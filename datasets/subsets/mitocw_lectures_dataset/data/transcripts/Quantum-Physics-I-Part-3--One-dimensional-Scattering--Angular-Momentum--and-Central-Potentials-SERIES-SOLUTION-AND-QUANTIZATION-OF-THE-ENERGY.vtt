00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.030
PROFESSOR: Write w
equals sum from k

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.695
equals 0 to infinity a k rho k.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.200
And plug in--

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.740
I've suggested that usually the
thing that you should know when

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.310
you plug in those equations
is to look for the power rho

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.280
to the k in this equation.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.870
And just, since
everything is equal to 0,

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.690
the coefficient of rho to the
k in this equation should be 0.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.010
And that's the easiest
way to select the powers.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.480
That's good practice.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:50.980
You should do it.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.680
I won't do it here.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.300
We've done it in a few cases.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.180
So this will relate a k plus 1.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.440
To a k.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.745
So that's algebra.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.210
It's a good skill
to be able to do it.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.090
But it would be
not very good use

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.060
of our time to do it right now.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.280
So here is the answer.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.430
OK.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.010
This is more important.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:40.560
2 to the k plus l plus 1 minus
1 over kappa over k plus 1

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.290
plus k plus 2l plus 2.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.790
OK.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.710
We've got our
recursion relation.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.970
And the issue is, again, what
happens with this coefficient

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.130
as k goes to infinity?

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:19.960
So as k goes large, a k plus
1 over a k goes like what?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.260
Well, we have a k that
is becoming large,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.230
and everything else
doesn't matter.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.640
There's a k and a k, so there's
going to be some cancellation.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.015
And this looks like
roughly 2 to the k.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:44.080
Now, you could change
these numbers a little bit.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.690
I'm going to do a tiny
trick to simplify it,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.300
but it's just a trick.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.920
Don't worry about it too much.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.150
I'll put 2 to the k plus 1 here.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.310
And I will say, look, if the
series diverges in this case,

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.880
this coefficient is
bigger than that one.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.110
So it will certainly diverge
for this case, as well.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.000
So the coefficients
here are smaller

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.680
than those ones, this ratio.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.280
So if the ratio
between coefficients

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.130
here is such that
the series diverges,

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.080
then it will even diverge
a little more in this case.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.440
And the reason I put it
here is because then this

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.040
is kind of solvable, a k
plus 1 nicely solvable, very

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.850
nicely solvable, 2k plus 1 a k.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.010
And the solution
of this is to say

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.820
you can try with a 0,
what a 1 is, what a 2.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.230
a k is 2 to the k a
0 over k factorial.

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:08.040
OK.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:16.360
With that we can reconstruct
what kind of function

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.880
this series would be building
if the series doesn't terminate

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.900
and will not be too surprising.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:32.050
So in this case, the sum
over k of a k rho k, which

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.730
is the function we're building,
is roughly equal to this

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.390
a k here, which is 2 to the k.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.120
a 0 can go out.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.020
k factorial rho k.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.800
So this is a 0 e to the 2 rho.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.620
It's kind of fair
of it to do that.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.440
It's kind of saying that if the
w solution doesn't truncate,

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.100
it's going to go like e to
the 2 rho, which precisely

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.160
with an e to the
minus rho is going

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.350
to give you the other possible
behavior of the solutions.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.570
It happened for the
harmonic oscillator.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:31.930
So what this is saying is
that then w, which is this,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.060
would go roughly like that.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.300
And that's bad.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.700
So the series must truncate.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.705
So we must truncate the series.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.880
OK.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.930
So here comes the
interesting part

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.200
because there's
lots of quantities,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.540
and that has to be done a little
slowly so that nobody gets

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.620
confused of what's
going to happen.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.195
We have to terminate
this series.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.350
So how are we going to do it?

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.780
I'm going to state
it the following way.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:13.420
I'm going to say
that let's assume

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:25.040
that we want a polynomial
of degree capital N.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.550
There will be lots of little
constants, capital N, little n.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.760
I want a polynomial
of degree capital N.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:40.770
That means that a sub capital
N is different from 0.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:46.980
And a capital N plus
1 is equal to 0.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:51.120
That's what should happen.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.830
If you have constants
up to a capital N,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.960
you'll have rho
to the capital N,

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.600
and you'll have a
polynomial of degree N.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.350
But that must happen that
the next one must be 0.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.770
I don't have to state
that all of the rest

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.370
are 0 because it's a
one-step recursion relation.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:17.550
Once a 5 is 0, a 6, a 7,
a 8, all of them are 0.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.590
That's it.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.590
And we will have like
even or odd solutions

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.160
that we had for the
harmonic oscillator

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.050
because these are
functions of r.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.430
And r and minus r you should
not quite expect anything.

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.460
Minus r doesn't exist.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:37.830
So this is what should happen.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.760
But if that happens,
think of this.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.960
You have a n plus 1 should be 0.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.210
So the numerator should have
become 0 for k equals 2N.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:08:04.590
So you have one over kappa
is equal to 2N plus l plus 1.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:11.220
And in a sense that's it.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:15.350
Whatever had to
happen, happened.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:16.850
Why?

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:20.030
The energy got
quantized already.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:25.320
Somehow it did because
the energy is kappa.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.810
Remember, kappa
squared actually was

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:31.680
the ratio of the energy divided
by the dimension [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.570
So here it's saying the
energy is some number that

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.450
has to do with an
integer, which is

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.190
the degree of the
polynomial you're going

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:44.169
to use, an l integer, and 1.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:50.160
So this is, of course,
pretty important.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.340
So what values happen here?

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.710
What are the
possible values of l?

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:10.630
Well, l here, l can go
0, 1, 2, 3, all of them.

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:11.720
All of them are possible.

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.530
And why is that?

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.530
It's because of the
physics of the problem.

00:09:21.530 --> 00:09:26.150
We assume we'll have a particle
in a central potential.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.180
All values of angular
momentum can exist.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:35.440
So we should be looking for
l's that take all these values.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:39.790
Moreover, N is the polynomial
that you can choose.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:45.810
And N can also be
all of those values.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.985
We can begin with 0.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.950
So a 0 would be a number.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:56.280
But then it dies.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.050
A polynomial of degree 0
would be just a constant.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:00.650
It's possible.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:06.540
1, 2, 3, all of
those are possible.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.820
And for each combination
will have some energy.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.630
But here you start
to see degeneracies,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:23.430
multiple degeneracies, because
if you have the number 100,000

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:29.710
here, it can be built in
many, many ways, 100,000 and 1

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:32.860
ways or something like
that, with two integers that

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:34.690
have to add up to it.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.170
And all of them will
have the same energy.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:42.700
So the hydrogen atom is going
to have lots of degeneracy.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.390
So here is a little bit of
a definition that we follow.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:52.560
So all these are
allowed, all allowed,

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.075
all combinations allowed.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.940
So l can be anything, and
capital N can be anything.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:18.250
And let's define a slightly
better version of this thing.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:24.450
So let's move the 2
down, 1 over 2 kappa.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:29.040
That's N plus l plus 1.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:39.065
And let's call all this n, or
the principal quantum number.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.480
So n is the principal
quantum number.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.060
And in some sense,
well, you know

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:55.200
that n has to be
greater or equal than 1.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:55.960
It's an integer.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.220
And has to be greater or equal
than 1 because of this 1 here

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.600
and because the other ones
cannot be negative either.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.180
So n is a principal
quantum number,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:17.430
and it's a fundamental number
because it immediately gives

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.470
you the value of the
energy, which we will

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:23.480
write more physically shortly.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.130
But it hides within
it a degeneracy

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.750
that this allowed because
of these differing numbers.

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.870
So these different
numbers have to do

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.680
with the degree of the
polynomial and the value of l

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.570
that you are using.

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:50.640
So let's classify this and
understand it a little better.

00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:54.700
So what do we have
for the energy?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:01.030
Remember, the energy divided
by the dimensionless factor--

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:04.580
well, to make it
dimensionless, z squared e

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.870
squared over a 0 kappa squared.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.550
We wrote actually that e
divided by this quantity, which

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:17.790
has units of energy,
was kappa squared.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.665
So kappa squared now,
kappa is 1 over 2n.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:30.510
So when we substitute here,
we get e is equal to minus

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:38.090
z squared e squared over
2a 0 1 over n squared.

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.340
It's probably the
most famous formula

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:47.030
that you certainly have studied
in high school, the 1 over n

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:51.200
squared of the energy
levels of the hydrogen atom.

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:57.850
The units are nice.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.470
There's for z equals to 1,
there's the e squared over 2a 0

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:07.240
that we mentioned a little
while ago as giving you

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.190
the characteristic energy.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:14.500
And e squared over
a 0 was 27.2 EV.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:21.191
And therefore, e squared over
2 a 0 is the famous 13.6 EV.

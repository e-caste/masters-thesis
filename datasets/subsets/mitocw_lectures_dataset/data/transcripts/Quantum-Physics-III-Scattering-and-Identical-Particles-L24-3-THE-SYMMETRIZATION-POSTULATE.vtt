WEBVTT

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.390
PROFESSOR: So so far
even though these things

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.430
look maybe interesting
or a little familiar,

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:16.870
we have not yet stated clearly
how they apply to physics.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.760
We've been talking about vector
spaces, V, for a particle.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.020
Then V tensor N. And we've
looked at states there.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.590
We've looked at permutation
operators there.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.210
Symmetric states there.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.790
Antisymmetric states there.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.970
What is missing is
something that connects

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.890
it to quantum mechanics.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:49.940
And that is given by the
so-called symmetrization

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.640
postulate.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.100
So it's a postulate.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.170
It's something that you
technically can't derive.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.370
Therefore, you postulate.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.220
You can say it's an extra
axiom even, quantum mechanics.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.290
You would say also
that probably there's

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.070
no other way to do things.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.830
So in some sense, it's forced.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.180
But I think it's more honest to
admit it's an extra postulate.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.130
So here it goes.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.510
I'll read it first.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.920
Then I'll write it.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.900
So it says the following.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.840
If you have a system of
N identical particles,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.100
arbitrary states in V tensor
N are not physical states.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.160
The physical states
are the states

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.920
that are totally symmetric.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.400
In that case, the particles
are called bosons.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.980
Or totally antisymmetric,
in which case

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.130
the particles are
called fermions.

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.570
That's basically it.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.360
The arbitrary state that
is neither symmetric

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.750
nor antisymmetric,
and all that is not

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.190
a physical state of a system
of identical particles.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.340
So it's stated here.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:24.340
In a system with N
identical particles,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:43.800
physical states are not
arbitrary states in V tensor N.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.260
Rather, they are
totally symmetric.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:08.380
In parentheses, they
belong to SymN of V.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:28.260
In which case, the particles
are said to be bosons

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.240
or they are totally
antisymmetric.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.180
Are totally antisymmetric.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.340
They belong to anti NV.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:04:05.060
In which case, they are
said to be fermions.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.740
All right.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.930
So this is really
pretty fundamental.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.600
It's a statement that
we began our discussion

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.714
by saying we have an
electron at this up

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:22.910
and another electron
at this down.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.860
Is it the plus minus state or
is it the minus plus state?

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.960
And we said it's neither one.

00:04:33.714 --> 00:04:36.830
You cannot declare those
two to be equivalent.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.300
And that's what this says.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.730
It's not arbitrary
states in this.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.590
But they have to become
totally symmetric,

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.320
if they're bosons or
totally antisymmetric

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.900
if they are fermions.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.390
So we have to make
a few comments.

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.770
And that's what will keep
us busy for the next 20,

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.210
25 minutes.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.250
And to understand this
and see what it implies

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.420
and how we use it.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.150
So here it is.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.420
The statement we have
made is a statement

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.820
of fact in three dimensions.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.890
There's no particles that
we like and we study.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:40.690
There are further
possibilities in worlds

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:46.690
of lower dimension two, three
dimensions, space, time,

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.420
or so two dimensional
space, that

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.960
allows for further
kinds of statistics

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.980
that are interesting.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.200
But this is the
general statement.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:04.800
So the first comment is this
is the general statement.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:16.720
But further statistics,
other types of space,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.720
exist in two dimensions,
not in three, where we live.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.290
We say three in
the Galilean ways.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:31.180
3 plus 1 time.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.810
But this is spatial dimensions.

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:43.230
This is the
statistical definition

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:47.120
of bosons and fermions.

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:57.080
But then comes the spin
statistics theorem.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:11.190
That applies then you understand
with quantum mechanics.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.480
And that's a deep
theorem that ends up

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:27.770
telling you that
particles with spin 0, 1,

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:33.290
2 integer are bosons.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:42.060
And particles with spin 1/2,
3/2 [INAUDIBLE] are fermions.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.330
So it's a great achievement
of quantum field

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:56.950
theory associating the
statistical properties

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.630
with the spin.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.930
It's a deep connection.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.690
It's valid for
elementary particles

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.240
or composite particles.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.870
The list of particles
is not that big.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.630
Particles of spin 1,
we know a lot of them.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.894
A photon is spin 1.

00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:20.660
Gluons are spin 1.

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.650
The w's, the c's are
spin 1 particles.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:25.770
Particles spin 0.

00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.550
We didn't know an
elementary one for a while.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.710
We finally know the
[INAUDIBLE] is there, spin 0.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:35.750
Particles of spin 2.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:38.330
Just [INAUDIBLE] along.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:40.159
Higher spin unknown.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.510
It may exist.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.250
String theory has them.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:47.840
All kinds of theories
postulate them.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.960
They may exist.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.440
They may not.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:54.440
Spin of 1/2, fractional spin.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.300
Well, all the matter particles,
quarks, muons, leptons,

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.970
neutrinos are spin 1/2.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:06.650
Spin 3/2 is hypothetical
as an elementary particle.

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.610
If it exists, it would
be called the gravitino.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:14.000
There are composite particles.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.710
You could [INAUDIBLE]
with quarks,

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.310
or with other particles,
mesons, baryons.

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:22.340
You can get several spins.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.050
Not with elementary particles.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.740
Many time unstable particles.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.510
So anyway, those are
very interesting things.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:40.610
Now next fact is that you can
go from elementary particles

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.200
to composite particles.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:49.680
So if you have, for
example, the hydrogen atom.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:54.200
That this has a proton
and an electron.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:59.570
And you want to figure out
if it's a boson or a fermion.

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:05.600
Well, you think of another
hydrogen atom here, p and e.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.850
And you write a
wave function that

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:13.970
involves the protons, the first
proton, the second proton,

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:17.180
the first electron, and
the second electron.

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.130
That's a little bit
of a funny notation.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.340
This would correspond
to maybe the coordinates

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.220
of the first proton, the second
proton, the first electron,

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.190
the second electron.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.090
Since protons are identical
particles that are fermions,

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:36.140
the wave function
must change sign

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.990
if P1 and P2 are exchanged.

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:40.850
There would be a minus sign.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.880
It's antisymmetric.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.910
Since the electrons
are fermions,

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:50.090
it should antisymmetric
by exchanging this 2.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:53.430
So it's also antisymmetric
under this exchange.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:58.280
So finally, if you exchange
this item with this item,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.820
you must exchange the two
protons and the two electrons

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.160
at the same time.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.690
Two minuses and you get a plus.

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:09.590
Therefore, the hydrogen
atom is a boson.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.820
So these statistical
properties build up.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:18.300
So an object built
with a number of bosons

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.180
and a number of fermions
will be a boson or a fermion,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.425
depending on those numbers.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.730
So that's a nice thing.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:36.140
So the hydrogen atom is a boson.

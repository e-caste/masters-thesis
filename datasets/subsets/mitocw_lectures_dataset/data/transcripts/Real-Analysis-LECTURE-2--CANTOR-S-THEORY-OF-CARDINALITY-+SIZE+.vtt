00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.120 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So last
time we spoke about--

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.250 align:middle line:90%
we covered sets and induction.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.950 align:middle line:84%
This time, I want to ask
a question about sets,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.820 align:middle line:84%
which turns out is actually
quite a deep question.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.130 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I didn't come
up with it myself.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.930 align:middle line:84%
This question is at least
150 years old probably.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:49.600 align:middle line:84%
So the question that I want to
ask is if A and B are sets--

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.440 align:middle line:90%


00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.470 align:middle line:84%
or let's phrase it this
way, at least a little more

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.310 align:middle line:90%
efficiently.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:19.655 align:middle line:84%
When do two sets, A and
B, have the same size?

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:26.060 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is
especially interesting

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.920 align:middle line:84%
if these two sets
are not finite,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.140 align:middle line:84%
meaning there's
not five of them,

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.340 align:middle line:84%
there's not eight of them,
but there's infinitely

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.020 align:middle line:84%
many members,
whatever that means.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And I'll actually
define what that means.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.330 align:middle line:84%
For example, do the natural
numbers and the integers

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.370 align:middle line:90%
have the same size?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.310 align:middle line:84%
Do the natural numbers
and the rational numbers

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.140 align:middle line:90%
have the same size?

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.660 align:middle line:84%
What about the rational
numbers and the real numbers?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.460 align:middle line:84%
Even though we haven't
defined that yet,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.000 align:middle line:84%
you can still keep in mind
your notion of the real numbers

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.515 align:middle line:90%
from calculus.

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:06.410 align:middle line:90%


00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.169 align:middle line:90%
And so this question is--

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:12.270 align:middle line:90%
why is it deep?

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:17.250 align:middle line:84%
Because it depends
on this word here,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.150 align:middle line:84%
"size," and what
exactly that means.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:34.200 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not-- so
kind of an answer,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.925 align:middle line:90%
this is due to George Cantor.

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.640 align:middle line:90%


00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.300 align:middle line:90%
He said that two sets--

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.080 align:middle line:84%
so not an answer, but
a way of defining size

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.200 align:middle line:84%
or a way of saying the two
sets have the same size.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:03:03.930 align:middle line:84%
He said two sets have the
same size when the two sets--

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:19.040 align:middle line:84%
the elements of the two sets
can be paired off, meaning--

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.170 align:middle line:84%
and I will make this much more
precise in a minute or so.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.750 align:middle line:90%
What does he mean?

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.050 align:middle line:90%
Or what do I mean?

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.510 align:middle line:84%
For example, the set a, b,
and c and the set 1, 2, and 3.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So this one, this set, consists
of three letters-- a, b, and c.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.970 align:middle line:84%
This set consists
of three integers--

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.020 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, and 3.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.900 align:middle line:84%
They have the same size
because I can essentially

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:45.665 align:middle line:90%
pair them off.

00:03:45.665 --> 00:03:49.590 align:middle line:90%


00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So a and 1 go together,
b and 2 go together,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.760 align:middle line:84%
and c and 3 go together,
meaning each member of this set

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.200 align:middle line:84%
gets paired off with
an element of this set.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.930 align:middle line:84%
And every element of
this set gets paired off

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.550 align:middle line:84%
with a unique element
from this set.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:17.570 align:middle line:90%


00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.860 align:middle line:84%
Now, to make-- and so
this goes under the name

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:35.640 align:middle line:84%
of the theory of cardinality or
cardinal numbers, if you like.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.440 align:middle line:84%
But we won't go
too deeply into it.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.620 align:middle line:90%
So the way you make--

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.640 align:middle line:84%
or the way one makes
this pairing off business

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.065 align:middle line:84%
more precise is using the
language of functions.

00:04:48.065 --> 00:04:50.190 align:middle line:84%
And you've been dealing
with functions since you've

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.400 align:middle line:90%
been doing calculus.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.690 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to quickly
reintroduce or review

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.770 align:middle line:84%
some terminology that goes
along with functions that

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:09.990 align:middle line:84%
will be the precise meaning
of this pairing off business

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.940 align:middle line:90%
that I'm writing here.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.650 align:middle line:84%
But just with an eye
towards the future,

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.560 align:middle line:84%
this is why I'm reviewing some
of this terminology related

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.670 align:middle line:90%
to functions.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:90%


00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.800 align:middle line:84%
So a brief review of some
terminology for functions--

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:39.350 align:middle line:84%
so let me just recall
that if A and B are sets,

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:47.920 align:middle line:90%
then function f A B--

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.540 align:middle line:84%
so a function's usually written
as f colon A arrow to B,

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.160 align:middle line:84%
meaning it takes elements
from A into elements from B.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:06.765 align:middle line:90%
This is a mapping that--

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:10.140 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.910 align:middle line:90%
or if you like, an assignment.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.410 align:middle line:90%


00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:26.570 align:middle line:84%
It assigns to each x in
A a unique element which

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.560 align:middle line:90%
we denote f of x in B.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.850 align:middle line:84%
So one single input, x,
gives me a single output.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
And the input does not
give me three outputs.

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is what one would call
a naive definition probably,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
not necessarily
completely unambiguous.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.320 align:middle line:90%
But for us, it suffices.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.020 align:middle line:84%
In the textbook, you
can look up a function

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:57.870 align:middle line:84%
is unambiguously defined or as a
subset of the Cartesian product

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.470 align:middle line:84%
of A and B, which
you would recognize

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.990 align:middle line:84%
as essentially describing
the graph of the function.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.840 align:middle line:84%
But then you never use
that definition of again.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.560 align:middle line:84%
And you essentially
use this definition

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.020 align:middle line:84%
when you think about
functions and when you

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.380 align:middle line:90%
prove properties of function.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.550 align:middle line:84%
So this we will just
take as our definition.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.240 align:middle line:84%
And it will be
unambiguous enough for us.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So let f be a
function from A to B.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:46.440 align:middle line:84%
If C is a subset of
A, we define a set--

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.890 align:middle line:84%
so this is f of capital C.
So C is not an element of A.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.020 align:middle line:90%
It's a subset of A.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:55.155 align:middle line:84%
And this is a subset
of B. This is--

00:07:55.155 --> 00:07:58.230 align:middle line:90%


00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.500 align:middle line:84%
let me write it slightly
differently here.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.580 align:middle line:84%
This is a set of all
y in B such that there

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:12.660 align:middle line:84%
exists an x in C such
that y equals to f of x.

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.580 align:middle line:84%
And I could write this a
little more efficiently as this

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.190 align:middle line:84%
is the set of all
elements f of x

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:30.270 align:middle line:84%
as x ranges over the
elements of this subset C.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:44.570 align:middle line:84%
And if D is a subset of B, we
define the set f inverse of D.

00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:48.140 align:middle line:84%
This is the set of guys
that get mapped into D.

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:53.120 align:middle line:84%
So I should say this is
the inverse image of D,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.890 align:middle line:84%
not the inverse of
this function f.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:03.080 align:middle line:84%
So the inverse, whatever
that means for now,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.920 align:middle line:84%
does not necessarily
always exist.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.690 align:middle line:84%
So this inverse image of
the set D always exists.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:19.670 align:middle line:84%
This is the set of all elements
in A such that f of x is in D.

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:31.400 align:middle line:90%
So for example, let me--

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%


00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:48.090 align:middle line:90%
so 1, 2, 3, 4 and a, b, c, d.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:55.110 align:middle line:84%
And let's suppose 1 goes
to a, 2 goes to a, 3 goes

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.810 align:middle line:90%
to c, 4 goes to d.

00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:02.160 align:middle line:90%


00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:08.040 align:middle line:84%
Then f of the set 1,
2, this is where--

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.270 align:middle line:90%
what is the set that gets--

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle line:90%
so this is the subset of--

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:20.220 align:middle line:84%
so this you should think of as
B, a, b, and c, and D. And then

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.610 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, and 3, this is A.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:27.810 align:middle line:90%
So f of the set of 1, 2--

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.670 align:middle line:90%
so 1 gets mapped to a.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.990 align:middle line:90%
2 gets mapped to a.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.470 align:middle line:90%
So this is just the set 2.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.520 align:middle line:90%
f of the set--

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.820 align:middle line:90%
let's go with 1 and 3.

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.980 align:middle line:90%
1 gets mapped to a.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:47.640 align:middle line:90%
So this should be a.

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.896 align:middle line:90%
1 gets mapped to a.

00:10:49.896 --> 00:10:52.515 align:middle line:84%
And 3 gets mapped
gets mapped to c.

00:10:52.515 --> 00:10:55.860 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:59.130 align:middle line:84%
And so a couple of
inverse images--

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:04.360 align:middle line:84%
if I look at the
inverse image of a,

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.040 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to the set
of all guys that map to a.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:12.150 align:middle line:84%
This is, well, 1 maps
to a and 2 maps to a.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:14.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is 1, 2.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.890 align:middle line:90%


00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:21.180 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I look at the
inverse image of a,

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:27.420 align:middle line:84%
c, d, what elements get
mapped to a, c, and d?

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.630 align:middle line:90%
Well, 1 and 2 get mapped to a.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.170 align:middle line:90%
3 gets map to c.

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:33.360 align:middle line:90%
4 gets mapped to d.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.390 align:middle line:84%
So everything maps
into a, C, and d.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:40.170 align:middle line:84%
So this is just the
original set or the set A--

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.780 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:49.630 align:middle line:90%


00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:55.570 align:middle line:84%
All right, so there's
more terminology.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.600 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we
will mean by when

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.940 align:middle line:90%
two sets can be paired off.

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:02.590 align:middle line:90%
Or this makes that more precise.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:07.024 align:middle line:90%


00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:19.160 align:middle line:84%
Let f be a function from A to
B. We say that f is injective,

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.305 align:middle line:90%
or I'll write one-to-one.

00:12:21.305 --> 00:12:27.712 align:middle line:84%
It should be read
one-to-one if f satisfies

00:12:27.712 --> 00:12:28.670 align:middle line:90%
the following property.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.220 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
f of x1 equals f of x2
implies x1 equals x2.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.020 align:middle line:84%
So injective, or
one-to-one, means

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.595 align:middle line:84%
if I take two different inputs,
I get two different outputs.

00:12:46.595 --> 00:12:49.560 align:middle line:90%


00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.220 align:middle line:84%
That's essentially
what this means.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:56.910 align:middle line:90%
I mean, taking the equivalent--

00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:04.930 align:middle line:84%
so equivalently, from
a logical standpoint,

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.550 align:middle line:84%
this statement
implying this statement

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:08.590 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to the
negation of this statement

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:11.060 align:middle line:84%
implying the negation
of this statement.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:17.620 align:middle line:84%
So equivalently, this means x
not equal to x2 implies f of x1

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.440 align:middle line:90%
not equal to f of x2.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.100 align:middle line:90%
So maybe this is clear.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.150 align:middle line:84%
If I were to define f as
injective if it satisfies

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.640 align:middle line:84%
this property, maybe
that would have

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.293 align:middle line:84%
been clearer that f takes
two different elements to two

00:13:32.293 --> 00:13:33.085 align:middle line:90%
different elements.

00:13:33.085 --> 00:13:36.790 align:middle line:90%


00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:40.540 align:middle line:84%
But this condition here is
typically easier to verify,

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.775 align:middle line:84%
or at least simpler
to state and verify.

00:13:42.775 --> 00:13:45.390 align:middle line:90%


00:13:45.390 --> 00:14:04.870 align:middle line:84%
So f is surjective or
onto if the image of A

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:11.450 align:middle line:84%
is B. So let me write that
statement out a little bit

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:11.950 align:middle line:90%
more.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:24.350 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the set B gets
mapped to by something from A.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:30.890 align:middle line:84%
So equivalently, this
says that for all y in B

00:14:30.890 --> 00:14:37.670 align:middle line:84%
there exists an x in A
so that f of x equals y.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:46.104 align:middle line:90%


00:14:46.104 --> 00:14:56.420 align:middle line:84%
f is bijective if f is
one-to-one and onto.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:01.870 align:middle line:84%
So f is bijective if it's
both injective and surjective.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:07.550 align:middle line:90%


00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So for example, this map
that we just drew over here

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.710 align:middle line:90%
that sends 1 to a, 2 to b--

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:20.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean 2 to a, 3
to c, 4, to d, this

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.620 align:middle line:84%
is neither injective
nor surjective.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:26.730 align:middle line:84%
It's not injective because it
takes two different elements

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.280 align:middle line:90%
to the image in B, namely a.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.180 align:middle line:90%
So it takes 1 and 2 to a.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.780 align:middle line:84%
It's not surjective
because nothing gets

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:38.235 align:middle line:90%
mapped to the element b here.

00:15:38.235 --> 00:15:54.890 align:middle line:90%


00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.570 align:middle line:84%
So we've seen that's
not surjective.

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:90%
Of course, this map, if I take--

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:05.030 align:middle line:84%
again, imagine this
is 1, 2, 3 a, b, c, d.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:10.220 align:middle line:84%
This map here, this function
here that takes 1 to a, 2

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.990 align:middle line:84%
to b, 3, to c, this is actually
injective but not surjective.

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:24.820 align:middle line:90%


00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.770 align:middle line:84%
And then of course, we
could change this slightly.

00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:38.980 align:middle line:84%
And 1 goes to a, 2 goes
to b, and 3 goes to b.

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:47.532 align:middle line:84%
Then this is surjective
but not injective.

00:16:47.532 --> 00:16:52.210 align:middle line:90%


00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.250 align:middle line:90%
Now, the map that sends--

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:59.110 align:middle line:90%


00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.330 align:middle line:90%
let's switch sides here--

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:06.730 align:middle line:90%
a, b, and c, 1, 2, 3--

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:17.150 align:middle line:84%
a to 1, b to 2, c to 3, this
is a bijection, bijective.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:20.240 align:middle line:84%
So if I say something's
an injection or surjection

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:23.510 align:middle line:84%
or bijection, that just means
it's a map that is injective,

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:30.860 align:middle line:84%
or, surjective or
bijective respectively.

00:17:30.860 --> 00:17:54.320 align:middle line:90%


00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:04.620 align:middle line:90%
And now, a definition--

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.870 align:middle line:90%
so this is really--

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:07.370 align:middle line:84%
there's not much
to this definition,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:15.240 align:middle line:84%
but just defining a couple
of related functions

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.490 align:middle line:84%
that are related to
a given function.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:27.540 align:middle line:84%
If f goes from A to
B, g goes from B to C,

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:37.110 align:middle line:84%
the composition g of f is the
function which goes from A to C

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:48.142 align:middle line:84%
is defined by g of f of
x equals g of f of x.

00:18:48.142 --> 00:18:52.214 align:middle line:90%


00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:57.130 align:middle line:90%
And 2, if f is bijective--

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.250 align:middle line:90%


00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.770 align:middle line:84%
so this is the composition
of two functions.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:05.860 align:middle line:84%
I didn't write the word
composition, but g of f

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.980 align:middle line:84%
means the composition, or is
referred to as a composition.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:15.850 align:middle line:84%
If f is bijective, then we
define the inverse function

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:24.520 align:middle line:90%
to f, B to A, by the following.

00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.740 align:middle line:90%


00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:35.990 align:middle line:84%
If y is in B, then
f inverse of y in A

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:52.090 align:middle line:84%
is the unique elements in A such
that if I take this element,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.770 align:middle line:90%
stick it into f, I get back y.

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.610 align:middle line:84%
So the inverse of a
function only exists

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:03.700 align:middle line:84%
for bijective
functions, or at least

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.780 align:middle line:84%
is only defined for
bijective functions.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:08.660 align:middle line:90%
Keep that in mind.

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.690 align:middle line:84%
Don't confuse that with
the inverse image of sets.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.290 align:middle line:84%
Although, those two
notations look the same.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:22.245 align:middle line:84%
You have an inverse
f to the minus 1.

00:20:22.245 --> 00:20:26.530 align:middle line:84%
f to the minus 1,
if it's a function,

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.460 align:middle line:90%
that is the inverse function.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:31.900 align:middle line:84%
However, if I'm taking f
to the minus 1 of a set,

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.770 align:middle line:84%
that means the inverse image of
that set as defined over there.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.890 align:middle line:90%


00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:45.650 align:middle line:84%
So bijections, meaning
bijective functions,

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:51.380 align:middle line:84%
will be what we mean when we
say two sets can be paired off.

00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.050 align:middle line:90%
It's what we mean when we--

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:59.960 align:middle line:84%
or at least what Cantor's
answer to that original question

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.480 align:middle line:84%
was, when did two sets
have the same size.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is the notion of
cardinality that I alluded to.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:30.740 align:middle line:84%
So we say two
sets, A and B, have

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:44.010 align:middle line:84%
the same cardinality
if there exists

00:21:44.010 --> 00:22:00.880 align:middle line:84%
a bijection or a bijective
function f from A to B.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:14.500 align:middle line:84%
And so let me just make some
notation here. so this is not

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.420 align:middle line:84%
really new objects I'm
defining or operations.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.900 align:middle line:90%
This is just some notation.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:24.850 align:middle line:84%
So when two sets have the
same cardinality, we write--

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:42.030 align:middle line:90%


00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.267 align:middle line:84%
so this is just a shorthand way
of writing that two functions

00:22:45.267 --> 00:22:46.350 align:middle line:90%
have the same cardinality.

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:84%
You should not necessarily
think this means taking

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.630 align:middle line:90%
the absolute value of a set.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.060 align:middle line:84%
That doesn't mean
anything, all right?

00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.280 align:middle line:84%
This is just shorthand
notation for saying two

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.840 align:middle line:90%
sets have the same cardinality.

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:02.180 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:15.600 align:middle line:84%
If A has the same cardinality
as the set 1, 2, 3 up to n,

00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:90%
we write A equals n.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.670 align:middle line:84%
That's just shorthand
for saying that a set has

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:27.860 align:middle line:84%
the same cardinality as the
natural numbers up to n.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:38.380 align:middle line:90%


00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:50.230 align:middle line:84%
So if there exists an
injective function-- or I

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:53.530 align:middle line:84%
will often say either
function or map.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:56.620 align:middle line:84%
You should take
those as synonymous.

00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.340 align:middle line:84%
There exists an
injective function f--

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:06.800 align:middle line:84%
if there exists an injective
function f from A to B,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:12.540 align:middle line:90%
we write this thing.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.390 align:middle line:84%
Again, do not read this as
taking the absolute value

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.940 align:middle line:84%
of some set and
that absolute value

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:20.580 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
absolute value of the other set

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.870 align:middle line:90%
because that's meaningless.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.780 align:middle line:84%
We haven't said what
that means even.

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:29.590 align:middle line:90%


00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.000 align:middle line:90%
This is just shorthand notation.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:40.230 align:middle line:90%


00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:52.440 align:middle line:84%
And if there exists an
injection from A to B

00:24:52.440 --> 00:25:04.385 align:middle line:84%
but they don't have the same
cardinality, we write this.

00:25:04.385 --> 00:25:08.040 align:middle line:90%


00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So even though this notation
of these absolute value

00:25:12.210 --> 00:25:14.850 align:middle line:84%
things being on the
outside of the set

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:19.770 align:middle line:84%
makes you think absolute
value or should be interpreted

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.080 align:middle line:84%
as absolute value,
it's OK to think

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:27.130 align:middle line:84%
as a certain
ordering being there,

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.930 align:middle line:90%
as A having smaller size than B.

00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:35.530 align:middle line:84%
We write this because there
being an injection from one

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:41.080 align:middle line:84%
set to the other means I
can pair off elements of A

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.470 align:middle line:84%
with some elements
of B. Maybe I don't

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:47.170 align:middle line:84%
get all of the elements
of B. But I can pair off

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.500 align:middle line:84%
some of the elements of A with
some of the elements of B.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.860 align:middle line:84%
For example, that first
map we wrote up there,

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:59.360 align:middle line:84%
that says that the
set 1, 2, 3 in size

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.060 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to the size of a, b, c,

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.820 align:middle line:84%
d because we found an
injection, an injective map

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.625 align:middle line:84%
from the first set
to the second set.

00:26:07.625 --> 00:26:10.350 align:middle line:90%


00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:16.560 align:middle line:84%
This third map would say that
the size of the set a, b,c is

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.210 align:middle line:84%
equal to 3, written here,
or shorthand written here.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.080 align:middle line:90%


00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:32.650 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, that first map that
we wrote up there, again, is--

00:26:32.650 --> 00:26:37.720 align:middle line:84%
so from first map, this says
that the set of 1, 2, 3--

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:41.170 align:middle line:84%
in our shorthand
notation, absolute value

00:26:41.170 --> 00:26:45.370 align:middle line:84%
is less than the
size of a, b, c, d.

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So don't think of these as
saying the absolute value.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:52.135 align:middle line:84%
It's best to maybe think of
this as saying the size of.

00:26:52.135 --> 00:26:55.070 align:middle line:90%


00:26:55.070 --> 00:27:01.040 align:middle line:84%
All right, so if there exists
an injective map or function

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.920 align:middle line:84%
from one set to another,
then the size of A

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.587 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
size of B. If the size of A

00:27:07.587 --> 00:27:09.170 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to the size of B

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.390 align:middle line:84%
but the size of A and
B are not the same,

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.830 align:middle line:84%
we write the size of A is
less than the size of B.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.525 align:middle line:90%
So best to think of those--

00:27:17.525 --> 00:27:20.120 align:middle line:90%


00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.770 align:middle line:84%
this absolute
value looking thing

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.700 align:middle line:84%
as being shorthand for
saying the words size of.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:32.330 align:middle line:90%


00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not going
to prove this.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:39.820 align:middle line:84%
It goes a little bit beyond
the scope of this class.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:45.550 align:middle line:84%
But let me just say that this
ordering, this inequality,

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:50.010 align:middle line:84%
these symbols that
we're writing does

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:53.800 align:middle line:84%
bear some sort of semblance to
the ordering of real numbers

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.060 align:middle line:84%
in that if I have two real
numbers, one is less than

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.380 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
other and vice versa.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So A is less than or equal
to B and B is less than

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.680 align:middle line:84%
or equal to A, then
A must equal B.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.460 align:middle line:84%
That is, in fact, true also
for this elementary notion

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.200 align:middle line:90%
of size of sets.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.990 align:middle line:90%
And this is--

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:84%
I mean, it shouldn't
surprise you for finite sets

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.820 align:middle line:90%
necessarily.

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:32.750 align:middle line:84%
If I have a pairing of A, if
A is no bigger than n and n is

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:37.100 align:middle line:84%
no bigger than the size of A,
then a should have n elements.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.590 align:middle line:84%
But it takes a little
bit more to prove

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:42.650 align:middle line:90%
for sets which are not finite.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.450 align:middle line:90%
So I forgot to write this down.

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:49.970 align:middle line:84%
We also say that
if the size of A

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.480 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the size of
this finite set 1 through n,

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:58.235 align:middle line:90%
we say A is finite.

00:28:58.235 --> 00:29:02.450 align:middle line:90%


00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:04.040 align:middle line:84%
So this theorem that
I'm stating here

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:18.860 align:middle line:84%
is the Cantor Schroeder
Bernstein theorem,

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.410 align:middle line:84%
which states that
if the size of A

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:30.200 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
size of B and the size of B

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:37.885 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to the
size of A, then the size of A

00:29:37.885 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
equals the size of B. So again,
if you're thinking of these

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:46.960 align:middle line:84%
in the context of real
numbers, one being less than

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.330 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
other and vice versa,

00:29:49.330 --> 00:29:51.820 align:middle line:84%
of course, that implies that
those two real numbers are

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.960 align:middle line:90%
equal to each other.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.180 align:middle line:84%
But we're not talking
about real numbers.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:58.150 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is just
shorthand notation

00:29:58.150 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:84%
for saying there exists a
bijective map from A to B. This

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.800 align:middle line:84%
means there exists a bijective
map from A to the set.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.200 align:middle line:84%
This means there exists an
injective map from A into this,

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:14.380 align:middle line:90%
from a to this set.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.080 align:middle line:84%
So this is not a statement
about real numbers.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.620 align:middle line:84%
This is a statement about
cardinality, all right?

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:26.275 align:middle line:90%


00:30:26.275 --> 00:30:26.775 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:30:26.775 --> 00:30:29.900 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So finite sets are sets that you
can count if you had n fingers.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:50.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, we would like to be
able to define what it means

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.370 align:middle line:90%
to be able to count a set.

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.530 align:middle line:84%
So what do I mean
by count a set?

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:57.890 align:middle line:84%
Meaning, if I had
infinite time, I

00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:01.130 align:middle line:84%
could go through the
set counting them--

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:08.180 align:middle line:84%
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 and so on.

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:90%
I don't need to go anymore.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:12.560 align:middle line:90%


00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.320 align:middle line:84%
But what does that
process of counting mean?

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:18.890 align:middle line:84%
That means, for each
element of the set

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:21.800 align:middle line:84%
that I'm trying to
count, I can pair it off

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.080 align:middle line:90%
with a natural number--

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.100 align:middle line:90%
1, 2, 3, and so on.

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:31.740 align:middle line:84%
So this is how we
define countable sets.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:37.650 align:middle line:84%
So if A has the same size
as the natural numbers,

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:44.940 align:middle line:84%
meaning there exists a bijection
from A to the natural numbers,

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:55.380 align:middle line:84%
then we say A is
countably infinite.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:02.070 align:middle line:90%


00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:10.870 align:middle line:90%
If A is finite, or countably--

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:14.890 align:middle line:84%
I also use a lot of shorthand,
but it's not clever shorthand.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:17.890 align:middle line:84%
So you should just be
able to sound what--

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.350 align:middle line:84%
if you just sound that out,
you'll get what word I mean,

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.480 align:middle line:90%
countably, countably infinite.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.450 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:38.080 align:middle line:90%
We say A is countable.

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:41.500 align:middle line:84%
So countably infinite means I
need all the natural numbers

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.640 align:middle line:84%
to be able to count off
the elements of the set A.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.850 align:middle line:84%
Countable means maybe
I stop after some point

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.890 align:middle line:90%
and I've counted all them.

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:55.030 align:middle line:84%
So A is finite or it's
countably infinite.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.520 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, if a set
is not countable,

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.840 align:middle line:90%
we say it's uncountable.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:18.220 align:middle line:90%


00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:27.850 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's take a look at
a couple of countable sets

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.440 align:middle line:84%
that maybe don't come
off as being countable.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:38.032 align:middle line:90%


00:33:38.032 --> 00:33:44.880 align:middle line:84%
The set of-- actually,
that's a homework problem.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:52.200 align:middle line:84%
The set of even
integers is countable.

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.840 align:middle line:90%


00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:00.060 align:middle line:84%
The set of odd-- so I said
integers a minute ago.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.280 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I should just
say natural numbers.

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:11.500 align:middle line:84%
The set of odd natural
numbers is countable.

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So in fact-- so this
is just an aside.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:24.090 align:middle line:90%


00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So these are two
disjoint subsets

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
that make up the
natural numbers, even

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:31.940 align:middle line:90%
and odd natural numbers.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:36.739 align:middle line:84%
And they both have the same size
as the set that they make up.

00:34:36.739 --> 00:34:42.610 align:middle line:84%
So it's almost like
saying the cardinality

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:44.949 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers
is twice the cardinality

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.679 align:middle line:84%
of the natural numbers,
since you would think

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.130 align:middle line:84%
that the size of N should
be the size of this set

00:34:51.130 --> 00:34:53.597 align:middle line:84%
plus the size of this set,
since they are disjoint

00:34:53.597 --> 00:34:54.639 align:middle line:90%
and they make up the set.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:57.640 align:middle line:90%


00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.760 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how
cardinality works.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:07.560 align:middle line:84%
You don't just add cardinalities
to get the cardinalities.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:17.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is a subtle, interesting
thing about cardinalities

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.600 align:middle line:84%
So Richard Feynman,
who won the Nobel Prize

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:26.620 align:middle line:84%
in the '60s for his work
on QED, described this

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:44.310 align:middle line:84%
as saying there are twice
as many numbers as numbers.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:48.990 align:middle line:90%


00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:57.610 align:middle line:90%
OK, so let's prove this.

00:35:57.610 --> 00:35:59.650 align:middle line:90%
So what does this mean?

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:03.750 align:middle line:84%
This means we have to be able
to find a bijective function

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:10.680 align:middle line:84%
from this set to this set or
from this set to this set, one

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.310 align:middle line:90%
or the other.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:14.240 align:middle line:90%


00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:22.660 align:middle line:90%
And so in fact, maybe I should--

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.360 align:middle line:84%
well, I'll say something
about that in a minute.

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.620 align:middle line:90%


00:36:28.620 --> 00:36:30.300 align:middle line:90%
Well, let me pause.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:34.680 align:middle line:84%
Let me pause this
just for a minute.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:38.520 align:middle line:84%
And let me make a few
comments about cardinality,

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
which maybe I should have.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.540 align:middle line:90%


00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:53.070 align:middle line:84%
So this you can think
of as a little theorem.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:37:00.460 align:middle line:84%
If I have two sets, A
has the same size as B,

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.570 align:middle line:84%
then B has the same size
as A. So remember, I mean,

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:08.470 align:middle line:84%
what I just said in
English is not exactly

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.790 align:middle line:90%
what those symbols mean.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:14.290 align:middle line:84%
Remember, this means there
exists a bijection from A to B

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:17.650 align:middle line:84%
This means there exists
a bijection from B to A.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:23.210 align:middle line:84%
So what is the proof
of this statement?

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's start off
with the hypothesis.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.470 align:middle line:90%


00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Suppose then there
exists a bijective map,

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:57.210 align:middle line:84%
bijective function
f from A to B.

00:37:57.210 --> 00:38:00.840 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I have a bijection
from A to B, then

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:03.118 align:middle line:84%
what would be a bijection
going from B to A?

00:38:03.118 --> 00:38:04.410 align:middle line:90%
That would just be the inverse.

00:38:04.410 --> 00:38:09.340 align:middle line:90%


00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:11.970 align:middle line:84%
So this is not the
inverse image of sets,

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:84%
like we described, but
the actual inverse,

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.525 align:middle line:90%
which we defined over there.

00:38:15.525 --> 00:38:22.980 align:middle line:90%


00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.330 align:middle line:90%
Is a bijection.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:37.440 align:middle line:90%


00:38:37.440 --> 00:39:01.440 align:middle line:90%
So B has the same size as A.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:11.640 align:middle line:84%
One other statement-- so if A
and B have the same size and B

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:15.070 align:middle line:90%
and C have the same size--

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.500 align:middle line:90%
so again, A, B, and C are sets.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I should have written
that at the beginning.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.015 align:middle line:84%
But from this context,
you should understand

00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:23.040 align:middle line:90%
that A, B, and C are sets--

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.885 align:middle line:90%
then A and C have the same size.

00:39:27.885 --> 00:39:38.450 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:40.200 align:middle line:90%
So let's do a proof of that.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.950 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
the hypothesis,

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:57.770 align:middle line:84%
meaning A has the same size as
B and B has the same size as C.

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.900 align:middle line:84%
So what did these
two statements mean

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.400 align:middle line:90%
in terms of the definition?

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.460 align:middle line:84%
That means there exists
a bijection from A to B

00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:18.310 align:middle line:84%
and a bijection from B to
C. And this statement-- so

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.220 align:middle line:90%
let me finish this.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.970 align:middle line:84%
And then I'll say what
I was going to say.

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:33.340 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists bijections f
from A to B and g from B to C.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So perhaps I should have
said a few more words

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.860 align:middle line:90%
about why this is true.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.910 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to leave
this as an exercise

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:49.150 align:middle line:84%
just to pause the lecture
and do it yourself.

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:54.190 align:middle line:90%
And what I'll write shortly--

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:55.900 align:middle line:84%
for this case,
I'll actually prove

00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:58.960 align:middle line:84%
that the thing I'm going
to define is bijection.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.200 align:middle line:90%
That should help you.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:06.070 align:middle line:84%
So let me draw over
here off to the side.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:12.917 align:middle line:84%
We have, again,
1, 2, 3, a, b, c.

00:41:12.917 --> 00:41:16.740 align:middle line:90%


00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.630 align:middle line:90%
So think of this as f.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:22.080 align:middle line:84%
This is my set A.
This is my set B.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:26.850 align:middle line:84%
And then I have
alpha, beta, gamma.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And a gets mapped to alpha,
b, gets mapped to beta,

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.160 align:middle line:90%
c gets mapped to gamma.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:39.060 align:middle line:84%
So what would be the map going
from A down to the set C?

00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:42.060 align:middle line:90%
Well, perhaps the composition.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:45.210 align:middle line:84%
1 gets mapped to a, which
gets mapped to alpha.

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.890 align:middle line:90%
So 1 gets mapped to alpha.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:48.450 align:middle line:90%
2 gets mapped to beta.

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.310 align:middle line:90%
3 gets mapped to gamma.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:53.130 align:middle line:84%
How do I build this function
out of the things that I know,

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:56.010 align:middle line:90%
namely this f and g?

00:41:56.010 --> 00:41:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, this function
going from A to C

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:02.105 align:middle line:84%
is just the composition
of these two functions.

00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:03.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is off to the side.

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:04.563 align:middle line:90%
This is not a part of the proof.

00:42:04.563 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:90%


00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:27.060 align:middle line:84%
Let h go from A to C be
the function g of f of x.

00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:30.311 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.311 --> 00:42:35.650 align:middle line:84%
So I claim that this
function is a bijection.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:51.960 align:middle line:84%
So we want to prove that it's
one-to-one and onto, all right?

00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.095 align:middle line:90%
So let's do one-to-one first.

00:42:55.095 --> 00:43:01.810 align:middle line:90%


00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.910 align:middle line:84%
So we this is the
part where I'm going

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:06.650 align:middle line:84%
to put this in parentheses,
meaning what we're doing now.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to prove
that h is one-to-one.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.240 align:middle line:84%
So that means we have to
verify the definition that I've

00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:17.650 align:middle line:90%
erased.

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:19.610 align:middle line:90%
So remember the definition.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:25.290 align:middle line:90%
So let's write it all out.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:29.860 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:36.940 align:middle line:90%
We first show h is one-to-one.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:41.080 align:middle line:84%
And what this means, according
to the definition that I'm now

00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:57.190 align:middle line:84%
writing over, if h of x1 equals
h of x2, then x1 equals x2.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:58.570 align:middle line:84%
So this is what
we want to prove.

00:43:58.570 --> 00:44:02.230 align:middle line:84%
This is the definition
of h being one-to-one.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:06.770 align:middle line:90%


00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.685 align:middle line:90%
So let's start.

00:44:07.685 --> 00:44:10.530 align:middle line:90%


00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:16.320 align:middle line:84%
If h of x1 equals h
of x2, then, in terms

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.500 align:middle line:84%
of how we've defined
h, which is g

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:28.400 align:middle line:84%
of f of x, so the composition,
then this means g of f of x1

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.065 align:middle line:90%
equals g of f of x2.

00:44:30.065 --> 00:44:32.860 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.400 align:middle line:90%
That's just what h is.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, this statement here--

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.280 align:middle line:90%
now g we know is a bijection.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.840 align:middle line:90%
We know g is one-to-one.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And since g of something equals
g of something else and g

00:44:52.180 --> 00:45:00.320 align:middle line:84%
is one-to-one, this implies
that f of x1 equals f of x2.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.740 align:middle line:90%
This is since g is one-to-one.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:08.800 align:middle line:90%


00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.440 align:middle line:84%
So starting with this
and the definition of h

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.810 align:middle line:84%
being the composition,
we conclude that f of x1

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:20.070 align:middle line:84%
has to equal f of x2
because g is one-to-one.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:23.280 align:middle line:84%
Now, since f is
also one-to-one--

00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.220 align:middle line:84%
we are assuming that f
and g are bijections.

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:33.240 align:middle line:84%
Since f is one-to-one,
this implies x1 equals x2,

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:36.420 align:middle line:90%
since f is one-to-one.

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:41.880 align:middle line:90%


00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.400 align:middle line:84%
And this is what
we wanted to prove.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:48.330 align:middle line:84%
We wanted to start with
assuming h of x1 equals h of x2

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:51.300 align:middle line:84%
and prove x1 equals x2,
which is what we've done.

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:57.900 align:middle line:84%
So thus, we've proven
that h is one-to-one.

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:00.885 align:middle line:84%
Now, we have to show that it's
surjective, that it's onto.

00:46:00.885 --> 00:46:12.580 align:middle line:90%


00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:18.160 align:middle line:84%
h of A equals C. And again,
I'll write out what this means.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:21.800 align:middle line:90%
This means for all y in C--

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.850 align:middle line:84%
all right, let me
call it [? z-- ?]

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:32.680 align:middle line:84%
there exists an x in A
such that h of x equals z.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.850 align:middle line:90%


00:46:37.850 --> 00:46:40.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, we used the
fact that f and g

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:46.230 align:middle line:84%
were injective to conclude that
the composition is injective.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:47.887 align:middle line:84%
So it stands to
reason that we're

00:46:47.887 --> 00:46:49.970 align:middle line:84%
going to use the fact that
they're both surjective

00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:51.980 align:middle line:90%
to prove that h is surjective.

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So we need to prove
that for all z in C

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:00.540 align:middle line:84%
there exists an x in A as
such that h of x equals z.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:05.310 align:middle line:84%
So let z be in C. Now,
we need to find some

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:07.650 align:middle line:90%
x in A that gets mapped to z.

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:12.060 align:middle line:84%
We'll use that g and
f are both surjective.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:16.530 align:middle line:90%


00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.245 align:middle line:84%
And what's the picture
that goes along with this?

00:47:19.245 --> 00:47:26.100 align:middle line:90%


00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:33.110 align:middle line:84%
Here's the sets C, B, and
A. We have some element of z

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:39.330 align:middle line:84%
And we know that
since g is surjective,

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:47.100 align:middle line:84%
there's some element in B
that gets mapped to z by G.

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:50.940 align:middle line:84%
But now, since f going
from A to B is surjective,

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:54.468 align:middle line:84%
there exists some
x which maps to y.

00:47:54.468 --> 00:47:57.112 align:middle line:90%


00:47:57.112 --> 00:47:58.570 align:middle line:84%
And then that's
the whole argument.

00:47:58.570 --> 00:48:00.880 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.990 align:middle line:90%
I drew this picture.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:05.170 align:middle line:84%
But now, I just need
to turn it into English

00:48:05.170 --> 00:48:08.710 align:middle line:84%
using the properties and
assumptions that I have.

00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:13.980 align:middle line:90%


00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:25.380 align:middle line:84%
Since g is surjective, there
exist a y in B such that g of y

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:26.220 align:middle line:90%
equals z.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:37.660 align:middle line:90%


00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Since f is surjective, there
exists an x in A so that f of x

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:51.680 align:middle line:90%
equals y.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:59.100 align:middle line:84%
But then if I look
at h of x, this

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:04.960 align:middle line:84%
is equal to g of f of x,
which is equal to g of y,

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.540 align:middle line:84%
which is equal to z by
how we've defined y.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:13.300 align:middle line:84%
Remember, g of y equals z, how
we found y and how we found x.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.380 align:middle line:90%
Remember, f of x equals this y.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:23.070 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
this map h is onto.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:29.470 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, h is a
bijection, proving this theorem.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:32.438 align:middle line:90%
So that should help you.

00:49:32.438 --> 00:49:39.150 align:middle line:84%
I'll give you many
exercises to prove

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:42.630 align:middle line:84%
that the inverse of a
bijection is a bijection.

00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:49.910 align:middle line:90%


00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:57.600 align:middle line:84%
So back to what we were
doing to begin with.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.910 align:middle line:84%
We want to show the set of
even natural numbers has

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:04.830 align:middle line:84%
the same size as
the natural numbers,

00:50:04.830 --> 00:50:07.830 align:middle line:84%
has the same cardinality, as
the natural numbers and the same

00:50:07.830 --> 00:50:08.550 align:middle line:90%
for the odd ones.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going
to do the odd ones.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:13.530 align:middle line:84%
Again, this will be a
small exercise for you

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:19.640 align:middle line:84%
to do to prove number 2, the
statement for the odd ones.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.380 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
do the even ones.

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:24.470 align:middle line:90%
And you can do the odd ones.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:28.720 align:middle line:84%
You should, if you plan
on studying more math,

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:35.050 align:middle line:84%
get used to the instructor,
professor, research paper

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:40.580 align:middle line:84%
writer, textbook author
giving out little exercises

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.290 align:middle line:84%
to make sure that
you're following along

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:47.980 align:middle line:84%
and that you can do some
minor task at some point

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:49.870 align:middle line:90%
during the discussion.

00:50:49.870 --> 00:50:52.790 align:middle line:90%


00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:56.840 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to find--

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:14.260 align:middle line:84%
so we want to show that
the natural numbers has

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:16.990 align:middle line:84%
the same size as the even
natural numbers, which

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:19.600 align:middle line:84%
is the same as this statement
by that first theorem I wrote up

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.100 align:middle line:90%
there.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.510 align:middle line:90%


00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:27.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, that means we need
to find a bijection

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:35.140 align:middle line:84%
from the natural numbers to the
set of even natural numbers.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:38.820 align:middle line:90%
This should be not too bad.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:43.315 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so again, this
is off to the side.

00:51:43.315 --> 00:51:44.565 align:middle line:90%
This is not part of the proof.

00:51:44.565 --> 00:52:02.570 align:middle line:90%


00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:07.610 align:middle line:84%
What would be the map going
from these guys to these guys?

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:10.790 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, there's
several you could choose.

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:13.560 align:middle line:84%
But maybe the simplest
is 1 gets mapped to 2,

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:16.670 align:middle line:84%
2 gets mapped to 4,
3 gets mapped to 6,

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:22.850 align:middle line:84%
4 gets mapped to 8, 5 to 10,
6 to 12, and so on, and so on.

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.730 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is that map?

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.570 align:middle line:84%
And now, I'll
continue the proof.

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:35.120 align:middle line:90%


00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:48.840 align:middle line:84%
Let f be the function into the
even natural numbers defined

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:54.870 align:middle line:90%
by f of n equals 2 times n.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:59.110 align:middle line:90%
And so n is a natural number.

00:52:59.110 --> 00:53:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So this is just formally writing
the function that takes 1 to 2,

00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:08.800 align:middle line:84%
2 to 4, 3 to 6, 4, to
8, and so on, and so on.

00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.760 align:middle line:90%
I claim f is a bijection.

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.345 align:middle line:84%
So I have to show that f
is one-to-one and onto.

00:53:16.345 --> 00:53:23.250 align:middle line:90%


00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:28.980 align:middle line:84%
So we'll first show
f is one-to-one.

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:31.930 align:middle line:90%


00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:36.480 align:middle line:84%
So that means that I have to
assume f of n1 equals f of n2

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:39.510 align:middle line:90%
and conclude that n1 equals n2.

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:42.390 align:middle line:84%
So let me actually write out
what this means again for you

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:44.460 align:middle line:90%
to say that f is one-to-one.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:46.140 align:middle line:90%
Is one to one-- i.e.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:55.860 align:middle line:84%
if f of n1 equals f of
n2, then n1 equals n2.

00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:58.560 align:middle line:84%
But this is easy to
verify for this function

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:07.430 align:middle line:84%
that we've written down because
if f of n1 equals f of n2-- so

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:10.430 align:middle line:84%
remember, this is what we
want to show, all right?

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:15.410 align:middle line:84%
So to show it, I start
with my assumption.

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:18.710 align:middle line:84%
And I need to
conclude n1 equals n2.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:24.560 align:middle line:84%
So suppose f of
n1 equals f of n2,

00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:26.600 align:middle line:90%
my assumption, my hypothesis.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.220 align:middle line:84%
And I need to
conclude n1 equals n2.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.805 align:middle line:84%
Then this implies, by
the definition of f,

00:54:33.805 --> 00:54:37.420 align:middle line:84%
2 times n2 equals
2 times n2, which,

00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:41.500 align:middle line:84%
by algebra of just eliminating
the 2's, n1 equals n2, which

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:44.650 align:middle line:90%
is the conclusion that I want.

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So I've proven the statement
that if f of n1 equals f of n2,

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:50.470 align:middle line:90%
then n1 equals n2.

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:53.510 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, f is one-to-one.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:59.320 align:middle line:90%
So thus, f is one-to-one.

00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:11.620 align:middle line:84%
So now, we want to show
f is onto, surjective.

00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.500 align:middle line:90%
I'll write this out again. i.e.

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:28.190 align:middle line:84%
For all elements that
n are an even number,

00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:33.800 align:middle line:84%
there exists an n such
that f of n equals m.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:47.900 align:middle line:90%
Now, let m be an even integer.

00:55:47.900 --> 00:55:52.500 align:middle line:84%
And so not to confuse us,
let me write 2 times k.

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:54.230 align:middle line:90%
This is the same set.

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:57.290 align:middle line:84%
I'm just using a different
dummy variable instead of n

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:59.705 align:middle line:84%
in my description of the
even natural numbers.

00:55:59.705 --> 00:56:05.790 align:middle line:90%


00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:07.410 align:middle line:90%
And let's do that here as well.

00:56:07.410 --> 00:56:15.470 align:middle line:90%


00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:17.030 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is not
changing anything.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:18.530 align:middle line:84%
This is just changing
the letter I'm

00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:24.820 align:middle line:84%
using to describe the set,
which is inconsequential.

00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:29.530 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want you to get the
false impression that somehow

00:56:29.530 --> 00:56:30.955 align:middle line:90%
I'm not doing anything at all.

00:56:30.955 --> 00:56:34.250 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.250 --> 00:56:39.770 align:middle line:84%
OK, so suppose I have an even
integer, then there exists--

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:42.290 align:middle line:84%
simply by the
definition of this set,

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:50.880 align:middle line:84%
there exists an n natural number
so that m equals 2 times n.

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:53.710 align:middle line:90%


00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:59.380 align:middle line:84%
Then f of this natural number,
which is 2 times n, equals m.

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:02.875 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I get
something that maps to m.

00:57:02.875 --> 00:57:12.490 align:middle line:90%


00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:14.020 align:middle line:90%
Therefore, f is onto.

00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:17.860 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, f is a
bijection and the two sets

00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:19.840 align:middle line:90%
have the same cardinality.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:29.260 align:middle line:90%


00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:42.170 align:middle line:90%
All right, so let's--

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.890 align:middle line:90%
where are we at?

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:44.450 align:middle line:90%
Where should I write?

00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:45.350 align:middle line:90%
Let's write here.

00:57:45.350 --> 00:57:50.907 align:middle line:90%


00:57:50.907 --> 00:57:52.990 align:middle line:84%
Maybe I'll leave that up
because I don't want to--

00:57:52.990 --> 00:58:11.170 align:middle line:90%


00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:13.990 align:middle line:84%
now, using this-- and
I'll probably put this

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:15.790 align:middle line:90%
in the homework--

00:58:15.790 --> 00:58:21.370 align:middle line:90%
I mean, one can also show--

00:58:21.370 --> 00:58:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:27.940 align:middle line:84%
I should say using
this, but one can also

00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:35.410 align:middle line:84%
show that the integers
have the same size

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:40.290 align:middle line:84%
as the natural numbers,
which, again, is a little bit

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.990 align:middle line:84%
surprising since the
natural numbers are

00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:48.540 align:middle line:90%
a strict subset of Z.

00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:50.680 align:middle line:90%
So what's the proof?

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:53.820 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to
draw a picture, then

00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:55.620 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to write
down the function,

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:59.192 align:middle line:84%
and then I'm going
to leave it as--

00:58:59.192 --> 00:59:01.400 align:middle line:84%
actually, I'm going to put
it in the homework for you

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:04.400 align:middle line:84%
to verify that this function
is one-to-one and onto.

00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:23.110 align:middle line:84%
So let's say there's
as many natural numbers

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:40.270 align:middle line:84%
as I want to write and as many
integers as I want to write.

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:46.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so what would
be a way of mapping

00:59:46.510 --> 00:59:51.340 align:middle line:84%
the integers in a
one-to-one and onto fashion

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:52.435 align:middle line:90%
onto the natural numbers?

00:59:52.435 --> 00:59:54.990 align:middle line:90%


00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:58.480 align:middle line:90%
Well, what we could do--

00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:05.330 align:middle line:84%
first off, let's send 0 to 1
just to get 0 out of the way.

01:00:05.330 --> 01:00:08.390 align:middle line:84%
And from then on,
now we just need

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.760 align:middle line:84%
to find a way to map
the positive integers

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:14.570 align:middle line:84%
and the negative integers onto
the natural numbers bigger

01:00:14.570 --> 01:00:17.020 align:middle line:90%
than 2.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
And in some way,
mentally, we should

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:27.910 align:middle line:84%
feel like we can do this because
we kind of did it over there,

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:29.770 align:middle line:90%
but not explicitly.

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So how about we take 1
to 2, 2 to 4, 3 to 6?

01:00:41.290 --> 01:00:44.860 align:middle line:90%
4 would then go to 8.

01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:53.995 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take 1
to 3, minus 2 to 5.

01:00:53.995 --> 01:00:56.620 align:middle line:90%
I'm getting crossed.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:01.850 align:middle line:84%
And then minus 3
would get sent to 7.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.940 align:middle line:84%
So you see that the
positive integers

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.700 align:middle line:84%
get mapped to the
even natural numbers

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:15.480 align:middle line:84%
and the negative integers
get mapped to the odd natural

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.770 align:middle line:90%
numbers bigger than 1.

01:01:16.770 --> 01:01:20.160 align:middle line:90%


01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:21.910 align:middle line:84%
So I'm not even going
to write the proof.

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:28.400 align:middle line:84%
This will be part
of the homework.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Now, it is a bit surprising
that there are twice

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:36.910 align:middle line:84%
as many numbers as
numbers, not too

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:42.070 align:middle line:84%
surprising since these
subsets, if you picture them

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:45.250 align:middle line:84%
as I've been doing as
subsets of the real line,

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:46.690 align:middle line:84%
you know they're
kind of discrete.

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.050 align:middle line:84%
So you should be
able to count them.

01:01:50.050 --> 01:01:55.450 align:middle line:84%
What is not-- what is
more surprising are--

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:59.270 align:middle line:84%
is whether or not can count
subsets that, in some sense,

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:00.340 align:middle line:90%
are not discrete.

01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:04.250 align:middle line:84%
For example, what about
the rational numbers?

01:02:04.250 --> 01:02:10.990 align:middle line:90%
So this is a theorem that--

01:02:10.990 --> 01:02:14.110 align:middle line:84%
and let me just look at those
positive rational numbers.

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I could take
all rational numbers.

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:21.600 align:middle line:84%
But for the statement
of this theorem,

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:31.700 align:middle line:84%
if I look at those rational
numbers which are positive,

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:36.790 align:middle line:84%
then this has the same size
as the natural numbers.

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:42.195 align:middle line:84%
You can count the positive
rational numbers, which is just

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:48.310 align:middle line:84%
a bit crazy to me because
here, at least for let's say

01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.580 align:middle line:84%
the integers, once
I'm at an integer,

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:55.805 align:middle line:84%
I can move to a next biggest one
and count that one in some way,

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:56.305 align:middle line:90%
right?

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:59.810 align:middle line:90%


01:02:59.810 --> 01:03:06.068 align:middle line:84%
And so that makes it believable
that I can count the integers.

01:03:06.068 --> 01:03:08.360 align:middle line:84%
The integers have the same
size as the natural numbers,

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:10.050 align:middle line:84%
even though that,
at first glance,

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:13.490 align:middle line:84%
it looks like there's
twice as many.

01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:17.780 align:middle line:84%
But for rational
numbers, between any two

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.850 align:middle line:84%
rational numbers, there's
another rational number

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:20.990 align:middle line:90%
in between them.

01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:26.840 align:middle line:84%
You just take the average of
those two rational numbers.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So now, this idea of
being at a rational number

01:03:30.290 --> 01:03:34.620 align:middle line:84%
and then moving to the next
big one, you can't do that now.

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:38.960 align:middle line:84%
So now, it's a little bit up in
the air at least whether or not

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:41.930 align:middle line:90%
can count the rational numbers.

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:44.757 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm saying is
that indeed you can.

01:03:44.757 --> 01:03:46.340 align:middle line:84%
And this will be
part of the homework.

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.410 align:middle line:90%


01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:57.500 align:middle line:84%
I will at least give you an
idea of how the proof will

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.720 align:middle line:84%
go, what we will actually
be able to write down,

01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:03.800 align:middle line:90%
a map based on a simple fact.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:12.530 align:middle line:84%
So let me not write down proof,
but let me write down a remark.

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So we'll actually be able
to write down a map based

01:04:15.790 --> 01:04:19.000 align:middle line:84%
on one simple fact, which
is this fundamental theorem

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.750 align:middle line:90%
of arithmetic, which says that--

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.265 align:middle line:90%
so this is just discussion now.

01:04:24.265 --> 01:04:27.015 align:middle line:90%


01:04:27.015 --> 01:04:29.670 align:middle line:84%
More stuff will be written
in the homework about this.

01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:31.650 align:middle line:90%
So just try to follow along.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.330 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental
theorem of arithmetic

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:35.880 align:middle line:84%
says that if you have a
positive natural number,

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:40.410 align:middle line:84%
you can write it in a unique way
as a product of prime numbers.

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:45.071 align:middle line:84%
Now, for rational
numbers, using that,

01:04:45.071 --> 01:04:48.920 align:middle line:84%
that means you can write
every rational number uniquely

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:53.170 align:middle line:84%
as a product of
prime numbers divided

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:55.690 align:middle line:84%
by another product
of prime numbers

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:58.840 align:middle line:90%
where no two prime numbers--

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.570 align:middle line:84%
where the prime numbers up
top and the prime numbers

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:04.040 align:middle line:84%
at the bottom,
none are in common,

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:07.580 align:middle line:84%
meaning you've simplified
as much as possible.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:13.095 align:middle line:90%
So instead of 15 over 3--

01:05:13.095 --> 01:05:14.790 align:middle line:90%
no, that's not good.

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:16.650 align:middle line:90%
Let's say 15 over 30.

01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.900 align:middle line:90%
You have 1/2.

01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:23.650 align:middle line:90%
So the map that I would take--

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:40.020 align:middle line:84%
so what I'm saying here is
that every rational number

01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:46.480 align:middle line:90%
can be written as some product.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So let me not use that
notation, but some product p

01:05:50.290 --> 01:06:07.330 align:middle line:84%
r1 pN rN q1 s1 qn sM where
p1, p2, and pN, these are all

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:07.830 align:middle line:90%
primes.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:10.650 align:middle line:90%
q1 up to qN, they're all primes.

01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:15.220 align:middle line:84%
r1, rN, these are all exponents,
positive natural numbers.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So rj, sk, these
are natural numbers.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:23.880 align:middle line:90%
p1 pN q1 to qM are primes.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:35.780 align:middle line:84%
And for all jk, qj
does not equal pk.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.440 align:middle line:84%
So there's no prime that appears
both up here and down here.

01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:42.050 align:middle line:84%
We've already
simplified that away.

01:06:42.050 --> 01:06:56.400 align:middle line:90%


01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:03.272 align:middle line:84%
So just so you don't
think I'm fooling you,

01:07:03.272 --> 01:07:04.980 align:middle line:84%
9/2, which is a positive
rational number,

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.040 align:middle line:90%
this is 3 squared over 2, yeah?

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:13.070 align:middle line:90%


01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:14.280 align:middle line:90%
I'm not going to do any more.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:14.780 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:20.420 align:middle line:90%


01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:25.930 align:middle line:84%
So the map that we will take
from this rational number

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:30.790 align:middle line:84%
to a natural number
will be this gets

01:07:30.790 --> 01:07:44.360 align:middle line:84%
mapped to the natural number
p1 to r1, pN to rN times now q1

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:53.780 align:middle line:90%
to 2s 1 minus 1 qM 2Sn minus 1.

01:07:53.780 --> 01:07:57.290 align:middle line:84%
So basically, I map
it to the integer that

01:07:57.290 --> 01:08:02.690 align:middle line:84%
has this expansion in terms
of prime numbers, where now

01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:04.610 align:middle line:84%
the exponents of
these prime numbers

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:07.850 align:middle line:84%
is even depending on
these exponents on top

01:08:07.850 --> 01:08:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and the exponents
of this one are odd,

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:15.290 align:middle line:84%
depending on this
exponent on top.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:24.080 align:middle line:84%
So for example, 3 squared over
2, this would get mapped to 3

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.780 align:middle line:90%
to the 4 times 2.

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:36.859 align:middle line:90%


01:08:36.859 --> 01:08:38.899 align:middle line:84%
So what we'll do in
the homework is show

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:41.390 align:middle line:84%
that this map is, in
fact, a bijection.

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:58.279 align:middle line:90%


01:08:58.279 --> 01:09:02.720 align:middle line:84%
So those two theorems you
will prove in the homework.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.330 align:middle line:90%
They won't be too bad.

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:07.970 align:middle line:90%
I will leave enough hints.

01:09:07.970 --> 01:09:11.255 align:middle line:90%
So we've dealt with z.

01:09:11.255 --> 01:09:13.550 align:middle line:90%
We've dealt with q, essentially.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:26.260 align:middle line:90%


01:09:26.260 --> 01:09:31.520 align:middle line:84%
I mean, so let me
actually write down--

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:35.290 align:middle line:84%
this is really a corollary
of these two theorems

01:09:35.290 --> 01:09:38.700 align:middle line:84%
here, which I haven't
proved, but you

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:40.200 align:middle line:90%
will prove in the homework.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:48.670 align:middle line:84%
So this says that the
rationals are countable,

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:52.330 align:middle line:84%
all the rationales, not
just the positive ones.

01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:56.270 align:middle line:90%
And what's the proof?

01:09:56.270 --> 01:10:02.330 align:middle line:90%
So we know that--

01:10:02.330 --> 01:10:08.970 align:middle line:90%


01:10:08.970 --> 01:10:13.930 align:middle line:84%
so I'm going to
give you a sketch.

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:16.123 align:middle line:84%
Should I sketch it or
should I write it all out?

01:10:16.123 --> 01:10:17.665 align:middle line:84%
I'm running a little
bit out of time.

01:10:17.665 --> 01:10:24.170 align:middle line:90%


01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:28.730 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I will just tell
you why this is true.

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.830 align:middle line:84%
I mean, all the details
are essentially here.

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:33.163 align:middle line:84%
I'm just not going to write
it as carefully as I've been

01:10:33.163 --> 01:10:35.010 align:middle line:90%
writing down the proofs before.

01:10:35.010 --> 01:10:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So let me write this
as the proof sketch.

01:10:40.430 --> 01:10:43.410 align:middle line:90%


01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.900 align:middle line:90%
Of course, you can write these--

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:49.570 align:middle line:84%
you can actually use the
definitions and write this out.

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:51.800 align:middle line:90%
But this is the essential idea.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:11:05.800 align:middle line:84%
So we have that the size
of rational numbers--

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:25.890 align:middle line:84%
so let me-- this has the same
size as the rational numbers

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.290 align:middle line:90%
which are negative.

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:36.940 align:middle line:90%


01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:41.320 align:middle line:90%
And how do we establish this?

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:45.070 align:middle line:84%
Or instead of using
the same letter,

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:55.120 align:middle line:84%
let's say r, since f
of Q equals minus Q

01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:06.810 align:middle line:84%
is a bijection from the
first set to the second set.

01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:24.829 align:middle line:90%


01:12:24.829 --> 01:12:27.440 align:middle line:84%
If I just take a rational
number, positive 1,

01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:31.160 align:middle line:84%
take its minus, then I get
an element of the second set.

01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:33.260 align:middle line:90%
And this is a bijection.

01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:36.100 align:middle line:90%


01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:49.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, so thus, since
this has the same size

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:55.380 align:middle line:84%
as the natural numbers,
and by that theorem

01:12:55.380 --> 01:12:57.560 align:middle line:84%
we proved over there,
the size of this set

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.100 align:middle line:84%
is the same as the
natural numbers--

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:01.897 align:middle line:90%
so it is countable--

01:13:01.897 --> 01:13:09.580 align:middle line:90%


01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:20.885 align:middle line:84%
then there exists
bijections f going from Q--

01:13:20.885 --> 01:13:22.745 align:middle line:84%
so the positive
rational numbers--

01:13:22.745 --> 01:13:27.340 align:middle line:90%


01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:48.210 align:middle line:84%
to the natural numbers and g
going from the negative ones

01:13:48.210 --> 01:13:51.630 align:middle line:90%
to the natural numbers.

01:13:51.630 --> 01:13:53.805 align:middle line:90%
So the picture here is--

01:13:53.805 --> 01:13:59.010 align:middle line:90%


01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:02.910 align:middle line:84%
well, let's not draw
the picture yet.

01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:05.190 align:middle line:84%
OK, so I have these
two bijections

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:08.340 align:middle line:84%
from the positive
rationales to the integers--

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:12.090 align:middle line:84%
this one from the
negative rationales

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:14.880 align:middle line:90%
to the natural numbers.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:17.960 align:middle line:84%
How do I get a map
that goes from all of q

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:19.570 align:middle line:90%
now to the natural numbers?

01:14:19.570 --> 01:14:23.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's go in between
and go to the integers.

01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:33.550 align:middle line:84%
Then I define a function h,
which goes now from all of Q

01:14:33.550 --> 01:14:48.970 align:middle line:84%
to the integers by h of
x equals 0 if x equals 0;

01:14:48.970 --> 01:14:56.990 align:middle line:84%
equals f of x if x is
positive; and negative g

01:14:56.990 --> 01:15:00.520 align:middle line:90%
of x if x is negative.

01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:06.320 align:middle line:90%


01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:11.010 align:middle line:90%
And h is a bijection.

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:15.330 align:middle line:84%
So everything up
to this point has

01:15:15.330 --> 01:15:18.520 align:middle line:84%
been completely fine
with the exception

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.850 align:middle line:84%
of me verifying that
this map is a bijection

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:23.540 align:middle line:90%
and this map is a bijection.

01:15:23.540 --> 01:15:24.940 align:middle line:84%
So that's the only
parts that I'm

01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:27.550 align:middle line:90%
leaving out for you to verify.

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:29.800 align:middle line:90%
Then h is a bijection.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:38.410 align:middle line:84%
So Q has the same cardinality
as integers, which we've shown

01:15:38.410 --> 01:15:41.635 align:middle line:84%
has the same cardinality
as the natural numbers.

01:15:41.635 --> 01:15:44.560 align:middle line:90%


01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:48.610 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the rationals
have the same cardinality

01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:49.760 align:middle line:90%
as the natural numbers.

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.490 align:middle line:90%
So they are countably infinite.

01:15:51.490 --> 01:16:01.220 align:middle line:90%


01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:06.725 align:middle line:90%
So a natural question is--

01:16:06.725 --> 01:16:09.973 align:middle line:90%


01:16:09.973 --> 01:16:12.390 align:middle line:84%
I mean, is there anything
bigger than the natural numbers?

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:14.280 align:middle line:84%
Because everything
I've written down,

01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.245 align:middle line:84%
this has the size of
the natural numbers.

01:16:16.245 --> 01:16:19.510 align:middle line:90%


01:16:19.510 --> 01:16:22.930 align:middle line:84%
We haven't really defined the
real numbers well enough yet

01:16:22.930 --> 01:16:32.830 align:middle line:84%
to make any sort of claim like
that about the real numbers.

01:16:32.830 --> 01:16:40.790 align:middle line:84%
And now, is there
just any set that

01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:43.440 align:middle line:84%
is bigger in size than
the natural numbers?

01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:47.620 align:middle line:90%
The answer to that was unknown.

01:16:47.620 --> 01:16:53.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's pretty
strikingly yes, in fact.

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:58.200 align:middle line:90%


01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:04.640 align:middle line:90%
So let me phrase that question.

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:13.760 align:middle line:90%


01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:26.050 align:middle line:84%
Does there exist a set A
such that A has strictly

01:17:26.050 --> 01:17:28.750 align:middle line:84%
bigger cardinality than
the natural numbers, so A

01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:29.680 align:middle line:90%
is uncountable?

01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:34.410 align:middle line:90%


01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:38.730 align:middle line:84%
So to answer this question
astoundingly yes, let me first

01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:40.995 align:middle line:90%
define for a general object.

01:17:40.995 --> 01:17:45.710 align:middle line:90%


01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:54.365 align:middle line:84%
If A is a set, we
define script p of A.

01:17:54.365 --> 01:18:08.480 align:middle line:84%
This is the power set of A.
This is a set that consists

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
of all subsets of A. So this is
a set of all sets B such that B

01:18:15.210 --> 01:18:31.860 align:middle line:84%
is a subset of A. So for
example, if A is the empty set,

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:32.685 align:middle line:90%
the power set--

01:18:32.685 --> 01:18:35.690 align:middle line:90%


01:18:35.690 --> 01:18:37.340 align:middle line:90%
so A is empty.

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
What are the subsets
of the empty set?

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:46.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's only one subset
of the empty set, the empty set.

01:18:46.030 --> 01:18:48.160 align:middle line:84%
And even though the
empty set has no members,

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.585 align:middle line:90%
its power set has one member.

01:18:49.585 --> 01:18:53.730 align:middle line:90%


01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:56.730 align:middle line:84%
If A equals 1,
then the power set

01:18:56.730 --> 01:19:01.390 align:middle line:84%
of A, the set of all subsets,
consists of the empty set

01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:03.910 align:middle line:90%
and the set itself, 1.

01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:06.940 align:middle line:90%


01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:10.180 align:middle line:90%
And let's do one more.

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:17.860 align:middle line:84%
If A is the set 1, 2,
then the power set of A,

01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:22.860 align:middle line:84%
this is the set which
consists of the empty set,

01:19:22.860 --> 01:19:26.830 align:middle line:84%
because this is a
subset of this set,

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:middle line:84%
the set consisting of 1, because
this is a subset of this set,

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:37.170 align:middle line:90%
or 2, 1, 2.

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:38.910 align:middle line:90%
Now, notice something.

01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:41.730 align:middle line:90%
This set had cardinality.

01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:44.640 align:middle line:84%
Strictly speaking, I
should have defined that

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.580 align:middle line:90%
as having cardinality 0.

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.940 align:middle line:84%
Yet, its power set
has cardinality 1.

01:19:50.940 --> 01:19:55.560 align:middle line:84%
A has size 1 because it's
in one-to-one correspondence

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.450 align:middle line:90%
with just 1.

01:19:57.450 --> 01:20:00.870 align:middle line:84%
And its power set
has two elements.

01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:04.310 align:middle line:90%
So it has cardinality 2.

01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:05.310 align:middle line:90%
I could count them off--

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
1, 2.

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:10.170 align:middle line:90%
A has size 2, has two elements.

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.490 align:middle line:84%
And the power set
of A has size 4.

01:20:12.490 --> 01:20:16.590 align:middle line:84%
It has four different elements--
the empty set, 1, 2, 1, 2.

01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:26.020 align:middle line:84%
So what one can prove in
general and which will appear

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:33.130 align:middle line:84%
on the homework is
if A has size n--

01:20:33.130 --> 01:20:37.330 align:middle line:84%
so it's a finite set of size
n, meaning it's in one-to-one

01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:40.660 align:middle line:84%
correspondence with
the numbers 1 up to n--

01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:48.010 align:middle line:84%
then its power
set is also finite

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:51.850 align:middle line:90%
and has cardinality 2 to the n.

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:56.250 align:middle line:84%
And you can prove by induction,
if you like, that 2 to the n

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.540 align:middle line:90%
is always bigger than n.

01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:00.240 align:middle line:90%


01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:07.340 align:middle line:84%
And so a theorem I'll
prove next time, which

01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:14.260 align:middle line:84%
will finish our discussion
of sets and cardinality,

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:16.840 align:middle line:84%
and then we'll move on
to the real numbers,

01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:25.150 align:middle line:84%
is this theorem due
to Cantor, which

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:30.800 align:middle line:84%
says that not just
for finite sets

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.350 align:middle line:84%
do we have the power set
being, in some sense, strictly

01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:36.680 align:middle line:84%
bigger than the original
set, but for any set.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:44.970 align:middle line:84%
So this theorem due to
Cantor is if A is a set,

01:21:44.970 --> 01:21:50.130 align:middle line:84%
then the cardinality of
A is strictly smaller

01:21:50.130 --> 01:21:54.350 align:middle line:84%
than the cardinality
of its power set.

01:21:54.350 --> 01:21:58.910 align:middle line:84%
So this definitely
answers our question.

01:21:58.910 --> 01:22:01.400 align:middle line:84%
Does there exist a set
with cardinality bigger

01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.940 align:middle line:90%
than the natural numbers?

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.565 align:middle line:84%
So let me write
this as a remark.

01:22:04.565 --> 01:22:08.550 align:middle line:90%


01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:13.740 align:middle line:84%
In fact, maybe I'll state
this as another theorem, which

01:22:13.740 --> 01:22:16.650 align:middle line:84%
just follows immediately
from this getting

01:22:16.650 --> 01:22:21.870 align:middle line:84%
used over and over again,
is that the cardinality

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.550 align:middle line:84%
of the natural
numbers, this is less

01:22:23.550 --> 01:22:27.210 align:middle line:84%
than the cardinality
of the power

01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:30.450 align:middle line:84%
set of the natural
numbers, which is less

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:33.780 align:middle line:84%
than the cardinality
of the power

01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:37.140 align:middle line:84%
set of the power set of
the natural numbers, right?

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:39.810 align:middle line:84%
I can now take this as a
set and take its power set.

01:22:39.810 --> 01:22:43.150 align:middle line:84%
And I get a new set
with bigger size,

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:48.120 align:middle line:84%
which is less than the power
set of the power set where--

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:53.100 align:middle line:84%
how many do we have now-- of the
power set of natural numbers,

01:22:53.100 --> 01:22:54.030 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

01:22:54.030 --> 01:23:08.570 align:middle line:90%


01:23:08.570 --> 01:23:25.540 align:middle line:84%
And formally, this means there's
an infinity of infinitudes.

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:30.490 align:middle line:84%
There's an infinite
number of infinite sizes,

01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:32.260 align:middle line:90%
one getting strictly--

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.675 align:middle line:84%
in some sense, strictly
bigger than the previous size.

01:23:34.675 --> 01:23:37.470 align:middle line:90%


01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:43.540 align:middle line:90%
And maybe you're wondering--

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.120 align:middle line:84%
there's one more
question that's kind

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:54.090 align:middle line:84%
of sandwiched in between
here, pun intended, is--

01:23:54.090 --> 01:23:56.820 align:middle line:90%
let's look at this first guy.

01:23:56.820 --> 01:24:06.020 align:middle line:90%


01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:19.930 align:middle line:84%
Does there exist a set A
such that it has size bigger

01:24:19.930 --> 01:24:23.470 align:middle line:84%
than natural numbers-- so
it's uncountable-- but has

01:24:23.470 --> 01:24:25.150 align:middle line:84%
size strictly smaller
than the power

01:24:25.150 --> 01:24:27.700 align:middle line:90%
set of the natural numbers.

01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:39.426 align:middle line:84%
And this question is called
the continuum hypothesis,

01:24:39.426 --> 01:24:41.720 align:middle line:84%
hypothesis because it
is independent from one

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
of the standard axiomatic
treatments of set theory.

01:24:48.440 --> 01:24:51.080 align:middle line:84%
But we will not
touch this question.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.195 align:middle line:84%
This is beyond the
scope of this class,

01:24:54.195 --> 01:24:55.820 align:middle line:84%
but it's an interesting
question that's

01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:58.990 align:middle line:84%
out there that people
just don't know.

01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:middle line:90%

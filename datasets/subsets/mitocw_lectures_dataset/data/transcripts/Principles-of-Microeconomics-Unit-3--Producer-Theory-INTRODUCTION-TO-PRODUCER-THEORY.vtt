00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.790
PROFESSOR: Now what I'm going
to do is, I'm going to turn

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.340
and start producer theory, OK,
which will not be in the exam,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.830
but be the next subject
to the course.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.850
OK, and we're going to spend a
little bit longer on this.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.590
So what we've been doing so
far is saying, look, we

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:35.430
introduced the course with
supply and demand curves,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.820
elasticities, all that.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.820
Hint, all that's on
the exam too.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.220
OK, and all that.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.930
Then we say, well gee,
where do supply and

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.810
demand curves come from?

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.990
Well, demand curves come from
utility maximization.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.150
And we talked about how where
indifference curves come from,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.380
how the tangency with the budget
constraints leads to

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.550
the demand curve.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.590
That's where demand
curves come from.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.050
We talked about what underlies
demand curves is income and

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.920
substitution effects.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.730
OK, now let's come
to supply curves.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.000
What underlies supply curves?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.390
Now on the one hand, this will
be much easier than demand

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.030
curves, because a lot of
the logic is the same.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.100
So we can march more quickly
through the analysis, because

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.830
it's basically the same kind
of tangency of curves with

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.130
straight lines that yield supply
curves that we've seen

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.380
with consumer theory.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.810
On the other hand, supply
curves are a ton harder,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.790
because now we don't
just have the

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.700
price as given to consumers.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.990
The suppliers actually
make up the price.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.040
With consumers, we said the
price -- you just went to the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.065
store. you're given a price.

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:42.120
And you choose what to
buy at those prices.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.180
Well, who set those prices?

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.140
Producers do.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.560
And that's what determines the
underlying supply curve.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.630
So life gets a little bit more
difficult with producers.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.220
And that's why I'll probably
spend about twice as many

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.100
lectures talking about producer
theory as we've spent

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.150
talking about consumer theory.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.590
Now, let's go to the basics.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.770
The basics are, just as we had
consumers making decisions, we

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.550
thought of a consumer as
somebody choosing across a

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.000
bundle of goods, pizza versus
movies, now we're going to

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.970
think of a producer very simply
as a black box, where

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.120
inputs go in and outputs
come out.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.250
So think of the firm.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.920
Let's think of a firm,
a producer, as

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.180
just some black box.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.820
We're literally thinking
a flow chart.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.350
You've got inputs that go in
and outputs that come out.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.490
And that black box, that firm,
just as individuals have a

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.470
simple goal which is to maximize
their utility,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.690
producers have a simple
goal which is to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.600
maximize their profits.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.490
And profits are defined as
revenue minus cost. OK?

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.830
Producers are these black boxes,
where their goal is to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.760
maximize their profits, which is
revenue minus cost. And the

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.915
key to maximizing profits
is efficient production.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.740
The key to maximizing profits
is going to be to produce

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.760
goods as efficiently
as possible.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.000
OK, so profit maximization
requires production

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.790
efficiency.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.580
To maximize your profits, you
need to produce as efficiently

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.830
as possible.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.420
Now, you might ask yourself,
gee, I can read about all

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.570
these companies that have
executive corporate jets, and

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.750
the guys in these lavish
lifestyles, and that doesn't

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.700
seem very efficient
production.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.140
I'll come back to that.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.540
OK, in a couple of lectures,
we'll talk about do firms

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.250
actually maximize profits, and
whether they do or not.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.800
But for now, let's take as
a given that they do.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.990
OK, just as it is a given that
consumers maximize utility,

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.270
let's take as a given that firms
maximize their profits.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.490
OK?

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.060
Now, to decide how to
efficiently produce goods,

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.370
we're going to turn
and today discuss

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.855
firm production functions.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.560
OK, today, we'll focus on
production functions.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.960
That's essentially the
technology by which a firm

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.740
takes inputs, or what we call
factors of production, and

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.110
turns them into outputs,
is through

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.520
this production function.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.040
So just like your utility
function is a tool for which

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.510
we take bundles of goods and
turn them into happiness, a

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.970
production function is a tool
for which we take bundles of

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.590
inputs and turn them
into outputs.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.030
OK, but something that's a
little easier to understand

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.330
this, you could think of a
factory where stuff comes in,

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.580
and think of a belt, a
mechanical belt, going through

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.320
and stuff goes in and other
stuff comes out.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.840
You could think of that
production function.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.880
We're going to think about two
different kinds of inputs that

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.000
firms are going to use.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.790
Once again, to make life easy,
we're going to assume firms

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.970
only use two kinds of inputs.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.250
Later, we'll expand this, but
from mostly intuition you can

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:19.560
get from thinking about
this-- two kinds of

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.760
inputs, labor and capital.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.590
Labor and capital are the two
kinds of inputs firms use.

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.340
Labor is clear.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.550
It's just hours of labor,
hours of work.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.550
OK?

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:39.140
It's just hours of work
in production.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:40.820
Capital is a lot trickier.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.800
And we'll spend a lot of time
this semester struggling with

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.810
what capital really means.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.020
Basically for now, think of
capital as everything else

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.080
that goes into production, the
machines, the buildings, the

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.470
land, everything.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.180
Think of capital as everything
else that goes into

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.230
production.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.960
So basically, when you produce
stuff, you produce it with

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.740
workers working with stuff.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.990
Capital's the stuff.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.230
Now, this capital is sort of a
composite of everything else

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.590
that goes into production.

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.540
And once again, we'll add some
more detail on this later.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:18.220
OK, and the output is
some output, q.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:19.600
That's the units
of production.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.000
That's the output that is
produced by the firm.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.910
So basically, we can think of a
production function is q is

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.810
some function of l and k.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.820
That's a production function,
that the output you produce as

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:34.670
your firm--

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.060
and by the way, we're going to
use little q to represent a

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.710
firm's output, and big Q to
represent market output.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.540
OK, so little q, and if I slip
in this, yell at me, OK?

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.330
But we're going to try to
consistently use little q to

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.830
represent a given firm's output,
and big Q to be the

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.660
market's output--

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.700
So little q is some function of
the amount of workers you

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:59.080
have and the amount of
capital you use.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.960
Now, the important distinction
we're going to make here is

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:10.585
between variable versus
fixed inputs.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.850
Variable versus fixed inputs
is an important distinction

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.750
we're going to draw.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.210
Variable inputs are inputs that
are easily changed, like

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.580
how many hours somebody works.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.100
In principle, you could just
have some work five hours one

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.600
day, one hour the next day, 10
hours the day after that.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.290
It's easy to change
hours of work.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.540
So that's a variable input.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.860
Fixed inputs are things which
are harder to change quickly,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.010
like the size of the building
that the workers

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.540
are building in.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.550
Once that building's built, it's
pretty hard to change it.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:49.330
You can't like lop off 2/3 of it
on one day and add it back

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.290
the next day.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.980
OK, that's more of
the fixed inputs.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.080
And this will lead to a critical
distinction for

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.090
production theory, which
is the short run

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:00.750
versus the long run.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.910
The short run versus
the long run.

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:11.150
The long run is the
period over which

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:14.240
all inputs are variable.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.550
The short run is a period over
which some inputs are fixed.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:19.380
Let me say it again, it's
very important.

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.020
The short run is the
period over which

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.180
some inputs are fixed.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:25.580
The long run is the
period over which

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:26.970
all inputs are variable.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.410
Now, what does that mean?

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:33.110
I can't tell you.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.710
OK?

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:38.590
I can tell you that, clearly,
tomorrow is the short run.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.299
Clearly, you can't vary all
your inputs over one day.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:42.940
And probably next month
is the short run.

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.670
And probably even next year
is the short run.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.570
There's a lot of inputs that it
takes more than a month to

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.760
change, or a year to change.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.120
On the other hand, 10 years from
now is almost certainly

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.580
the long run.

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.610
There's very few inputs to
production you can't change

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.120
over a 10-year period.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.870
So we know a day are
the short run.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.010
And we know 10 years
is the long run.

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.610
We don't really know where
the transition is, but in

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.810
substance that doesn't
matter for you guys.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:07.570
What matters is the definition
of short run, long run.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.290
When someone asks you what the
long run is, you say it's the

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.770
period of time over which
all inputs are variable.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:13.070
That's what matters.

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:14.520
So it doesn't matter if
you define it in days

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.920
or months or years.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.465
It's a theoretical concept,
which the break from the short

00:09:18.465 --> 00:09:21.750
run to the long run is the break
between when some inputs

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.595
are fixed and all inputs
are variable.

00:09:24.595 --> 00:09:26.070
OK?

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.370
Now of course, once again
this is tricky.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.100
And economists recognize
this subtlety.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.480
A lot of times, economists will
talk about quasi-fixed

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:37.020
factors of production, which are
things which could change

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:38.320
in between the short run
and the long run.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.010
So for instance, take labor.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.760
OK, we'll talk about labor as a
variable unit of production

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.100
you can change in
the short run.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.200
But in fact, we know in
practice you can't.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.430
Most jobs, you can't ask the
guys to come for an hour one

00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:52.230
day, and 10 hours the next day,
five hours the day after

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.360
that, maybe some jobs like
hourly construction.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.040
But most jobs you guys will
have, OK, your labor isn't

00:09:59.040 --> 00:09:59.720
that variable.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.340
We're typically on some kind of

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.420
reasonably set work schedule.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.930
Now that work schedule
can evolve.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:09.020
OK, but it can't change
day by day.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.500
None of us are going to have
jobs where they're going to

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.000
say, look, work two hours
today, 12 hours the

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.240
next day, et cetera.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.260
OK, we're all going to have
jobs with a fairly smooth

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.900
distribution.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.990
There'll be peaks and valleys,
but a fairly smooth

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:22.770
distribution of our
labor effort.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.250
So really, truly, there's very
few inputs which are truly

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.190
perfectly variable.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:29.370
OK?

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:31.770
Just like there are no inputs
which are truly perfectly

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:35.930
fixed, but for the purposes of
this model, let's think about

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.310
labor as a variable input.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.370
Let's think about labor as being
like hourly labor, like

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.010
hourly construction, OK?

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.430
And let's think about capital as
being a fixed input, like a

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:48.670
building that you can't pare
down or rebuild overnight, but

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.590
over a 10-year period you can.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.530
OK?

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:55.730
Questions about that?

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:57.397
Once again, we talked about
simplifying assumptions at the

00:10:57.397 --> 00:10:58.390
beginning of the semester.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.700
This is our set of simplifying
assumptions.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.320
Simplifying assumptions are that
firms produce goods with

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.070
two inputs, labor and capital,
that labor is variable, which

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.930
means you can change it minute
to minute or day to day, and

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:13.605
capital is fixed, which means
you can only change

00:11:13.605 --> 00:11:16.190
it in the long run.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:19.160
OK?

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:23.340
All right, so armed with that,
let's now talk about how firms

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.730
make short-run production
decisions.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:32.610
And once again, these are
a lot of assumptions.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.900
But at the end of the day, I'm
going to be able to teach you

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.830
in a couple of lectures how
firms make decisions.

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:39.910
And I'm going to be
about 80% right.

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.360
So that's pretty good.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.510
OK, so there are some
assumptions, but we're going

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.000
to go a long way with
these assumptions.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.600
So let's start by considering
the short run, and considering

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.160
that period of time over
which labor is variable

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.970
but capital is fixed.

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.340
Labor is variable but
capital is fixed.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.580
That is, you have a given plant,
but you can adjust how

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:08.630
many workers you use every
day in that plant.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:11.290
And now the firm has to decide,
given that that plant

00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.210
exists, how many workers
should I hire

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.610
to produce my good?

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.090
How many workers should I
hire to produce my good?

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.850
And the key concept that's going
to determine that is

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:29.350
something we'll call the
marginal product of labor,

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.580
which is the change in total
output resulting from the next

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.090
unit of labor used--

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:41.590
that is, delta q, delta l--

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.260
is the marginal product
of labor.

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:47.310
It's going to be the change in
total output from another unit

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:50.500
of labor, once again holding
capital constant because

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:51.730
that's fixed.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:56.580
So really, it's really at a
given k bar, but that's

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.780
implicit in the fact
it's the short run.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.620
So the given level of capital,
what is the change in output

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.000
for another unit of labor?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.270
And once we get to the short
run, I shouldn't

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:05.800
have to write this.

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.680
If I tell you short run, you
should know this is true.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.060
But technically, we would
write that out.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:17.520
Now, what we're going to do here
is we're typically going

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:21.280
to assume this--

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.600
hint, hint--

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.980
if you're comfortable with
consumer theory, this is like

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:26.680
marginal utility.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.660
Marginal product is like
marginal utility.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.550
Just as the marginal utility was
your utility from another

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:35.650
unit of one good, holding the
other good fixed, marginal

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.860
product is the marginal
production from another unit

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.290
of an input, holding the
other input fixed.

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:45.520
So just sort of a parallel
to keep in mind.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.660
And just as we've assumed and
discussed the intuition for

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.780
diminishing marginal utility,
we're going to typically

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.280
assume diminishing
marginal product.

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:04.340
So we're going to assume
diminishing marginal product.

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:10.340
That is, from a given level of
labor, the next worker you add

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.780
increases your total product by
less than the previous one.

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.290
Now once again, just like we
have a non- satiation rule in

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.180
utility, we're not going
to say the next

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.800
worker doesn't help.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.330
Every worker helps.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.920
But every worker helps less and
less and less, just like

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.880
every pizza means less and
less and less to you.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:37.045
Now, the trick here, once again,
this is like consumer

00:14:37.045 --> 00:14:38.140
theory, only more subtle.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.620
With consumer theory, it's
pretty clear that once you had

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.160
one pizza, clearly, the second
pizza means less.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.680
And once you've seen one movie,
your first-place prize,

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.620
the movie you most want to see,
clearly the next movie

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.560
you want to see means
a little bit less.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.330
Producer theory is a
little more subtle.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:56.550
And you can imagine ranges over
which more workers help.

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:58.110
They can work together.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.410
So that actually two workers
can do more than twice what

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.190
one worker can do.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:04.480
And we'll talk about that.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.070
But we're going to focus in the
main on ranges over which

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:09.995
each additional worker does
less and less and less.

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.520
And the reason is because,
to remember, this

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:16.270
is less than two--

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.550
Yeah?

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.710
AUDIENCE: Is there going to
be a point where actually

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.608
additional workers won't do
anything, because of like

00:15:24.608 --> 00:15:27.030
constrain to the amounts
of other inputs?

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:29.210
PROFESSOR: Once again, we're not
going to get-- just like

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.110
there's a point at which extra
pizza will make you barf--

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.590
OK, we're assuming we don't
get to that point.

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.610
But yes, technically of course,
at some point more is

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:38.090
not better.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.060
At some point, extra workers
just sit around.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.110
And so I agree.

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:43.840
So basically, it's
a little tricky.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.350
You could imagine an initial
range where more

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:47.280
workers would help.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.280
Then there's the main range
we'll focus on each additional

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.845
worker does less and
less and less.

00:15:50.845 --> 00:15:52.880
And you could imagine that
running out, which is a worker

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:53.660
does nothing.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:56.930
But let's just now assume
we don't get there.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.650
So basically, what's
the intuition?

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:02.526
Now the intuition for in
utility theory, for

00:16:02.526 --> 00:16:04.210
diminishing marginal utility,
I thought was pretty easy,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.940
which is each pizza
means less.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:09.010
The intuition for why each
worker does less, I find a

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:09.640
little bit harder.

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.240
You could say, well, gee, why
should one worker do less than

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.120
the next worker?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.300
Why shouldn't the next worker
do less than the first?

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.250
And the key is this
part, that we're

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.400
holding capital constant.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.520
The reason each worker does less
is because they only have

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.870
the same amount of stuff
to work with.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:30.870
And the classic example we
use here is the example

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.120
of digging a hole.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.610
You go to dig a hole and your
capital's a shovel.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:38.950
And let's say for some reason
the shovels are out, so you

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.060
can't get another shovel
for a while.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:42.640
OK, so there's one shovel.

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:46.210
So you have one worker digging
a hole, then the next worker

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:47.950
comes along and that's where
he can help because he can

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.100
spell the first worker.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.400
And maybe the next worker's just
as good because he can

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.390
work more hours, but probably
it's a little bit less good.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:58.490
But certainly by the time you
add a fourth and a fifth and a

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.390
sixth person, with one shovel,
they probably each help

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.380
because they can rotate
and rest each other.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.550
But certainly the sixth person
is not going to help dig the

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.930
hole as much as that second
person did, or the third, or

00:17:08.930 --> 00:17:12.430
fourth, or fifth person, because
only one shovel.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.900
So they can share a little
bit and share the

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.980
burden a little bit.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:18.040
But at some point each
additional worker helps less

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.300
because they have to share
the same shovel.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.780
So that's what diminishing
marginal product is, because

00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:24.369
capital's fixed.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:26.430
With a certain amount of capital
to work with, each

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.890
additional worker just
can't help as

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:30.140
much as the one before.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.410
Now eventually, you can
add more shovels.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:36.430
And you could have
wheelbarrows.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.810
So some people could run the
wheelbarrows, some people

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:39.230
could run the shovels.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.840
But that's the long run.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.620
In the short run, there's the
one shovel, so each additional

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.330
worker does less good.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.000
And that's the intuition.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.460
Once again, not as clean as with
consumption, where it's

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.290
easy to see each additional
pizza is worth less, because

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:57.510
you could imagine the second
worker might actually help.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.080
They could rest, et cetera,
and you could imagine

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.720
eventually the ninth worker does
nothing because there's

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.070
nothing left to do.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.780
But let's focus on that range
where it's intuitive.

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.500
We're staying between the second
and sixth worker, which

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.060
is when a worker would help,
but they help less

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.460
and less and less.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:13.920
OK, and that's the diminishing
marginal product.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.170
Questions about that?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.176
That's short-run production.

00:18:20.176 --> 00:18:21.400
And we're going to come
back to this.

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.350
But I just want to introduce
these concepts.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:26.900
Now let's talk about long-run
production.

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.560
Now in the long run, all
inputs are variable.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.620
That's how we defined
the long run.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.000
So now a firm doesn't just
choose how many workers to

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.420
hire, or how many hours
of labor to buy.

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:53.290
It chooses both l and k, and
has to trade them off, just

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.730
like you chose both pizzas
and movies and had

00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:58.410
to trade them off.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:04.300
So the long-run production
theory is the same, basically

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.990
the same mechanics,
as utility theory.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.440
There's a production function.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.240
You have two inputs.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.700
You trade them off.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.230
Just like you're a consumer.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.300
You have two goods to consume.

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.980
You trade them off.

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.540
The difference is going to be
that ultimately production is

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.380
going to self--

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.440
the difference is, when you
decide how to trade them off

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.430
as a consumer, you're given
a budget constraint.

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.620
The difference with production
is the budget constraint is

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.940
going to be itself determined
by the same system.

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.650
So you're not only going to
develop your production

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.190
function, but you're going to
develop your budget constraint

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:36.350
and, you're going
to decide both.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.380
It's a little bit funky
but we'll get to it.

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:40.750
But for now, let's just think
about the parallels to

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.740
consumer theory, and think about
a production function

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.890
which is q--

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:46.750
little q--

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:48.880
is the square root
of k times l.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.360
That same functional form I used
with pizza and movies,

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:53.590
where utility is the square root
of pizza times movies.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:58.450
Now I'm going to say what you
produce of your good is the

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.310
square root of k times l.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.567
Now let's go to figure 8-3.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:11.520
And what we see here is, if
you're trading off k and l and

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.440
deciding to produce, then you
get what's called isoquants.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.750
Isoquants are the parallel
to indifference curves.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:22.990
Once again, this is all
the same mechanics.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.010
Just as there were sets of goods
across which you were

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:31.030
indifferent, two pizzas and one
movie versus one pizza and

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:32.410
two movies.

00:20:32.410 --> 00:20:35.620
Isoquants are sets of
inputs along which

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:38.120
production is the same.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.300
So along a given isoquant,
q is fixed.

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.830
Each of those isoquants is a
different level of q, but they

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:49.790
show how you can vary k and l
to get the same amount of q.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.830
So producing q equals
square root of 2.

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:57.120
I can use two units of capital
and one unit of labor, or one

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.990
unit of capital and
two of labor.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:04.590
So I can choose lots of
combinations of k and l along

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:09.300
that isoquant to produce a
given amount of output.

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.390
And isoquants have all the
same features as in

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:12.660
indifference curves.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.440
The further out the better
because you're producing more.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.040
They can't cross.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.830
All the same set of things we
have in the indifference

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:20.350
curves are true with
isoquants as well.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.210
And they slope downwards because
there's a trade off

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:29.780
between capital and labor.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.200
Now, what's going to determine
the slope of an isoquant?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.330
Can someone tell me
what determines

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.830
the slope of an isoquant?

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:43.185
What determines if isoquants
are steep or shallow?

00:21:47.545 --> 00:21:49.720
Well, what determines the slope
of a indifference curve?

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.540
Yes, go ahead.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.970
AUDIENCE: It's based on the
ratio of how much labor is

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.440
worth versus capital?

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:57.500
PROFESSOR: Right, and what
do we call that?

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:59.170
What determines how much they're
worth from each other?

00:21:59.170 --> 00:22:01.770
What determines the slope
of a indifference curve?

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.920
The marginal rate of
substitution, it was the

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.400
substitutability
between goods.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.220
Likewise, the substitutability
between labor and capital will

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:13.550
determine the slope of
these isoquants.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:19.030
So to see an example, let's do
an extreme example here.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:24.370
Let's consider goods that are
perfectly substitutable.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.420
So like, I don't know, just like
a Harvard undergraduate

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:27.650
and a beanie baby.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:30.980
OK, perfectly substitutable.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:34.150
Figure 8-4a shows the
case of perfectly

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.070
substitutable inputs.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.750
In that case, you would have a
linear isoquant, because what

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.590
that would mean is you don't
care if you have three capital

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.990
and one labor, or three
labor and one capital.

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:49.720
You don't care.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:53.670
You don't care if you have two
labor and two capital, or

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:55.310
three labor and one capital,
as long as you

00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:56.590
get a total of four.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.080
That's all that matters.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.530
They're perfectly substitutable
inputs, which

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:03.890
would say that it would be
something like q equals k plus

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.550
l would be the case
of perfectly

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:06.640
substitutable inputs.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.970
You don't care if it's k or l,
you just care about the total.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:11.400
That'd be perfectly
substitutable inputs.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.590
That would be a linear
isoquant.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:18.030
OK, on the other hand, let's
think about goods which are

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:22.020
not at all substitutable like
cereal and cereal boxes.

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:23.240
The cereal wouldn't be any
good unless you have a

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.330
box to put it in.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.480
The box doesn't do anything
unless you have

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.760
cereal to put in it.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:30.370
That would be like in 8-4b.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:34.360
8-4b would show you
non-substitutable inputs where

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:42.160
basically, given the amount of
one input, it doesn't matter

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.060
how much you have
of the other.

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.810
So for example, if you take
these-- these we often call

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.220
non-substitutable isoquants--

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:53.030
Leontief production functions.

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:57.130
Leontief production function,
for Wassily Leontief, some old

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:59.000
economist.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.180
And basically, the Leontief
production function is that

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:09.520
your production, q equals the
Min of k and l, is the

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.570
Leontief production function.

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:15.130
So given how much k you have,
given you have 10 cereal

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:19.850
boxes, once you have 10 chunks
of cereal, it doesn't matter

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:21.860
if you have 10, 11,
12, 1 million.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.590
You only have 10 cereal boxes.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:28.650
So given an amount of k, then
it doesn't matter how much l

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.970
you have. Once you get to the
amount of l you need to fill

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:33.960
the cereal boxes, it doesn't
matter, and vice versa.

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.270
So basically, they're perfectly
non-substitutable.

00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:40.350
So all that determines your
output is which you

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.460
have the least of.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.660
OK, so substitutabilities
determine the slope of the

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.270
isoquants and of this
production function.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.300
Now in general, we'll be
in between these cases.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.130
There'll be some
substitutability.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.610
Goods won't be perfectly
substitutable, but they'll be

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.060
somewhat substitutable.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.370
So in general, we'll be in
between these cases.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.690
And more generally, just as the
slope of the indifference

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:08.020
curve is the marginal rate of
substitution, the slope of the

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.620
isoquant we will call the
marginal rate of technical

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.060
substitution.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.690
The marginal rate of technical
substitution-- the rate at

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:17.910
which you can substitute one
input for another in a

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:21.500
production function is the
marginal rate of technical

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.750
substitution--

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:35.900
which we'll define as delta k,
delta l for a given q bar, the

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.870
rate at which you can
trade off k for l

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.955
to hold q bar fixed.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.035
Now, as with marginal rate of
substitution, the marginal

00:25:48.035 --> 00:25:49.990
rate of technical substitution
will

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.780
change along the isoquant.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:56.690
So if you go to figure 8-5,
here we've drawn a typical

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.680
isoquant for the production
function q equals square root

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.100
of k times l.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:04.490
So the production function
is q equals the square

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:05.590
root of k times l.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.910
And here's a isoquant.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.580
This is the isoquant
of all combinations

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.335
which produce two units.

00:26:11.335 --> 00:26:15.320
This is the q equals
2 isoquant.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.770
Now, unlike utility--
remember utility?--

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.620
we said where u equals
2 was meaningless.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.980
Utility was an ordinal concept,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.150
not a cardinal concept.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.780
Here, quantity is meaningful.

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.730
If you produce four, you would
have only produced twice as

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.130
much as if you produced two.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:32.300
We can care about both the
ordinality and the cardinality

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.790
of these outcomes.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:37.690
So we can say, what are the
combinations of inputs which

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:38.970
lead you to produce two units?

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.890
What's all these combinations
of inputs?

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.040
So whereas you can have one unit
of labor and four units

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.695
of capital, two of each, or four
units of labor and one

00:26:46.695 --> 00:26:48.420
unit of capital, all
will produce two

00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.640
units of the output.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.560
And what you can see is that the
marginal rate of technical

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.750
substitution varies.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:57.770
So for instance, when we start
with four units of capital and

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.580
one unit of labor, and we think
about adding a second

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:05.040
unit of labor, then the marginal
rate of technical

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.230
substitution is minus 2.

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.290
That is, one unit of labor is
worth two units of capital.

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.020
In other words, we can produce
the same amount of widgets of

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:19.740
q, but if we replace two units
of capital with one unit of

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.490
labor, so at that point we're
very capital-intensive, and

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.790
that unit of labor
is very valuable.

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:31.290
On the other hand, now if you
imagine we're down at 4-1, at

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.650
the third point--

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.050
we are probably using
a, b, c--

00:27:35.050 --> 00:27:37.980
now we're at the third point,
where you have we have four

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:40.680
units of labor and one
unit of capital.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:46.640
Now, if you'd be willing to
give up two units of labor

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.836
just to get one unit of capital,
that's the marginal

00:27:48.836 --> 00:27:52.110
rate of technical substitution
is now minus 1/2.

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:54.330
When you're very
labor-intensive, you'd be

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.550
happy to give up a lot of labor
to get a little capital.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.490
Once again, the principle of
diminishing marginal product,

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.830
just like the principle of
diminishing marginal utility,

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:07.050
implies that the marginal rate
of technical substitution is

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:10.770
going to be falling as you
go down the isoquant.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.920
Just like the marginal rate of
substitution fell as you went

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.460
down the indifference curve, the
marginal rate of technical

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.895
substitution is going to fall
as you go down the isoquant.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.590
And why is this?

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.180
Once again it's because of
this diminishing marginal

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.220
productivity.

00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:32.440
That is, as you add more and
more labor, given capital,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.770
each unit of labor can
do less and less.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.800
And likewise, as you add more
and more capital, given an

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.550
amount of workers to use it,
each unit of capital can do

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.820
less and less.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.750
So it's a very different
approach, but gets you the

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:47.890
same answer, which is with
consumption, each piece does

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:51.010
less and less for you, but we
can see that as consumers.

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:54.000
Here's the notions of labor,
each worker does less and less

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.610
for you, holding
capital fixed.

00:28:55.610 --> 00:28:58.300
And each machine by the same
logic, if you have one guy in

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.620
the hole, it doesn't
matter how many

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:01.010
shovels you throw there.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.770
He still is only one guy.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.860
So each machines is doing less
and less by the same logic.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:08.980
And those diminishing marginal
products lead to this

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.880
decreasing marginal rate of
technical substitution as you

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.130
move along the isoquant.

00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:16.002
That's about the most technical
statement I'll make

00:29:16.002 --> 00:29:17.600
all semester.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.480
OK, questions about that, about
what's going on here?

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.490
That's production theory.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:26.660
That's what you need to know
to know basically how firms

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.210
produce things.

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:31.000
Now, what we're going to do
is, now take this basic

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.910
production theory, and turn it
into actually understanding

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.990
how firms make decisions
on how much to produce.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:40.990
But before we do that, I want
to talk about one other

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:45.340
concept, which is very important
for thinking about

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:46.790
production theory.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:48.990
And it comes back to these
assumptions that we make which

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.480
might be a little bit
unrealistic, which is the

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:54.330
concept of returns to scale.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.575
The concept of returns
to scale.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:10.220
So here the question is, what
happens if we increase all

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:12.300
inputs proportionally?

00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:13.740
Return to scale.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.870
By scale, I mean, what if we
just double everything, twice

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:19.400
as much labor and twice
as much capital.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.660
That's an increase in scale,
increasing all inputs

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:25.530
proportionally, twice as much
labor, twice as much capital,

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.660
half as much labor, half
as much capital.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:32.160
So a change in scale is an equal
increase or decrease in

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.060
all inputs?

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.300
Equal proportional.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:41.390
So what happens if we increase
all inputs, increase or

00:30:41.390 --> 00:30:45.600
decrease proportionally?

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.960
And this is an interesting case,
because it's like, OK,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.890
what if we just make the
firm half as big?

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:51.140
What happens?

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:55.530
Well, the answer is,
it depends on

00:30:55.530 --> 00:30:57.490
the production process.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:02.660
Some production processes will
exhibit what we call constant

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.970
returns to scale.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:06.390
This is a convenient form.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:08.550
It's convenient because the way
constant returns to scale

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:16.930
works is, it says that f of
2l, 2k, is equal to 2

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:21.050
times f of l, k.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:24.060
That is, if it's constant, you
can just pull the 2 out.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.920
Doubling the inputs leads to
doubling the outputs, which

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.510
equals to 2q, I'll write here.

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:33.510
Doubling the inputs equals
doubling the outputs.

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:36.700
So if I have twice as much labor
and capital, that's the

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.980
same as twice producing what I
had with the original labor

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.970
and capital which will get me
twice the original production.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.940
That's the constant
returns to scale.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.400
So every time I double my firm,
I get exactly twice as

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.140
much stuff out.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.030
We can contrast that with
increasing returns to scale,

00:31:54.030 --> 00:32:01.530
IRS, which says that f of 2l,
2k, is greater than 2

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:05.380
times f of l, k.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.620
Or it's greater than 2q.

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.400
That is, when I double my firm,
I produce more than

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.580
twice as much stuff.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.240
That'd be increasing
returns to scale.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:20.000
On the other hand, we could also
have decreasing returns

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.420
to scale, which not surprisingly
means that f of

00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:31.970
2l, 2k, is less than 2 times
f of l, k, or less than 2q.

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:37.620
That would be decreasing returns
to scale, which is

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:42.010
when I double my firm I get less
than twice as much stuff.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:47.345
Can anyone give me an example or
some reason why returns to

00:32:47.345 --> 00:32:50.340
scale is going to be increasing
or decreasing?

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.910
Think about firms out there.

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:54.090
Give me some that, by returns to
scale, would be increasing

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:56.360
or decreasing, any examples
you can think of.

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.260
There's no right answer here.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.320
Yeah.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:58.780
Go ahead, on the end.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:02.372
AUDIENCE: Oh, if you're mining
something, you can only get to

00:33:02.372 --> 00:33:05.007
stuff at one time, so having
more equipment and more people

00:33:05.007 --> 00:33:07.390
doesn't mean you can
get more out of it?

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.590
PROFESSOR: Right, so if there's
a limited resource,

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:11.150
you could imagine decreasing
returns to scale.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:11.320
Good.

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:12.250
What else?

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:12.982
Yeah.

00:33:12.982 --> 00:33:15.184
AUDIENCE: If the company gets
harder to manage, that could

00:33:15.184 --> 00:33:17.710
be decreasing returns
to scale?

00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:19.440
PROFESSOR: Right, exactly.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.760
If you're an entrepreneur,
you've got a great idea, but

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.460
it turns out that idea only
works if you really are

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.520
hands-on about it.

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.640
You're not Mark Zuckerberg, who
can just farm the thing

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:29.830
out, it's really your idea.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:30.730
And you've got to be there.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:32.500
Then after it expands and
you lose control of the

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.900
production, it might not be as
effective because you're not

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.850
there making it happen.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:37.900
Any ideas why return--

00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:38.730
Yeah.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:40.170
AUDIENCE: If you or
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.050
PROFESSOR: So that's
an example of

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:47.490
increasing returns to scale.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.820
Increasing returns to scale
would be, gee, maybe if I'm

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:55.760
bigger, I can get a better
deal on the inputs.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.570
But that's not quite right,
because we haven't really got

00:33:58.570 --> 00:33:59.650
into prices yet.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.280
I'm looking-- that's really
a market response--

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.370
I'm looking for a more
technological story, a

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:04.810
technological story of
increasing returns.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:05.390
Go ahead.

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.115
AUDIENCE: If you're bigger, you
can hire a specialist to

00:34:07.115 --> 00:34:11.310
do work, like a manager
who can [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.810
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.290
So it's the opposite, which is,
let's say you have an idea

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.840
which is pretty good, but
in fact it's replicable.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:21.560
And right now, you're trying
to manage some guys.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.239
And then all of a sudden, when
you get twice as big, you

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:26.050
bring other people in who can
effectively replicate your

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.929
idea, and really expand it
in a very effective way.

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:32.370
You can have increasing
returns to scale.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.850
Now, so an example of what that
looks like, if you go to

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:42.070
the last page in the handout,
figure 8-6a shows constant

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.340
returns to scale.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.020
So let's start with
8-6a, that's

00:34:45.020 --> 00:34:46.429
constant returns to scale.

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:49.190
So here-- and these are
from the textbook--

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:52.830
for example, when we doubled the
inputs from 100 labor, 100

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.480
capital, to 200 labor, 200
capital, you doubled output.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.480
Those are constant returns
to scale isoquants.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.300
The last page shows
decreasing and

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.010
increasing returns to scale.

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:05.670
So for instance, tobacco is an
example of decreasing returns

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:09.710
to scale, because there's only
so much leaf that you have

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:11.820
that you can produce.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:15.260
So here, when you double the
inputs from 100 to 200, your

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.930
output only goes from
100 to 142.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:20.950
OK, and if you want to double
the 200 units, you've got to

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.320
go way the heck up
there on inputs.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:26.310
On the other hand, primary metal
production is something

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:28.550
where you can have increasing
returns to scale, because

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:32.460
there's such high costs of
building a plant that once

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:36.860
it's built, so just like I said,
gee, in fact that second

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.170
digger of the hole might
actually make it more

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:38.770
productive.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.700
Once that plant's built, there's
one worker banging

00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:43.790
around the plant, a second
worker adds a huge amount to

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:45.740
productivity because they
can specialize.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.400
Basically, increasing returns to
scale is going to come from

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.900
specialization.

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:51.380
So if you build this big plant
to build primary, to build

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:54.630
steel, one worker in that plant
is no good, because he's

00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:55.960
got to pour the steel,
then run over and

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.080
cool it down, et cetera.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.168
Once you have two, they can
specialize, and three, they

00:35:59.168 --> 00:36:00.470
can specialize more.

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:01.840
You might think of something
like that would have

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.310
increasing returns to scale
through specialization.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:08.040
And that's illustrated here,
where doubling the inputs

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:10.410
actually leads to more than
doubling the output.

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:12.300
Now we're going to talk
about all these cases.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.140
Typically, economists are
suspicious of increasing

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.350
returns to scale.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:20.400
Anybody, anybody who ever has an
IPO, whoever starts a firm

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.230
will always tell you
that they have

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.530
increasing returns to scale.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.750
Well, we say, I've got a great
idea and the bigger, the more,

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.420
the better it's going to be.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.680
And they're generally wrong.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.920
Generally, we think of
increasing returns to scale as

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.510
being like a free lunch.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.855
And we don't like free lunches,
we economists.

00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:36.640
We think, gee, if it's really
increasing returns to scale,

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.400
you would have already
expanded there.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.332
OK, if it's really such a good
idea to get bigger, why aren't

00:36:40.332 --> 00:36:42.470
you bigger already?

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:43.470
Now, it doesn't mean you can--

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.720
Yeah.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:44.930
AUDIENCE: Well, they
need capital.

00:36:44.930 --> 00:36:46.480
PROFESSOR: Well, they need
capital, and so that would be

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:46.980
their argument.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.620
And that's great.

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:48.910
And typically, they're wrong.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:51.010
But that would be why you would
argue that they need

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:51.990
capital to get bigger.

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.170
So typically, we like decreasing
returns to scale.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:55.590
That's going to be our
sort of default

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.520
assumption of the world.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.560
In other words, here's a way to
think about it, think about

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.255
we're dealing with mature firms.
We're modeling, for

00:37:03.255 --> 00:37:04.070
instance, mature firms.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.680
We think that for mature firms,
at least, there's not

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.470
increasing returns to scale,
because in a mature firm they

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.410
would have hit that
point already.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.640
Now they're on the
decreasing part.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:13.360
So that's where we're
going to focus for

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:14.370
the rest of the semester.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:16.090
OK, let me stop there.

00:37:16.090 --> 00:37:18.120
And good luck tomorrow night.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.350
And we'll come back
to talk more about

00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:20.600
production on Wednesday.

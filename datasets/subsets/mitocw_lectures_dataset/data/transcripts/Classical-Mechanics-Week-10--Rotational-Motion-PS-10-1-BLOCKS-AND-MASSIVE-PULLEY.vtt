DR. PETER DOURMASHKIN:
I would like

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.790
to now analyze the motion
of a system of particles

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.820
that has both translational
and rotational motion.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.760
So I'm going to
consider a pulley,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.550
and the pulley has
radius R. And there

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:22.960
is a string wrapped around THE
pulley and a block of object 1

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.050
that's on a plane, and
another block of object 2.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.720
And as object 2 falls
down, the pulley

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.780
rotates and object 1
moves to the right.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.980
And there's a coefficient
of friction between block

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.790
1 and the surface.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.030
Now, in order to analyze this
problem, I'm going to apply,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.400
for the pulley, our
torque equals I cm alpha,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.300
and for each of the
blocks, I'll apply

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.780
F1 equals m1 a1 and
F2 equals m2 a2.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.670
But the important
thing to realize

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.520
is that these three
quantities, the acceleration

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.920
of block 1, the
acceleration of block 2,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.140
and the angular
acceleration of the pulley,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.140
are constrained because
this string is not

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.540
slipping around the pulley.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.700
And so let's begin to
analyze this type of problem.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.270
So we'll start with
the torque principle.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.240
Now, what's crucial in
all of these problems

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.940
is that we're relating
two different quantities,

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.140
vectors on both sides.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.620
The physics quantities
have definite direction,

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.860
and our alpha a1
and a2 as vectors

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.200
are determined by our
choice of coordinates.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.500
So what I'd like to do is
draw a coordinate system,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.370
a rotational coordinate system.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.810
Now, the way I'll do it is
I'll draw an angle theta.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.410
And now I have to draw
a right-hand move,

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.480
so my angle theta will
look as though it's going

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.550
into the plane of the figure.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.160
And so I write cross
n hat right-hand move,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.490
and I'm going to just to
define that to be k hat.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.770
Now, what that allows me to
do, when I write my point

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.030
s here will be cm.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.570
So I'm going to calculate
this about the center of mass,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.370
and I get I cm alpha.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.070
As soon as I draw the
coordinate system, then

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:26.210
this side becomes the
vector alpha z k hat,

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:34.660
where alpha z is the z component
of the angular acceleration.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.490
And technically, the
reason this angle

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.150
is there is because this
is the second derivative

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.590
of that angle.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.910
And that's well-defined now.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.470
So the next step is
to define the force,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.560
to do what we call
a torque diagram.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.630
So this is my rotational
coordinate system.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.090
The next step is to
construct a torque diagram,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.780
and the way we do that
is we draw the object.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.120
We indicate our rotational
coordinate system.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.980
I don't have to put
the theta anymore.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.700
Now, here's a subtle point.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.750
I'm going to draw
the rope that is

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.510
connected to the pulley
as part of my system.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.030
This is the part where
the tension here, I'll

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.550
call that T2, and over here,
this is the tension T1.

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.180
Now, on the pulley, there
is a gravitational force,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.800
and there's some pivot
force on this pulley.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:50.320
And now what I want to consider
is the torque about the Cm.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.620
Now, the pivot force, f pivot,
and the gravitational force,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.410
produce no torque
about the pivot,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.740
so I'm just going to eliminate
those for the moment,

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:09.070
and just focus on the
torque due to T1 and T2.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.480
So I draw my vector Rs
T1 and my vector Rs T2.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.269
So this is what a torque
diagram consists of.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.290
Let's summarize it.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.110
It's our system,
the relevant forces

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.350
that are producing torque,
vectors from the point we're

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.550
calculating the torque.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.950
Our S is the center of mass.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.740
And the vector from where
we're calculating the torque

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.300
to where the force is acting.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.830
And now, when we calculate
the cross-product of Rs and T,

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.400
we put these two
vectors tail to tail,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.820
and notice that this
vector is giving us

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.240
a torque out of the board,
our positive direction

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.310
is into the board,
so over here we

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.510
have minus T1 R.
Whereas T2, when

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:04.300
we put these two vectors, Rs T2,
and we calculate that torque,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.750
that torque is into
the board, which

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.390
is our positive direction,
and so that's plus T2 R2.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.830
And now in our torque principle,
we set these two sides equal,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:25.810
and we have minus T1 R plus
T2 R equals Icm alpha z.

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.820
Now, this is our
first equation, but it

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.840
requires some type of thought.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.510
For the first thing, we
see that the tension T2

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:39.490
is equal to Icm over
R alpha z plus T1.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.010
So the tensions on the
side are not equal.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.390
Now, when we studied pulleys
earlier in the semester,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.020
we imposed a condition that the
pulley was frictionless, which

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.290
meant that the rope was
sliding along the pulley,

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.920
and there was no
rotation in the pulley,

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.000
so there was no
contribution to alpha.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.180
And in that case, T2
would be equal to T2.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.330
We also could make a
slightly different statement.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.180
We could say suppose
the mass of the pulley

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.090
was very, very small, an
extremely light pulley,

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.850
then Icm would be 0, and
again, T2 would be equal to T1.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.390
So when we were dealing
with either massless pulleys

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.260
or ropes that were slipping
frictionlessly along a pulley,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.870
the tension on both
sides was equal.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.660
Now, something
different is happening.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.700
We need to apply a greater
torque here than T1

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:39.980
because there is
rotational inertia.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.650
We're causing the
pulley to accelerate.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:46.600
So this torque from T2 has to be
bigger than the torque from T1,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.860
and therefore T2
is bigger than T1,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.990
so that is a very important way
to apply the torque principle.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:59.770
When T2 is bigger than T1,
alpha will be positive,

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.200
and a positive
angular acceleration

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.020
is giving a rotation in which
our angle theta is not only

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.900
increasing, but its second
derivative is positive.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.360
So that's crucial for beginning
the analysis of this problem.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.620
The next step is to
analyze Newton's second law

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.070
on both objects, M1 and M2.

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:23.560
So I'll save our
result here, I'll

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:28.180
erase what we don't need, and
then continue the analysis.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.280
So returning to our
analysis of a pulley

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.070
with two masses
and a string that's

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.110
not slipping around
the pulley, I now

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.520
want to begin analysis of
F equals Ma on object 1.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.200
So as usual, I draw object 1.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.900
I'll choose i hat 1 to
point in the direction

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.840
because I know it's
going to go that way

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.500
so my component of
acceleration will be positive.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:54.820
In my force diagrams, I have a
normal force, I have gravity.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.680
The string is pulling T1,
that's the same tension

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.400
at the end of the string.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.520
The tension in the
string is not changing.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.200
We're assuming it's
a massless string.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.790
And I have a friction
force on object 1,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:10.570
which is kinetic friction.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.900
And now I can write
down Newton's second law

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.790
in the horizontal direction.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.020
I could also call j hat 1
up, and my two equations

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:24.770
for Newton's second law
are T1 minus Fk is M1 A1,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.640
and N1 minus M1 g is zero.

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:34.110
Now, I also know that
the kinetic friction, Fk,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:37.830
is the coefficient of
friction mu times N1.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:43.730
So my next equation for
F equals M A on object T1

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:50.370
is T1 minus mu N1 equals M1 A1.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.190
Now I have to apply
the same analysis to 2.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:56.310
Notice I'm not drawing my
force diagram on my sketch.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.040
I do a separate
force diagram on 2.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.860
So here's 2.

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.990
I have tension T2
and gravity M2g.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.580
Now, even though I chose
a unit vector up here,

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.000
this choice of unit vectors is
completely independent of how

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.130
I choose unit vectors for 2.

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.050
Because object is
moving down, I would

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.780
prefer to choose j hat 2 down.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.180
My acceleration for this
object will be positive.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.540
And then when I apply
f equals MA object 2,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:31.800
I get M2g minus T2 equals M2 A2.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:39.812
So that's now my third equation,
that M2g minus T2 equals M2 A2.

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:40.770
And now I look at this.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.980
System of equations.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.430
And what are my unknowns?

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.810
T1, T2, alpha, A1, A2.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:50.640
Five unknowns.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.620
I'm treating properties of the
system, the radius mu, Icm,

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.490
actually the N1,
because it's in M1g,

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:05.850
I can simplify this
equation and replace this

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:12.930
with M1g, where
I'm already using

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:14.370
the other Newton's second law.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:18.670
So I have three equations
and five unknowns.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.790
I cannot solve this system.

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.990
But in all of these problems,
there's constraint conditions.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:28.020
There's constraints between
how the masses are moving

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.160
and how the angular
acceleration pulley

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.120
is related to the linear
acceleration of the masses.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.060
Let's consider mass 1 and 2.

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.940
They're attached by a string.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.070
As mass 2 goes down,
mass 1 goes to the right.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.040
The string is not
stretching, so they're

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.030
moving at the same rate, so
they have the same acceleration.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:55.910
So my first constraint
is that A1 equals A2.

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:58.250
Now in general, I
have to be careful.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.630
Plus or minus.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.590
Why is it a plus sign and
not a minus sign here?

00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:08.510
It's a plus sign because I've
chosen i hat to the right

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.000
and I've chosen j hat downwards.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.630
If I'd chosen them differently,
that sign could have varied.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.730
Now, let's focus
on the relationship

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.750
between the angular acceleration
of the pulley and M2.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:23.070
Think about the strength.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.940
Here we're on a
point on the rim.

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:31.580
This is a distance R, and
the pulley and the string

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.060
are moving together.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.940
So there's a
tangential acceleration

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:38.330
of the pulley
equal to R alpha Z.

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:46.190
This is the tangential
acceleration of pulley

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.020
and string.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:53.300
But the same string has a linear
acceleration, either A1 or A2.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.850
So this has to be
equal to A2, this

00:11:55.850 --> 00:12:00.190
is the linear acceleration
of the string.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:03.050
And so that's our
last constraint, five,

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:07.820
that A1 equals R alpha.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:12.050
And now I have a system of five
equations and five unknowns.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.920
And the question is, how
can I find the acceleration?

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.580
So in general, when opposed
to a system like that,

00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.260
I want to have some strategy.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:28.840
Let's make a little space
to clear for our algebra.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:34.700
OK, now, I look at this
system, and I say to myself,

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:37.490
which equation do I want
to use as a background?

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:41.570
My target is to find A1.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.550
A1 is equal to A2.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:49.160
Now, when I look at these
equations, T1 depends on A1,

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.510
T2 depends on A2,
which is equal to A1,

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.260
and alpha is also related to A1.

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:01.490
So I can use this
equation 1 as my backbone,

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:07.850
and substitute in T1, T2,
and alpha into that equation.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.590
And now let's do that.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.870
So when I solve
this equation for T1

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:15.380
equal to M1 A1 plus mu
M1g with the minus sign,

00:13:15.380 --> 00:13:24.680
I get minus M1 A1 plus mu M1g
times R, that's my first piece.

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:30.260
I solve for T2, which
is M2g minus M2 A,

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:34.180
so I get M2g minus M2.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:38.540
Now, A2 is equal to A1, so I
make my second substitution,

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:42.040
multiply it by R, and
that's equal to Icm.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.390
And now I make my
final substitution,

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:50.060
that alpha z is
equal to A1 over R.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:56.180
So if I now can collect
terms, minus, minus over here,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.060
but there's an R
there, an R there, I'll

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.930
divide through by R, and
bring my A1 terms over

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:11.770
to the other side, and I'm
left with minus mu M1g plus M2g

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:17.570
equals Icm over R squared that
has the dimensions of mass,

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.395
because moment of inertia,
M R squared divided by R

00:14:20.395 --> 00:14:27.770
squared, plus M1 A1 plus M2 A1.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.550
And finally, as a
conclusion, I now

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:34.790
can solve for the
acceleration of my system

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:37.220
in terms of all of
these quantities.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.640
And let's just put it all the
way down here at the bottom

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:51.500
that A1 equals M2g minus
mu M1g over Icm R squared

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:55.100
plus M1 plus M2.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.680
Often, in types of problems
like these when there's

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.630
a lot of signers, you might end
up with a minus or a minus sign

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:05.780
down here, and if you looked
at that, that would imply that

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.862
with the right choice of
parameters, this could be zero

00:15:08.862 --> 00:15:10.570
and that would be an
impossible solution.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.250
So that's always a sign that
there could be something wrong.

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.790
The other thing we want to
check is, when does it actually

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:17.480
accelerate?

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.040
We have a condition.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.400
So we can conclude
that if M2g is bigger

00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:30.890
than Mu M1g then 2 will
start to go downwards.

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.770
If M2g were less than
M1g, then the problem

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.580
would be very different, because
two would not go downwards.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.700
The friction would not be
kinetic, but would be static.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.960
And that would vary, depending
on how much weight were here.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:50.060
So if you went from 0 to
mu M1g, the static friction

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.380
would depend on how much
weight that's there.

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:57.620
So here is a full analysis of
rotational and translational

00:15:57.620 --> 00:15:58.700
motion.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.490
Takes a little bit of time
and a little bit of care,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:03.920
but we've done it.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.710
PROFESSOR: Today we're
going to continue

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.180
discussing firm behavior.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.830
But today we're going to deviate
from our fantasy land

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.580
of 14.01 to come to the real
world a little bit which is to

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.840
talk a bit about whether firms
actually maximize profits.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.190
The whole presumption of
producer theory is just as we

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.130
think with consumer theory,
consumers maximize utility.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.570
Except producers maximize
profits.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.190
That turns out to be an
incredibly useful shorthand

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.780
for lots of things.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.470
And it will turn out to be,
as with any simplifying

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.519
assumption, largely right and
largely will help us draw a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.320
lot of interesting conclusions
about firms and markets.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.550
Nonetheless, it's clearly
not right in

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.110
reality for every firm.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.240
For example, we see lots of
firms doing things which look

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.940
pretty wasteful like big
corporate jets or

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.760
other things like that.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.780
More relevantly, huge pay for
CEOs seems pretty wasteful.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.920
So, for example, on 2004 the net
income of Eli Lilly, the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.800
drug manufacturer,
fell by 29%.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.940
Yet the CEO got a 41% raise to
to $12.5 million a year.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.040
Or even more so in the financial
crisis, in 2009,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.285
Citigroup and Merrill each lost
more than $27 billion.

00:01:45.285 --> 00:01:46.830
It's a pretty bad year
for the financial

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.390
sector, you might think.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.290
And yet their CEO's pay in each
company rose by more than

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.650
10% to about $15 million.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.380
So in the worst year for the
financial system since 1929,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.350
the CEO pay increased in
these two companies.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.610
So you might think that this
sounds kind of off.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.630
How could we explain that?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.789
Well, there's two possible
explanations.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.990
So one explanation is that
things which look wasteful

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.280
really aren't.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.510
That is that we pay CEOs a
huge amount of money, but

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.070
they're worth it.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.450
So, for example, even at his
ultimate salary of $33 million

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.600
per year, Michael Jordan
was vastly underpaid.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.920
By any reasonable economic
analysis of the value he added

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.410
to the Chicago Bulls, it was
well in excess of $50 million.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.380
So even though he was
paid $33 million,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.020
Michael Jordan was underpaid.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.860
Similarly, just because someone
gets paid a lot of

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.830
money, doesn't mean that
they're overpaid.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.840
These CEOs are very
talented people.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.090
They may be underpaid.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.750
Now this is an argument you
might have made with a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.930
somewhat straight face maybe
10 or 15 years ago.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.890
It's hard to make that with
a straight face now.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.150
It's hard to believe that these
CEOs of these companies

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.500
aren't overpaid given their
company performance and even

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.340
the kind of facts we
just talked about.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.150
So a better explanation for
things like excessive CEO pay

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.340
is something which we call
the agency problem.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.520
And that's what I want to
emphasize in today's lecture.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.000
In reality, we think of a firm
as something where there's a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.710
guy who's an owner.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.340
He hires some machines
and some workers.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.110
They make stuff that he thought
of, and you produce

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.270
it, and some profit is made.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.110
So the model we have in mind
when we talked about the firms

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.720
so far in this course is the
model of what we might call a

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.890
sole proprietorship
or a partnership.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.830
It's a model where one
individual, where there's

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.640
basically a commonality.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.370
The key thing that we've
discussed so far is a

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.240
commonality of interest between
the owners who own the

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.740
company and the control
of production.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.710
So the people who earn the money
from the company also

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.210
control the production.

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.310
So when you start your start-ups
when you graduate,

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.370
you will start them as a sole
proprietorship or a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.870
partnership where you own the
company, and you control

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.410
what's done.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.815
You're there 18 hours a day
making sure the guys are doing

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:16.570
what they're supposed to do.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.110
And you're who gets the money
if they succeed or lose the

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.070
money if they fail.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.120
And that's the model we've had
in mind as we've thought about

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.610
corporations or firms
so far in our class.

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.230
But, in fact, most production
in the US

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.260
doesn't happen that way.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.450
Most production in the US
happens through the guise of

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.700
corporations.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.790
Corporations are marked
by a separation of

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.600
ownership and control.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.140
What defines a corporation
is a separation of

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.240
ownership and control.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.800
The owners of corporations are
the stockholders or what we

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.350
call the equity holders, people
who have invested money

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.850
in the corporation.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:05.930
So the owners of the corporation
are its investors,

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.380
its stockholders, its
equity holders.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.460
All of you, most of you,
probably somewhere--

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.050
if you're Jewish, it's in some
Bar Mitzvah gift you got, if

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.250
you're not, it's in some other
gift you got-- probably have

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.570
some equity ownership in
something somewhere.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.230
OK.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.360
You maybe have a little bond
which says you own five shares

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.830
of GM that someone gave you,
because they thought it'd be

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.420
cute or whatever.

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:29.260
That's now worthless, but maybe
some other company.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.590
We're equity holders.

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.420
We invest in companies.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.110
But we don't make the
production decision.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.670
The production decision is made
by the firm's managers

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:47.230
who are employees of the owners,
the equity holders.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.910
Now these managers may
have some ownership.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.430
And we'll talk about that
in a little bit.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.090
But, by and large, the primary
ownership of the firm is done

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.370
by people who do not control
the everyday decisions of

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.990
production.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.260
And it sort of makes sense
it has to be that way.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.830
When a company's as big
as Microsoft, you

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.190
couldn't have me.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.570
Somewhere, I'm sure if you add
up my various stock funds I

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:12.830
own, I own 0.000000000001%
of Microsoft.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.500
It'd be crazy to have
me involved with a

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.800
0.000000000001% of the
decision making.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.620
I don't know anything about
anything that Microsoft does.

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.640
It makes sense that there's a
separation of ownership and

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.330
control once companies
get big enough.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:29.240
But the fact that there is a
separation of ownership and

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.630
control can lead to this agency
problem and can lead to

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.690
firms not maximizing profits.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:42.220
So, basically, the point is that
managers care not just

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.320
about the profits they
make but also how

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.310
happy their life is.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:49.220
And things which make their life
happy may be things which

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.530
aren't profit maximizing.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.850
The managers who are in charge
of production may have their

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.410
own agenda that deviates from
profit maximization.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.630
And the problem is it may be
hard to figure that out if

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.950
you're the owner of the firm.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:08.200
So the agency problem is the
first example of a problem

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.090
we'll talk about later in the
semester of imperfect

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:12.680
information.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.610
This is the first time we'll
see imperfect information.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:22.160
We've assumed in our class so
far, and we'll assume in our

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.780
class going forward that there's
perfect information

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.380
the world, that everyone knows
what stuff costs, that

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.540
everyone can shop costlessly
across providers, et cetera.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.800
But, in fact, the world
is marked by imperfect

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.780
information.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.070
As an owner of Microsoft, as a
trivial owner of Microsoft, I

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.960
don't know for sure that every
Microsoft employee is doing

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.630
what's profit maximizing
for the company.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.150
I can't.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:46.650
It's just impossible
for me to own that.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:49.050
So that creates an
agency problem.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.340
And the agency problem arises
because it's in the employees'

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:53.970
interest, perhaps, to do things
which aren't profit

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.590
maximizing.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.130
So so as a simple example,
imagine that you're an

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.120
investor in the company that's
a medium-sized company.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.910
And the head of that company is
jealous because all of his

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.840
friends at bigger companies have
their own jets, and he's

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.610
got to fly commercial.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:12.375
He says, I want my own jet,
because I'm not cool enough.

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:16.370
There's this great episode of
the Simpsons where Burns goes

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.940
to the billionaires club.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.130
And he's in the billionaires
club.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:21.136
And then eventually his wealth
drops so low he gets thrown

00:08:21.136 --> 00:08:23.020
into the millionaires club, and
it's these yokels in the

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.580
millionaires club.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.970
He's like, I want to be back
in the billionaires club.

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.980
The point is managers of
companies care about how they

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.300
look and who they
hang out with.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.090
And you've got this manager of
a medium-sized company who

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:33.909
wants his own private jet.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.820
But he knows that that's
not profit maximizing.

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.460
Because he knows that if he
figures out his travel, and

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.905
prices it out at competitive
prices, it'll be cheaper to

00:08:41.905 --> 00:08:43.270
just travel commercial.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:43.900
So what does he do?

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.270
He puts together a glossy
PowerPoint which he presents

00:08:48.270 --> 00:08:51.060
to you, the owner of the
company, showing that

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.780
financially it would be more
prudent to own a jet than to

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.005
fly commercial.

00:08:56.005 --> 00:08:58.186
What he doesn't point out and
put into that PowerPoint is

00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:00.270
that in putting together the
commercial prices he used, he

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.820
chose the highest rates from
flying from point A to point

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.990
B, not the lowest rates.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.656
Now, unless you're an expert
on the cost of flying from

00:09:06.656 --> 00:09:08.010
point A to point B, you
won't know that.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.110
You'll say, well, that's
a pretty impressive

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:09.650
presentation.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.640
Yes, you can show you've saved
20% by having your own plane.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.630
Go get it.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.640
But it turned out he
didn't save 20%.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.050
He just cooked the numbers in
a way to make his life nicer

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.300
even if it wasn't profit
maximizing.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.170
And that's an example of the
kind of problem that arises

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.420
with imperfect information.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.070
And I could go through examples
all the time.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.470
But I think you guys probably
all understand what I'm

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.930
talking about, which is there's
lots of ways employees

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.290
of companies might make their
lives nicer that aren't profit

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.300
maximizing.

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:39.450
Now, corporations have
recognized this from time

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.010
immemorial.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.080
And they've recognized that
their owners are too diffuse

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.730
to monitor this.

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:46.350
So what corporations do
is they have set up an

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:52.430
intermediary between the owners
and the producers

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:53.680
called the board of directors.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.570
The board of directors is a set
of individuals appointed

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.320
by the owners that are supposed
to actually pay

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.040
attention to what's going
on in production.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.470
The owners say, look, we can't
afford to pay attention.

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.350
But we're going to appoint you,
the board of directors,

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.510
and we're going to pay you
quite a lot of money.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:15.460
A typical director on the
Fortune 500 company will make

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.770
$100,000 plus a year.

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.330
It's a part-time job.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:22.120
We appointed you to keep
an eye on the tools of

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:22.850
production.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.470
The problem is the board
of directors aren't

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.180
that good at it either.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.880
Because it turns out to be
really hard to figure out

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:30.600
exactly what's going on.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.240
And this is made worse, because
the members of the

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.560
board of directors are often
chosen by management of the

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:37.900
company, by the people
running the

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:39.650
production, not by the owners.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.190
So they'll make selections of
who's going to be on the board

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.720
of directors.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.885
And they'll pack it with
their friends who

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:45.040
will be nice to them.

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:49.010
So, for example, Richard Grasso
was the CEO of the New

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.610
York Stock Exchange.

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:53.320
He started out in the mail
room, worked his way up.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.290
He became CEO of the New York
Stock Exchange and retired

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.120
with $187 million severance
package which was outrageous

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.520
and totally unearned.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.570
But the board of directors were
a bunch of his buddies

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:05.070
who'd known him since
he was a kid.

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.250
And they said, he seems
like a nice guy.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.300
Let's give him a
bunch of money.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.810
And a lot of the board of
directors, when actually

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.780
grilled on it, didn't actually
know he'd gotten that much.

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:12.200
They were like, wow.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.340
We didn't realize
his retirement

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:14.860
package was that big.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.610
So it turns out having the board
of directors does not

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.040
solve the agency problem.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.710
Because there's still too much
of an information imperfection

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.450
between the managers and the
board of directors, not to

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:27.150
mention the managers
and the owners.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:28.170
So what do we do?

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.240
What do we do with this
agency problem?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.110
Well, this was known
for a lot of years.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:37.120
And about 25 years ago, the
thinking was, look, the way to

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.780
solve this problem is we need to
align the incentives of the

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.365
managers and the owners.

00:11:43.365 --> 00:11:45.270
If we're going to solve this
problem, we need to get the

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.480
managers, the producers, to
actually care about maximizing

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.440
profits enough that they'll do
that even if it makes their

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.300
life a little uncomfortable.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:53.460
And how do we do that?

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.190
We turn the managers
into owners.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.150
We give the managers, the
producers, an ownership stake

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.410
in the company.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:05.670
We say look, your income is
going to be directly derived

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.620
from the profitability
of this company.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.100
So now you'll have a direct
incentive to do what's profit

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.470
maximizing even if it makes
your life a little

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.500
uncomfortable.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.596
Even if it means flying
commercial, you recognize if I

00:12:17.596 --> 00:12:19.530
have my own jet, then
I'm going to suffer.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.050
So you align the incentives.

00:12:21.050 --> 00:12:22.540
So we want to give
them an ownership

00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.270
stake in the company.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.820
Well, how do you do that?

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.360
How do you give managers
an ownership stake?

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.110
Well, there's two ways
you can do it.

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:31.460
One way is you can directly
give them stock.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.840
So you can directly say, look,
instead of paying you in cash,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.630
we are going to pay you
in company stock.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:42.940
So your fortunes will directly
be tied to the performance of

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.180
this company if you
pay them in stock.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:49.730
Or, alternatively, you can do
something which turns out to

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:50.790
be cheaper.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.200
You can give them
stock options.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.940
It turns out to be cheaper,
at least, in principle.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.540
We can give them
stock options.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:58.350
So let's talk about what
a stock option is.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.840
And some of you may deal with
these along the way.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.210
A stock is a piece of paper
which says you only 0.00001%

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:07.660
of the company.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.730
A stock option is simply a piece
of paper which says we

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:15.610
are granting you the right to
buy the stock at some price.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:18.180
Typically, it's today's price.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.550
We're not giving you a
share of the company.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.270
You have a piece of paper which
says if the value of

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.900
stock today is $100, you have a
piece of paper which says no

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:25.400
matter where the stock
ends up, you can

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.540
always buy it for $100.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.860
Why is that valuable?

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.020
Well, that's valuable because
let's say you give a CEO of a

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.630
company a million options at
$100 each when the price of

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.240
the stock is $100.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.690
Well, if the price of the stock
rises to $150, that CEO

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:45.290
can then take his million
options, say, I want to buy

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.400
the shares for 100, which I'm
allowed to by these pieces of

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.800
paper, and I'll turn around
and sell them for $150.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.250
I've just made $50 million.

00:13:52.250 --> 00:13:55.110
So a stock option is valuable
if the stock goes up.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.180
But it's worthless if
the stock goes down.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.980
So it's kind of the ultimate
incentive, if

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.440
you think about it.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.890
Because what it says to the CEO
is, look, we're going to

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.240
incent you to do better.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.190
And you make a lot of money
by doing better.

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:09.860
But if you do worse, you're
not going to get anything.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.200
And as myself as the owner
it seems great,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.380
because it's cheaper.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.850
Because if the stock goes up,
I share some with the guy.

00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:17.500
But I don't care.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:17.860
I'm happy.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.850
The stock goes up.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:20.880
If it goes down, I don't have
to give him anything.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.940
And, in fact, giving someone
a stock option costs,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.060
effectively, about half as much
as giving them stock.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:30.350
So if I say today's stock price,
if I instead of giving

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.170
you a share of stock, I give you
an option to buy a share

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.520
of stock at today's price, the
value to that, what it costs

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.930
me in the market is about half
of what it costs when I

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.670
actually give you the
share of stock.

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:40.210
So it seems like
the best deal.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.700
You get all the incentives for
them to raise the price, but

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.240
it costs you half as much.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.330
And, in fact, there's been
tremendous growth in use of

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:49.890
stock and stock options.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:55.810
So if you look at Figure 12-1,
now, this sort of changes.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:59.610
Before 1992, there's only
two categories.

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:01.250
And after '92, there's three.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:06.750
So before '92, we just have to
divide into salary and bonus

00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.170
versus options.

00:15:08.170 --> 00:15:11.970
So you see there was essentially
no options in '84.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.690
This is the mean CEO pay.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.970
So the typical CEO in 1984 made
$500,000, and it was all

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:19.220
cash, all salary and bonus.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.585
By 1992, they made about $1
million, and a decent share of

00:15:23.585 --> 00:15:25.520
it started to be
stock options.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.000
Now, starting after '92, we
actually break into three

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.070
categories which is salary,
bonus, and options.

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.380
But that doesn't
really matter.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.560
The main thing is to pay
attention to the option share,

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.590
which you see grew
astronomically.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:41.000
And so by its peak, in about
2002, first of all, the

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.070
typical CEO was making
$3.5 million.

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:50.360
Second of all, the majority of
that was in stock options.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.840
In fact, if you look at salary
and bonus, it didn't grow that

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.370
much over time.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:59.660
If you look at 1992 versus 2002,
over that decade, salary

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.650
and bonus barely grew, but
options went through the roof.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.660
So there's a huge increase
in use of these.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.910
And the motivation is pretty
basic economic intuition.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.420
What we're going to do is this
is a cheap way to align the

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.665
incentives of owners
and managers.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:20.790
And that was why
they took off.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:21.880
And everyone thought
it was great.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.800
And people like Michael Jensen
at Harvard Business School

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.890
made fortunes off having
suggested this, et cetera.

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:27.460
It was like we solved
the problem.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.620
And, remember, we did pretty
damn well in the 1990s.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.380
And a lot of it, people
attributed it to exactly

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.500
what's in this graph.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.940
That by finally figuring out how
to align the incentives of

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.980
producers and owners, we'd
figured out a way to change

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:42.820
the economy.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.540
And people thought we sort of
entered this new economic era

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.070
of massive productivity.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.390
Well people, as we know
now, were wrong.

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.630
Things slowed down in the
2000s and then now have

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:57.020
completely crashed.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:58.100
And why were they wrong?

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.270
Well, they're wrong because what
makes economics fun is

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.310
unintended consequences.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:07.430
And these stock options had
two kinds of unintended

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.569
consequences.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:12.869
The first unintended consequence
is that they lead

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.119
to excessive gambling.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.660
And what I mean by that is that
once your stock option is

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.220
out of the money, once, if
you've got it for 100,

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:33.390
you're below 100.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.740
You don't care how
low it goes.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.020
If you're at 99 or 20,
you don't care.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.630
All we care about is being
100 verses above.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:45.410
What that means is as an owner,
as a manager, you'll

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:48.890
take excessive risks to go into
the positive territory.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.600
Even if there's a huge
risk you'll get

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.850
nailed on the downside.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.170
Contrast to guys working
for a company that's

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.616
currently worth $100.

00:18:01.616 --> 00:18:09.530
One is given stock, and one is
given stock options at $100.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.060
Imagine they're both going to
leave the company in one year.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.910
Because there's dynamics with
the long run issues.

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:14.880
Let's put that aside.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.580
They're both going to
leave in one year.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.720
One today is given a share of
stock, and one today is given

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.810
an option to buy at $100.

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:25.090
And then they're given the
choice of a risky investment.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:26.130
Someone comes to them
and says, have I

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.880
got a deal for you.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:31.140
I've got an investment that
has a 10% chance it will

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.860
double the value of your company
and a 90% chance the

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.060
value of your company
will fall by 20%.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:51.040
So there's a 10% chance of a
100% return and a 90% chance

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.510
of a 20% decline in your
company's value.

00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:57.910
Now, what is the profit
maximizing thing

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.190
to do in this situation?

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:02.800
Well, to do that, we have to
consider the concept of what

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.375
delivers the company the
highest expected value.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.850
Expected value is a concept
we'll use-- and we'll come

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:12.910
back to this later when we
talk about uncertainty--

00:19:12.910 --> 00:19:15.770
it's a concept we use to measure
how you value things

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.130
when there's uncertainty.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:20.980
So the expected value of a
gamble is the probability that

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:27.470
you win times the value if you
win plus the probability that

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.320
you lose times the value
if you lose.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.570
That's the expected
value of a gamble.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.210
And the profit maximizing thing
to do would be to take

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:42.200
gambles of expected values
of greater than zero.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.460
The expected value is
the summation of the

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.480
value of that gamble.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:54.170
This gamble has an expected
value of 0.1 times 100--

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:56.650
100% return and a 10% chance--

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:01.590
plus 0.9 times negative 20--

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.790
a 90% of losing 20-- or an
expected value of minus 8%.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:09.060
That is if you take this gamble,
and you took it an

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.450
infinite number of times,
you would end up

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.110
losing 8% on average.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.710
Any one time might work out.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.340
But by the law of large numbers,
if we took this

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.530
enough times, you'd lose
8% on average.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:22.800
So you will lower the value
of your company.

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.840
You will reduce profits
by taking this gamble.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.300
Your company is worse off
if you take this gamble.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.810
Well, what would the person who
got the $100 in stocks do?

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:33.640
They won't take the gamble.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.310
Because their $100 in stock will
be worth, on average, 8%

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.390
less if they take this gamble.

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:39.590
So I'm not taking the gamble.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.000
This is stupid.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.210
But now let's look at the
guy who got the option.

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:44.830
His gamble is a little
bit different.

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:47.496
Because he doesn't care whether
the value of the

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.410
company is 99 or 80.

00:20:49.410 --> 00:20:51.370
He just cares about how much
it goes above 100.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.400
So what is his calculation?

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.600
Well, his calculation is he
has a 10% chance of making

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:03.910
100% and a 90% chance of what?

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:06.880
Zero, ending up with zero.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.030
He can't lose.

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:10.740
He has a 90% chance of zero.

00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:12.350
So what is his calculation?

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:16.250
Well, he uses the positive
10% gamble.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:20.135
He makes money on this gamble,
because head he wins, tails he

00:21:20.135 --> 00:21:21.590
walks away.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.550
The guy who owns the stock loses
if it's tails with this

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:28.550
weighted coin that only hits
heads 10% of the time.

00:21:28.550 --> 00:21:30.260
This guy only wins.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.250
So he says, sure.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.330
Any gamble which has a huge
upside, I'm going to take.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:38.500
Because I get all the upside,
and I don't bear the downside.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.070
So what this does is it leads
to excessive gambling,

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:41.990
excessive risk taking.

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:44.910
And that's exactly what we saw
in economy, was companies

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.820
gambling on things which sounded
very good, managers

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.970
gambling on things which sounded
very good, some of

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:54.890
which worked out very well
and some of which didn't.

00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:56.660
And that's the first problem
we have with the

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.300
use of stock options.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.690
And questions about that?

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:01.900
Yeah.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:04.876
AUDIENCE: What about using a
package of options like a

00:22:04.876 --> 00:22:07.356
number of stock options
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:22:10.332 --> 00:22:13.320
package of stock options
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.290
PROFESSOR: Certainly there are
more sophisticated ways you

00:22:15.290 --> 00:22:16.260
can do that.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.710
I mean, there's certainly
more sophisticated

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:18.600
ways you can do that.

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:22.180
But that's a great segue to the
second problem with these.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.500
The second problem is who
decided the structure of the

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.950
stock options?

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.600
The managers.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.060
So the managers had executive
compensation committees that

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.830
designed the stock options
the managers got.

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:36.360
So the second problem
was there was

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.460
just outright cheating.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.670
So what you just described would
be a great structure

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:43.700
which would incentivize them
maximally, but it would not

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.470
make them the most money.

00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:47.690
So the second problem we had
was outright cheating.

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.470
So there's a wonderful
investigation by the Wall

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.850
Street Journal that investigated
a whole list of

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.540
stock option arrangements.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.470
And what they found was
companies would frequently do

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.140
what's called backdating
stock options.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:01.363
What they'd say is, look, the
value of the company just went

00:23:01.363 --> 00:23:04.570
up from $100 to $15 last week.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.240
We're going to give you
an option at $100.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.990
And let's pretend it was issued
before the company

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.980
value went up.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.400
We've just given you money.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.360
You haven't done anything
to earn that.

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.700
We've just given you money.

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:18.480
And the Wall Street Journal
found incredible evidence of

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.040
backdating stock options.

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.910
So they had one CEO.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:25.886
They Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:23:25.886 --> 00:23:28.251
AUDIENCE: Is the company
paying the money?

00:23:28.251 --> 00:23:30.150
I thought it was like the
market who gives it.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:34.840
PROFESSOR: The owners are paying
the money, the owners.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.560
AUDIENCE: People who are
buying the stock are

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:37.910
exercising the option to.

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:38.230
PROFESSOR: No.

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:39.270
But here's the thing.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:42.460
When I gave it to you, then,
basically, I gave you

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.260
something of value.

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:45.050
I have to pay for that
thing of value.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.010
Now, ultimately,
the transaction

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.250
happens in the market.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:50.600
But, basically, in other words,
I give you this option

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.390
to buy the stock at $100.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:53.840
This is an important point that
I wasn't clear enough on.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.230
I give you an option to
buy a stock at $100.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.750
The stock is now worth $150.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:02.440
That means that stock I could
have had at $150 as an owner.

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:02.830
And it's worth $150.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:08.530
But by letting you take it at
$100, I let you keep the extra

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:09.810
$50 instead of me getting it.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.620
I have a share of stock
which [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:16.000
$150.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.290
I've given that to you.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.248
I've, essentially, transferred
to you $150.

00:24:21.248 --> 00:24:23.638
AUDIENCE: So when companies
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.700
PROFESSOR: They'll keep
some amount of shares.

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.450
The owners, they
will sell stock

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.430
and they'll do offerings.

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.070
But the owners own the majority
of the stock.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:40.450
That's what makes
them the owners.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.250
Maybe that's the right
way to put it.

00:24:42.250 --> 00:24:43.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.530
PROFESSOR: No.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:52.810
Well, in principle, the board
of directors approves stock.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:53.510
They don't decide.

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:55.520
An executive management
committee decides.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:57.240
The executive management
committee consists of all the

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.162
golf buddies of the CEO.

00:24:59.162 --> 00:25:00.090
They decide.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:01.770
The board of directors is
supposed to make sure nothing

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.055
untoward happens.

00:25:03.055 --> 00:25:05.720
The board of directors, they're
just a bunch of

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.390
retired former executives
who are also golf

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.030
buddies of the manager.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:11.580
So they don't really
get it right.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:12.820
So there's outright cheating.

00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:17.310
So, for instance, one CEO,
he got six stock options.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:21.870
Each one happened to be issued,
happened to be issued

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:24.040
the day before-- at least on
paper-- was issued the day

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.900
before a huge increase
in the stock price.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:28.655
Now, the CEO said he
was just lucky.

00:25:28.655 --> 00:25:31.030
But the Wall Street Journal
did a simulation and

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.080
calculated that there's a 1 in
1 billion chance he could've

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:34.400
been that lucky.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.350
That, in fact, what clearly
happened was he got the stock

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.040
options later, and they were
backdated to make it seem like

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.980
he got them before the
price went up.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.610
But that's not the
best example.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:44.990
The best example
is Cablevision.

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.670
They granted and backdated
options to their vice chairman

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.080
from 1997 to 2002.

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.010
So from 1997 to 2002, they gave
them options and they

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.780
kept backdating them to
make them look good.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.870
The only problem was that
he died in 1999.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.380
So, basically, they were just
giving money away to this

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:02.000
guy's heirs.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.350
Clearly they weren't
incentivizing his performance.

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:07.400
As the quote said, trying to
incentivize a corpse suggests

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.650
they were not complying with
the spirit of shareholder

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.840
approved stock option plans.

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.740
They were just giving money to
his heirs, because they felt

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:15.760
bad for him, because they
weren't keeping their yacht up

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.360
or whatever.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.520
So, basically, this is an
example of a kind of cheating.

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.850
Of course, then you can
go further, and

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:24.030
there's outright fraud.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:25.810
The backdating is sort
of cheating.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:26.750
You can go even further.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.860
I don't know what determines
fraud versus cheating.

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.050
You can just do what
Enron did.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:35.040
What Enron did is the executives
there just lied

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.590
about how much money
they were making.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.100
They just went public with
figures that were wrong.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.710
The stock price went up.

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.480
They cashed in their
options and quit.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.410
And as long as you don't get
caught, that's a great deal.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.580
And if you do get caught, well,
they fine you for 1/3 of

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.640
what you made.

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.080
So who cares?

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.950
So basically it was
outright fraud.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.630
And this was a lot
of what happened.

00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:58.280
A lot of the wealth that we
thought was created in the

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.200
1990s in the stock market was
really just false wealth

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.160
created by people saying their
company's were worth more than

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.190
they actually were.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.006
Yeah.

00:27:05.006 --> 00:27:07.386
AUDIENCE: Who decides the salary
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.690
PROFESSOR: No.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.010
I mean, once again, it varies
by company to company.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.260
But, basically, the dividend
payout would be something that

00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:22.110
a different set of managers
would decide, once again,

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.410
subject to approval
of the owners.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:27.710
But, once again, the point is
that the owners of a company,

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:29.880
of a big company, are just a
diffuse set of people who

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.570
don't know what they're doing.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:34.790
The managers know exactly
what they're doing.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:37.580
The board of directors is in
between and is half clueless,

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.960
half knows what it's doing.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.390
And that's what leads to
the agency problem.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.920
What's so interesting about
this example is it sort of

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.160
points out, like in many things
in economics, why we're

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.630
called the dismal science.

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:52.070
There is no right answer here.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:55.340
On the one hand, if you don't
incentivize your owners, then

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.500
they might not do what's
profit maximizing.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:28:00.000
On the other hand, if they
incentivize your owners, they

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.735
might do cheating to maximize
their profits as opposed to

00:28:02.735 --> 00:28:03.640
the company's profits.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.390
And that's why you need
complicated structures, the

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:07.050
type that was suggested
in the back.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.480
And that's why, for example,
they find that companies with

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:11.760
much more concentrated
ownership, the ones that

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.795
Warren Buffett owns 20% of, they
do a much better job in

00:28:14.795 --> 00:28:17.110
their CEO compensation than
the ones where it's just a

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.480
bunch of people owning
a tiny, tiny percent.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:25.460
So that's exactly the kind of
difficulty you face in setting

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.380
up executive compensation.

00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.610
Now, this was a real departure
from the kind of things we

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.830
talked about, just
one example.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.410
Partly what we want to do in
this course, I want to teach

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:35.300
you about basic economics.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:37.450
I partly want to excite you
about what else you can go on

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.390
and do in economics.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.820
What I've just done in the last
half hour is a microcosm

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.320
of the field of corporate
finance.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.350
There's an entire field
in economics

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:46.100
called corporate finance.

00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:47.890
We teach it in course 15.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:48.950
And it's a terrific course.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:51.690
15.401 and 15.402 are the
introductory courses.

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.670
And if you find this stuff
exciting, as I'm sensing some

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.930
of you are, that's a great
place to take what we're

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.110
learning in this course and go
on and actually dive in.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.540
Realize that half the stuff
I've told you, I'm

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:00.300
talking out of my ass.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.410
I don't really know for sure.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.880
But those guys do
in course 15.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:07.830
And you can really get into
these agency relationships and

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.100
understand our corporations work
and how you set up these

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.925
kinds of compensation
arrangements.

00:29:11.925 --> 00:29:14.970
So this is kind of just
a very exciting area.

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:16.460
Now, we're going to go back
after this and assume

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.390
corporations maximize
profits again.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:21.200
And, once again, as with any
assumption we make, by and

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.910
large, it's right.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:25.200
And by and large it will deliver
the kind of important

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.280
knowledge that we need to know
about how firms function.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.710
But it's important to remember
that these kinds of

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:29.470
things are behind it.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.110
What we do in this course
is teach you the basics.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.540
Then you go on in these other
electives and actually learn

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.830
about this kind of more
interesting tweaks

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:37.930
and what we do here.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:41.590
And other questions about
this before I move on?

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:43.250
OK.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:46.840
Now we're going to stop with
that topic, and we're going to

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.380
move to sort of an
in between topic.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:54.760
That is, we've been talking
about firms and firm profit

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:55.870
maximization.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:57.660
And we talked about how that
depends on the structure of

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.030
the market and perfect
competition.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:03.370
Starting in two lectures, we're
going to start talking

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.170
about alternative market
structures like

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.240
monopoly and oligopoly.

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.550
But in order to talk about them,
we need to introduce a

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.670
new concept we haven't
used before.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:13.560
And that's what we'll
do the rest of this

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.010
lecture and next lecture.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:19.490
We need to move from positive
economics to normative

00:30:19.490 --> 00:30:27.080
economics, from positive
economics to normative.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:35.540
Positive analysis is the study
of the way things are.

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.990
So positive analysis is
explaining why do firms

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.360
produce this many widgets?

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.080
Why do they hire this
many workers?

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.170
Why did I buy this many CDs?

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:45.050
That's a positive analysis,
trying to explain the way

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:46.570
things are.

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.150
That's what we've done,
by and large, so far.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:52.130
Normative analysis is the
analysis of the way

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:54.100
things should be.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.380
Is it good that I bought
that many CDs?

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:58.690
Is it good that the company
made that much profits?

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:01.430
Would be better if we have a
minimum wage or don't have a

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.250
minimum wage?

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.110
Normative analysis is the
analysis of the way things

00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:08.690
should be as opposed to
the way they are.

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:12.780
So, for example, we showed in
the last lecture that in the

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.910
long run, with free entry and
exit, all firms are driven to

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:20.250
zero profit, and the supply
curve is horizontal.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:22.860
Well, is that a good thing?

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:23.300
We don't know.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:24.520
We just said it happened.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:25.565
I described why it happened.

00:31:25.565 --> 00:31:26.230
But I didn't tell you
if it was a good

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.710
thing or a bad thing.

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:30.360
Zero profits, I make a lot of
money off the profits that the

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.800
companies I own make.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.500
I don't know if I want to
work with zero profits.

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.910
I've got a lot of
stock and stuff.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.010
And I'm making money because
these companies make profits.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:39.975
I don't think I'd
be that happy to

00:31:39.975 --> 00:31:41.000
work with zero profits.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.110
How do we think about whether
that's a good

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.550
world or a bad world?

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.240
How do we think about whether
we like these outcomes or

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.500
don't like them?

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.635
These are the tools of normative
economics or what we

00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:54.280
will refer to as welfare
economics.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.010
Now, let me be clear here.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.330
The term welfare, as you might
have heard it, often refers to

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:03.040
money you give to low
income populations.

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.250
And we'll talk about that
kind of welfare

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:05.700
later in the semester.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:08.020
Here, when I say welfare,
I mean well-being.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.350
Welfare is the term economists
use as the measure of

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.080
well-being.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:15.330
We need to start talking about
welfare economics, measuring

00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:19.170
the impact of economic outcomes
on well-being, not

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.540
just studying what happens when
firms maximize profits or

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:26.180
consumers maximize utility,
but measuring how we feel

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:30.760
about it, measuring whether
it's good or bad, and

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.460
measuring whether some
outcomes might be

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.240
preferred to others.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:36.190
Because if we don't do that, we
can't ever talk about the

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:38.380
role of the government
in the economy.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:41.480
Until you start talking about
welfare, you can't talk about

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.330
whether we should
have government

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:44.310
interventions or not.

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.960
You can only talk about
what happens, not

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.160
whether it should happen.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.210
Now, the problem of welfare
economics is that it's a lot

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.670
harder because of something
I mentioned when we

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:55.550
talked about utility.

00:32:55.550 --> 00:33:00.200
Utility is an ordinal concept,
not a cardinal concept.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.950
Utility is an ordinal concept,
not a cardinal concept.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.660
That is, utils are
meaningless.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.970
We use utility functions to
decide whether you prefer

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:09.830
package A or package B. But the
actual amount of utils you

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:14.100
get, unlike profits, is sort
of a meaningless concept.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.060
It's just sort of an index.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.500
So what we do to do welfare
economics is we turn from

00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:21.920
utils to dollars.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.810
We measure welfare in dollars
which is easy on

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.050
the corporate side.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.520
That's profits.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.650
How do we do it on the
consumer side?

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.730
We do it through the concept
that we call compensating

00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:38.310
variation, which is one of these
things where economists

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:40.380
use fancy terms for something
which isn't that hard to

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.530
understand.

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.210
But you need to know the fancy
terms, because that's kind of

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:46.700
how we teach, compensating
variation.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:53.510
That is instead of asking, how
sad are you about outcome x,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.325
we ask, how many dollars
would it take?

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:03.590
Instead of asking, how sad would
you be to not have a CD,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.680
we ask, how much would
you pay to avoid

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:07.930
being in that situation?

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:16.920
So instead of asking, how sad
are you that you end up with

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.639
this car instead of that car,
we don't want to measure the

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.980
utils of driving a Hyundai
versus a Lexus.

00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:23.960
We can't measure those.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.810
What we can ask, is how much
more will you pay to get the

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.730
Lexus than the Hyundai?

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:33.030
And that's $1 measure
of your utils.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:34.260
That's a compensating
variation.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.010
How much do you have
to be compensated?

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:41.719
So, in other words, instead of
asking you how sad are you

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.280
that you couldn't get tickets
to a Lady Gaga concert--

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.159
maybe that's not a good example
because no one's sad

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:46.580
about that.

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.630
But let's say you were.

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:51.560
Let's say I am because my
daughter wants to see her.

00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.650
How sad are you?

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:56.050
I ask, instead, how much would
you pay to get the tickets to

00:34:56.050 --> 00:34:57.300
the Lady Gaga concert?

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:01.140
That's a measure of how
sad you were you

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.310
couldn't get them.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:05.490
Because you'll pay an amount to
compensate yourself for the

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:07.040
sadness of not getting them.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:10.340
So it's a way of turning
utils into dollars.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:12.750
And that leads to the concept
that we'll refer to throughout

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:14.000
the semester.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:18.370
That leads to the concept
of consumer surplus.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:30.620
Consumer surplus measures the
benefit that a consumer gets

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:34.740
from consuming a good above
and beyond what they

00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.250
paid for the good.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:50.110
So it's the benefit of
consumption beyond the price.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.770
So your consumer surplus--

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.480
surplus means extra--

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:56.400
is how much you enjoy consuming
something above and

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.210
beyond what you had
to pay for it.

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:04.450
In other words, the idea is if
you have to pay exactly as

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:07.390
much as you'd enjoy the good,
there's no consumer surplus.

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:08.930
So let's do an example.

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:13.490
So consider my demand to
buy a Lady Gaga CD.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.330
I've got to update
my examples.

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:15.400
You guys don't buy
CDs anymore.

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.680
How many of you have bought
a CD in the last year?

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:20.822
Wow.

00:36:20.822 --> 00:36:21.950
OK, let me ask another
question,

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:22.380
just one for the record.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:23.980
Just because I have to decide
how hard a time to give my

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.090
16-year-old son.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:29.283
How many of you typically
pay when you buy a song?

00:36:29.283 --> 00:36:30.610
Wow.

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:30.770
OK.

00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:31.200
Let me ask another one.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:35.790
How many of you typically don't
pay when you buy a song.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:37.730
Well, when you get a song, when
you download a song, you

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.090
know what I mean, when
you download a song.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.950
So the majority of you don't pay
when you download a song.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:41.360
Interesting.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:42.610
OK.

00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:46.160
I'll update this next year.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.440
But, for now, we're still
10 years ago.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.810
Consider my demand for
Lady Gaga CDs.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:53.310
I'm trying to decide whether
to buy the marginal CD.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:58.380
And let's say that it's
worth $15 to me.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.980
I'd be willing to pay $15
for the Lady Gaga CD.

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.890
And let's say the
price is $15.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:07.850
In that case, there's
no surplus to me.

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:08.980
There's nothing extra.

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:11.005
I've paid what I was
willing to pay.

00:37:11.005 --> 00:37:14.000
So that's a case of a zero
consumer surplus.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.940
The consumer surplus is how
much extra I got from

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.330
consuming it.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.085
I've got no extra.

00:37:18.085 --> 00:37:19.460
It was worth $15.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.850
I paid $15, no surplus.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:27.730
Now let's say that the
price was $10.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.130
Then I've got a surplus.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.340
I've got $5 in surplus.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.050
I was willing to pay $15.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.410
It makes me $15 happier to
have this Lady Gaga CD.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.170
But I only had to
pay $10 for it.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.930
So I've derived some surplus.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:43.670
Well, how do we know what
people's willingness to pay

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:46.680
for a good is?

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.320
The demand curve.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.300
That's the definition
of the demand curve.

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.470
The demand curve measures
your willingness to pay.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.530
So let's go to the
second figure.

00:37:55.530 --> 00:38:00.300
Think about the demand
curve for CDs.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:02.740
There's some demand
curve for CDs.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:07.880
What this measures is the
utility maximizing choice.

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.030
Every point in this demand curve
represents my utility

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:15.240
maximizing choice
at that price.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.000
This is backwards.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.830
That should be a $15 on the
y-axis and a $5 on the x-axis,

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:25.290
Sorry, guys.

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:29.130
It should be $15 on
the y-axis and a--

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:29.430
no.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:30.030
Wait, hold on one second.

00:38:30.030 --> 00:38:31.280
Time out.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:34.910
At $5, I get no consumer
surplus.

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:46.580
Yeah, this graph is
kind of messed up.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.830
Let me draw a new one here.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.270
So you've got my demand
curve for CDs.

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.535
You've got the quantity
and the price.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:04.390
And I've got some utility
function that delivers this

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.580
demand curve.

00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.210
And let's say the way this
works, this demand curve for

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:12.290
CDs, let's say the way this
works is that I am

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:16.280
willing to buy 1 CD.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.500
I'm willing to buy if the
price is $20, I'm

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.160
willing to buy 1 CD.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.200
So at a price of $20, I'm
willing to buy 1 CD.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.290
So if I get that 1 CD at $20,
then basically that's my

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:33.540
willingness to pay.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.020
It equals a price, so there's
no consumer surplus.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.180
Really imagine it's right
next to that y-axis.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.740
Now let's the price
falls to $15.

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:53.040
Sorry.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.100
That's a 1.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:54.510
That's the 1.

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.225
That's a 20.

00:39:55.225 --> 00:39:57.340
At a price of $20, I'm
willing to buy 1.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:40:00.290
At a price of $15, I'm
willing to buy 5.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.540
I'm willing to buy 5 CDs.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.680
Now, what is my consumer
surplus?

00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.030
Well, let's ask.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.290
For the first CD, I got
no consumer surplus.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:17.410
But for the second, I
was willing to pay.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.120
When the price was $20, I
got no consumer surplus.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.270
Now let's say the
price is $15.

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:24.840
So what was I willing to
pay for the first CD?

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.460
$20.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.363
So what's my consumer surplus
on the first CD?

00:40:27.363 --> 00:40:28.670
5.

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:32.150
So on that first CD, I got
a consumer surplus of 5.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:35.780
The second CD, I was willing to
pay less because I've got

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.160
diminishing marginal utility.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:40.190
But I was still willing
to pay more than $15.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:42.170
So I've got some
surplus there.

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.790
Third CD here, et cetera.

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.870
But on the fifth CD, I derive
no surplus, because I was

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:51.535
willing to pay $15 for that
fifth CD, and I paid $15 for

00:40:51.535 --> 00:40:53.080
that fifth CD.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:59.500
What that means is that all of
this is my consumer surplus.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:05.640
Because on every unit, because
I paid a fixed price of $15,

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.640
and for my fifth CD, that
delivered no surplus, that was

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.330
indifferent.

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:13.470
But in my first through fourth
CDs, that made me very happy.

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:16.900
Because I was willing to pay
more than $15 for those.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.800
So my consumer surplus is the
amount by which I derive

00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:22.740
utility above what
I was willing to

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.400
pay, above the price--

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.580
I'm sorry-- the amount
that I was willing to

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.010
pay about the price.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:31.070
The amount I'm willing to pay is
every point on this curve.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:36.250
So anything I buy that I was
willing to pay more for the

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:37.710
price for, I derived
surplus on.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:41.670
So this becomes my
consumer surplus.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:46.380
So, basically, consumer surplus
is the area under the

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:50.000
demand curve above the price.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.810
So, graphically, consumer
surplus is going to be the

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.960
area under the demand curve
above the price.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:59.110
Intuitively, why is that?

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:04.510
Intuitively, what's going on is
that every unit above the

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:07.110
price under the demand curve
are units which I valued

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.350
higher than the price.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:11.310
So I get surplus on them.

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:12.000
OK.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.100
Question?

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:13.957
Yeah.

00:42:13.957 --> 00:42:15.556
AUDIENCE: If you're
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] this, would

00:42:15.556 --> 00:42:17.160
you start at zero?

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.050
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.070
Really, in some sense, you'd
want to start at zero.

00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:22.620
It's really the integral
of this whole area.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:23.660
The problem is it's discrete.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.010
I should have a stepwise
curve here.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:26.790
I made it discrete.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:30.020
But, really, it's the integral
of this area.

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:30.743
Yeah.

00:42:30.743 --> 00:42:33.158
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:42:33.158 --> 00:42:34.610
upward sloping demand curve?

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:34.980
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.860
AUDIENCE: With an upward
sloping demand curve.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.690
PROFESSOR: With an upward
sloping demand curve, well, as

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.150
I said, we don't believe
in Giffen goods.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:43.870
We think they are a fantasy.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.650
So with an upward sloping
demand curve,

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:47.900
how would that work?

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:56.300
So an upward sloping demand
curve, then that would say

00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:05.500
that if the price is here, then
you'd have an infinite

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:05.990
consumer surplus.

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:08.096
It wouldn't be well-defined.

00:43:08.096 --> 00:43:09.590
It wouldn't be well-defined.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.660
So I don't know how
you'd do that.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.650
That's why we don't like upward
sloping demand curves.

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:14.360
Yeah.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:14.640
Question?

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.420
No?

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:15.890
OK.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:19.930
So, basically, what you end up
with is this consumer surplus

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:22.440
concept which, basically, as
pointed out mathematically, is

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:23.820
the integral of this area.

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.200
But we're not going to
make you integrate.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.480
It's basically this triangle
which is basically all the

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:33.010
units above the price, all the
units for which you're willing

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.290
to pay more than the price.

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:37.990
And you get consumer surplus
on every unit you buy up to

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:39.420
the point where your
willingness to

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.230
pay equals the price.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.320
And that's our normative
measure of welfare.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.660
That's our normative measure
of how happy you are.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.510
And the key that drives this is

00:43:49.510 --> 00:43:50.370
diminishing marginal utility.

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:52.540
That's why we don't like upward
sloping demand curves.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.280
What drives this is diminishing
marginal utility.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.860
It's that with each additional
unit I'm willing to pay less

00:43:57.860 --> 00:43:59.500
and less for.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.680
So I'm going to get less and
less surplus off each

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.790
additional unit I buy.

00:44:03.790 --> 00:44:05.560
And that's going to
be the key thing.

00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.540
The key intuition that you guys
have to remember is that

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:12.810
the last unit that I'm willing
to buy at that price, by

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:21.100
definition, I get no surplus
on, or I get a $0.001 of

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.510
surplus on.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.520
Because if I've got a lot of
surplus, I'd buy 1 more.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.670
So, by definition, the marginal
unit is the one where

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.850
surplus is driven to 0.

00:44:32.850 --> 00:44:35.810
And units before that are the
ones with positive surplus.

00:44:35.810 --> 00:44:37.800
And that's why an important
intuition to have is the

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:40.260
amount of surplus you're going
to get from a purchase is

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.040
going to be about how far away
from the price point you are.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.680
Those first units are going
to give you more surplus.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.020
And that's going to dwindle as
you get to the actual last

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.940
unit you buy at that price.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:51.860
Any questions about that?

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:52.330
OK.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.310
Let me stop there.

00:44:53.310 --> 00:44:55.960
We will come back next time, and
we're going to spend the

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.150
whole lecture talking about
welfare economics, we'll

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:00.565
introduce producer surplus,
and talk about how we then

00:45:00.565 --> 00:45:02.720
think about whether changes
are good or bad.

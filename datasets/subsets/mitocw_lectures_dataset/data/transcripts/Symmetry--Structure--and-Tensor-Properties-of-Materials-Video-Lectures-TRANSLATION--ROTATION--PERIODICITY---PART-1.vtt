WEBVTT

00:00:06.958 --> 00:00:11.680
PROFESSOR: All right, my trusty
$5 Timex watch says

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.920
it's five after the hour.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.180
So I guess we might
as well begin.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.460
I have corrected all the
problems that were turned in--

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.710
the puzzles, not problems,
puzzles.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.110
And I just yesterday
got hold of the

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.720
photographs of you few people.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.570
And I'd like to hand out the
papers individually so I can

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.120
start to put names together
with faces.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.040
So I'll turn them back
individually next time.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.600
I have one additional problem
set that for you.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.210
And again, this is in the
form of a puzzle.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.790
Be assured that this is the last
entertaining problem set.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.800
From here on, we move
into drudgery--

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.760
tedious, drawn out things
that hopefully

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.620
will teach you something.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.880
But this is the last one that's
done with a little bit

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.750
of tongue in cheek humor.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.820
This one is a little more subtle
than the other two.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.200
And for this one, I will hand
out a solution because I would

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.230
like to use these problems to
make a couple of basic points

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.310
about the nature of symmetry
theory in crystals.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.070
So see how you do on this one.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:31.190
OK, also before we begin, he
gets a little bit uneasy

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.190
before a crowd.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.110
But I brought a little friend
in with me today.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.090
And could someone hold
the box, please, so I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.340
could take him out?

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.570
Sorry.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.020
He gets a little bit nervous
before a crowd.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.230
Come on, take it easy.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.480
Take it easy.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.820
This is Rodney.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.070
He's an old friend of mine.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.820
Rodney is a crystallographic
abomination.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.535
Rodney has five-fold
symmetry--

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.330
impossible in crystallography,
an abomination.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.130
Why did Rodney decide
to do this?

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.470
Anybody have any idea?

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.740
Why not six fold symmetry?

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.490
He's got five-fold symmetry.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.400
Yuck!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.480
But why?

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.420
There's always a reason for
things if you look carefully

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.176
enough and know what
questions to ask.

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:40.634
Yeah?

00:02:40.634 --> 00:02:42.930
AUDIENCE: He had narrow
symmetry.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, he had
narrow symmetry.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.190
But he could do that-- what
if you were square?

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.440
Why not a square starfish?

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.750
Why five?

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.940
He did this for a reason.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.340
He's been doing this for
probably a couple of million

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.985
years, he and his ancestors.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:01.930
There has to be a reason.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.650
OK, let me turn him over.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.900
And maybe that will
give you a clue.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.210
The backside is not nearly as
nice as the front side.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:18.230
And in fact, if you look at
Rodney carefully, Rodney has

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.650
sutures between these
five arms.

00:03:26.856 --> 00:03:29.400
OK, this is what he looks
like from the top.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.890
But if you look at him from the
bottom, there are sutures

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.280
between these arms
that do this.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.970
And these sutures are weak
points in his structure.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.500
And by having five-fold
symmetry, he puts the suture

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.030
between this pair of arms
opposite the midpoint of the

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.290
opposite rib.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.150
And that gives him a great deal

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.480
more structural integrity.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.580
So when a large fish comes along
and gloms onto one of

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.655
his arms and shakes, he doesn't
split in half and end

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.530
his career prematurely.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.250
What happens instead, at very
worst, the tip of the arm

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.920
breaks off.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.000
And then, Rodney gets to scamper
away and make more

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.899
starfish or do whatever his
purpose in our environment is.

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:18.550
If he had an even-fold
symmetry,

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.070
that wouldn't happen.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.070
He would really be
done in by a fish

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.652
grabbing hold and shaking.

00:04:25.652 --> 00:04:28.530
AUDIENCE: What if [INAUDIBLE]?

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.730
PROFESSOR: That's a very
good question.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.650
If he had only three arms and
a fish glomed on and one arm

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.300
broke off, his mobility would
be greatly impaired.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.060
In a way, he would go
hip, hop, flop.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.550
Hip, hip, flop.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.500
Hip, hip, flop.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.640
Hip, hip, flop.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:45.590
It'd be a pathetic thing.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.387
So five is much more
advantageous than three.

00:04:49.387 --> 00:04:50.201
AUDIENCE: Why not seven?

00:04:50.201 --> 00:04:52.130
PROFESSOR: Why not seven?

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.520
That's a good question, too.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.965
Would you believe that on the
Australian Barrier Reef, there

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:00.936
are starfish with nine-fold
symmetry?

00:05:00.936 --> 00:05:03.070
Quite odd.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.730
That's really a creepy
thing with all those

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:06.740
arms flopping around.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.430
But as many things in our
environment in our natural

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.130
world, there's a reason for
things if you can only think

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.610
what it might be.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.455
So we gave you another example
of a non-crystallographic

00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:25.130
symmetry, the large cacti of the
Southwest, the saguaros.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.160
And there are lots of
other ribbed casts.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.270
They have symmetries that range
between 19 and 23 fold.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.480
Why do you think they have
this rib structure?

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.160
Why can't they have a
nice, smooth trunk

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.370
like a birch tree?

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.430
Any idea there?

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.180
I'll give you a hint.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:43.760
They live out in the desert.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.840
There's not much water.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:45.794
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:45.794 --> 00:05:47.225
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:05:47.225 --> 00:05:50.087
AUDIENCE: More surface area
for the [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:50.087 --> 00:05:51.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
but that's bad.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.170
That means they would
lose their water.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.730
So things that don't
want to lose water

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.500
through their surface--

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.510
you're right-- try to minimize
their surface.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.690
But you're onto something.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.070
And it is exactly the
reverse of that.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.370
Water is scarce.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.260
So when it rains, this cactus
wants to soak up the moisture

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.540
and store it.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.090
If he has this pleated
structure,

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.300
he's able to expand.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.680
If he had a smooth surface
with minimal area,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:21.630
he would just pop.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.560
And that would be the end of
him or her, as the case may

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.590
be. "It" is probably the
appropriate term.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.380
But anyway, there's the reason
for these many, many ribs.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.280
It gives them the ability to
expand, store water, and then

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.800
contract when the water
evaporates.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.140
So again, it's always
interesting to look at the

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.610
world around us and see examples
of things that are

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.860
strange because it's the strange
things that very often

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.760
can lead to penetrating
conclusions.

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:56.650
All right, last time we had
talked about chirality in

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.790
finite atomic structures,
molecules.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.340
And I had pointed out-- but
did not make the obvious

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.510
observation--

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.260
I cannot think of a more
dramatic connection between

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:13.240
structure and properties, which
is what material science

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.240
is all about, than the very,
very different properties of

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:21.490
molecules that are of
opposite handedness.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.700
We pointed out, for example,
that many pharmaceuticals are

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.230
of chiral molecules that exist
in right handed and left

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.450
handed forms.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.570
And very often, one form of
one handedness has a very

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.870
different set of properties,
and in particular

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:44.180
pharmacological action, then
it it's enan enantiomorph.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.860
So in the case of thalidomide,
one handedness of the molecule

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.200
acts as a tranquilizer.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.390
The other handedness acts as
a source of birth defects.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.460
One of the other ones less
familiar to me, but this is

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:00.885
[? ethambutol. ?]

00:08:00.885 --> 00:08:04.510
It's used as a drug to
treat tuberculosis.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:09.400
The molecule of opposite
handedness creates blindness.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:17.010
The drug Ritalin that is used
to treat hyperactivity, one

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:20.150
handedness of the molecule
is absolutely useless.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:23.710
So you only use half of
what you pay for.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:27.610
So it's of great interest to
pharmaceutical companies to be

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.370
able to synthesize a molecule
of one particular handedness

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:35.200
with little if none
of the other one.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.030
And I looked up a number
since we met last time.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:45.010
It turns out that in 1997,
enantiomorph pure drugs were a

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:49.610
$400 billion dollar industry.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:55.180
So again, this is structure
property relations in action.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.740
So let me ask you another
question.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.460
It turns out that products that
are derived from nature--

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:04.240
a good example being sugar,
which is produced by sugar

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.440
beets or sugar cane--

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.300
produces a molecule only
of one handedness.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.570
They are [? enantiomer ?]

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:12.650
pure.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.120
But every synthetic compound
that can exist in right handed

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.890
and left handed forms occurs
with equal probability.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:27.430
So how do you make a
pharmaceutical of one

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:30.600
particular handedness?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.900
And this is an interesting
question because I think it

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:36.940
was two years ago the Nobel
Prize in chemistry was given

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.250
to three people for their work
in being able to synthesize

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.960
molecules of a given
handedness.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.020
Anybody an idea how you do it?

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.756
AUDIENCE: I don't have an idea
how you do it, but what do you

00:09:46.756 --> 00:09:48.421
mean by one handedness
versus--?

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:50.377
PROFESSOR: OK, left handed
or right handed.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.460
So my left hand is exactly the
same as my right hand, but I

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.250
cannot match them into
congruence with one another.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.080
And we don't know how to
describe this other than we

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.490
used the term derived
from our physiology.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:10.240
We say left handed
and right handed.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.190
So when I was referring to a
molecule of one handedness--

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.860
and I'll bring in a Xerox copy
of a couple of examples.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.340
There are many examples of
fairly common molecules which

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.300
can exist in one form in which
the hydroxyl group points out

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.870
this way, then another form
where the hydroxyl groups

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.350
points out this way.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.420
Sorry, you should have
asked that earlier.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.230
AUDIENCE: So if it's not the
same molecule, it would be

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.200
that molecule but--?

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.000
PROFESSOR: Chemically, it is
exactly the same concept.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.245
But the way in which those
component models are

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:44.806
configured has the same number
of side groups, the same

00:10:44.806 --> 00:10:45.984
number of appendages.

00:10:45.984 --> 00:10:49.760
But they, don't have
a better word.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.310
One is left handed.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.240
One is right handed.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.420
I'll give you some examples
next time.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:55.560
Somebody else, you
had a question?

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.528
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
see if I could venture a guess

00:10:57.528 --> 00:10:58.512
how they do it.

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:01.464
I was going to guess they use an
electric field that has its

00:11:01.464 --> 00:11:04.088
bearings to set the right handed
course [INAUDIBLE] that

00:11:04.088 --> 00:11:05.400
would make [? enantiomorphs ?]

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.070
or more advantageous
than [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.320
PROFESSOR: That's
not a bad idea.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:16.750
Anything that could bias the
energy of one configuration

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.810
over the other would do it.

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:21.410
But actually, no reason why you
should know how to do it.

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:23.210
If you knew how to do it, maybe
you could have gotten

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.350
the Nobel Prize instead
of these other guys.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.720
But actually, you do it
through catalysis.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:33.850
And you use a catalyst which
itself has chirality.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.920
And that chirality favors the
formation of one molecule over

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.590
the other almost exclusively.

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:43.980
And that's why living
plants make--

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.140
or animals-- make chiral
molecules in just one

00:11:47.140 --> 00:11:48.990
handedness as well.

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.300
So it's using a catalyst that
also has some chirality.

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:55.288
AUDIENCE: How do you get the
one hundred catalysts

00:11:55.288 --> 00:11:56.782
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.032
PROFESSOR: How do
you have it--?

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:04.730
OK, there are lots
of materials.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:09.330
Any crystalline material that
does not have a mirror plane

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.870
in it can exist in
chiral forms.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:18.790
And one of the classic examples
of this is quartz.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.280
Quartz is SiO2.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.430
And quartz has actually only
a threefold symmetry.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.480
But it forms crystals that look
prismatic, as though they

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:32.460
were hexagonal prisms.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.190
And if I draw two of these
prisms side by side, you could

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.980
not tell which prism
was left handed and

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.150
which was right handed.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.330
But quartz ends up growing with
a couple of little facets

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:46.640
on it that look like this.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.850
They spiral up this way in a
crystal of one handedness and

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:54.515
they spiral up in the opposite
direction for a crystal of

00:12:54.515 --> 00:12:55.900
opposite handedness.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.170
So the external faces on the
crystal show you that this

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.150
crystal shape cannot be mapped
one into another.

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:05.390
They are of opposite
handedness.

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.810
And they have very different
properties.

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.300
And so here's an example.

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:10.330
I'm not answer your question.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:14.310
I'm talking around it very
adroitly in the hope that if I

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:16.480
talk enough you will forget
what you asked.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.760
But how do you make
a chiral catalyst?

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.280
Well, there are some materials
if you prepare them in a

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:25.510
single crystal form, once you
nucleate one enantiomorph,

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:27.710
that will continue to grow.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.980
So I would presume one
could do exactly

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.840
the same with a catalyst.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.940
Actually, the properties of
quartz are strikingly

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.990
different for these two
different forms.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:44.680
If you would subject the crystal
to compression, this

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:46.520
crystal would develop
a positive

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.810
charge on the surface.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:50.860
This crystal would develop
a negative

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.720
charge on the surface.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.310
That's a property that we'll
discuss in detail later on.

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.240
That's something called
piezoelectricity, literally

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.310
pressure electricity.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:03.440
So the nature of the charge
induced on the crystal is

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.945
different for the crystals
of the two chiralities.

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:12.940
OK, any other comment
or question?

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:25.510
OK, last time we had taken the
first small steps in what will

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.740
turn out to be a long and

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.310
protracted process of synthesis.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.330
We've covered by now some of
the general notions of

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:39.290
operations that can exist in
a pattern, two dimensional

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:43.630
pattern of wallpaper or fabric
or a three dimensional pattern

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.260
that constitutes a crystal.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.960
And we said that in three
dimensions, there are four

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.800
basic different operations that
can exist that tell you

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.640
how one part of the system
is related to another.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.370
There is an operation
of translation.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:04.780
And this has all the
characteristics of a vector,

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.360
magnitude and direction.

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.590
We summarize that translational
periodicity by a

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:14.815
set of fiducial markers that
are called lattice points.

00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.060
And analytically, the
transformation takes the

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:24.596
coordinate x, y, z.

00:15:24.596 --> 00:15:29.560
And if you do the operation
once, maps this to x plus a, y

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:35.078
plus b, z plus c where the
translation has components a,

00:15:35.078 --> 00:15:38.570
b, and c in x, y, and
z directions.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.270
Another operation is the
operation of reflection.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:52.230
And what this operation does is
to take the coordinates of

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:57.400
an initial part of the space
atom or location and maps it

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:03.780
into some location where one
direction is reversed in sign.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.920
Which direction that is or
whether it's a pair of

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:10.010
directions will depend on how
the reflection locus is

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.830
located relative to the
coordinate system.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.120
Next, there was an operation
of rotation.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:25.440
And this involves repeating
things at angular intervals.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.070
Take the space or the location
of the atom and rotate it

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:33.240
through some angle, alpha,
about some rotation, a.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:37.440
And in a sense, this is
a periodicity which is

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.650
reminiscent of translation
except translation strings

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.490
things out in a line.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.110
Rotation wraps up the
directions about

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.150
some central axis.

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:50.370
But it's also periodic.

00:16:50.370 --> 00:16:54.150
Then finally, in three
dimensions, there is another

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.400
operation called inversion.

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.580
And what this does is--

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.870
to could describe it as such
in literal terms--

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.300
take something and turns it
inside out to a point.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.650
So if the inversion point were
at the origin, it would take

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:16.930
x, y, z, and map it into minus
x, minus y, minus z.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:22.180
And then, we concluded last time
with a definition of a

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:27.880
vocabulary for indicating
analytically a single

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:37.150
operation, the set of operations
that constitutes

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:45.800
the symmetry element, and then
a geometric symbol for the

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:51.050
locus of that operation.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:58.790
And for translation, we could
represent a single

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:00.830
operation by t.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.820
The set of operations
could be--

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:07.430
and I'll use this customary
set of braces to

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.240
indicate the set--

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.270
this would be a one dimensional
lattice, a set of

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.990
operations, p, where p is
an integer times t.

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:21.950
The geometric symbol, it's
convenient to use an arrow

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.800
extending from one lattice
point to another.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:29.630
But I emphasize that there's
no unique origin to the

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.730
translation.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.910
We cannot be entitled to say
it sits here as opposed to

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:36.780
down here or down here.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.420
There are an infinite number
of parallel directions that

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.020
could specify a given interval
between lattice points.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:49.080
For rotation operations, the
notation for a single

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.800
operation in as much as we must
specify two things, the

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.730
point about which we rotate and
then the angular interval

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.750
about which we perform
the rotation.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.420
And so we need to specify two
things, the location of the

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.160
axis, a point a, and
the angle, alpha,

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.870
through which we rotate.

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:14.240
The set of operations, the
rotation axis, is indicated by

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.230
an integer, n, where the
rotation part of the operation

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.810
is 2 pi divided by
the integer, n.

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:28.420
So we would use, for example, 2
to represent a rotation axis

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:34.130
where things were moved through
180 degrees, 3 for a

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:37.810
symmetry where things were
mapped through intervals of

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.890
120 degrees, and 22 for my
good friend, the Saguaro

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.950
cactus, which is left invariant
perhaps by a

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:51.290
rotation through 1/22 of 2 pi.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:54.920
For the geometric symbol for a
rotation axis, we will use a

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.170
little polyhedron.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.970
Triangle for a threefold axis.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.340
Square for a fourfold axis.

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:06.940
For a twofold axis, the
polyhedron that had that

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.790
symmetry would be
a line segment.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.350
So we'll take a little artistic
license and let the

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:15.720
middle of the line segment
bulge out a little bit.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.990
Finally for inversion, for
reasons that will not become

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:24.470
clear for another meeting or
two, the single operation is

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:25.780
denoted one bar.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.960
The set of operations of which
there are only two, inverting

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.360
and coming back again,
also indicated by

00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.840
the symbol one bar.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.210
And the geometric symbol for
the locus is a little, tiny

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:40.220
circle that's open large enough
to be noticed, but not

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:46.100
so large that it looks like an
atom in an atomic arrangement.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.470
So there's our basic
bag of tricks.

00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:52.250
And last time, we had already
used some simple geometry to

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.270
come to a rather astonishing
conclusion.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.710
Yes, sir?

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.128
AUDIENCE: Reflection?

00:20:57.128 --> 00:21:00.551
PROFESSOR: Reflection, that's
this middle one.

00:21:00.551 --> 00:21:02.507
Whoops, not going to help.

00:21:02.507 --> 00:21:04.463
Thank you very much.

00:21:04.463 --> 00:21:06.419
I get excited and
carried away.

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:08.375
OK, reflection, the
second operation.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:18.090
Single operation, although
crystallographers don't often

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:21.890
use it in condensed matter
physics, a single operation is

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:26.660
represented by the
symbol sigma.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:30.820
Symbol for a mirror plane is
m, easily appreciated.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.520
And the geometric locus across
which things are reflected

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:38.570
left to right and vice versa
is done with a bold, solid

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.580
line when you're looking down
parallel to the surface of the

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.830
reflection locus.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.220
Then, I will now be caught up.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:53.165
And I can set off on
something new.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:01.480
We had said that in a pattern,
very often more than one of

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:05.490
these operations are combined
in a single space.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:07.460
And one of the things that
must be present--

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.720
if the symmetry of
the entity we are

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:11.950
discussing is a crystal--

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.710
one of the things that must be
present is a translation.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.940
And so I asked last time the
question, what if we want to

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.120
say that our space has a
translational periodicity

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:26.280
described by t.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.440
And then, I add to one lattice
point a rotation operation, A

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:35.100
alpha, that has to get
translated to another location

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.180
where that operation,
A alpha, exists.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:45.190
And if A alpha exists and I
repeat that translation by a

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:49.810
rotation alpha, I'm going to
have a sheath of translations

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:52.810
all separated by a
distance alpha.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:59.095
If I single out the one that is
removed from the first by

00:22:59.095 --> 00:23:03.200
an operation of rotation A alpha
in a counterclockwise

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:07.540
direction and single out from
that sheath another one that

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:12.640
is alpha away in the clockwise
direction.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.960
Then, I have lattice points
at the end of all of these

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.040
translations.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.680
But these two guys up here
are also lattice points.

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.510
And therefore, I have mucked up
to the entire construction

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.830
unless I can claim that this
distance between these two

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:33.430
lattice points is either T or
some multiple P times T, where

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:35.540
P is an integer.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.350
And then lickety split, before
you could catch your breath in

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.580
wonder, I dropped a
perpendicular down to the

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.260
original translation.

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:44.490
This distance in here was PT.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:47.230
This distance on either
side was T times

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.120
the cosine of alpha.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:53.600
And that led me to a constraint
that alpha, that

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.260
rotation operation A alpha, if
it were to be combined with

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.080
translation, would be restricted
to values such that

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.750
the cosine of alpha was equal
to 1 minus an integer P

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.000
divided by 2.

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.690
Wow, simple, but so incredibly
profound.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.390
What came out of this
was that alpha could

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.870
either be 0 or 360 degrees.

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:23.170
That was a one-fold axis.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.420
Alpha could be 180 degrees.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.460
That was a two-fold axis.

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.750
120, which would be the
angular rotation of a

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.210
three-fold axis.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:40.150
90, that would be the operation
of a four-fold axis.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:45.090
Or 60, that would be the
operation of a six-fold axis.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.940
It's incredible.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:51.760
Anything, any pattern, any
crystal that is based on a

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:56.610
lattice can contain only these
five rotational symmetries

00:24:56.610 --> 00:25:00.630
including no symmetry at all.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:05.630
So this says a lot about what
the morphology of crystalline

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:07.450
materials are permitted to be.

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:13.790
Then, we looked at the nature
of the lattices that were

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:18.430
described by these angular
rotations.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:22.640
And we found that there were
only three types of lattices

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.095
that were required
by rotation.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.915
These were two dimensional
lattice nets.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:37.170
One was a general oblique net
which had two different

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:41.730
translations, some arbitrary
angle between them, two

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:45.730
translations, T1 and T2, which
were not equal to one another.

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.100
We would call this
the oblique net.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:55.340
Then, there was another net that
was square in the sense

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.770
that two translations,
T1 and T2, were

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.410
identical to one another--

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.480
not close, but identical.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.940
And the angle between them was
identically 90 degrees.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:11.450
This oblique net could accept
either a one-fold axis or a

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:12.470
two-fold axis.

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:14.910
This was the specialized shape
that was required by a

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.340
four-fold axis.

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:19.330
And then finally, there was
another net that looked

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:22.740
oblique except it was a
specialized oblique net.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:26.690
It had two translations, T1 and
T2, which were identical

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:33.130
just as in the square net and
an angle between them, which

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:35.460
was exactly 120 degrees.

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:38.400
And this same sort of net
could be compatible with

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:40.935
either a three-fold axis
or a six-fold axis.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.450
Then, we took the only other
operation that could be

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.210
present in a two dimensional
pattern, and this was the

00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:53.750
operation of reflection,
a mirror point, m.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:58.250
And we saw that this by itself
could require two different

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.170
sorts of specializations in a
lattice, a lattice in which

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:05.450
two directions were exactly
orthogonal but the lengths of

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.790
the translations were unequal.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.881
And then, a diamond
shaped net--

00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:14.020
and this was a new wrinkle.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.350
This was a net that had two
translations that were

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.890
Identical in length and an
arbitrary angle between them.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.080
Or alternatively, if we chose
to pick a redundant lattice,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:30.330
one that had two translations,
T1 and T2 prime which were

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.770
different but an angle between
them that was exactly 90

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:37.970
degrees, so this one we would
refer to as a rectangular

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:42.860
lattice, a rectangular net,
and this one as a centered

00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:43.810
rectangular net--

00:27:43.810 --> 00:27:46.620
same shape, but an extra lattice
point in the middle.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:00.050
Why pick a double cell, which
is redundant, takes up more,

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:02.370
and doesn't convey any
more information?

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:07.080
And the advantage comes when
you want to analytically

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.050
describe the relation between
different directions or the

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:13.350
positions of atoms
within the cell.

00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:16.900
In that case, an orthogonal
coordinate system, even if

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.120
it's not Cartesian, is of
immense advantage as opposed

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.540
to an oblique system.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.530
OK, slightly out of breath, but
that is everything we've

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:29.870
covered to this point.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:34.500
And you can find this material
discussed in the first

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:38.340
chapter, in the introduction,
and then half of the second

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.420
chapter of Berger's book if
you want to read over it.

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:46.110
OK, any questions or comments?

00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.810
All right, I wanted to say a
little bit more about lattices

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:07.040
and something with which you
are no doubt familiar, but

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.630
perhaps have some questions
about why one does it in such

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.140
an obscure, difficult way.

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:18.360
And let me introduce what's done
by an analogy which we

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.460
have around us in
everyday life.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:27.240
Let me draw a system of streets
and avenues for a city

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.410
that might be one like Boston
where the streets were laid

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:39.960
out by cows wandering around
in search of forage.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:44.080
And suppose somebody met you on
the street and said, may I

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.390
stop you here at point A
and ask you a question?

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:52.760
How do I get from point
A to point B?

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.410
That's not a vector.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.190
That's a point.

00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:58.330
How do I do that?

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:07.560
You would not say, go 342 meters
to the east and 26.4

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.670
meters to the south.

00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:13.410
That's perfectly logical that is
admirably Cartesian but you

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:17.830
wouldn't do it that way what we
just said you would say go

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:21.620
one block straight ahead, and
then turn one block to your

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.700
left, and then go down the
street to your right and turn

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.700
to your right again, and
you'll be right there.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.550
You can't miss it.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:32.620
Of course, the person in Boston
would miss it and would

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.340
have to stop a second time and
ask again and by a method of

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.020
successive approximations
eventually get to where he or

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:43.640
she would like to be.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:49.120
I submit if a system gives you
a grid, it makes sense to use

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.290
that grid as the basis vectors
of coordinate system even if

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:59.150
the intervals are different, in
two different directions,

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:03.500
and even though the intervals
might be not vectors that are

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.710
orthogonal to one another.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:09.545
If the system is periodic and
has this grid work to it, it

00:31:09.545 --> 00:31:13.740
makes sense to use that as the
basis of a coordinate system.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:20.020
So if we have a lattice that
is oblique and there are

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:27.570
lattice points defined by these
two translations, T1 and

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:37.820
T2, it makes great sense if you
want to specify the vector

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:42.510
that runs from this lattice
point to this lattice point to

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:47.740
do that by saying that this is a
lattice point that is at the

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:55.370
end of the vector
1 T1 plus 2 T2.

00:31:58.290 --> 00:32:02.000
And that, just as a system of
streets and avenues, is a lot

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:07.290
more efficient than saying go
12.2 angstroms in the x

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:12.900
direction and go 15.3 angstroms
in the y direction.

00:32:12.900 --> 00:32:16.370
What we have defined here is
something that is called a

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:17.620
rational direction.

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:26.240
And a rational direction is
something that is going to be

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.280
a direction that extends
between lattice points.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.110
And what's rational about it
is that the coefficients in

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:37.340
front of T1 and T2 that would
appear would be integers.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.450
And an integers is sometimes
referred to

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.840
as a rational number.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.680
That would be quite different
from a vector that extended

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.210
from a lattice point to, let's
say, some atom that is within

00:32:51.210 --> 00:32:53.770
the boundaries of this cell.

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.310
And this might be a radial
vector from the

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:57.650
origin to one lattice.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.880
And that could be used
to specify the atomic

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:01.350
coordinates.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:05.910
This is going to complete the
dichotomy, a feature that is

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.190
referred to as irrational.

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.590
Why?

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:15.400
Because the components of the
steps along T1, x, and along

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.110
T2, y, are going to be
fractional numbers.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.620
So you'll hit irrational
notation for directions that

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.760
go to different locations
with a unit cell.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.350
You'll use rational vectors in
directions that extend between

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:32.190
integral numbers of
lattice points.

00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.880
These directions occur all the
time when one discusses the

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.270
physical properties
of crystals.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:50.160
I'm sure in any class that
you've had that's discussed

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.610
mechanical properties, one of
the favorite topics is to

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:57.340
discuss the ways in which close

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.930
packed metals can deform.

00:33:59.930 --> 00:34:03.810
And this can be discussed easily
in terms of one layer

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.980
of close packed spheres
sliding over another.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.620
And one of the ways that the
layer can slide to go from one

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:15.070
set of close packed hollows
to another is in a

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:16.780
direction like this.

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.219
And that turns out to be
a rational direction.

00:34:19.219 --> 00:34:22.170
And these are directions in
which a close packed metal

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.190
will easily deform.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:30.449
So directions of easy plastic
deformations almost always

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:33.590
involve rational directions.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:39.110
So there is a unique application
of these sorts of

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.590
features in the discussion
of mechanical properties.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:47.960
Another thing that can happen
is that a particular

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.580
structure, if it is weakly
bonded or relatively weakly

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:57.965
bonded in one direction, if you
come down with a chisel on

00:34:57.965 --> 00:35:03.490
that plane and give it a little
tunk with a hammer, the

00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.230
crystal will fall exactly in
half and give you two very

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:10.620
smooth surfaces on either
side of some plane.

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.920
And the reason is if you look
down into the guts of the

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.150
crystal and look at the atoms
and how they're bonded

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.480
together, there may be some
direction of weak bonding

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:22.710
between atoms that is very
easily separated by some sort

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.770
of mechanical force.

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:28.280
This is true even for crystals
that are very strongly bonded.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.620
The way in which people begin
to facet diamonds, for

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:35.570
example, is to sit for a month
and study the diamond and then

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.360
decide how you're going to put a
straight edge to it and give

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:41.660
it a little tunk so that it
falls neatly into two pieces

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:45.890
at the sides that you
want to facet.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.960
Doesn't always work, so you sit
for a long time to figure

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.990
out just what you're
going to do.

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:57.110
I think diamond cutters burn
out early and have a useful

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:59.580
career that last perhaps
3 and 1/2 years.

00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.700
And then, they're burned out.

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.800
I don't know that for sure.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:03.460
But it must be a nerve
wracking way

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.660
of making an existence.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:08.020
Not a far-fetched story.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.010
At one time, I was doing a
diffraction study on a

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:15.090
material which was a low
temperature face, very

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:19.070
interesting, but formed stable
only at such low temperatures

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:21.950
that you could not make it by
cooking the components.

00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:27.240
But it had been found as a
mineral in the Swiss Alps, all

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.200
sorts of exotica attached to
this particular material.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.670
There was a particular place
up in the Alps which had a

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:40.040
very unusual chemistry involving
lead and arsenic and

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.180
thallium and sulfur--

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:45.430
not what you find in your usual
backyard rock pile.

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:48.730
And there was something like 37
unique minerals that were

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:52.570
found in this little spot that
were known nowhere else on the

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:53.970
face of the Earth.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:55.910
And I was very interested
in the atomic

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:56.940
arrangements in one of them.

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.130
So I wrote to the British Museum
that had found the sole

00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:04.510
supplier of this
material that--

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.590
back in about 1901 or so--

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:07.900
I wrote and I said,
do you have any

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.360
crystals of this stuff?

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.450
Yes.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:12.580
Would you like to study it?

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.430
And I said yes, I would.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:14.930
Well, we'd be happy
to send it.

00:37:14.930 --> 00:37:19.170
But please be careful not to
damage the morphology because

00:37:19.170 --> 00:37:22.460
it is a very rare material.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:22.980
So I said fine.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.150
I'm as careful as the
next meticulous guy.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:27.760
They sent two crystals.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.320
The crystals measured--

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.480
one of them was 2/10 of a
millimeter in diameter.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.770
One of them was about 0.15
millimeters in diameter.

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:42.230
And I was supposed to take off
a piece for study without

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.230
damaging the morphology.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:48.240
Man, I felt just like one of
these Dutch diamond cutters.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.210
I sat and I looked at those two
little suckers under the

00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:53.380
microscope for, I
think, a week.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.680
And then finally, the moment of
truth, and I took a needle

00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.785
and popped off a corner.

00:37:58.785 --> 00:38:00.640
And it went into two pieces.

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.350
One went for a microprobe
analysis to determine the

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:04.240
composition.

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.740
One of them went to a single
crystal x-ray diffraction

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.070
study to determine the
atomic arrangement.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.820
Both analyses can be done on a
very small piece of material.

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:17.400
So my story about the diamond
cutter agonizing before

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.040
looking for a cleavage or a
fracture surface is not just

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:21.960
made up fiction.

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.430
It is something that, when you
work with crystals very often,

00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:27.090
is encountered.

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:31.220
OK, cleavage planes are also
rational directions.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.580
The cleavage plane of rock
salt is legendary.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.030
And it's nice, really, to spend
an afternoon splitting

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:39.560
it up just to see how
neat it falls apart.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:48.520
OK, how are we going to denote
rational planes?

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:51.590
Talked about rational and
irrational directions, and

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:53.520
that's easy.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:59.815
How are we going to describe
rational planes in crystals?

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.250
And this is rather bizarre.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:11.240
So let me tell you what you do,
which is something you've

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:14.860
probably heard before, and
then explain why one

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:18.010
does it this way.

00:39:18.010 --> 00:39:24.020
Let's suppose we have three
vectors that are the vectors

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.560
we will use to define
the lattice.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.300
And if there is a plane hanging
on one of these

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:38.990
lattice points, everything is
translationally periodic, so

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.610
there must be a similar plane
in the same orientation that

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.930
passes through all the
lattice points.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:50.220
So let me look at a very special
plane, namely one that

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:54.280
cuts a lattice point at
an integral number of

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.840
translations, T3, and an
integral number of

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:01.330
translations, T2, and an
integral number of

00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:04.650
translations, T1.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.930
And I don't want any common
factor here, so let's look at

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:09.610
this point here.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:14.700
And now, let's connect these
lattice points together.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:20.900
And that will define
a plane uniquely.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:24.260
And what is special about this
point is that it hits a

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:27.510
lattice point on each
of these three axes.

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.185
And this is a plane that I'll
call the intercept plane.

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:40.580
There will be a similar plane
hanging on all of these other

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.060
lattice points.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:47.400
But those planes will not hit
a lattice point on the

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.990
directions of T1, T2, and T3.

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.540
This is the first one out from
the origin that does that.

00:40:55.426 --> 00:41:02.080
Now, we will use this oblique
set of vectors, T1, T2, and

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.890
T3, as the coordinate system
for specifying

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.470
direction and angles.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:10.920
So let me ask a question now
that's going to blow you away.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.630
What is the equation for the
locus of this plane If I use

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:23.010
this oblique coordinate system
based on T1, T2, and T3 as my

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:24.260
coordinate system?

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.050
Holy mackerel.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.370
What a way to wrap
up a Tuesday.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.570
Actually, it's very,
very easy.

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:37.500
First of all, it has to
be a linear equation.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.100
So it's going to be linear
in x, y, and z.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.270
So something times x, something
times y, something

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:49.690
times z equals a constant.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:53.430
That's going to define, if I use
the proper coefficients,

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:56.980
the equation for this plane.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:01.970
And let me determine quite
easily what those

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:04.170
coefficients are.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:07.920
What is the coordinate of this
point, which sits on the plane

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.280
and therefore must satisfy
this equation?

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:12.860
Well, y is 0. z is zero.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.270
So this is the point--

00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:20.620
if I am a translations out from
the origin, this is the

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.340
point x equals A.

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:28.120
So if I'm three translations
out from the origin, that

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.610
integer is the coefficient in
front of x because when y and

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.200
z are 0, if I make the constants
on the right hand

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:43.040
side equal to 1, this is
the point x equals a.

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.220
And it's nice to have one
on the right hand side.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.270
That's about as nice and neat
and tidy a constant as you

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.900
could have.

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.870
We do the same thing for this
point at the end of two

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.540
translations, T2.

00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:58.050
let's say in general that for
this intercept plane, we are

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:01.350
two translations out along T2.

00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:04.810
So for the point 0--

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:07.700
this point, 0--

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.500
if I put the number of
translations, b, in front of

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:20.620
y, This is the point y equals
b when x and z are 0.

00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:26.100
And in the same way, if we are C
translations out along T3, C

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.504
times z-- that integer--
is equal to 1.

00:43:29.504 --> 00:43:30.754
AUDIENCE: Can you explain
it again?

00:43:33.157 --> 00:43:34.011
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:35.040
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.823
What?

00:43:36.823 --> 00:43:39.522
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:39.522 --> 00:43:41.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'm saying I'm
going to [INAUDIBLE] my

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:47.520
definition at a plane which
cuts the direction of T1,

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.030
which is what I called
the variable x, at a

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.980
translations out.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.880
In this case, this is 3.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.150
This is 2.

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:56.320
And this is 1.

00:43:56.320 --> 00:44:01.890
So for this particular example,
I would have 3x plus

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:09.350
2y plus 1z equals 1 because when
y is 0 and z is 0, the

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:13.410
point on the surface is--

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:15.830
1/3.

00:44:15.830 --> 00:44:17.080
Sorry.

00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:20.680
Good question.

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.230
OK, that's a lot better.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.750
I would've gotten in much deeper
trouble if you had let

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:31.960
me persist in that.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.110
So thank you for
the correction.

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:36.370
But now, I would like to have
integers out in front here.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:41.750
So let me multiply both sides
through by A times B times C.

00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:46.820
And now, I do get something with
integers in front of x

00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:49.815
and integers in front of y.

00:44:49.815 --> 00:44:53.890
And this would be A times C,
and integers in front of z.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.650
And that's A times B equals--

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:01.560
and now on the right side, I
would have a times B times C.

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.710
So everything, every coefficient
and the term on

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:05.550
the right hand side are
products of integers.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.200
So they are all integers
themselves.

00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:23.470
OK, let me next ask the question
these planes passing

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.200
through all of the other
lattice points that are

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:30.540
contained within this little
tetrahedron of volume are

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.790
going to be equally spaced.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.710
How will I claim that these
planes are all equally spaced?

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.960
Well, that's easy just
in general terms.

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.540
Here is a lattice point.

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:45.180
There's a plane passing
through it.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:47.500
There's some lattice point
neighboring it that's out at

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:54.860
distance, D. Here is another
lattice point.

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:57.000
It has a plane passing
through it.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.290
There must be a plane out here
on D. And I'm not going to be

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.850
able to have the same
environment for every lattice

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:07.920
point unless all of these planes
have the same spacing

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:09.950
from one another.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:12.190
So to say that they pass in
lattice points in the

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.530
environment of everybody lattice
point is by definition

00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:19.585
identical is possible only if
the planes are equally spaced.

00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:23.830
Next question--

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:27.040
and I'm not going to be gutsy
enough to try to demonstrate

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.340
this in three dimensions,
so let me do it in two.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:36.770
Let us ask the question, how
many planes are there hanging

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:40.350
on all the lattice points
between the origin and the

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.600
intercept plane?

00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:48.980
And let me demonstrate that for
a two dimensional case.

00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:55.080
And I will refer you to a
drawing in Berger's book

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.740
because this is not convincing
unless you do

00:46:58.740 --> 00:47:01.630
it absolutely exactly.

00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:06.390
And to do that in front of a
live audience with chalk is

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:08.830
not always the easiest
thing in the world.

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:10.230
So here is T1.

00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:11.640
Here is T2.

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.910
And let me look at this plane.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.800
This is the intercept plane.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:21.170
A is equal to 3 and
B is equal to 2.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:24.680
Now, what I'm going to do is
to use plus and minus the

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.370
translation T1 to repeat
this intercept plane.

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:36.520
OK, I go minus T1.

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.720
And that's going to give
me a plane in here.

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.370
I'm going to go minus
T1 again.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.880
And that's going to give
me a plane in here.

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.510
So I have split the interval
between the origin and the

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.535
intercept plane into A parts.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:47:57.620
OK so far?

00:47:57.620 --> 00:48:00.220
Let me now use the
translation T2.

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:05.010
And I will use the plus and
minus the translation T2 to

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:09.660
take this stack of A planes
and repeat it B times.

00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:12.400
And that's going to take the
plane at the origin and move

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.850
it up to here.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:18.520
It's going to move the planes
into stacks like this.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:26.180
I will map the stack of
A planes B times.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:39.520
And that is going to give me A
times B intervals except if a

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.880
special condition applies.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.690
And then, I will go back
to it in a moment.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:49.715
This is the equation of
the intercept plane.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:04.730
I will argue that the three
dimensional analogy of what

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:09.440
I've done is that there will be,
if I let the translations

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.020
T1, T2, and T3 go to work, there
will be A times B times

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:20.800
C intervals between the origin
and the intercept plane.

00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.740
So if this is the intercept
plane and this is A times B

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:43.930
times C times the spacing
between the planes out from

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:50.250
the origin, then the first plane
from the origin is going

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:54.836
to happen to intercept which
is 1ABC to the first.

00:49:54.836 --> 00:49:59.880
And ABC divided by ABC turns out
to be 1 for any value of

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:00.940
A, B, and C.

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:03.880
So the first plane from the
origin is going to have the

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:12.110
simple equation be BC times x
plus AC times y plus AB times

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.710
z equals 1.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:17.850
And the second plane out from
the origin will have the same

00:50:17.850 --> 00:50:21.350
coefficients except the term
on the left will be 2.

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:25.020
Third plane will have 3 on the
right and finally the integer

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.170
ABC when we get to the
intercept plane.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:33.510
OK, now I'm ready to make a
momentous definition just as

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:35.710
we get five of the hour.

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.650
B times C is an integer.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:40.940
Let me define that integer
by a single integer.

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:45.330
And just for the heck of it,
I'll call it H. A times C is

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:45.880
an integer.

00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:51.800
Let me call that integer K.
And AB is an integer.

00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.310
Let me call that integer L.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:51:01.720
So using T1 and T2 and T3 as
the basis vectors of my

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:05.670
coordinate system, the first
plane from the origin has the

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:10.000
equation Hx plus Ky
plus Lz equals 1.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:15.000
And these three integers, H, K,
and L, are said to be the

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.110
Miller indices of this plane.

00:51:24.956 --> 00:51:25.928
PROFESSOR: Yes, sir?

00:51:25.928 --> 00:51:29.168
AUDIENCE: Just on that figure,
[INAUDIBLE] connect to the

00:51:29.168 --> 00:51:29.816
lattice points.

00:51:29.816 --> 00:51:32.489
I'm trying to make sense of why
did you put the planes in

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:33.720
between them?

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.490
PROFESSOR: OK, what I did was
I started with just these

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:41.200
three hanging on the lattice
point separated by T1.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.710
And then, I move this by T2.

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:49.360
OK, so T2 has a plane
in the middle of it.

00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.590
And it's going to move
that up to here and

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:54.110
give me another plane.

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.720
If you just draw this out--
and you're going to get a

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:58.140
problem that asks
you to do this--

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:02.300
since these integers are
mutually prime, the second

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:05.430
translation is going to
interleave planes

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:06.850
between the first set.

00:52:06.850 --> 00:52:09.660
And it gets even worse in three
dimensions because the

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:16.840
third translation, which is the
axis C translations out,

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.010
is going to interleave that
set of AB planes C times.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.180
And they have to be at
equal distances.

00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:27.370
Otherwise, the definition of
the lattice point having

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.830
identical environment
is violated.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:35.560
OK, these are the infamous
Miller indices that are the

00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:40.080
downfall of all freshman
who take 309.1.

00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:46.320
It is not necessarily a very
straightforward definition.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:51.520
But the advantage of it is that
it lets you analytically

00:52:51.520 --> 00:52:56.360
describe the locus of the
lattice planes in a very, very

00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:58.070
convenient way.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.180
Actually, let me tell you
something maybe you have not

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:02.500
heard before.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:07.300
These indices were not invented
by a fellow named

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.540
Miller who was an Englishman
who wrote a book, an early

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:13.920
book on crystallography that
incorporated this notation.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.220
The guy who invented them and
first proposed them was

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:22.990
Auguste Bravais, a very famous
French crystallographer--

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:24.440
mathematician, actually--

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:28.780
who gave his name to the three
dimensional space lattices.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.830
These are universally
known as the Bravais

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.110
lattices, 14 of them.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:33.980
It's a great name.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.280
It's music. it rolls
of the tongue--

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:39.100
Bravis, Bravais.

00:53:39.100 --> 00:53:41.080
Actually, Bravias wasn't
the first guy to

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.300
try to derive them.

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:46.700
The first guy who tried to
drive the lattices was

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.950
somebody named Frankenheim.

00:53:50.290 --> 00:53:51.890
He blew it.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:52.750
He didn't get 14.

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:56.040
He only found 13.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.575
So there's a moral here.

00:53:57.575 --> 00:54:01.050
If immortality is your game,
get it right the first time

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:04.400
because everybody has heard
of Bravais, Bravais.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.520
Nobody has heard
of Frankenheim.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.960
And for that, I say thank god.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:09.500
What a name!

00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.960
It makes you think of somebody
who's got plugs in his neck

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.610
and walks around like this
and has a green face.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:15.390
Frankenheim--

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:16.520
bah!

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:19.760
Bravais, Bravais, it really
sings to you.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:25.590
OK, I'm getting silly so it's
time to quit and take a break.

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:27.000
Come up and say hello
to Rodney.

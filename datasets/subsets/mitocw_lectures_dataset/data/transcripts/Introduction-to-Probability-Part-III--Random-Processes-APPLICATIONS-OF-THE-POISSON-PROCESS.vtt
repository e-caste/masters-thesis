00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.410
In what kind of situations
does the Poisson process arise?

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.240
In general, it
arises whenever we

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.560
have events like arrivals
that are somewhat rare,

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.180
and which happen in a
completely uncoordinated manner,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.550
so that they can show up
at any particular time.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.250
In such situations,
the number of arrivals

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.480
will be often described by a
certain distribution called

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.860
the Poisson
distribution, and which

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.530
is named after the person who
first studied this situation,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.750
who is a famous
French mathematician

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.350
by the name of
Simon Denis Poisson.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.820
An early example
where the data seems

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.920
to fit the description
of the Poisson process

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.450
is a curious one.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.690
It had to do with
deaths from horse

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.010
kicks, that is, accidental
deaths, in the Prussian army.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.110
The idea here is that
a death by horse kick

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.410
can happen pretty
much at any time.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.200
And different arrivals,
that is, different accidents

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.760
are completely uncoordinated
from each other.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.450
So the process is sort
of completely random.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.240
For more scientific
applications,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.260
it was realized that
certain physical phenomena

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.410
obey the Poisson process.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.590
Examples are the following.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.150
You have some radioactive
body which decays,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.660
and the decaying
happens once in awhile,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.880
emitting various particles.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.860
Different particles get emitted
at completely random times

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.390
in a completely
uncoordinated manner

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.460
and, therefore, this
process is actually

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.039
described as a Poisson process.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.900
Conversely, if you have
a photo detector who

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.710
looks at a very
weak light source.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.030
So photons arrive from that
weak light source one at a time.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.810
And you look at the time at
which photons hit the detector.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.880
Then, the process
of photon arrivals

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.560
is very well-modeled
by the Poisson process.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.800
For more modern
applications, if you

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.910
look at the financial markets
and the times at which

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.170
certain very unexpected events,
like certain market shocks,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.160
occur, a model that
is commonly employed

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.610
is to use a Poisson
process model.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.100
Although this is not an
entirely accurate model,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.030
it provides a first approach
to situations like this.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.750
But these days, the
predominant source

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.930
of applications for
the Poisson process

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.260
is in various
service operations.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.940
You are the phone company.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.746
Phone calls get placed
at random times.

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:38.620
And because there are
several people involved

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.900
who are uncoordinated
with each other,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.870
those calls get placed at
completely random times.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.079
And the same story
goes about, let's

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.130
say, service requests
to a web server,

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.020
service requests to
any kind of company.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.079
So, many applications that
are being studied these days

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.540
and which rest on Poisson models
involve service operations

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.510
of this type.

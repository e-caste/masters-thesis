WEBVTT

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.840
MICHALE FEE: So today, we're
going to start a new topic.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.740
We're going to be talking about
the propagation of signals

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.610
in dendrites and axons.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.790
So the model that
we've considered so far

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.430
is just a soma.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.280
We basically had a kind of a
spherical shell of insulator

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.160
that we've been modeling that
has different kinds of ion

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.280
channels in it that allow the
cell to do things like generate

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.630
an action potential.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.660
So the reason that
we've been doing

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.590
that is because in most
vertebrate neurons,

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.580
the soma is the sight in the
neuron at which the decision

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.470
to make an action
potential is made.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.880
So all kinds of inputs
come in, and then the soma

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.790
integrates those inputs,
accumulates charge,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.660
reaches some spiking
threshold, and then generates

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.080
an action potential.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.870
And so that's where
the decision is about

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.250
whether a neuron is
going to spike or not.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.930
Now, in real neurons,
relatively few of the inputs

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.490
actually come onto the soma.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.000
Most of the synaptic
inputs, most of the inputs

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.350
arrive onto the dendrites, which
are these branching cylinders

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.000
of cell membrane.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.830
And most of the
synapses actually

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.240
form onto the dendrite at
some distance from the soma.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.770
There are synapses that
form onto the soma.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.810
But the vast
majority of synapses

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.180
form onto these dendrites.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.220
And sometimes,
those synapses can

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.590
be as far away as 1 or
2 millimeters for very

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.350
large neurons in cortex.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.960
So there's a population
of neurons in deep layer V

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.300
some of you may have heard
about that have dendrites

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.700
that reach all the
way up into layer I.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.280
And those cells can be--

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.660
those dendrites can be as long
as a couple of millimeters.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.259
So we really have to think
about what this means,

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.960
how signals get from out here in
the dendrite down to the soma.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.890
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.310
So the most important thing
that we're going to do

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.180
is to simplify
this-- by the way,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.575
anybody know what
kind of cell this is?

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:30.465
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:31.215
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:32.920
It's a Purkinje cell.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.590
And it was one of the--

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.190
this is one of the cells
that Ramon Cajal drew back

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.310
in the late 1800s.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.950
So the most important
thing we're going to do

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.170
is to simplify this very
complex dendritic arborization.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.630
And we're going
to basically think

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.830
of it as a single cylinder.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.070
Now mathematically, there
are reasons why this is not

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.550
actually unreasonable.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.650
You can write down--
if you analyze

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.600
the structure of
dendritic trees,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.120
there is something
about the way the ratio

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.300
of the diameters of
the different dendrites

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.430
as they converge to
form thicker branches

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.290
as you get closer
and closer to closer

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.500
to the soma that
mathematically makes

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.800
this not a bad approximation
for an extended dendritic arbor

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.430
like this.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.850
So we're going to think
about the problem of having

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.170
a synapse out here on this
cylindrical approximation

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.980
to a dendrite.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.500
And we're going to
imagine that we're

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.140
measuring the voltage
down here at the soma

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.260
or at different positions
along the dendrite.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.630
And we're going to ask, how
does synaptic input out here

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.025
on this cylinder affect
the membrane potential

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.200
in the dendrite and
down here at the soma?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.700
And the basic conceptual
picture that you should have

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.770
is that those signals propagate
some distance down the soma

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.070
but gradually leak out.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.790
And there's a very simple kind
of intuitive picture, which

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.190
is that the dendrite you
can think of this as a leaky

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.540
pipe or a leaky hose.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.070
So imagine you took a
piece of garden hose

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.660
and you poked holes
in the side of it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.310
or so that they're
kind of close together.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.810
And when you hook this
up to the water faucet,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.710
you turn the water on,
that some of that water

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.160
flows down the hose.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.410
But some of it also leaks
out through the holes

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:47.710
that you drilled.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.580
And you can see that
eventually the water is all

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.170
going to leak out
through the sides,

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.630
and it's not going to go all
the way down to the other end

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.820
to get to your
hydrangeas or whatever

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.830
it is that you're watering.

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.620
And so you can see
that that signal isn't

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.900
going to get very far
if the holes you drilled

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.710
are big enough.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.170
And the general
kind of analogy here

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.920
is that current is like
the flow of the water.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.800
Electrical current here is
like water current flowing down

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.730
the pipe.

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.630
And voltage is like pressure.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.270
So the higher the pressure here,
the higher the current flow

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.870
you'll get.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.370
And we're going to develop
an electrical circuit

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.030
model for a dendrite
like this that's

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.460
going to look like a set
of resistors going down

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.130
the axis of the dendrite
and a set of resistors

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.050
that go across the membrane.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.980
And you can see that each
little piece of membrane

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.810
here, a little piece
of the dendrite

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:56.430
is going to look like a
resistor divider, where you have

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.060
a resistor along
the axial direction

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.160
and a resistance
across the membrane.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.880
And as you make a longer and
longer piece of dendrite,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.310
you're going to get
additional voltage dividers.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.730
Each voltage divider
divides the voltage

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:14.520
by some constant factor.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.290
And as you stack
those things up,

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:20.610
the voltage drops by some
constant factor per unit length

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:21.450
of the dendrite.

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:22.980
And so you can
see-- anybody want

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.340
to just take a guess of
what kind of functional form

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.230
that would give
you if you divide

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.450
the voltage by some
constant factor

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.013
each unit length
of the dendrite?

00:06:33.013 --> 00:06:33.930
AUDIENCE: Exponential.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:34.972
MICHALE FEE: Exponential.

00:06:34.972 --> 00:06:36.640
That's right.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.270
And that's where this
exponential falloff comes from.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.110
So today, we're going to
do the following things.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.810
And we're going
to basically draw

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.020
a circuit diagram, an
electrical equivalent

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.030
circuit of a piece of dendrite.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.510
And I would like you to be able
to make that drawing if you're

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.040
asked to.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.650
We're going to be able
to plot the voltage

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.140
in a piece of dendrite
as a function of distance

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.080
for the case of a dendrite
that has leaky walls

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.540
and for the case of a dendrite
that has non-leaky walls.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.720
And we're going to describe
the concept of a length

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.450
constant, which I'll tell
you right now is just

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:27.490
the 1 over the distance at which
the voltage falls by 1 over e

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.490
as a function of length.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.580
So it's some length over
which the voltage falls

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.600
by some amount 1 over e.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.250
We're going to go over how
that length constant depends

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.270
on the radius of the dendrite.

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:45.180
It's a function of the size.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.370
And also, we're going
to describe the concept

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.290
of an electrotonic length.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:50.820
And then finally,
we're going to go

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.880
to some sort of extreme
simplifications,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:57.090
even beyond taking that
very complex dendrite,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.010
simplifying it as a cylinder.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.320
We're going to go to
an even simpler case

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.130
where we can just treat the
cell as a soma connected

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.620
to a resistor
connected by a resistor

00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:10.350
to a separate compartment.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:12.900
And that's sort of the
most extreme simplification

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:13.800
of a dendrite.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.520
But, in fact, it's an
extremely powerful one

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.100
from which you can
get a lot of intuition

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.910
about how signals are
integrated in dendrites.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.470
So we're going to analyze
a piece of dendrite

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.980
using a technique called
finite element analysis.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.480
We're going to
imagine-- we're going

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.270
to approximate our piece
of dendrite as a cylinder

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.770
of constant radius a, an
axial dimension that we're

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:45.230
going to label x.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.590
We're going to break up this
cylinder into little slices.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.720
So imagine we just
took a little knife,

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:55.220
and we cut little
slices of this dendrite.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.020
And they're going to
be very small slices.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.290
And we're going to model
each one of those slices

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:02.153
with a separate little circuit.

00:09:02.153 --> 00:09:04.070
And then we're going to
connect them together.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:05.778
And we're going to
let the length of that

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:07.010
slice be delta x.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:10.640
And then eventually, we're
going to let delta x go to 0.

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.950
We're going to get some
differential equations that

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.740
describe that relationship
between the voltage

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.510
and the current in
this piece of dendrite.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:27.290
So let's start with a model for
the inside of this cylinder.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.540
So remember, in a
cell, we had the inside

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.720
of the cell modeled by a wire.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.650
In a dendrite, we
can't just use a wire.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.960
And the reason is that
current is going to flow along

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.663
the inside of the dendrite.

00:09:42.663 --> 00:09:44.080
It's going to flow,
and it's going

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.850
to experience voltage drops.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:50.020
So we have to actually
model the resistance

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.550
of the inside of the dendrite.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.290
And we're going to model
it like the resistance

00:09:56.290 --> 00:10:00.060
between each one of those slices
with a resistor value little r.

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:07.390
We're going to model the outside
of the axon or the dendrite

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:08.140
as a wire.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:11.170
And the reason we're going to
put resistors inside and just

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:15.700
a wire outside is because the
resistance-- remember the axon

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.260
or dendrite is very small.

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.110
In the brain, dendrites might
be about 2 microns across.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.410
So the current is constrained
to a very small space.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.840
When currents then
flow outside, they're

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.280
flowing in a much larger volume,
and so the effective resistance

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:31.760
is much smaller.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.270
And we're going to essentially
ignore that resistance

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.760
and treat the outside
as just a wire.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:43.790
Now we have to
model the membrane.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.730
Anybody want to take
a guess how we're

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:48.125
going to model the membrane?

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:51.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:53.500
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.470
I heard two correct answers.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:57.830
What did you say Jasmine?

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.830
AUDIENCE: The capacitor.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:10:59.490
MICHALE FEE: Capacitor.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:00.160
And?

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:04.720
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.220
Whoops.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.435
I wasn't quite there.

00:11:06.435 --> 00:11:07.940
Let's put that up.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:08.440
Good.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.200
So we're going to
have a capacitance.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.360
We're going to imagine
that this membrane might

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.390
have an ion selective ion
channel with some conductance G

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:21.760
sub l and an equilibrium or
reversal potential E sub l.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.470
Now coming back to these terms
here, we're going to model.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.660
We're going to write
down the voltage

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.110
in each one of our little
slices of the dendrite.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.270
So let's do that.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.740
Let's just pick one of
them as V, the voltage,

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.732
at position, x, and time t.

00:11:41.732 --> 00:11:44.800
The voltage in the
next slides over

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.710
is going to be V at
x plus delta x of t.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.760
And the voltage in this slice
over here is V of x minus delta

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.400
x and t.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.450
So now, we can also write down
the current that goes axially

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.760
through that piece of--

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.140
that slice of our dendrite.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:09.070
We're going to call
that I of x and t.

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.420
And we can write down also the
current in every other time--

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.950
in every other slice
of the dendrite, I

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:16.930
of x minus delta x and t.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:25.700
And we're going to model
this piece of membrane

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:30.290
in each one of those
slices as well.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.400
Any questions about that?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.690
That's the basic setup.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:39.400
That's the basic finite
element model of a dendrite.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.450
No questions?

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:49.590
Now we also have to model the
current through the membrane.

00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:54.300
That's going to be I
sub m, m for membrane.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.730
And it's going to be
a current per unit

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.490
length of the dendrite.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.640
We're going to imagine
that there's current

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.180
flowing from the inside to the
outside through the membrane.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.180
And there's going to be
some current per unit

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.285
length of the dendrite.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:15.630
And we can also imagine that
we have current being injected,

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.660
let's say, through a synapse
or through an electrode

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.620
that we can also model as
coming in at any position x.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:28.125
And this is, again, current
per unit length times delta x.

00:13:28.125 --> 00:13:29.000
Does that make sense?

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.880
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:48.685
is we're going to write
down the relation between V

00:13:48.685 --> 00:13:53.260
in each node and the current
going through that node.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.710
So let's do that.

00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:56.440
We're going to use Ohm's law.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:00.130
So the voltage difference
between here and here

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:05.235
is just going to be the
current times that resistance.

00:14:05.235 --> 00:14:06.110
Does that make sense?

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:07.910
We're just going
to use Ohm's law--

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:09.990
very simple.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:19.870
So V of x and t minus
V of x plus delta x, t

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:23.830
is just equal to little
r times that current.

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.560
And now we're going
to rewrite this.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.090
Let's divide both sides of
this equation by delta x.

00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:38.530
So you see 1 over delta x V
of x minus V of x plus delta

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.300
x is equal to little r over
delta x times the current.

00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:48.540
And can anyone tell me what that
thing is as delta x goes to 0?

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.190
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.430
It's the derivative of--
it's the spatial derivative

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:56.480
of the voltage.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.910
That's just the
definition of derivative

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:00.650
when delta x goes to 0.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.020
So let's write that out.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.610
Notice that it's the
negative of the derivative

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.420
because the derivative
would have V

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.490
of x plus delta x minus V of x.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:12.730
So it's a negative
of the derivative.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:18.660
So negative dv/dx is
equal to some resistance

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:19.750
times the current.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:23.010
And notice that
this capital R sub a

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.430
is called the axial
resistance per unit length.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:33.060
It's this resistance per
unit length of the dendrite.

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:38.760
Now notice that if you pass
current down that dendrite,

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:42.540
the voltage drop is
going to keep increasing.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.060
The resistance is going to
keep increasing the longer

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.710
that piece of dendrite is.

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:48.750
So you can think
about resistance

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.970
in a piece of dendrite
more appropriately

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.620
as resistance per unit length.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.530
So there's Ohm's law--

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.060
minus dv/dx equals axial
resistance per unit length

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:03.810
times the current.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.298
Any questions?

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.370
And notice that
according to this,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.910
current flow to the
right, positive I

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.650
is defined as current
to the right here

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.650
produces a negative
gradient in the voltage.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.280
So the voltage is high on this
side and low on that side.

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.028
So the slope is negative.

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.360
So now let's take
this, and let's

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.080
analyze this for some
simple cases where

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.540
we have no membrane current.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.880
So we're going to
just ignore those.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.380
And we're just going to include
these axial resistances.

00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.000
And we're going to analyze
what this equation tells us

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.572
about the voltage
inside of the dendrite.

00:16:53.572 --> 00:16:56.160
Does that makes sense?

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.330
So let's do that.

00:16:57.330 --> 00:17:03.290
So if we take that equation,
we can write down the current

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.390
at, let's say, these
two different nodes--

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.450
I of x minus delta x and I of x.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.560
And because there are
no membrane currents,

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.180
you can see that
those two currents

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.369
have to be equal to each other.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.670
Kirchoff's Current Law says
that the current into this node

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:22.010
has to equal the current
out of that node.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.619
So if there are no
membrane currents,

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:26.420
there's nothing
leaking out here,

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.910
then those two currents
have to equal each other.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.350
And we can call that I0.

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.670
So now, dv/dx is minus
axial resistance times I0.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.820
And what does that tell us
about how the voltage changes

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:48.080
in a piece of dendrite if
there's no membrane current,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.612
if there's no leaky membrane?

00:17:50.612 --> 00:17:52.070
There's no leakage
in the membrane.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.730
If dv/dx is a constant,
what does it tell us?

00:18:06.005 --> 00:18:07.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:08.260
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:09.520
But decreases how?

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.780
What functional form?

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.720
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.553
It changes linearly.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.410
So if there are no
membrane conductances,

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.585
then the membrane
potential changes linearly.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.660
So you can see that the voltage
as a function of position--

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:28.700
sorry I forgot to
label that voltage--

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.790
just changes linearly
from some initial voltage

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.960
to some final voltage
over some length l.

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:41.710
We're considering a case of a
piece of dendrite of length l.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:42.476
Yes?

00:18:42.476 --> 00:18:47.592
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:47.592 --> 00:18:48.300
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.460
So I just rewrote this equation.

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.880
Sorry, I just rewrote this
equation moving the minus sign

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.210
to that side.

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.710
Yep.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.710
Good.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.810
Now you can see that the delta
V that the voltage difference

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.490
from the left side
to the right side

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.810
is just the total resistance
times the current-- just Ohm's

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:17.060
law again.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:20.030
And the total resistance
is the axial resistance

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.880
per unit length
times the length.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.530
Really simple.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.130
Voltage changes linearly.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:30.640
If you don't have any
membrane conductances,

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.400
and you can just write
down the relation

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.500
between the voltage
difference on the two

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:37.060
sides and the current.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.630
So, in general, let's
think a little bit more

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:49.940
about this problem of being able
to what you need to write down

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.820
the solution to this equation.

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.840
It's a very simple equation.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:56.420
If you integrate
this over x, you

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:58.940
can see that the voltage
as a function of position

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.320
is some initial voltage
minus a resistance

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:06.822
times the current times x.

00:20:06.822 --> 00:20:08.930
And that, again,
just looks like this.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.540
That's where that
solution came from.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.400
It's just integrating
this over x.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.040
And you can see that
in order to write down

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.890
the solution to this equation,
we need a couple of things.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.520
We need to either know the
voltages at the beginning

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.380
and end, or we need
to know the current.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.040
We need to know some combination
of those three things.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.670
So let's write down
the voltage here.

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.790
Let's call it V0.

00:20:33.790 --> 00:20:38.730
Let's write down the
voltage there, V sub l,

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:40.110
and plug those in.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.560
And you can see that--

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.540
there's V0.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:44.800
There's V sub l.

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.600
You can see that if you know
any two of those quantities--

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.860
V0, V sub l, or Io--

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.450
you can calculate the third.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:56.200
So if you know V0 and Vl, you
can calculate the current.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.010
If you know V0 and the current,
you can calculate V sub l.

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:06.100
That is the concept of
boundary conditions.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.750
You can write down the
voltages or the currents

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:13.570
at some positions
on the dendrite

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:18.370
and figure out
the total solution

00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:21.220
to the voltage
[AUDIO OUT] of position.

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:23.140
Does that make sense?

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.170
If you don't know some
of those quantities,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.220
you can't write down the
solution to the equation.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.530
It's just the simple
idea that when

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.420
you integrate a
differential equation,

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.000
you need to have an
initial condition in order

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.810
to actually solve the equation.

00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:44.960
Any questions about that?

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.830
So let's think about a couple
of different kinds of boundary

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.200
conditions that you
might encounter.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.670
So this boundary condition
right here-- so let's

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:01.750
say that we inject a
x amount of current I0

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.540
into a piece of dendrite.

00:22:04.540 --> 00:22:06.430
And we take that
piece of dendrite

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.110
and we inject
current on one end,

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:12.520
and we cut the other
end so that it's open.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.860
What does that produce
at the other end?

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.923
So we have a wire that describes
the inside of the dendrite.

00:22:18.923 --> 00:22:21.340
We have a wire that describes
the outside of the dendrite.

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:25.720
And if you cut the end of the
dendrite off so that they're--

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:28.610
it's leaky-- so
it's an open end--

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:31.734
what does that look
like electrically?

00:22:31.734 --> 00:22:34.350
Like what's the word for--

00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:36.770
like those two wires
are touching each other.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:38.510
What's that called?

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:40.650
They're shorts.

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.310
If you cut the end
of a dendrite off,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.740
you've created a short circuit.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:48.700
The inside is connected
to the outside.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.170
So that's called an open
end boundary condition.

00:22:53.170 --> 00:22:58.657
And what can you say about
the voltage at this end?

00:22:58.657 --> 00:23:00.240
If the outside is
[AUDIO OUT] what can

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.465
you say about the voltage
inside the dendrite at that end?

00:23:05.465 --> 00:23:06.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.080
MICHALE FEE: It's 0.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:08.860
Good.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.620
So we have injected current.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:14.650
We have V0, the
voltage at this end.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.050
And we know, if we
have an open end,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.780
that the voltage here is 0.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.340
Now we can write down.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.310
We know that the
initial voltage is V0.

00:23:24.310 --> 00:23:28.180
The voltage at position L is 0.

00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:31.640
And now you can--

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.410
you know that the current here
is equal to the current there,

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:40.990
and you can write down
the equation and solve V0.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:46.960
So V0 is just the resistance,
the total resistance

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.420
of the dendrite times
the injected current.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:58.550
And that Rin is known
as input impedance.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:00.690
It's just the resistance
of the dendrite.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.930
It tells you how
much voltage change

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:10.740
you will get if you inject
a given amount of current.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:11.240
All right.

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.680
Any questions about that?

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.690
Let's consider another case.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.680
Rather than having an open end,
let's leave [? the end of ?]

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:23.660
the dendrite closed so
that it's sealed closed.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.440
So we're going to consider
a piece of dendrite

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.720
that, one end, we're
injecting current in,

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.842
and the other end is closed.

00:24:31.842 --> 00:24:33.800
So what do you think
that's going to look like?

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.470
It's called a closed end.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.170
What does that look like here?

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:40.490
It's an open circuit.

00:24:40.490 --> 00:24:44.610
Those two wires are not
connected to each other.

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:47.910
There's no resistance
between them.

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:52.190
Let's say we define
the voltage here as V0.

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:53.690
What can you say--
well, what you

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.750
can say about the current
there is that the current is 0,

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.670
because it's an open circuit.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.020
There's no current flowing.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.572
And so the current flowing
through this at this end is 0.

00:25:05.572 --> 00:25:07.370
Does that make sense?

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:11.090
So what can you say about
the current everywhere?

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:11.590
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:12.560
MICHALE FEE: It's 0.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:16.170
And what can you say about
the voltage everywhere?

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:16.710
It's V0.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.170
Exactly.

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:22.690
So the voltage
everywhere becomes V0.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.940
And the input impedance?

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.970
Anybody want to guess what
the input impedance is?

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:34.440
How much-- what's the ratio
of the voltage at this end

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:35.790
and the current at this end?

00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:41.525
AUDIENCE: Infinite?

00:25:41.525 --> 00:25:42.650
MICHALE FEE: It's infinite.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:43.192
That's right.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.700
So we're just trying to build
some intuition about how

00:25:50.700 --> 00:25:53.040
voltage looks
[AUDIO OUT] of distance

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.130
for one special case, which
is a piece of dendrite

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:03.530
of some finite length for which
you have no membrane currents.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:10.660
And you can see that the voltage
profile you get is linear,

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:14.260
and the slope of it depends
on the boundary conditions,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.690
depends on whether
the piece of dendrite

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:19.165
has a sealed end,
whether it's open.

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:27.260
All right.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:29.360
So now we're going to
come back to the case

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.810
where we have membrane
currents, and we're

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.140
going to derive the
general solution

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:43.550
to the voltage in a piece
of dendrite for the case

00:26:43.550 --> 00:26:46.070
where we have membrane
capacitance and membrane

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.450
currents.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:48.950
All right.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.970
And I don't expect you to
be able to reproduce this,

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:55.340
but we're going to derive
what's called the cable

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.640
equation, which is the general
mathematical description,

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.080
the most general mathematical
description for the voltage

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:08.210
in a cylindrical
tube, of which--

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:09.990
that's what dendrites look like.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:13.490
So we're going to write down
that differential equation,

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:16.520
and I want you to just
see what it looks like

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:18.573
and where it comes
from, but I don't expect

00:27:18.573 --> 00:27:19.740
you to be able to derive it.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:24.970
All right.

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.990
So let's come back to this
simple model that we started.

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:34.300
We're going to put our model
for the membrane back in.

00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:40.060
Remember, that's a capacitor
and a conductance in parallel.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:45.680
We're going to-- we can write
down the membrane current,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.230
and we're going to have an
injected current per unit

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:49.260
length.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:51.020
So Kirchoff's
current law tells us

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:56.690
the sum of all of those currents
into each node has to be 0.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.795
So let's just write down--

00:27:58.795 --> 00:28:00.170
let's just write
down an equation

00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:02.840
that sums together all of
those and sets them to 0.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.400
So the membrane current
leaking out minus that

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.930
injected current coming in.

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.380
They have positive signs because
one is defined as positive

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:17.150
going into the dendrite,
and the other one

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:20.540
is defined as
positive going out.

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.580
So those two, the
membrane currents,

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.810
plus the current going out this
way minus the current coming

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.910
in that way is 0.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.660
So we're going to do the
same trick we did last time.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.700
We're going to
divide by delta x.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:42.350
So, again, membrane current per
unit length times the length

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:44.630
of this finite element.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:46.010
We're going to
divide by delta x.

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.630
So this thing right
here, i membrane minus i

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:55.760
electrode, I guess, equals minus
1 over delta x I of x minus I

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.250
of x minus delta x.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.480
So what is this?

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.130
You've seen something
like that before.

00:29:03.130 --> 00:29:05.310
It's just a derivative.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:10.130
First derivative of I
with respect to position.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.460
So now what you see is
that the membrane current

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.090
minus the injected current is
just the first derivative of I.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.010
So hang in there.

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.530
We're going to substitute
that with something that

00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.660
depends on voltage.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:25.140
So how do we do that?

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.170
We're going to take Ohm's law.

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:28.460
There's Ohm's law.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.610
Let's take the derivative of
that with respect to position.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.930
So now we get the second
derivative of voltage

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.620
with respect to position
is just equal to minus

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:40.750
Ra times the first
derivative of current.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:47.310
And you can see we can just take
this and substitute it there.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:51.270
So here's what we get, that the
second derivative of voltage

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:57.480
with respect to position is
just equal to the membrane

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.440
or injected current coming into
the dendrite at any position.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.130
So the curvature of the
voltage, how curved it is,

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:10.865
just depends on what's coming
in through the membrane.

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.110
Remember, in the case where
we had no membrane current

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.530
and no injected current,
the curvature was 0,

00:30:20.530 --> 00:30:24.280
d2V dx squared is 0, which,
if the curvature is 0,

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.423
then what do you have?

00:30:26.423 --> 00:30:27.090
A straight line.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.820
Now, we're going to plug
in the right equation

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.250
for our membrane current.

00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:41.906
What is that?

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:43.050
That we know.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.660
It's just a sum of two terms.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:46.180
What is it?

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.580
It's the sum of--

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:53.220
remember, this is going to be
the same as our soma model.

00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:53.940
What was that?

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.590
We had two terms.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.330
What were they?

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:00.690
The current through the
membrane in the model,

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:02.850
in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is?

00:31:06.024 --> 00:31:07.176
What's that?

00:31:07.176 --> 00:31:08.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.340
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.270
It's a capacitive current
and a membrane ionic current.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:15.530
So let's just plug that in.

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:19.500
We're just going to substitute
into here the current

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.060
through the capacitor
and the current

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.490
through this conductance.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:30.515
That's just C dV dt
G times V minus EL.

00:31:30.515 --> 00:31:35.690
It's a capacitive part
and a resistive part.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:38.080
Now, the capacitance
is a little funny.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.270
It's capacitance per unit length
times the length of the element

00:31:43.270 --> 00:31:43.840
plus--

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.540
and the [AUDIO OUT] is
conductance per unit length

00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:48.355
times the length of
our finite element.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.250
Capacitance per unit length
and ionic conductance

00:31:56.250 --> 00:31:58.000
per unit length.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.730
And we're going to
plug that into there.

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.210
We're first going to notice that
this E leak is just an offset,

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:06.370
so we can just ignore it.

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.260
We can just set it to 0.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:11.770
We can always add it
back later if we want.

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.650
We divide both sides by the
membrane conductance per unit

00:32:14.650 --> 00:32:17.510
length to get this equation.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:20.440
And that's called
the cable equation.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:24.310
It's got a term with the
second derivative of voltage

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:26.740
with respect to
position, and it's

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.920
got a term that's the
first derivative of voltage

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.250
with respect to time.

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.160
That's because of the capacitor.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:43.080
And then it's got a term that
just depends on [AUDIO OUT]..

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.530
Now, that's the most
general equation.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:50.240
It describes how the voltage
changes in a dendrite

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:52.230
if you inject a
pulse of current,

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:56.125
how that current will propagate
down the dendrite or down

00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:56.625
an axon.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.960
We're going to take
a simplifying case.

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:08.940
Next, we're going to study the
case just of the steady state

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.760
solution to this.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:15.770
But I want you to
see this and to see

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:22.710
how it was derived just using
finite element analysis,

00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:28.080
deriving Ohm's law in a
one-dimensional continuous

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.100
medium.

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.150
And by plugging in the
equation for the membrane that

00:33:33.150 --> 00:33:36.500
includes the capacitive
and resistive parts,

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.440
you can derive
this full equation

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.230
for how the voltage changes
in a piece of dendrite.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.720
Now, there are a couple of
interesting constants here

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.160
that are important--

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.960
lambda and tau.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.520
So lambda has units of length.

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.370
Notice that all of
the denominators

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.750
here have units of voltage.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:59.530
So this is voltage
per distance squared.

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:01.030
So in order to have
the right units,

00:34:01.030 --> 00:34:02.770
you have to multiply
by something

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.990
that's distance squared.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:07.970
This is voltage per
unit time, so you

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:12.190
have to multiply by something
that has units of time.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:14.969
So that is the length
constant right there,

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:16.830
and that is a time constant.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:20.489
And the length constant
is defined as 1

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.739
over membrane conductance.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:27.010
That's the conductance of the
membrane, through the membrane,

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:32.429
and this is the axial
resistance down the dendrite.

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:36.699
So this is conductance
per unit length,

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:39.940
and this is resistance
per unit length.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:42.219
And when you multiply
those things together,

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:47.045
you get two per unit length
down in the denominator.

00:34:47.045 --> 00:34:48.670
So when you put those
in the numerator,

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:51.060
you get length squared.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.480
And then you take
the square root,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.870
and that gives you
units of length.

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.960
The time constant is
just the capacitance

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.900
per unit length divided by the
conductance per unit length.

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.060
And that is the
membrane time constant,

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.490
and that's exactly the
same as the membrane time

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:09.780
constant that we
had for our cell.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.260
It's a property of the
membrane, not the geometry.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.250
So any questions about that?

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.400
It was-- it's a lot.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.610
I just wanted you to see it.

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:21.333
Yes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:21.333 --> 00:35:25.715
AUDIENCE: Like, two
slides ago [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:25.715 --> 00:35:26.840
MICHALE FEE: This one, or--

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.412
AUDIENCE: One more
slide [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:29.412 --> 00:35:30.370
MICHALE FEE: Yes, here.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.268
AUDIENCE: So when you plug that
in for the derivative of V,

00:35:33.268 --> 00:35:37.293
were we not assuming that there
was no membrane [INAUDIBLE]??

00:35:37.293 --> 00:35:37.960
MICHALE FEE: No.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.170
That equation is still correct.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.220
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:42.220 --> 00:35:45.550
MICHALE FEE: It's-- voltage
is the derivative with respect

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:49.400
to position as a function
of the axial current.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.080
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:50.747
MICHALE FEE: OK?

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:04.300
Remember, going back
up to here, notice

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.650
that when we derive this
equation right here,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:11.560
we didn't even have to
include these membrane.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.797
They don't change anything.

00:36:12.797 --> 00:36:13.630
It's just Ohm's law.

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:16.300
It's the voltage here
minus the voltage

00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:19.630
there has to equal the current
flowing through that resistor.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.300
Doesn't matter what other
currents-- whether current

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.980
is flowing in other
directions here.

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:24.800
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:27.410
MICHALE FEE: Does
that make sense?

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:29.700
The current through
that resistor

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.610
is just given by the
voltage difference

00:36:32.610 --> 00:36:34.520
on either side of it.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.240
That's Ohm's law.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:46.430
So now we're going to
take a simple example.

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.010
We're going to
solve that equation

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.550
for the case of steady state.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:53.890
How are we going to
take the steady state?

00:36:53.890 --> 00:36:57.610
How are we going to
find the steady state

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:59.350
version of this equation?

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.210
Any idea?

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:02.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:03.310
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.320
We just set dV dt
to 0, and we're

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:09.990
left with this equals that.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.770
So we're going to take
a piece of our cable,

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.500
and we're going
to imagine that we

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.750
take a piece of dendrite
that's infinitely long

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.060
in either direction.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.840
And somewhere here in the middle
of it, we're going to inject--

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:25.590
we're going to put an
electrode, and we're

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.755
going to inject current
at one position.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:36.760
So it's injecting
current at position 0.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.110
How many of you have heard of
a delta function, a Dirac delta

00:37:40.110 --> 00:37:40.610
function?

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:41.110
OK.

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:44.220
So we're going to
define the current

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:47.400
as a function of position
as just a current times

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.160
a Dirac delta function
of x, that just says

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.800
that all the current is
going in at position 0,

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:58.020
and no current is
going in anywhere else.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:00.440
So the Dirac delta
function is just--

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.270
it's a peaky thing that is
very narrow and very tall, such

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:07.190
that when you integrate
over it, you get a 1.

00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:16.480
So we're going to go to
the steady state solution.

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:18.540
And now let's write down that.

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:22.310
So there's the steady
state cable equation.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.230
And we're going to inject
current at a single point.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:26.817
So that's what it looks like.

00:38:26.817 --> 00:38:28.400
Does anyone know the
solution to this?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:31.640
Notice, what this says
is we have a function.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.320
It's equal to the second
derivative of that function.

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.470
Anybody know?

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:42.780
There's only one
function that does this.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.790
It's an exponential.

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:45.930
That's right.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:51.090
So the solution to this
equation is an exponential.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:57.740
V of position is V0, some
voltage in the middle,

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.020
e to the minus x over lambda.

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.580
Why do I have an absolute value?

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.650
What is the voltage
going to look like if I

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.290
inject current right here?

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.850
You're going to have
current flowing.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.183
Where's the current going to go?

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.680
If I inject current into the
middle of a piece of dendrite,

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.290
is it all going to go this way?

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:17.790
No.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.260
What's it going to do?

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.385
It's going to go both ways.

00:39:23.328 --> 00:39:25.620
And the current-- the voltage
is going to be high here,

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:30.560
and it's going to fall as
you go in both directions.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.580
That's why we have an
absolute value here.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:35.700
So the voltage is going
to start at some V0 that

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.870
depends on how much
current we're injecting,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:44.010
and it's going to drop
exponentially on both sides.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:48.930
And notice what's right here.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:55.970
The lambda tells us
the 1 over e point,

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.150
how far away the 1 over e
point of the voltage is.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.890
What that means is
that the voltage is

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:06.960
going to fall to 1 over e
of V0 at a distance lambda

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:11.815
from the side at which
the current is injected.

00:40:11.815 --> 00:40:12.840
Does that make sense?

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:16.980
That is the steady
state space constant.

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:19.632
It has units of length.

00:40:19.632 --> 00:40:24.650
It's how far away do you have
to go so that the voltage falls

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:26.390
to 1 over--

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:33.405
falls to 1 over 2.7 of
the initial voltage.

00:40:42.156 --> 00:40:44.330
Any questions?

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.640
It's pretty simple.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:53.110
We took an unusually
complicated route to get there,

00:40:53.110 --> 00:40:56.650
but that's the-- the nice
thing about that is you've seen

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:00.180
the most general
solution to how a cable--

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:03.070
a dendrite will behave when
you inject current into it.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.780
So now we can
calculate the current

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.070
as a function of position.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:14.540
Any idea how to do that?

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.620
What-- if you know
voltage, what do you

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.470
use to calculate current?

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:21.093
Which law?

00:41:21.093 --> 00:41:21.760
AUDIENCE: Ohm's.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.410
MICHALE FEE: Ohm's law.

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.020
Anybody remember what
Ohm's law looks like here?

00:41:29.796 --> 00:41:33.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:34.020
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.050
And we have to do
something else.

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.080
The-- remember, the
current is what?

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.290
Ohm's law in a continuous
medium, the current

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:46.380
is just going to be
what of the voltage,

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.810
the blank of the voltage?

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.800
AUDIENCE: Derivative?

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.190
MICHALE FEE: The
derivative of the voltage.

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:53.565
So we're just going to take
this and take the derivative.

00:41:53.565 --> 00:41:54.390
That's it.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.810
dV dx is just equal
to minus R times I.

00:41:57.810 --> 00:42:00.360
So the current is proportional
to the derivative of this.

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:02.190
What's the derivative
of an exponential?

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:07.715
Just another exponential.

00:42:07.715 --> 00:42:08.340
So there we go.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.090
The current, and
then there's some--

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.002
you have to bring
the lambda down

00:42:12.002 --> 00:42:13.210
when you take the derivative.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:17.520
So the current is now just minus
1 over the axial resistance per

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:21.700
unit length times
minus V0 over lambda--

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:25.220
lambda comes down when
you take the derivative--

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:28.760
times e to the
minus x over lambda.

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:32.190
Notice, the current is to
the right on this side,

00:42:32.190 --> 00:42:34.310
so the current is
positive it's flowing

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.490
to the left on that side,
so the current is negative.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.190
So to do this properly,
you'd have-- this is

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.320
the solution on the right side.

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.930
You'd have to write another
version of this for the current

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.013
on the left side, but I
haven't put that in there.

00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:55.150
And, again, the current
starts out at I0,

00:42:55.150 --> 00:43:01.430
and drops exponentially,
and it falls to 1 over e

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.560
at a distance lambda.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.190
Why is that?

00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:06.890
Because the current
is leaking out

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:11.530
through the holes
in our garden hose.

00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:16.330
So as you go further down,
less and less of the current

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:18.780
is still going
down the dendrite.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.530
I don't expect you to
be able to derive this,

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:27.820
but, again, just know
where it comes from.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:28.810
Comes from Ohm's law.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:38.840
So I want to show you one really
cool thing about the space

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.770
constant.

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:42.530
It has a really
important dependence

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:46.333
on the size of the dendrite.

00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:47.750
And we're going
to learn something

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:53.060
really interesting about why
the brain has action potentials.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.050
So let's take a closer
look at the space constant,

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:58.670
and how you
calculate it, and how

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:01.950
it depends on the
size, this diameter,

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:04.450
this radius of the dendrite.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:08.330
So we're going to take a
little cylinder of dendrite

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:10.580
of radius a length little l.

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.550
G sub m is the membrane
conductance per unit length.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:21.590
Let's just derive what
that would look like.

00:44:21.590 --> 00:44:27.450
The total membrane conductance
of this little cylinder

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:33.510
of dendrite, little
cylinder of cell membrane,

00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:42.100
is just the surface area of that
cylinder times the conductance

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.420
per unit area.

00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:45.340
Remember, this is the
same idea that we've

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:47.050
talked about when
we were talking

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.530
about the area of our soma.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.020
We have a conductance
per unit area

00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:55.810
that just depends on the
number of ion channels

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:59.560
and how open they are on
that piece of membrane.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.720
So the total conductance
is just going

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.410
to be the conductance per
unit area times the area.

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:09.710
And the area of that
cylinder is 2 pi a--

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:11.270
that gives us the
circumference--

00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:13.520
times the length, 2 pi al.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:22.070
And the conductance
per unit length

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:27.200
is just that total conductance
divided by the length.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:33.190
So it's 2 pi a times g sub l,
the conductance per unit area.

00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:36.410
So that's membrane
conductance per unit length.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.760
The axial resistance
per unit length

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.580
along this piece, this
little cylinder of dendrite,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.780
we can calculate
in a similar way.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:52.750
The total axial resistance
along that dendrite is--

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:56.080
can be calculated using this
equation that we developed

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.950
on the very first day,
the resistance of a wire

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:03.790
in the brain, the resistance
of a chunk of extracellular

00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:04.990
or intracellular solution.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:10.900
The resistance is
just the resistivity

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:14.390
times the length
divided by the area.

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:20.000
The longer-- for a given
medium of some resistivity,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.690
the longer you have to
run your current through,

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:26.120
the bigger the resistance
is going to be.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.300
And the bigger the area,
the lower the resistance

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.340
is going to be.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:34.690
So that total resistance is--
it has units of ohm-millimeters.

00:46:34.690 --> 00:46:38.150
So it's the resistivity
times l divided by A.

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:42.410
In intracellular space, that's
around 2,000 ohm-millimeters.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:47.310
And the cross-sectional area
is just pi times a squared.

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:49.440
So now we can calculate
the axial resistance

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.160
per unit length.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:53.100
That's the total
resistance divided by l.

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.690
So that's just
resistivity divided by A,

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:59.700
which is resistivity divided
by pi radius squared, just

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:02.160
the cross-sectional
area, and that has

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.170
units of ohms per millimeter.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:07.260
So now we can calculate the
steady state space constant.

00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:11.100
Conductance per unit
length and axial resistance

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.250
for unit length-- the
space constant is just 1

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:17.550
over the product of
those two, square root.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.020
We're just going to
notice that that's

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:25.130
siemens per millimeter, ohms
per millimeter, inverse ohms.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:28.310
So those cancel, and you're
left with millimeter squared,

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:30.090
square root, which
is just millimeters.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.700
So, again, that has the
right units, units of length.

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:36.520
But now let's plug
these two things

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.505
into this equation
for the space constant

00:47:38.505 --> 00:47:43.682
and calculate how
it depends on a.

00:47:43.682 --> 00:47:44.390
So let's do that.

00:47:47.243 --> 00:47:48.910
Actually, the first
thing I wanted to do

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.040
is just show you what
a typical lambda is

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:53.050
for a piece of dendrite.

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.550
So let's do that.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:48:00.430
Conductance per area is around
5 times 10 to the minus 7,

00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:01.030
typically.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:02.860
So the conductance
per unit length

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.070
of a dendrite, 6
nanosiemens per millimeter.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:07.990
You don't have to remember that.

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.570
We're just calculating
the length constant.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:13.990
Axial resistance is--
plugging in the numbers

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:19.735
for a piece of dendrite that's
about 2 microns in radius,

00:48:19.735 --> 00:48:21.850
the axial resistance
per unit length

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:26.420
is about 60 megaohms
per millimeter.

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:30.470
And so when you plug those two
things to calculate lambda,

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:34.250
you find that lambda for a
typical piece of dendrite

00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:35.920
is about a millimeter.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:45.490
So that's a number that I would
hope that you would remember.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.870
That's a typical space constant.

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:56.180
So if you inject a signal into
a piece of dendrite, it's gone--

00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:01.160
it's mostly gone or about
2/3 gone in a millimeter.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:07.870
And that's how you
can have dendrites

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:11.110
that are up in the range
of close to a millimeter,

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:13.300
and they still are
able to conduct

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:17.980
a signal from synaptic inputs
out onto the dendrite down

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:18.820
to the soma.

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:27.420
So a millimeter is a
typical length scale

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:30.018
for how far signals propagate.

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.180
So now let's plug in those--

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:40.370
the expressions that we derived
for conductance per unit length

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:44.060
and axial resistance
for unit length of a

00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:47.100
into this equation for
the space constant.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.820
And what you find is
that the space constant

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.700
is a divided by 2
times the resistivity

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.520
times the membrane
conductance per unit

00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.420
area, per area to the 1/2.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.540
It goes as the square root.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:07.340
The space constant, the
length, goes as the square root

00:50:07.340 --> 00:50:10.390
of the radius.

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:13.160
And notice that
the space constant

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:19.520
gets bigger as you increase
the size of the dendrite.

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.580
As you make a dendrite
bigger, what happens

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:28.100
is the resistance down
the middle gets smaller.

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.460
And so the current can go
further down the dendrite

00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:33.506
before it leaks out.

00:50:33.506 --> 00:50:36.130
Does that make sense?

00:50:36.130 --> 00:50:38.850
But the resistance
[AUDIO OUT] is

00:50:38.850 --> 00:50:43.140
dropping as the
square of the area,

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:48.680
but the surface area is
only increasing linearly.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:53.220
And so the resistance
down the middle

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.420
is dropping as the square.

00:50:57.732 --> 00:51:03.050
The conductance out the
side is growing more slowly.

00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.970
And so the signal
can propagate further

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:09.630
the bigger the dendrite is.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:16.230
So that's why-- it's very
closely related to why

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:19.070
the squid giant axon is big.

00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:21.110
Because the current
has more access

00:51:21.110 --> 00:51:28.180
to propagate down the axon
the bigger the cylinder is.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.220
But there are limits to this.

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:33.430
So you know that, in
our brains, neurons

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:36.760
need to be able to send signals
from one side of our head

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:42.540
to the other side of our
head, which is about how big?

00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:43.840
How far is that?

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:53.115
Not in Homer, but in [AUDIO OUT]
seen the cartoon with little--

00:51:53.115 --> 00:51:53.740
OK, never mind.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.400
How big across is the brain?

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.720
How many millimeters, about?

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.240
Yes.

00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:09.030
Order of magnitude,
let's call it 100.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:14.740
So a piece of dendrite
2 microns across

00:52:14.740 --> 00:52:19.690
has a length constant
of a millimeter.

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:27.320
How-- what diameter dendrite
would we need if we needed

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:35.610
to send a signal across the
brain passively through a piece

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:36.650
of--

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:40.660
a cylindrical piece
of dendrite like this?

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.660
So lambda scales with radius.

00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:56.130
2 microns diameter, radius,
gives you 1 millimeter.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:53:02.100
Now you want to go to-- you
want to go 100 times further.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.773
How-- by what factor larger
does the radius have to be?

00:53:06.773 --> 00:53:07.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.416
MICHALE FEE: 10,000.

00:53:09.416 --> 00:53:10.630
Good.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:18.190
And so how big does our 2-micron
radius piece of dendrite

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:23.950
have to be to send a
signal 100 millimeters?

00:53:23.950 --> 00:53:28.130
10,000 times 2
microns, what is that?

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.983
Anybody?

00:53:32.847 --> 00:53:34.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.290
MICHALE FEE: 2 centimeters.

00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:45.050
So if you want to make
a piece of dendrite that

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.030
sends a signal from
one side of your brain

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:50.056
to the other 100
millimeters away,

00:53:50.056 --> 00:53:51.675
you need 2 centimeters across.

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:58.800
Actually, that's the radius.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:02.240
It needs to be 4
centimeters. across.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:05.620
Doesn't work, does it?

00:54:05.620 --> 00:54:09.160
So you can make things-- you can
make signals propagate further

00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.590
by making dendrites
bigger, but it only

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:13.400
goes as the square root.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:15.910
It's like diffusion.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:21.258
it's only-- it
increases very slowly.

00:54:21.258 --> 00:54:23.550
So in order to get a signal
from one side of your brain

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.500
to the other with the
same kind of membrane,

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:30.070
your dendrite would have to
be 4 centimeters in diameter.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:36.260
So that's why the
brain doesn't use

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.830
passive propagation of
signals to get from one place

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.330
to the other.

00:54:41.330 --> 00:54:47.420
It uses action potentials that
actively propagate down axons.

00:54:53.118 --> 00:54:53.910
Pretty cool, right?

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:02.130
All right.

00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:08.070
So I want to just introduce
you to the concept

00:55:08.070 --> 00:55:10.680
of electrotonic length.

00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.790
And the idea is very simple.

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:16.530
If we have a piece of dendrite
that has some physical length

00:55:16.530 --> 00:55:21.370
l, you can see
that that length l

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:31.560
might be very good at conducting
signals to the soma if what?

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.800
If-- what aspects
of that dendrite

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:38.810
would make it very good at
conducting signals to the soma?

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:39.970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:39.970 --> 00:55:41.470
MICHALE FEE: So it's big.

00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:42.430
Or what else?

00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:44.120
AUDIENCE: Short.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:46.330
MICHALE FEE: It's got a
fixed physical length l,

00:55:46.330 --> 00:55:48.736
so let's think of
something else.

00:55:48.736 --> 00:55:50.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:50.550 --> 00:55:52.250
MICHALE FEE: Less leaky.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:53.190
Right.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:53.790
OK.

00:55:53.790 --> 00:55:56.940
So depending on the
properties of that dendrite,

00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.700
that piece of dendrite
of physical length l

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:04.080
might be very good at
sending signals to the soma,

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:08.970
or it might be very bad if
it's really thin, really leaky.

00:56:08.970 --> 00:56:13.210
So we have to compare
the physical length

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:15.790
to the space constant.

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:19.300
So in this case, there's
very little decay.

00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:24.940
The signal is able to propagate
from the site of the synapse

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.410
to the soma.

00:56:26.410 --> 00:56:29.260
In this case, a slightly
smaller piece of dendrite

00:56:29.260 --> 00:56:31.240
might have a shorter
lambda, and so there

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.430
would be more decay by the
time you get to the soma.

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:38.500
And in this case, the
lambda is really short,

00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.540
and so the signal
really decays away

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:44.280
before you get to the soma.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.240
So people often refer
to a quantity as the--

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:50.060
referred to as the
electrotonic length,

00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:54.440
which is simply the ratio of
the physical length to the space

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.030
constant.

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:58.710
So you can see
that in this case,

00:56:58.710 --> 00:57:02.810
the physical length is
about the same as lambda,

00:57:02.810 --> 00:57:06.340
and so the electrotonic
length is 1.

00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.470
In this case, the
physical length

00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:12.430
is twice as long as lambda,
and so the electrotonic length

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:14.390
of that piece of dendrite is 2.

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:17.600
And in this case, it's 4.

00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.970
And you can see that the amount
of signal it gets from this end

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:24.060
to that end will go like what?

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:28.908
Will depend how on the
electrotonic length?

00:57:28.908 --> 00:57:34.240
It will depend something
like e to the minus L.

00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.550
So a piece of dendrite that
has a low electrotonic length

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:42.550
means that the synapse out
here at the other end of it

00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:46.000
is effectively very
close to the soma.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.690
It's very effective at
transmitting that signal.

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.150
If the electrotonic
length is large,

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:56.680
it's telling you that some
input out here at the end of it

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:58.120
is very far away.

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.090
The signal can't
propagate to the soma.

00:58:01.090 --> 00:58:03.460
And the amount of signal
that gets to the soma

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:07.870
goes as e to the minus L,
e to the minus [AUDIO OUT]..

00:58:07.870 --> 00:58:10.030
So if I told you
that a signal is

00:58:10.030 --> 00:58:11.410
at the end of a
piece of dendrite

00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:14.950
that has electrotonic length
2, how much of that signal

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.050
arrives at the soma.

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:24.270
The answer is e to the minus
2, about 10%, whatever that is.

00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:32.520
So I want to tell
you a little bit more

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:40.240
about the way people model
complex dendrites in--

00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.420
sort of in real life.

00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:46.210
So most of the time, we're
not integrating or solving

00:58:46.210 --> 00:58:47.180
the cable equation.

00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:49.360
The cable equation
is really most

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:52.630
powerful in terms
of giving intuition

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.320
about how cables respond.

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.310
So you can write
down exact solutions

00:58:57.310 --> 00:59:00.250
to things like pulses
of current input

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:03.850
at some position, how the
voltage propagates down

00:59:03.850 --> 00:59:09.810
the dendrite, the functional
form of the voltage

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:11.260
as a function of distance.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:14.530
But when you actually want
to sort of model a neuron,

00:59:14.530 --> 00:59:17.230
you're not usually integrating
the cable equation.

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:20.140
And so people do
different approximations

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:23.590
to a very complex dendritic
structure like this.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.440
And one common way
that that's done

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.695
is called
multi-compartment model.

00:59:28.695 --> 00:59:30.070
So, basically,
what you can do is

00:59:30.070 --> 00:59:35.860
you can model the soma with this
capacitor-resistor combination.

00:59:35.860 --> 00:59:38.710
And then you can
model the connection

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:42.430
to another part of the
dendrite through a resistor

00:59:42.430 --> 00:59:45.880
to another sort of
finite element slice,

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.550
but we're gonna let the
slices go to 0 length.

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:52.240
We're just going to model them
as, like, chunks of dendrites,

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.860
that are going to be modeled
by a compartment like this.

00:59:56.860 --> 00:59:59.290
And then that can
branch to connect

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:01.360
to other parts of the
dendrite, and that

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:04.760
can branch to connect to
other parts of the model

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.550
that model other
pieces [AUDIO OUT]

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:08.920
So you can basically
take something like this

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.800
and make it
arbitrarily complicated

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:16.780
and arbitrarily close
to a representation

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.010
of the physical structure
of a real dendrite.

01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:22.400
And so there are
labs that do this,

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:28.150
that take a picture
of a neuron like this

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:30.220
and break it up
into little chunks,

01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.230
and model each one of
those little chunks,

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:35.650
and model the branching
structure of the real dendrite.

01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:40.060
And you can put in real ionic
conductances of different types

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.530
out here in this model.

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.650
And you get a gazillion
differential equations.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.860
And you can [AUDIO OUT]
those differential equations

01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:53.180
and actually compute,
sort of predict

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:56.150
the behavior of a complex
piece of dendrite like this.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:03.710
Now, that's not my favorite
way of doing modeling.

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:07.250
Any idea why that would be--

01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:12.910
why there could be a better way
of modeling a complex dendrite?

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:16.310
I mean, what's the--
one of the problems

01:01:16.310 --> 01:01:19.640
here is that, in a
sense, your model

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.130
gets to be as complicated
as the real thing.

01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:28.870
So it would be-- it's a great
way to simulate some behavior,

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:32.140
but it's not a great way of
getting an intuition about how

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:33.205
something works.

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:41.880
So people take simplified
versions of this,

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.490
and they can take this
very complex model

01:01:44.490 --> 01:01:48.100
and simplify it even more by
doing something like this.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.050
So you take a soma
and a dendrite.

01:01:51.050 --> 01:01:53.390
You can basically just
break off the dendrite

01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:56.048
into a separate piece and
connect it to the soma

01:01:56.048 --> 01:01:56.840
through a resistor.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.390
Now, we can simplify
this even more

01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:07.470
by just turning it into
another little module,

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:11.490
a little compartment, that's
kind of like the soma.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:14.280
It just has a capacitor,
and a membrane resistance,

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:16.810
and whatever ion
channels in it you want.

01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:19.290
And it's a dendritic
compartment that's

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:22.530
connected to the somatic
compartment through a resistor.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:26.040
And if you write that down,
it just looks like this.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.080
So you have a
somatic compartment

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.140
that has a somatic
membrane capacitance,

01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.085
somatic membrane conductances,
a somatic voltage.

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:37.710
You have a dendritic compartment
that has all the same things--

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.893
dendritic membrane capacitance,
conductances, and voltage,

01:02:40.893 --> 01:02:43.185
and they're just connected
through a coupling resistor.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:49.990
It turns out that
that very simple model

01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:54.430
can explain a lot of complicated
things about neurons.

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:57.190
So there are some
really beautiful studies

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.950
showing that this kind
of model can really

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:05.800
explain very diverse kinds
of electrophysiological

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:07.090
[AUDIO OUT] neurons.

01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:16.570
So you can take, for example,
a simple model of a layer 2/3

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:22.540
pyramidal cell that has a
simple, compact dendrite.

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.500
And you can write
down a model like this

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.470
where you have different
conduct [AUDIO OUT] dendrite.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:31.850
You have Hodgkin-Huxley
conductances in the soma.

01:03:31.850 --> 01:03:34.202
You connect them
through this resistor.

01:03:34.202 --> 01:03:35.660
And now, basically,
what you can do

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.910
is you can model that
spiking behavior.

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:42.180
And what you find is that if
you have the same conductances

01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:45.060
in the dendrite and in
the soma but you simply

01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:50.922
increase the area, the total
area of this compartment,

01:03:50.922 --> 01:03:54.820
just increase the total
capacitance and conductances,

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.280
that you can see that--

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.050
and that would model
a layer 5 neuron that

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:01.000
has one of these very
large dendrites--

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.780
you can see that the spiking
behavior of that neuron

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.490
just totally changes.

01:04:06.490 --> 01:04:09.400
And that's exactly what the
spiking behavior of layer 5

01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.920
neurons looks like.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:18.610
And so you could imagine
building a very complicated

01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:21.570
thousand-compartment
model to simulate this,

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:23.760
but you wouldn't really
understand much more

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.530
about why it behaves that way.

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:27.630
Whereas [AUDIO OUT] a
simple two-compartment

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.960
model and analyze it,
and really understand

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.940
what are the
properties of a neuron

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.070
that give this kind
of behavior as opposed

01:04:35.070 --> 01:04:37.390
to some other kind of behavior.

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:39.480
It's very similar
to the approach

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.110
that David Corey took in
modeling the effect of the T

01:04:45.110 --> 01:04:51.540
tubules on muscle fiber
spiking in the case of sodium--

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:55.170
failures of the sodium
channel to inactivate.

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:57.030
That was also a
two-compartment model.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:04.580
So you can get a
lot of intuition

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:07.490
about the properties
of neurons [AUDIO OUT]

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:11.840
simple extensions of an
additional compartment

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:14.820
onto the soma.

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:20.530
And, next time,
on Thursday, we're

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:22.840
going to extend
a model like this

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:29.410
to include a model
of a [AUDIO OUT]

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:33.390
So let me just remind you of
what we learned about today.

01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:36.890
So you should be able
to draw a circuit

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:41.270
diagram of a dendrite, just that
kind of finite element picture,

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:45.500
with maybe three or
four elements on it.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:48.240
Be able to plot the
voltage in a dendrite

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.970
as a function of
distance in steady state

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:52.770
for leaky and
non-leaky dendrites,

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:56.770
and understand the concept
of a length constant.

01:05:56.770 --> 01:05:59.500
Know how the length constant
depends on dendritic radius.

01:06:03.030 --> 01:06:05.915
You should understand the
idea of an electrotonic length

01:06:05.915 --> 01:06:09.120
and be able to say
how much a signal will

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:13.260
decay for a dendrite of a
given electrotonic length.

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:15.210
And be able to draw
the circuit diagram

01:06:15.210 --> 01:06:16.590
of a two-compartment model.

01:06:16.590 --> 01:06:20.600
And we're going to spend more
time on that on Thursday.

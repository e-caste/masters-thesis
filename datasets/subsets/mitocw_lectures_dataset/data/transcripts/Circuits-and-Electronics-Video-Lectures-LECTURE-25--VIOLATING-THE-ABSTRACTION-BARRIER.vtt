WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right.
Good morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning.
So, we have some fun stuff for

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
today's lecture,
and as far as the final is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
concerned and so on,
I'd like you to forget about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
anything we do today,
absolutely.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, get your mind to become a
blank, and forget anything you

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
hear in today's lecture.
So, what I'm going to show you

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
today will hopefully completely
blow your minds.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And I'm not talking about
controlled substances or

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
anything.
So what I'm going to do is show

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you a few things that behave
completely and spectacularly

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
differently than how you expect
them to.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And, today's lecture is
appropriately called --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
OK.
So, we're going to violate the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
abstraction barrier here,
and do some fun things.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And, the important thing to
realize is that in all of 6.002,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we have, after all,
based on some assumptions we

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
made at the beginning of the
course like lumped matter

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
discipline and so on,
we have landed ourselves in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
this playground called the
playground of 6.002.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And, within that playground,
certain ground rules apply.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
OK, and our entire course
depended on those assumptions

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
being true.
So, for example,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the first assumption we made
that brought us from Maxwell's

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
equations to the lumped matter
discipline was,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
or rather the circuit
abstraction, was a lumped matter

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
discipline.
And there were three tenets of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the lumped matter discipline.
One is that the rate of change

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
of flux was going to be zero
within our circuits,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
not inside elements,
but in the circuit itself,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and second, the dq by dt was
going to be zero outside the

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
elements, and third,
something we did not dwell upon

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in the course,
but it's certainly present in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the course notes is that the
speeds of signals that we are

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
going to consider are going to
be much slower than the speed of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
light.
OK, so we're going to be

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
working in a realm where we are
going to be well slower than the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
speed of light.
OK, so starting with that,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000
let me walk you through some
examples and some fun stuff.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, the first case is called
the Double Take.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So, let me sketch out a small
little circuit for you,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and take a look at the expected
behavior, and then show you what

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
really happens in real life.
So, the first case,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I have a voltage source,
and what I'm going to do is

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
make a transition from a zero to
a one.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Think of it as a step input,
and through a Thevenin like

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
resistance, I want to feed it to
a circuit.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The circuit will go to an
inverter.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000
This node goes to an inverter,
and goes through some other

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
circuits within our own design
here.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, again, remember,
a step input here,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and this input goes through a
Thevenin like resistance,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
or is applied to some other
circuit elements.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, if I apply a step here,
what do you expect?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
You expect that,
so let me call that VI,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and let me call that Vo.
So, if I plot VI as a function

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.000
of time, and let's say this step
input happens at t=0.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So let's say this is t=0 here,
and let's say this is a 5V

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
step.
So, I expect that this input

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
here is going to go to,
VI here, is going to go to 5V

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.000
at t=0.
What do I expect at Vo?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
At Vo, based on our circuit
abstraction, I get a step input

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
here.
I should get a step of some

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
magnitude here,
depending on what's connected

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in this direction.
And let's simply say that

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
what's connected here is an
inverter, and maybe other

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
inverters at the other side.
So essentially,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
as far as this node is
concerned, it's got some wires

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
connected to it.
And at the end of the wires,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it has an open circuit,
an open circuit,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
for example,
like the gate input of this

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
inverter.
So what do you expect at V

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
nought?
A step input here,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and at V nought I see an open
circuit.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
OK, so I expect the same step
at V nought: 5V.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So, that's what we've prepared
you for, OK?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But, the fun thing that we're
going to see,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
so this is what you expect,
and I'll show you a little demo

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that is going to show you
something very different.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
What you're going to see is not
this.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
OK, you're not going to be
seeing that.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Rather, I'm going to show you
something that looks like this.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
So, at t=0, I do see Vo looking
like a step, and approximately

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
halfway through,
decides, ah,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
well never mind,
and flattens out,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
OK, then says,
oh, OK, and zoom,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
it goes back up to 5V.
So, it sort of does a bit of a

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
double take up there saying,
hey, what's going on here?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And zoom, jumps up to 5V,
and then it's five as you

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
expect.
OK, so this is some finite

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
amount of time that looks like
that.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
OK, so try to understand what's
going on.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So let me show you a quick
little demo.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So that's the input VI.
OK, so that's the input VI that

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
you expect, and I won't do
anything to my circuit at this

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
point.
And, go ahead.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So, let's see what happens now.
There you go.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So now, I'm showing you the
output here at Vo.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So at VI, there's a nice little
step, and at Vo,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
notice that I get something
that behaves like this.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
OK, and I promise you,
nothing we've taught you in

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
6.002 prepares you for this.
OK, and as I mentioned at the

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
beginning of this lecture,
it would behoove you to forget

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
about everything you learn in
today's lecture for the next two

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
weeks at least.
So what's going on here?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Any ideas?
Anybody?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Any thoughts?
So what's up with my circuit

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
here?
It says, oh,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
OK, a step.
It starts off and says,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
oh, never mind,
and then meanders along at 2.5V

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and then says oh,
step, yes, I remember,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and then boom,
it jumps up to 5V.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So, any theories?
Any guesses?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Any wild guesses?
OK, so let me draw you a little

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
bit more of a detailed circuit,
and see if you can explain

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
what's going on here.
So, the circuit that I've drawn

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
there is not quite the circuit I
have at least in terms of my

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
wires.
So, what I have is something

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that looks like this,
VI, and this is going to step

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to 5V.
I do have a resistance,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
R.
This is Vo, this does go to an

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
inverter.
But what is also happening is

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that I have a long wire.
OK, you see this guy here?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We had one of our union folks
stretch out along the floor

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
here.
We have a really long wire that

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
connects to the Vo node,
and there's also a long

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
corresponding ground.
So, this wire is a coaxial

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
cable that is used for Ethernet
and such like.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It's got a core that carries a
signal, and around the core is

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
shielding that is the ground.
OK, so that goes a long way,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and at the end,
it is open.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
OK, it's an open circuit at the
end.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I haven't connected anything
out there: open circuit.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So, you know,
something's happening here

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that's making the circuit behave
like this.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
So, this is VI.
At Vo --

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So at Vo I'm getting this funny
behavior.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
OK, so does anybody want to
take the next piece of clues

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
here, does anybody want to take
a stab at guessing what might be

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
going on here?
Yes?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Ah, we have a shill in the
audience here.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So, the theory is that the step
here, think of it as an

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
electromagnetic pulse that goes
from zero to five,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and things in real life don't
travel instantaneously.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So, there's something with a
wave that flies down,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and the wave goes to the end,
flips, and then comes back,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and then establishes the full
voltage here.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So that is indeed at the root
of what's going on.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And let me put it in layman's
terms and then describe the

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
details of what's going on here.
OK, so the way to view what's

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
going on is that I have this
long wire.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
OK, in the very first lecture,
I started off by saying wires

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
are ideal.
OK, ideal wires are such that I

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
can transmit signals on them.
Wires are small so that the

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
propagation time of signals is
inconsequential compared to the

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
rise times and fall times of the
signals of interest.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
By having this really long
cable here, I have clearly

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
violated that assumption,
which is the wires are really,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
really long here.
OK, and so I somehow need to

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
model what the wire is doing to
my circuit when I don't have a

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
small wire.
So what actually happens,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the way to view it is the
following.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So, although this is a wire,
to understand the mechanics of

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
what's going on,
I really have to model it much

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
more accurately,
OK?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And, the way to model a wire
like this is that notice that

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
every small element of a wire
has associated with it some

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
inductance.
OK, so let's take a small

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
segment of the coax cable here.
The coax cable is a small core

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
surrounded by a metallic shield.
OK, that's a ground.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And so, when I have a wire
surrounded by a metallic shield,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that also has the capacitance,
OK, inductance and capacitance.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So this small segment can be
modeled as a really small

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
inductance, and a really tiny
capacitance.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Similarly, the next segment can
be modeled as a tiny inductance

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and a capacitance.
There is also a resistance

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
here, but let's assume that the
resistance is zero for our

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000
model, and also the parallel
resistance is also infinity.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
OK, so it's an inductor,
capacitor, and really the

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
situation that I have is not a
pair of ideal wires,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but really a really,
really small inductance,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and a small capacitance in
parallel.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So, it's more of a set of
distributed elements that I have

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
here.
Notice that in my lump circuit

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
abstraction, when we talked
about the RLC model for the wire

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
between two inverters,
we lumped it.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We lumped this thing into a
model that looked like this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
OK, we lumped the resistance
into a source resistance.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We lumped all the inductors
into a lumped inductor.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
We lumped all the capacitances
into a lumped capacitance.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
OK, but in this situation,
I can do this when the signal

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
speeds of interest are much,
much, much slower than the

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
speed of light than the
propagation speeds of

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
electromagnetic signals.
In this case,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that is not quite true.
And so, therefore,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
we have to model it much more
exactly.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We need to see what's going on.
So, what's happening here is

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that at t=0, I get this step.
So, think of that as a pulse of

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
energy, and the instant it comes
here, and instantaneously this

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
guy looks like a voltage
divider, OK?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I've chosen my resistance,
R, here to match the

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
instantaneous impedance looking
in, which is also R.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
I've arranged it to be that
way.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So, instantaneously,
the point at which the pulse

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
appears at this point,
looking down here looks like

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
another resistor to this pulse.
OK, therefore,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
when I start out,
I start out going up and

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
pausing at 2.5 because
instantaneously,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
this looks like a resistance,
R.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So instantaneously,
it's a voltage divider,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
R, and so it's 2.5 here,
instantaneously.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
OK, then what happens?
Then those little pulse

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
propagates down.
What does it mean for a pulse

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
of energy to propagate down?
Well, it begins sending a

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
current through the inductor,
begins charging up the

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
capacitor, current here,
so that's what I mean by saying

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that the pulse of energy goes
down.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
OK, it's a step that sends
current to the inductor and

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000
charges of the capacitors,
and that wave front moves out

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
here and comes all the way here.
What happens there?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Well, think about it.
Supposing you stand here,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and you hold a long string in
your hand somehow,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and just do this Gedanken
experiment.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It's not easy to do.
And so, let's say you somehow

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
have the long string that you're
holding onto,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and the string on the other
side is not connected to

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
anything.
OK, just imagine this

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
experiment.
OK, and what you do is you

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
suddenly raise the string up at
your end by about a foot.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
What are you going to see
happen?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So instantaneously,
the string is up here,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
but the rest of the string is
down a foot below.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And then you see this wave
propagate down the string,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
right?
So here's a string.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I lift this thing,
and you see this wave propagate

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
all the way down,
the one foot wave propagate all

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
the way down until you come
here.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
What happens here?
So, out here,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
the string is down here,
the wave propagates out here

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and pulls it up to one.
And then what?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
There's nothing connected
there, so the string is zipped

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
up, but it's got the energy.
OK, where does energy go?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Well, it continues going up,
and sends a wave back.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
OK, so just think of a string
that you pull up like this and

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
propagates down,
boom, hits the other end,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
reverses, and comes back at me.
OK, you can look at a

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
complementary situation,
not the same as this,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
but complementary by taking a
string, tying it to a door,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and lifting it up.
It's not the same situation.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
It's a complementary situation
where it's tied down.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Tying down a string is
tantamount to shorting the ends

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
here.
OK, in that case what you'll

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
see happen: as the wave goes
down, at the end the string

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
can't move, so the wave goes and
flips around and comes back.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Try it out at home.
Take a long piece of string,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
tie it up there,
do this, OK?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And you'll see the wave go out,
flip, and then come back at

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
you.
So, if your friends see you

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
tying a long piece of string
doing this, hopefully they won't

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
think you're nuts or something.
OK, so the same way here:

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
this thing flies down,
OK, there's no way to dissipate

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
the energy here,
so this thing continues up.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And then, what I'm going to see
happen is the wave move back.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
OK, the wave begins to move
back, and that's another 2.5V,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
resulting in a net 5V at this
terminal.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
That wave begins to blast back,
OK, and then when it comes back

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
here, after some amount of time,
it raises this to 5V,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and that's what you see happen
here.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
So, this is a wave going down,
and then after a time,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
2t, it goes back up to 5V.
That's a return wave.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
It's 2t because to get down
here is t seconds,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and then t seconds to come
back, which is why we have 2t.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
OK, that is why you see that
pulse at 2.5.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
OK, so I'd like to show you a
few more things here.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Clearly we don't want that in
our circuits.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Could someone tell me what
problem would happen if my

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
signals looked like this in my
digital circuits?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Instead of being nice little
steps, if there was a little

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000
thing in the middle and then a
step, what's the problem with

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
signals like this?
In digital circuits,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
what did it violate?
Yeah?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Exactly.
This little sucker here is

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000
meandering out in the forbidden
region for all of 2T.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Can't do that.
OK, can't have that.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Well, so we need to fix the
problem because this is real

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
life.
OK, but what if you and your

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
buddy were signaling each other
but using digital signals from

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
one dorm room to another maybe a
few hundred feet down?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
Your circuit isn't going to
work because the signal's going

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
to meander around in the
forbidden region for some time.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So, any ideas what might you
do?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Yeah?
Put a resistor on the end.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
OK, trick the circuit.
So, what you can do,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and I'm going to show you a
little demo here,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
what you can do is the reason I
got this wave propagating back,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
was that there was nothing to
absorb the energy.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
So instead, what if I put
another resistor here,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
R?
So, as far as a burst of energy

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
is concerned,
it says, oh,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
yeah, it just looks the same.
It's R, and goes and dissipates

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
in this resistor,
R, and guess what?

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
I don't have any wave going
back, and I'm done.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
So, what I'm going to find,
then, is that out here,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
this goes up to 5V,
but out here,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
I will have a signal that
starts out and goes up to 2.5,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
and that's it.
OK, I lift it up,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
it goes down,
it goes to 2.5 because in the

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
lumped model that you've been
dealing with,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
it's a resistor R,
a resistor R to ground,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
and you're taking the
connection here or here.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So, it's your standard lumped
model, your voltage resistive

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
divider, and it just simply
works.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yeah, that's it.
So, this is the end of the

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000
cable.
OK, if somehow you could watch

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
this and that at the same time,
so what I'm going to do,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
and this is a resistor,
R, I'm just going to plug it

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
in.
OK, if the fates are smiling at

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
me, what should you see there?
What should happen is that the

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
second jump from 2.5 to 5 should
simply go away.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
It should just go to 2.5.
Let's try that.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
There you go.
I take it out,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
it jumps back up.
OK, so all I've done here is

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
put in a resistor at the end,
and I'm still measuring the

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
voltage here.
So, that's one solution.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
One solution is to put a
resistor here.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
So, I absorb the energy,
and the resistance has to be

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
equal to the instantaneous
impedance looking in.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And the instantaneous
impedance, for many of these

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
cables is 50 ohms.
It's called a characteristic

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
impedance.
OK, you'll learn a lot more

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
about it if you take 6.014.
That course starts out with

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
assuming that things are
distributed in that matter.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
OK, so if you want to design
multi-gigahertz chips,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
it turns out that if you have
signals that are traveling

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
around at edge speeds in the
0.1-1 nanosecond range,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
remember, light travels roughly
one nanosecond a foot.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
And if the signals are roughly
of interest are 0.1 nanoseconds,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
then if the chips are one inch
in size, right there,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
the propagation speed of a
signal across a chip is 0.1

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
nanoseconds.
OK, so today,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
we have to deal with these
issues and try to figure out

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000
what to do about them.
OK, so that's one solution that

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
somebody pointed out.
There is a second solution.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Anybody else have a second
solution for me?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
And then there's a third
solution, too.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
So it's OK.
You can give me either the

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
second or the third solution.
It doesn't matter.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Anybody?
You have two to choose from,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
come on.
Yeah?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
You can do that,
yeah.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
So we could define the problem
away by saying this transition

00:24:05.000 --> 00:00:02.500
is such that my high is below

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
So, once it goes above 2.5,
who cares what it does?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
That's a good point.
That's solution number four,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
and that works.
OK, so I still need two and

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
three.
Put a diode in there?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Yeah, I guess you could.
If the diode had the same kind

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:30.000
of impedance looking in,
it kind of may work.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
That's solution 4.2.
I'm still waiting for solution

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
two and three.
Pardon?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Cut off the cable?
Exactly.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
So, the solution says,
work on a different problem.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
And that is solution number
two.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
OK, so the idea is,
the root of all evil,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
this long wire,
which is why I had this thing

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
here.
So instead, if I had short

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
wires, then what will happen is
if it's a very small wire,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
it'll look like this.
And the wire's small enough.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
I will see an itty-bitty
thingamajig out there,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
but not a whole lot.
By the way, the fun thing is

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
that you can actually calculate
the speed of light,

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
the experiment I just showed
you.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Can we put that up again?
No, the big one.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
So, in the experiment that I
showed you, this distance was

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000
about 500 nanoseconds,
OK?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
This distance was 500
nanoseconds this time interval.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
The length of this cable is
about 500 feet,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
somewhere around 500 feet.
So you can figure out the speed

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
of light.
What's the speed of light?

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
So, this is about 500
nanoseconds, and this cable is

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
roughly 500 feet.
What's the speed of light?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Roughly a foot per nanosecond.
So, would you believe that in

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
6.002 we've figured out the
speed of light from a simple

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
experiment?
All right, so let's do the next

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
experiment now.
Let's take out the long cable,

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
and connect a short cable
instead.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
So, what I'm going to do is
disconnect the long cable,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
and instead,
connect a small cable.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
It's still relatively long,
but much shorter than the 500

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000
foot cable.
So what you should see happen

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
now is that the little step
should not be this big,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
but much, much smaller.
So, take a look up there.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
There you go.
OK, so with this thingamajig,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
the little blip there is very
small.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
And of course,
if I make it even smaller,

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.000
then that can virtually vanish.
OK, so that is solution number

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
two.
So, we've done one,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
two, four, 4.2.
So, what's solution number

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
three?
One more solution.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Pardon?
So, another solution we

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
mentioned is we change this
resistance.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
and that will work,
if I make this very,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
very low, then I'll get much
closer to 5V here.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Yeah, that's a possibility.
That's solution six I guess.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
So what was solution number
three?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:30.000
And you all should be able to
solve this.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
You guys know the answer.
OK, you folks should be able to

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
solve this.
Yes?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Ah, clock.
So, what I can do is just as

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
was pointed out,
that I leveraged my abstraction

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
by changing my VOH and VIH
thresholds.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
So that'll work.
The alternative thing is to use

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
a clock.
A clock is a distinguished

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
signal that I send around in my
digital circuit,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
OK?
So all I do is if I arrange it

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
such that my clock doesn't
happen in this vicinity,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
but rather, my clock happens
late enough, then I'm going to

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.000
sample and look at my signals
only on the rising and falling

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
edges of the clock,
in which case I won't be

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
looking at the signal,
but the signal is doing weird

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
things.
OK, so a decent clock would

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
also solve the problem.
OK, any last minute questions

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:40.000
before we go onto the next one?
OK, the next problem that we're

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
going to look at is titled the
Double Dip.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:56.000
OK, so what I'm going to do
here is our Vs power supply,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:06.000
and what I'm going to do is
feed the power supply to an

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
inverter.
OK, so we've been doing this

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
all along; Vs,
I feed the supply to an

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
inverter.
And what I'm also going to do

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
is, so this is ground,
and I'm going to feed it to,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
so feed the power supply
connection to a couple of

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
inverters.
OK, and what I'm going to do is

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000
apply some sort of a signal to
this inverter,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:57.000
and I'm going to observe,
and I'm going to look at this

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
signal here.
So, the abstraction should tell

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
you that here's a power supply.
This is 5V, or whatever the

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.000
supply voltage is to these two
inverters.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
That should be fine,
and feed some sort of input to

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
this inverter,
OK, and the output here should

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
be simply determined by this
input.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
This signal can have absolutely
no bearing on this output.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
OK, and let's look at that and
actually confirm it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So, I build a circuit like
this, and we look at this

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
output, and initially there
should not be any,

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
it should simply work fine.
OK, so it should work now,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
right?
OK.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
So what you have here,
this input here is the input

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
that I'm feeding to this
inverter.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000
That is a straight line.
Is that the power supply?

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
It doesn't matter?
OK, so I believe this is the,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
we'll check in a few minutes,
but I suspect this is the power

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
supply, and this guy here is the
output looking here.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
So, the green one is the look
here part.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
So, there must have been a
one-to-zero transition here,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
and that's all fine.
So, so far, so good.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
OK, no problem so far.
Now what I'm going to do is I'm

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
going to do something to the
circuit that as far as

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
abstraction is concerned,
it doesn't show up on the

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
circuit.
OK, it's below the abstraction

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
layer.
OK, I'm going to do something,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
and suddenly,
some things are going to

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
happen.
Look up there.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
The circuit hasn't changed.
It's the same circuit.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I've done nothing to the
circuit.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
OK, look at the green output.
I've done nothing to the

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
circuit that is visible here.
OK, it's below the radar screen

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
here.
It's below the abstraction

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000
barrier.
But, look at the disaster here.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000
OK, in particular,
the spikes going up are not so

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.000
much of a problem.
Because of the static

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
discipline, if I am at five or
six or seven,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
it doesn't matter as long as I
am higher than VOH.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:32.000
So as long as I'm higher than
VOH I don't have a problem.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
But the problems are these
repeated dips.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000
OK, the dips are a problem
here, which is why I labeled

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
this experiment the Double Dip.
OK, the dips are bad because if

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
they are large enough,
they can then group the output

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000
down into the forbidden region,
or worse yet,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
make it look like a zero.
OK, so you're not prepared for

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
this.
So what I'm going to do is tell

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
you what I did to the circuit,
and then ask you to help me

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:08.000
figure it out.
So all I did was applied a load

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:17.000
resistance to this,
I think of 50 ohms or some RL.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:28.000
I just applied a load resistor.
And this inverter here,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I believe, is a CMOS inverter
that looks, OK?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
So I have this input applied to
this inverter,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
and all I did is I applied an
RL load here.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And notice that the load here
should not really change what's

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
happening if this is an ideal
inverter, OK,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
the load here should simply
draw some current but really

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
should not change any other
property.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
OK, so just remember,
what's the signal doing?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
The signal is high.
This guy turns on,

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
and current flows like this.
So, let's say I had some sort

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
of a capacitor here.
This charges like this,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
and when it's slow,
the PFET is on,

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
and current flows through here
down here.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
And then when this goes high,
this guy goes off,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
and this guy turns on.
OK, so the current flows out

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
this way and this charges
through this guy.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
When I turn it off,
the P fret turns on and draws

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
current from the top.
OK, so do we have any theories

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
as to why I'm getting that messy
stuff, the dips and the spikes,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
on the output of this inverter?
So why does this inverter care

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.000
what the load of this inverter
is?

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
I mean, who cares?
So, put your thinking caps on.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Any theories?
You guys did pretty well with

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
the previous one.
And this is much easier,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
actually.
Need a better power supply;

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
OK, so what I'm going to do is
I'm going to replace the power

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
supply, and instead,
use a much bigger power supply

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
at 5V.
A big, mongo power supply that

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
can supply 100 amps,
and guess what,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
I've made the changes,
but guess what,

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.000
I still see the spikes.
Good try, but it didn't work

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
out.
Good try, good try.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
What next?
Any other solutions?

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Yes?
So dips are because of the

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
resistance, and the spikes are
because of the inductance?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
You're half correct.
So, which one is it?

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So, dips are because of
resistances, and spikes are

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
because of inductances.
You're half correct.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
It turns out that both the dips
and the spikes are because of

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
inductances.
OK, but be that as it may,

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
let me give you the next clue
here, and then see if you can

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
come closer to the answer.
So, what I've done here is I've

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
made this wire really,
really long.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000
OK, it's a really long wire,
OK, but it's a thick wire,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
so it's a long,
long, thick wire.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
So it's not the resistance.
It's really,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
really thick and mongo,
and it's a long wire,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
so a signal wire above a ground
plane behaves like an inductor.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
And so here,
it has the capacitance to,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
but in this case it's
inductance.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
It's inductance here.
So, I'll give you another ten

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
seconds to think about it and
then tell you the answer.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
But despite the inductance
here, it turns out if I take out

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
this resistor,
the problem goes away.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Look, I take out the resistor,
the problem goes away.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Yes, there is an inductor here.
OK, I take out this resistor,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:44.000
problem goes away.
I put the resistor back in,

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000
boom.
Yes?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:54.000
OK, pretty good.
That's 86 points.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So here's what's going on.
There's an inductor here,

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
and when I put a 50 ohm
resistor here,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I put this resistor.
When the PFET turns on,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
it draws a current.
OK, it's going to draw a

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
current.
It draws a current;

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
remember that across an
inductor, I have a drop.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And the drop relates to the
di/dt.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Remember, for a capacitor,
the current is Cdv/dt.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
For the inductor,
the voltage across the inductor

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
is Ldi/dt.
So, if di/dt,

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
from switching a large current
through the inductor every

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
cycle, OK, big di/dt,
di/dt is large.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I've made it large by having a
very small RL,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
so, you know,
pulling a big current through

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
every few, whatever,
every cycle,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
and then stopping it.
And so therefore,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
I'm getting these big drops
across this inductor that relate

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
to Ldi/dt.
In other words,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.000
the power supply here is fine.
While you guys were watching,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
I switched to the huge,
mongo power supply,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
and so this voltage is fine.
But then this voltage after the

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
wire is the problem.
So, this voltage here doesn't

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000
look like this anymore.
Rather, it has spikes that go

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
down, for example,
and when I switch the other

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.000
way, they go up.
OK, so therefore,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:30.000
what I end up having here is
big spikes on this power supply.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And when this guy's power
supply goes wacko,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
then I see the spikes on its
output as well.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
OK, so what are the solutions
for that?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Any solutions here?
What can I do to fix the

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
problem?
Pardon?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Stop using the,
exactly.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
When in doubt,
do something else.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Build a different design.
So what I could do is this is

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000
pretty dumb, using a long wire.
And so, no, but trust me,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:04.000
oftentimes you go to the store
room and they give you a big

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
roll of wire,
and you're too lazy to cut a

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
piece out.
Use the whole roll,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
and use the two ends,
and connect it in,

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
OK?
So, if I had a much shorter

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
piece of wire,
then that can solve my problem.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
But again, remember,
what's small to you may not be

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.000
small to the circuit.
OK, so let's say,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
for example,
I'm Intel, and I'm building a

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
10 GHz Pentium 6 processor.
OK, it's 0.1 nanosecond is my

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
cycle time.
There, even a small,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
itty bitty wire can be a real
problem.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
OK, and so therefore,
distributing power throughout a

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
one inch chip that's clocking at
10 GHz is a really,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
really hard problem.
And our own David Perreault,

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
who is doing one of our
sections, is one of the world's

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
experts in this field.
Distributing power,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
something as simple as,
how do I get 1V in a stable

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
manner to every single device on
my chip?

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
It's a hard problem.
OK, so now, you have to begin

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.000
feeding your power supply
connections much like RC

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
circuits, OK,
and you have to solve some hard

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
problems to be able to simply
distribute power decently

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
throughout your circuit.
So, what else can I do?

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
Yeah?
Say it again?

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Ah, I can do that.
I could use different wires to

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.000
connect each of the inverters.
That's a good point.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
So here, the coupling happens
because I connect the two

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
inverters way out here.
So instead, I use a different

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
cable.
I hadn't thought of that.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
That's a creative solution.
OK, so in fact,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000
if you build a chip,
so we built this chip called

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
RAW in our group,
and it has on the order of 10

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
million gates.
And this chip we built with

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
IBM's technology,
and it turns out that you don't

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
send power supply in through a
pin and then connect that 1.5V

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
supply to all your gates.
What you do is from that pin,

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
you then build special power
supply buffering trees.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And each tree,
each leaf of the tree drives a

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
subcircuit.
In other words,

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
if this is a chip,
you have lots and lots of gates

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.000
throughout your chip.
What you do not do is bring in

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
a power supply like this,
and then connect.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
You don't do that.
That's the worst possible thing

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.000
you can do.
It's an absolute disaster for

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:55.000
the reason just brought up.
OK, so instead what you do is

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
divide up the chip into,
say, four quadrants.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
OK, in our case,
we have 16 quadrants.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
And then what you do is from
this point, you take one wire

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
that goes to this quadrant,
one wire that comes here,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
one here, and one here,
so that you're getting the

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
power supply very close to the
source, and you have different

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
connections going to each
quadrant so that switching in

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.000
this quadrant will not affect
this guy because of the

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
inductance of this lead here.
OK, and if you hadn't taken

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
6.002, you'd have been arguing
with IBM, I don't want 16 wires.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
I want just one wire.
OK, so there are other

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
solutions, of course.
There's a couple more solution.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
One is that what you can do is
part of the problem here is that

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
all my transitions are really,
really sharp.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:54.000
OK, so di/dt is very,
very large.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
So, there's a whole new
technique in design of digital

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
and analog circuits,
which talks about,

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
maybe I should call it waveform
engineering, OK,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
or edge engineering.
OK, it's also called edge

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
smoothing.
The idea is that rather than

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
have very sharp edges in your
circuit, you try to have

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
smoother edges.
And when you have smoother

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
edges, OK, then your di/dt is
now going to be less.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
It's not going to be very,
very high.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Rather, your delta I is spread
out over a longer period of

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:31.000
time.
Of course, that means the

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
circuits may have to run a
little slower,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
but that can also solve the
problem.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
And in fact,
that same smoothing of the

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:46.000
waveforms was also the solution
you saw in the capacitive

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
coupling we saw a month and a
half ago.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
And let me show you the demo,
and then close up.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Not working?
OK, that's OK.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.000
It doesn't matter.
So if you remember the demo

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:05.000
from the lecture about a month
and a half ago in capacitors,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:10.000
I talked about a chip with two
pins, and there was this

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
capacitive coupling between the
pins.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
And because of this,
if this waveform is switching,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
then because of this coupling,
you will end up getting,

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:29.000
if this is the signal here,
you will end up getting spikes

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
on this pin because of the
signaling of the other pin.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:39.000
And that's good old capacitive
coupling.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
OK, and to eliminate this,
what you can do is much like

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
with the inductance system,
if you, rather than having

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
sharp transitions on this pin,
if you have smooth transitions

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000
that look like this,
then what you can do is you'll

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
now spread delta V from here to
here over a longer delta T.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:59.000
OK, delta T has become longer,
and because of that,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
you end up getting much better
behavior, and you don't end up

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
getting these spikes.
So therefore,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
if you want to build really,
really fast circuits,

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
you have to be really careful.
You can build fast circuits,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
but watch out for them fast
edges.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
OK, fast edges are nasty.
They kill you.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
That's something to remember as
you build the next generation of

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
circuits.
Well, thank you all.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
I had a blast,
and I hope you guys had fun

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
too.
Thank you.

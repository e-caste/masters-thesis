00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.400
GARY GENSLER: All
right, we're going

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.910
to turn today to
a fun topic of how

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.950
central banks, right at the
heart of the financial system,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.220
are thinking about blockchain.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.540
And we're going to do
this over two classes.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.083
We're fortunate that we
have some real expertise

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:45.000
in the room, and I'm not
talking about myself.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.580
But Rob Ali, who ran the digital
efforts at the Bank of England,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.600
and is now--

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.700
and has been for some time--
part of the digital currency

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.620
initiative over
at the Media Lab,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.300
is going to come up from time to
time and give his perspective.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.390
Not only from MIT's
Media Lab's perspective,

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.880
but also from the history
of what he's done.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.960
He's authored a number
of papers in this area.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.340
He works with
technologists creating

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.390
a number of technologies.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.160
But I'll let Rob tell you
a little bit about what

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.410
he's doing in central banking.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.580
Simon Johnson's
also joined us, who

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.450
is a former chief economist
of the International Monetary

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.950
Fund.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.825
He's told me he doesn't
want to be called on,

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:32.730
but I will call on Simon to give
his perspective at some point

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.920
in time, from the IMF days.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.780
But as you all know,
Simon is Sloan faculty,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.760
a great teacher, himself,
teaches a lot of you

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.100
in the global markets
course and the GLAB course,

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.390
and things like that.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
And Simon and I in the
spring teach a public policy

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.810
and private sector
course, which is just one

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.440
more time for me to plug that
that's a good course, too.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.250
So now, let's just talk a
little bit about central banking

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.868
and blockchain.

00:02:03.868 --> 00:02:05.160
First, what are we going to do?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.949
A little bit about our readings
and the study questions.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.760
We're going to start
with Fiat currency,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.280
and go back again
to Fiat currency,

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.410
and how does it fit
into central banking.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.640
So the first 20% or
30% of today is really

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.560
just about what
is a central bank,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.960
and how does it fit into money?

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.150
Then, how are central
banks thinking

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.650
about blockchain technology?

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.790
What are their approaches?

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.210
And we're going to talk about
four different approaches

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.620
that central banks are taking
to blockchain technology.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.250
Then dive into one of those four
approaches-- payment systems,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.000
and how are they looking at
payment systems right now.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.870
Dive into probably the most
interesting one-- central bank

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.760
digital currency, and what's
called the money flower.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.460
You might remember
that money flower

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.390
that was in the BIS
report, and so forth.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.740
And then just wrap it up.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.420
So that's a little bit of
what we're trying to do.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.812
The study questions were
really about central banking--

00:03:05.812 --> 00:03:07.020
what are they thinking about?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.272
How are they thinking about
digital reserves, and so forth?

00:03:10.272 --> 00:03:11.730
Because I have a
guest with me, I'm

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.320
not going to do as
much cold calling,

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.090
because we're going
to leave time for Rob

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.690
to get up here and give some of
his thoughts as we go through.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.050
But the key
questions were really

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.910
how are central banks
thinking about central bank

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.120
digital currency?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.730
How might they think of
the design considerations--

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.370
which we're going to dive
into in the latter part

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.150
of the class.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.250
Designing retail
versus wholesale.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.330
Access-- should it be a
token or account-based?

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.710
Interest bearing or not?

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.730
And we'll talk a lot Thursday
about why Sweden right now is

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.542
come out with their most
recent paper, which was not

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:49.500
in assigned reading,
because the paper came out

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.538
about a week ago.

00:03:50.538 --> 00:03:52.830
But they're saying they're
thinking they should make it

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.370
interest bearing, which I
wouldn't have necessarily

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.910
predicted.

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.030
But that's where their thinking
is as of October of 2018.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.620
And then, what are
the challenges?

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.910
That it might relate back to
the commercial banking business,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.602
the credit markets,
the economy as a whole.

00:04:12.602 --> 00:04:14.310
So that's a little
bit of the background.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:15.769
And these were the readings.

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.519
I apologize, because
this week is probably

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.769
a little heavy reading,
which meant you all skimmed

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.269
rather than actually dove in.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.830
One of these
readings, Broadbent--

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.627
Rob did you help write this
speech that Broadbent wrote?

00:04:30.627 --> 00:04:32.710
ROBLEH ALI: No, I confess,
this is all Ben's work.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.430
And I reviewed a draft
that he sent round

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.215
and made some
comments on it, but I

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:40.858
can't claim any [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:42.900
GARY GENSLER: Anybody
working in the central bank

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.270
digital currency
space really goes back

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.530
to Broadbent's speech--

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.330
I assumed that Rob may have
written it or reviewed it.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.370
And Garratt, who gave testimony
in front of the US Congress

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.890
on these issues, is often quoted
by the Bank of International

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:02.890
Settlement and others.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.700
So if there were two that you
really want to think about--

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.090
the economics of money and
central bank digital currency,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.680
Garratt and Broadbent
are picked up a lot.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.140
The Economist piece
was kind of lively,

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.990
and walked us all the
way back to Adam Smith.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.250
Did anybody read The Economist
piece and remember what he--

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.183
anybody remember
the Adam-- so James?

00:05:27.183 --> 00:05:28.850
AUDIENCE: He basically
argued everything

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.140
that's done right and wrong
with Fiat currencies, exactly

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.730
what's happening with Bitcoin.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.880
GARY GENSLER: It's exactly
what's happening with Bitcoin.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.380
In The Economist piece, it
talks about in the 1770s, when

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.790
they started to move a bit away
from gold money to paper money,

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.850
and they set up a
clearing house in 1773

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.260
to deal with the paper that was
going amongst and between all

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.390
the banks.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.460
That Adam Smith
apparently wrote that it

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.390
was wagon wheels in
the air, and that gold

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.330
was the highway of money--

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.840
but paper money and central
clearing of that paper money

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.810
was the wagon wheels in the air.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.270
So The Economist was
basically saying,

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:18.370
these debates are
as old as time.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.310
Adam Smith was saying,
you can promote an economy

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.600
with wagon wheels in the air--

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.940
money.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.120
But maybe that's what's
going on now, as well.

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.660
So I've already introduced Rob--

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.240
research scientist from the
Digital Currency Initiative,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.650
and before MIT.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.558
He helped Broadbent--
he won't say he did,

00:06:38.558 --> 00:06:40.100
but he helped
Broadbent do everything

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.440
he did at the Bank of England.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.090
And then Simon, who's
taking notes feverishly--

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:48.200
did I get your--

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.760
did I get this right?

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.670
Yeah, good picture?

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.420
SIMON JOHNSON: Not
sure about the picture.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.503
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:06:55.503 --> 00:06:57.910
Not sure about the picture?

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.250
So Fiat currency is
anybody going to remind me

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.990
what Fiat currency is?

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:04.970
Brodish?

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.040
You were slouching in the
chair a little bit there.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.460
AUDIENCE: So Fiat currency
is the currency particularly

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.030
issued by the central
bank of the government

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.220
of the countries-- which
is [INAUDIBLE] something

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.670
that is normally the
norm in the ecosystem

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.072
to use as a [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:23.072 --> 00:07:25.030
GARY GENSLER: So it's
issued by a central bank,

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.980
it's the norm in the system.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.610
And what are two very
important economic features

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.390
of Fiat currency, that
make it so widely accepted

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:38.260
in any economy that
we've talked about?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.760
AUDIENCE: One of
the reasons is it's

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.385
typically used as the means to
pay taxes for that [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:42.385 --> 00:07:44.080
GARY GENSLER: Right, so taxes.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.380
And what was the other big
one that almost every country

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:48.840
you can use it for?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.830
Pria, were you looking at me?

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:52.540
No?

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.180
Shawn?

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.470
What?

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:56.430
Yeah, you can use it
for debt payments.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.540
So societies come
together and say,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.170
you can use it for all
debts, public and private.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.000
You can use it for taxes.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.376
It sort of gives it an enormous
network effect and an advantage

00:08:08.376 --> 00:08:11.140
in any economy.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.830
And then what happens is,
so many of us in a society

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.590
then use it as a
unit of account,

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:23.040
and there's an enormous
amount of network effect.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.400
Just the raw
economics of money is

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.610
that others will use
it, and exchange it,

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.490
and thus it becomes the medium
of exchange, unit account

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.289
and store of value.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.230
So it's represented
by central bank notes.

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:41.590
And commercial bank deposits
relies on a system of ledgers,

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.580
which makes it
somewhat adaptable,

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.490
and why blockchain is
interesting in this space.

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:49.220
And taxes and debts.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.190
So then, I've pieced together
a little bit of a slide

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.730
to think about, where do
central banks fit into this?

00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:57.650
Ultimately, you'll see
where I'm going with this.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.660
But commercial banks and
central banks both have money.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.770
Central bank money
are reserves and cash.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:10.840
So it's not simply the cash in
our pocket, it's also reserves.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:16.200
And bank deposits actually
are a form of money.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.880
So a little diagram--

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.980
if the central bank
is at the top--

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:25.050
and these are number
banks, commercial banks--

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:28.590
reserves are the deposits
that commercial banks

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.410
have with the central bank.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.320
When central banking started
200 and 300 years ago,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.870
it was the commercial
banks wanted something

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:37.840
from the government.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.430
They wanted some backing, they
wanted a lender of last resort,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:46.440
and they would have to open up
accounts at the central bank.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.870
But today, when we
have unified ledgers,

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:55.920
then the central bank issues
reserves to the banking system,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.710
and those reserves
are a form of money.

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.130
The next thing is, there's the
public down at the bottom--

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.830
Bob, Alice, and Charlie.

00:10:07.830 --> 00:10:12.120
We all have money, and
it's called bank deposits.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.230
But there's one other piece of
this puzzle, if I can get it,

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:16.590
it's cash.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:19.400
So three forms of money--

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.930
we can all have
cash in our pocket,

00:10:21.930 --> 00:10:28.040
as I commonly pull
out, this here, right.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.090
I'm going to watch you,
Hugo, I'm going to watch you.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.268
No, no, but what is
that right there?

00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:35.560
AUDIENCE: Federal Reserve note?

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.890
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.360
That Federal Reserve
note is a representation

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:44.690
that at the central bank they're
storing some value for me.

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.470
It's got a serial number.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.380
That piece of paper itself
is not the store of value,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.260
in a sense, even
though we accept it.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.870
Would you say that's
a store of value?

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.940
AUDIENCE: In some ways.

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.460
GARY GENSLER: In what way
is that a store of value?

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:02.920
AUDIENCE: I know
that it's worth $20.

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.880
GARY GENSLER: And
why is it worth $20?

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.675
AUDIENCE: Because the
central bank says so.

00:11:07.675 --> 00:11:11.700
GARY GENSLER: And see what
happens if you hand it to Rob.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.400
He'll take it, right?

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.220
That's how you know
it's worth something.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.940
But it's a tokenized
means of money.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:24.360
It's a physical token,
and the central bank

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.510
has something stored there.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.280
But you also have bank deposits.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:33.060
And if you go into Starbucks,
and you buy something

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.380
at Starbucks--

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.400
James, if you buy
something at Starbucks,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:37.970
what are you giving them?

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:41.190
AUDIENCE: A piece of paper--
well, a piece of linen.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:43.280
GARY GENSLER: No, but do
you actually-- who here--

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.360
AUDIENCE: A credit card.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:44.880
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so when you

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:47.250
give a credit card, what
are you giving to Starbucks,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:49.170
ultimately?

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.374
AUDIENCE: A notion that I have
some money in my bank account

00:11:52.374 --> 00:11:55.450
that they can take in
exchange for coffee.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:12:00.870
GARY GENSLER: In exchange
for coffee, you're going to--

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.540
I hope you give them
more than a notion.

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.230
What will the payment system do?

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:05.810
Ross?

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.680
AUDIENCE: A receivable from
the credit card company.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.972
They just have a right to
get paid from the credit card

00:12:09.972 --> 00:12:11.250
company.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.007
That company checks to make
sure they're willing to--

00:12:14.007 --> 00:12:15.840
GARY GENSLER: And
ultimately that receivable

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.285
will be moved bank
deposit to bank deposit.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.228
You'll never be handing
him my $20 bill.

00:12:24.228 --> 00:12:26.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:26.730
What's that?

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.440
All right, Rob, that's his fee.

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.980
Teaching fees are cheap at MIT.

00:12:32.747 --> 00:12:34.330
But Ross, you want
to go through that?

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:36.550
So the receivable will be
a bank deposit, ultimately.

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.050
AUDIENCE: Right,
and they collect it

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.392
from the credit
card company, who

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:42.100
is going to move money
from their account

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.350
to Starbucks's account.

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:46.160
Then the credit card
company sends you a bill.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.040
So there's two separate
relationships there.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.570
So when they're
checking your card,

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.450
it's just a credit card
company checking its records

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.790
to see if they're
willing to issue

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:56.320
the receivable to Starbucks.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.028
GARY GENSLER: So what
you're really doing

00:12:58.028 --> 00:13:01.480
is you're spending a form of
money called bank deposits.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.000
And your bank deposit
is going to go down,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.423
and what's Starbucks
bank deposit going to do?

00:13:06.423 --> 00:13:07.090
AUDIENCE: Go up.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:08.600
GARY GENSLER: Go up.

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.830
So three forms of money--

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:16.080
the cash, the deposits,
and the reserves,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.840
because the central bank
is giving some money.

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.430
All of this is handled in
accounts in a ledger structure.

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.960
And we talked about it.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.540
So the accounts-- there's
central bank accounts,

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.710
and there are bank accounts.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:35.060
It's just accounts are ledgers,
I've just changed the words.

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.910
And it's moved through a
system, a payment system

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:40.130
that we talked about last
week-- and I'm putting to.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:43.550
Real-time gross settlement
is that little box up there.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.300
Real-time gross settlement
is a system between banks

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.560
and a central bank.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.510
Almost every country
has some form

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.520
of real-time gross
settlement system.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.830
Here in the US, we might
call it the Fed wire, or ACH.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.998
I see Ali-- is ACH real-time
gross settlement, or maybe not?

00:14:02.998 --> 00:14:04.290
AUDIENCE: No, they're not real.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:05.350
GARY GENSLER: Just the Fed wire.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:06.850
AUDIENCE: There's
another one, but I

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.400
forget the name [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.283
GARY GENSLER: Chips?

00:14:09.283 --> 00:14:09.950
AUDIENCE: Chips.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:12.033
GARY GENSLER: Chips-- so
in the US, we have chips,

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:14.400
and the Fed wire are both
real-time gross settlement.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.480
That's between banks
and the central bank.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.620
And then you have all
sorts of systems--

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.940
what's in that little box
is not as important to read,

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.580
is basically to
move between banks.

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:34.420
So that's central banking
and how it fits into money.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.560
Rob, how we doing?

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.140
All right so for?

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.570
You can come up here anytime.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.100
All right-- what's that?

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.150
ROBLEH ALI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.640
GARY GENSLER: All right, we've
got some feedback, though.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.170
So I just wanted to
hit two things on cash.

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.540
Cash in the economy is
moving up a little bit.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.270
The BIS report, for
those who read deeply,

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.180
this is just a chart that
comes from your reading.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.290
This is cash as a
percentage of GDP.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:04.810
You'll see one
arrow going down--

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:06.590
Sweden.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:13.010
Sweden only has about 2%
of their economy in cash.

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:18.600
The US is going
up-- it's about 8%.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.050
We have a $20 trillion
economy, we have $1.6 trillion

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:25.870
of those $20 bills.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.650
So in most countries,
it's going up.

00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:35.190
China-- Japan, by the
way, is close to 20%

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:39.790
of their GDP in cash.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.140
I added this chart, Simon,
this was to keep you guessing.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.890
Yes?

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:46.307
AUDIENCE: Why is Japan so high?

00:15:46.307 --> 00:15:47.390
GARY GENSLER: Why is what?

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.660
AUDIENCE: Why is
Japan's cash is so high?

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.880
GARY GENSLER: Who do we
have from Japan here?

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.160
You want to answer
this question, Akira?

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.220
AUDIENCE: Japanese people tend
to use actual cash rather than

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:58.520
credit card.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.510
People use [INAUDIBLE] going
to use their credit card,

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:04.300
because they're using the
account credit card number,

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:08.200
and the [INAUDIBLE]--

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:13.570
it's a little bit old people
feel uncomfortable to use

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.860
that number.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.443
GARY GENSLER: So a
bit of a cultural--

00:16:17.443 --> 00:16:19.900
AUDIENCE: Cultural, I
think, yeah, cultural.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.140
GARY GENSLER: And technological.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:25.522
Or more culture?

00:16:25.522 --> 00:16:26.980
AUDIENCE: So the
younger generation

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.130
is right to use their
credit card for [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:34.140
but older people
doesn't [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.640
ROBLEH ALI: And I think, what's
interesting about this slide

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.340
is, a lot of the other
central banks in Sweden

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.250
is like the canary in the mine--

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.200
they see cash usage
dropping, and they're

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.985
thinking about this sort
of fundamental question

00:16:47.985 --> 00:16:50.360
about should the public have
access to central bank money

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.035
at all?

00:16:51.035 --> 00:16:52.660
And they have it now,
in terms of cash,

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.900
and should we provide a digital
version cash is not convenient

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:56.704
anymore.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:05.502
AUDIENCE: It's starting on
2007, is this [INAUDIBLE]??

00:17:05.502 --> 00:17:10.210
Or is it capturing the effect
of advanced buying lots

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.410
of assets in the market?

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:13.329
GARY GENSLER: So
this question is,

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:18.190
is does this reflect because--
we start in 2007 to 2016--

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:20.160
is there something
else going on?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.490
The quantitative easing
of central banks.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.619
But what else happened
during this period of time?

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:27.800
What fundamentally happened
during this period, Elan?

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.050
AUDIENCE: The mortgage crisis.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.800
GARY GENSLER: The
mortgage crisis, or more

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:32.930
broadly, the financial crisis.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.700
So there was--

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.210
I think, more than
quantitative easing,

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.150
I think that this whole sense--

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.300
that Satoshi Nakamoto
tapped into, too--

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.180
is central institutions
are failing.

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:50.230
So should there be a
run to physical cash?

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.780
Is this-- it's not gold--

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:57.680
but is this more,
in some cases, safe

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.735
than commercial bank deposits?

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:06.060
Now, my dad, if he
would have been--

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:07.710
well, he was alive
during this period,

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.918
but he would've been taking
his money out of the bank

00:18:09.918 --> 00:18:12.320
and getting gold.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.820
Simon, you haven't
heard this story,

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:20.830
but my dad always had some
gold coins and a few diamonds.

00:18:20.830 --> 00:18:25.770
He inherently did
not trust government.

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.160
He also carried a
gun most days, too.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.625
He is in a tough business.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.120
But in this period of time, you
couldn't easily get the gold.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.550
A lot of people went to cash.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.790
How much do you think
the US's $1.6 trillion,

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:52.180
or 8% of our economy, is $20
bills like that, and $10s?

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.470
And how much do you
think it's $100 bills?

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.970
Anybody?

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.590
It was not in the
readings, I'm just

00:18:56.590 --> 00:19:00.720
kind of curious what
do people think here?

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.320
AUDIENCE: I think $100
bills are worth 80% of the--

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.220
GARY GENSLER: So 80%
of the $1.6 trillion.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:13.920
Does anybody have a
different thought?

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.240
That was pretty good.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.600
So here's a chart that I
pulled out, through 2017.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.280
Of the $1.6 trillion, it
looks like about $1.3 trillion

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.450
is $100 bills.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:30.570
So what's expanding
in the US is not

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.270
the use of $20
bills and $10 bills,

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.750
it's the use of the $100s.

00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:38.560
And I could put
up another chart--

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.920
over half of those
$100 bills are thought

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.450
to be held internationally.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.980
And they're not even held
within the 50 continental--

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:50.200
the 48 continental states,
and Alaska and Hawaii.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.290
They're not held domestically.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.240
So it's great to be
a reserve currency,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.090
it's great to be
a store of value.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.605
Ross?

00:19:57.605 --> 00:19:58.980
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to ask

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:00.290
the store of value question.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.705
Maybe I misheard you before,
when you were passing the $20,

00:20:03.705 --> 00:20:05.080
you said, is it
a store of value?

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.990
And I thought you said, no.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.210
And if half of that
is $100s overseas,

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:13.320
then that's the store of value,
that's what people are holding.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.010
GARY GENSLER: I don't think
there's a real answer to it.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.760
I would say this represents
a store of value, ultimately,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:24.390
on the central bank's ledger.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:31.120
Because the central bank
could, if they wish to,

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.380
deny use of this.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.300
They haven't, they
haven't for decades,

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.430
but I'm saying
somebody could say,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.190
that's a bad serial number.

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:41.950
But most people would say
that $20 piece of linen

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.155
is a store of value.

00:20:45.155 --> 00:20:46.780
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask, would you

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.280
expect the velocity of these
to be inversely related?

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.450
Like with $20
bills, they probably

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:55.960
have a higher velocity
than $100 bills,

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.207
especially if they're being
used to store of value, right?

00:20:59.207 --> 00:21:00.790
GARY GENSLER: Yes,
so the question is,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.240
is the velocity of
$20s higher than $100s?

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.850
Yes, meaning they
turn over faster.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:09.880
And one measurement of
it is, is how quickly

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:17.050
these currencies, these
linens, have to be replaced.

00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:22.300
And $1 bills, I think, have an
average life about 18 months.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.820
They keep coming in
and out of the system.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.720
And I'm not entirely
sure, but I think $20s

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.530
are maybe three,
four, five years.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.950
In essence, these are
all signed by secretaries

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.600
of the treasuries,
and I apologize

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.920
for those who aren't Americans.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.160
But it's hard now to
still find Rubin's--

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.300
Bob Rubin, or Benson's,
which was the early '90s--

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.260
signatures on the $20 bills.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.095
Now, part of that is because the
currency design keeps changing.

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.360
So $100s aren't used as often.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.870
They have turned over since the
currency design has changed,

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.570
because even an
illicit activity,

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:09.470
you'd prefer a new
$100 to an old $100.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.570
Because a new $100
is more secure--

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.250
it's less able to
be counterfeited.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:18.010
And when I served in the
US Department of Treasury,

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:21.040
I had to spend a lot of
time, because I chaired

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.130
something called the Interagency
Counterfeit Deterrent

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.390
committee.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.300
And I had to meet in these
secure rooms, where they locked

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.570
us in, and you learned about who
was counterfeiting the money.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:32.890
Brodish?

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:35.746
AUDIENCE: Please go
back to the last slide.

00:22:35.746 --> 00:22:39.190
So what I see here is the
vertical shift in most

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:42.430
of the economies
is smaller, which

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.120
I'm hypothesizing that the
value of consumption in cash

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.490
are also [INAUDIBLE] dense.

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.950
So if that is the
case, then what

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.530
is the rationale of increasing
the high-value notes

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:55.540
in the system?

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.620
GARY GENSLER: What do
central bank issue more cash

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.110
to meet that demand?

00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:04.710
AUDIENCE: And why
more $100, as compared

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:07.550
to the smaller denominations
who have the cash consumption--

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.940
seem to be more low
value consumptions?

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.600
GARY GENSLER: So
Brodish is asking why--

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:18.810
why, in, essence
is this happening?

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.210
Well, a central bank has
a couple of choices--

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:26.600
they can issue paper
currency to meet demand.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.890
And the demand is
really as evidenced

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.170
through this thing called DAS--

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:35.480
does the public
ask for the cash?

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.770
And that's what's
largely happening.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:41.520
Or can they put some quota
system, or by government Fiat--

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.590
like an India, where
they said, no, you

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.580
have to hand in all
the old banknotes?

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.360
And there was an
active desire in India

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:54.730
to take cash out of the system.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.880
But in the US,
we've not had that.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.930
We have not had any real
large government interest

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.770
of taking it out of the system.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:06.600
And so what you do have, is
you have more and more demand

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.670
for $100s, as a--

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.980
I'll call store of
value, whether it's

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:15.360
for illicit activity, or
for straight-up appropriate

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.220
activity.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:21.180
And the central bank
is facilitating that.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:27.450
This entire 8% of our GDP,
or $1.6 trillion of notes,

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.660
is interest-free borrowing
for the US government.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.260
So there's seniorage.

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.760
Eric?

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.385
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just wanted to
make a quick comment regarding

00:24:38.385 --> 00:24:40.910
the store of value.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.270
And going back to what we
discussed in the first classes

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.290
was that, it's actually a
social construct, the belief

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:53.880
that you're going to
solve debts, or pay taxes

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.670
without the Fiat currency.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.950
And that reminded
me of a story, there

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:02.980
was this-- this was true-- this
was a South American drug lord

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.640
family, this drug lord was
on the verge of being caught.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:12.300
All their assets were being
seized by the government.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:16.100
And the story is told by
his son, who was actually

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.910
sitting in the one
apartment, surrounded

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:23.600
by piles and piles
of dollar bills,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:27.500
which they actually
couldn't do anything with.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:31.760
They actually used them to burn
and get some heat out of them.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.530
And then you go back
to think, is it really

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:37.480
an intrinsic sort of value?

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.180
This is going back to the
social construct, right?

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:46.070
Because their money wasn't
good for any merchant

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.130
in the south-- in that specific
South American country.

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:51.230
GARY GENSLER: Right, so it is--

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.840
if your point is, it's
a social construct,

00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.180
I'm concurring, agreeing.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.310
In that case, maybe it
was also a little bit

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:02.700
of time value of paper money--
he was about to get arrested.

00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:06.180
There's so might-- so
I don't know enough

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.620
about that circumstance.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.180
But for sure.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:14.200
So let's move a little
bit on to central banking.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:21.460
And I choose the US, but
it's true around the globe.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.640
So there are
economic policy goals

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.560
that central banks
have taken on.

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:30.300
In the US, it was captured,
written into law in the 1970s--

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:33.240
1977, to be precise--

00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.000
something called
the dual mandate.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.090
Interestingly, the US dual
mandate for the central bank

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:42.390
has three things,
written in law.

00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:44.700
This is a quote, "promote
effectively the goals

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:48.330
of maximum employment,
comma, stable prices,

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:51.780
and moderate long
term interest rates."

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:53.640
That is what's
known as, in the US,

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.530
is the Federal
Reserve's dual mandate.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.990
You might say it looks
like three mandates.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:59.773
Simon, do you have any thoughts?

00:26:59.773 --> 00:27:01.440
SIMON JOHNSON: Well,
the central bankers

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.315
will tell you that stable
prices are the best

00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:04.950
way to moderate interest rates.

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:06.140
So that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.580
GARY GENSLER: And
thus, mostly, people

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.410
call the dual mandate
is price stability

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.420
and maximum employment.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.970
And then some
central bankers would

00:27:17.970 --> 00:27:20.760
say, the best way to
promote maximum employment

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.600
is stable prices,
depending on how--

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.240
You wouldn't say that if you're
going for senate confirmation

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.060
to be a member of the
Federal Reserve Board,

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.280
but am I not right?

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.300
That some economists--

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.450
AUDIENCE: If you were up
for presidency of the ECP.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.200
GARY GENSLER: If you
were up for president

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.610
of the European Central Bank.

00:27:38.610 --> 00:27:40.050
AUDIENCE: You'd
have to say that.

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:40.860
GARY GENSLER: Because?

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.402
AUDIENCE: They only
have one mandate.

00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:44.430
GARY GENSLER: They
only have one mandate.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.260
So around the
globe, central banks

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.370
might have different
mandates, but almost--

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:53.210
I would say, though I haven't
studied 180 central banks,

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.870
all of them would
have price stability,

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.300
or to ensure that there's
not much inflation.

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.600
Because they are in the business
of having the public mandate

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:07.340
to secure the money.

00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:10.160
That's the core thing.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.570
Now, what do they do?

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:13.590
They manage money.

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:17.300
And I think of it
as supply and price.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:19.030
So these are
Gensler's way to think

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:22.000
about what central banks do,
but it's about supply and money.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.610
Supply is physical cash.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:26.860
Do we keep issuing
more physical cash?

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.130
This $1.6 trillion of cash?

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.273
But there's broader things
called monetary base.

00:28:32.273 --> 00:28:34.690
This was not in the reading--
does anybody want to tell me

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.500
things like M2 and M3, what--

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.680
anybody taking a finance course?

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:46.540
Are you studying what monetary
base is, or M1, or M2, or M3?

00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:48.070
There's no reflection
on you, it's

00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:49.540
maybe a reflection on Sloan.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:50.930
I'm just asking.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:51.730
No?

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:54.160
So there's different
measurements of money

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.820
that central bankers
will monitor and manage.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.270
M1 is usually the hardest core
money-- used to just be cash,

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:06.280
or cash and demand deposits.

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.100
In the US system, it's about
$3 and 1/2 to $4 trillion.

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.920
So about half of it's the cash.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.610
And then they add-- the
Federal Reserve says,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.850
demand deposits in a
bank are just like cash.

00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:21.970
And this comes back four
and five decades ago,

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:28.740
started to say that the
hard money, M1 is that.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.380
M2 includes the
rest of deposits.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:38.180
So M2, in the US, is somewhere
in the order of $14 trillion.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.710
In the US, there's
about $13 trillion--

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.260
or 65% of our economy
is in deposits

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.700
the banking system has.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.520
Every country that you're
from has a different number,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.130
I'm just using the
US as an example.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:56.690
So deposits and make up
more money than cash.

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:59.180
Cash is about 1/2
to $2 trillion,

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.920
deposits are $13 trillion.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:04.060
You add the together,
you roughly--

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.110
I'm using this term loosely--

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:10.280
M2, which is a wider form of
money, is about $14 trillion

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.090
here in the US.

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:16.700
There's also an M3, and there's
other measurements of money.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:19.580
So the Federal Reserve
tries to manage that,

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.760
and they manage it not only
by how much physical cash is

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.210
printed, but it's also the
leverage in the banking system.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:28.460
If you let a banking
system be highly leveraged,

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.460
then you're, in essence,
creating more money.

00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:34.600
If a banking system
needs more capital,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.130
then it's going to
have fewer abilities

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.830
to expand the economy.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:42.590
And those are the big tools that
a Federal Reserve, or the Bank

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:47.510
of England, or any central
bank has to basically shape

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:49.190
the supply of money.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:53.120
But there's also things they
do to shape the price of money.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.340
And that's interest rates.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:58.400
The price of money is like
I'm lending Rob money,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.140
he's giving it back
to me in a year--

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.090
what's the price of money?

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:03.650
And it's that.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.970
So two big tools-- supply
of money and price of money.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.840
If you ever want to be a
governor of your central bank,

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:15.280
you're in the Fiat
money business.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.220
Rob, any thoughts?

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:17.580
Did I--

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:20.590
ROBLEH ALI: Yeah, I
that's about right.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:24.170
And obviously, that's when
modern central banking came in,

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.330
mid '70s, when the Bretton
Woods came to an end.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.920
So this is [INAUDIBLE]
floating exchange rates,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:32.030
and all the rest of it.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:34.960
And there's some good books
about this-- there was a--

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.550
there's a recent book
came out, a history

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:41.450
of the eurozone, like
monetary union in Europe

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.690
is about 40 years old, give or
take the different [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.960
[INAUDIBLE],, his name was,
a guy at the IMF, I think,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.470
worked on the Greek crisis,
and he wrote a very good book

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.440
about, right, the
history of monetary union

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:58.000
in the European Union,
and how that worked.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.240
And this goes for a long--

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.820
like end of-- taking place at
the end of Bretton Woods to,

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.450
I think, the Greek crisis.

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.890
GARY GENSLER: One
weekend in 1971,

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:14.460
if I've got my year correct,
early 1970s, Richard Nixon

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:15.750
took to Camp David--

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:20.320
which is the presidential
retreat in western Maryland.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.930
The leaders that he needed to
get together in one weekend--

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:27.760
the head of the Federal
Reserve, the undersecretary

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.160
for monetary affairs at
the Treasury Department,

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.340
who happened to be Paul
Volcker at the time.

00:32:33.340 --> 00:32:39.100
But he got together four or
five people in one weekend,

00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:42.990
and took the US off the
end of the gold standard.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:46.060
We kind of went off the
gold standard in the 1930s,

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.720
but after World War II, there
was an international consensus,

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.760
Bretton Woods, and
there was still

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.280
that central banks
to central banks

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.870
could exchange money for gold.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.380
So we were still in
somewhat a gold standard.

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.262
And Rob might have a
different point of view--

00:33:04.262 --> 00:33:05.720
a good friend of
mine, Jeff Gordon,

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.430
is writing a book
about that weekend,

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:12.530
he was dean of the
business school at Yale.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:16.370
But the French had asked
for some of their gold back.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:17.810
And they got it back.

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:21.560
But then the British started
to make noise, Bank of England,

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:24.530
started make noise that they
wanted some of their gold back.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.410
And Richard Nixon
had a challenge.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:30.420
So he decided he'd just take
us off the gold standard.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:31.970
There's a lot of
historians' debate

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.420
whether the Bank of
England forced it or not.

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:34.920
Simon?

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:35.490
SIMON JOHNSON: It
wasn't their gold,

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.250
it was our gold-- they
wanted to exchange

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:38.498
their dollars for our gold.

00:33:38.498 --> 00:33:39.790
That's what Nixon didn't want--

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.970
GARY GENSLER: I see, I see.

00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:45.270
So Professor Johnson is
saying, it was actually--

00:33:45.270 --> 00:33:46.610
SIMON JOHNSON: US gold.

00:33:46.610 --> 00:33:49.260
GARY GENSLER: Wait, it was
the US gold, or the UK's gold?

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.310
SIMON JOHNSON: They had dollar
balances that they accumulated,

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.670
which was all fair and good.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:54.920
And under Bretton Woods, you
could convert your dollar

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.335
balances into gold, until
Richard Nixon said you

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:57.987
couldn't.

00:33:57.987 --> 00:33:58.820
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:01.220
And so the question
was, whose gold was it?

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.920
And under Richard Nixon's view--
and I think Simon is agreeing,

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.120
it was--

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:08.270
I didn't know, because you're
a dual citizen, aren't you?

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:10.727
I just didn't know when you
said our gold, whose gold?

00:34:10.727 --> 00:34:12.560
SIMON JOHNSON: It was
in my American accent.

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.300
GARY GENSLER: So your British
accent was throwing me off.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.020
OK, so Richard Nixon would
agree with Professor Johnson

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.900
that it was our gold.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.760
And the British to
this day would say,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:27.900
well, we didn't really
ask for it back,

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:30.469
They were making some
noises about this.

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:36.870
I don't know if that's--
that might even be.

00:34:43.650 --> 00:34:45.353
So what do they do?

00:34:45.353 --> 00:34:47.020
What does the central
banks actually do?

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:50.560
They oversee the
fractional banking system,

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.600
providing those reserves.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.510
But also regulating
the banking system.

00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.860
I mean, if you're sitting on
top of all of this back here,

00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:02.470
you might want to
regulate the whole system.

00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:05.260
And that's why around the globe,
by and large, central banks

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:07.660
regulate the banking
system-- not always,

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:09.490
and sometimes, like
in the United Kingdom,

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.210
they gave it up to another
agency and then pulled it back.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:13.745
Hugo?

00:35:13.745 --> 00:35:15.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
just have a question.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.330
So I understand how central
banks introduce new money

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.570
into the system.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.450
But what would be the
mechanism of trying

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:23.890
to decrease the supply of cash?

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:27.550
Would it be an increase in the--

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.460
or not allowing the commercial
banks to use much leverage?

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:33.790
Or how would they bring
money back and get rid of it?

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:37.080
GARY GENSLER: So you can apply--

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.110
a very good question--

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:41.080
Hugo is saying, how can you
change the amount of money?

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.840
And I'm going to use all
digital forms of money, not just

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.310
physical cash.

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:48.130
But off digital forms, the
way you can effect it is

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:54.530
say that any one bank needs
more capital, or more reserves--

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.050
so you're lowering
the multiplier

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:59.390
effect in fractional banking.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.950
If you need 5%
capital, that means

00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:05.620
you can have $20
of balance sheet

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.530
for every dollar of capital.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.140
If all of a sudden you
say, no, you need 10%,

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:14.910
then you would be shrinking
the banking system in half,

00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:16.250
for instance.

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.860
So there is a number of tools,
but one of the direct tools

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:22.830
is reserve requirements
and capital requirements.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.480
It's not the only tool.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.980
AUDIENCE: So it
would be a mandate

00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.390
to the commercial banks?

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.800
You wouldn't
necessarily directly

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.990
interact with the retail?

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:34.620
GARY GENSLER: Correct, the
Federal Reserve manages

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.870
monetary supply
in numerous ways,

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:38.720
but some of the direct ways--

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:42.600
and it's why they also regulate
the fractional banking system.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.930
They have that direct need.

00:36:45.930 --> 00:36:48.600
But they also need, very
importantly, the third bullet

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.660
point, to promote a safe and
efficient payment system.

00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:56.500
In some countries, many of the
countries represented here,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.550
written right in the
legislative act that sets up

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.700
a central bank, says they must
promote a safe and efficient

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.030
payment system.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.760
And if it's not written
into legislation,

00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.530
it's at the heart of
every central bank.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.660
They are also the
lender of last resort.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.050
When banks fail, they
come in and support them.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.990
Our central bank
was set up in 1913.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:23.410
In 1907, we had a crisis.

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.620
Banks were failing all around.

00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:27.760
Does anyone know the
history of that crisis?

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.370
Who actually was the
lender of last resort

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.740
in the US economy in 1907?

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:35.130
And it was not
the US government.

00:37:35.130 --> 00:37:36.400
AUDIENCE: JP Morgan.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.415
GARY GENSLER: JP Morgan.

00:37:38.415 --> 00:37:43.928
And not JP Morgan the
bank, JP Morgan the man.

00:37:43.928 --> 00:37:45.595
I mean, he had a bank,
he had a library,

00:37:45.595 --> 00:37:49.870
he had a lot of other
things going on for sure.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:52.030
You could say, he was
the Bill Gates or Warren

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:53.680
Buffett of his time.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.770
But in sense, he had more
influence than a Warren Buffett

00:37:56.770 --> 00:38:01.750
or Bill Gates in 1907.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.360
We had had a--

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.120
in fact, that picture in
the upper right corner,

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:15.421
is the First Bank of the US in
Philadelphia, set up in 1791.

00:38:15.421 --> 00:38:17.750
It was set up with
a 20-year charter.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:22.130
Hamilton and Jefferson
had a huge fight.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.970
The Congress passed
the law to set up

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.190
the First Bank of the US.

00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:27.840
And Jefferson recommends--

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.630
Jefferson with
Secretary of State--

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:33.240
recommends to President
Washington, veto it.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.530
Hamilton's wrong.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:39.510
Washington gave Hamilton one
week to write him a report.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:41.500
It's a really
well-written report--

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.160
I've not read it in
a number of years,

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:47.690
but I went back and read
it when I was at Treasury.

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.990
One week later, Washington
signed the bill.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:53.980
Jefferson never forgave
Hamilton for that,

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.520
and many other things.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:39:00.640
But it was a compromise
that only lasted 20 years.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:06.580
In 1811, we no longer
had a central bank.

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.640
So we had a love-hate in the
US with this central authority

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.620
in central banking.

00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.310
AUDIENCE: There's [INAUDIBLE]
and crypto anarchists say that

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:18.000
because Fiat currency isn't
backed by the gold standard,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.750
and because of fractional
reserve banking,

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.252
that the Fiat accounts
is worthless--

00:39:22.252 --> 00:39:23.710
I guess, what would
your response--

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:25.085
or the bankers in
the room-- what

00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:27.390
would your response to that be?

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:28.770
ROBLEH ALI: Well, I think--

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:33.460
I mean, money is-- it
comes back to money

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.200
as a social construct
thing, right?

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.598
Anything can be money if you
want it to, almost anything.

00:39:39.598 --> 00:39:41.890
So if you've got a big enough
group of people who think

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.057
something's money, then it
has-- that it's valuable,

00:39:44.057 --> 00:39:44.980
then that's true--

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.567
the US dollar, and a Bitcoin.

00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:49.150
But I guess the
question is how do you

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.440
generate trust in the system?

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.270
And I guess the US
government generates it

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:56.017
through having a nation state,
an army, and a treasury,

00:39:56.017 --> 00:39:56.850
and everything else.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:40:00.070
Whereas Bitcoin has this
network of miners, and this code

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:02.260
that people put their faith in.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.850
So it's just generally-- it's
the trust in a different way.

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:07.780
But to say, money is only
worthless if everybody

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.400
thinks it's worthless, or like
a significant group of people.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:13.550
So the Zimbabwean dollar
is worthless, right?

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:16.340
But Fiat money as a general
concept being worthless,

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.060
I mean, now you've choice.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.280
You can choose Bitcoin, or
any other crypto currency,

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:23.197
if you want to, depending
on your preferences.

00:40:23.197 --> 00:40:25.900
But I think it's difficult
to maintain it's worthless

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:29.005
when lots of people use it
all the time, can exchange it

00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:31.750
for goods and services.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:36.190
GARY GENSLER: And I think
also, Fiat currency has had

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:39.730
a lot of challenges and crises.

00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:43.270
Usually related to either
poor fiscal policy--

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.240
that the nation,
the government state

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:49.930
is overspending
its taxing ability,

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:53.420
because taxes are revenue,
and then the spending.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:58.220
Often related to
wars, but not always.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.360
Or to the monetary policy--

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.730
in essence, a lot of
printing of money.

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:07.130
In the old days, it was
physical printing of money.

00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:08.570
In the new days, it's digital.

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:12.330
It's the overseeing
of the banking sector.

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:15.170
And some of the
biggest banking crises

00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:17.930
have led to
significant, in essence,

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:20.090
expansion of the monetary base.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:21.890
Maybe it was lending
against real estate

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.248
in a housing bubble in
Ireland, or other countries,

00:41:25.248 --> 00:41:25.790
and so forth.

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:30.890
But we're not unique in the
US to have housing bubbles.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:34.010
And that can undermine
the social consensus

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.870
about Fiat money.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:41.960
Take China in the late 1940s,
where every few minutes

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.780
you had to worry about, did
you have enough suitcases

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.390
of physical cash to pay
for your restaurant bill,

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.450
if you were at a
restaurant, and so forth.

00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:54.190
And any country that's in
the midst of hyper-inflation,

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.280
you usually then-- the
social construct falls away.

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.580
But it's rare that it hasn't
been replaced by another Fiat

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.750
currency--

00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:07.490
maybe with a stronger military,
or a stronger central bank.

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:09.350
But after some crisis.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.920
Occasionally, it's replaced
by another country's Fiat

00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.280
currency, and there's a number
of Latin American countries

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.140
that have said, well
this isn't working.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:20.960
We're going to go
to the US dollar.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.620
And just be darn--

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.970
we're not going to
trust our sovereign,

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.585
we're to trust somebody else.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:28.940
And remember, I've
said this once,

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:30.960
I think, in this
class, the history--

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:34.430
and Simon, bail me
out, and Rob, bail me

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.130
out-- but the history
of the Bank of England

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:42.470
was that the King of England was
at war with the King of France,

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:45.830
and needed to borrow some money
and couldn't borrow it readily.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:48.770
I think it's like 1
and 1/2 million pounds.

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:51.050
And some noble lord
said, well, this is

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:53.090
how we'll give you the money--

00:42:53.090 --> 00:42:55.350
if we set up a board--

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:56.900
it was initially,
the Bank of England

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:02.240
was in essence a contract
between the sovereign

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.550
and the noble lords that
said, we have to check.

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:10.130
And then the war went
on, I don't remember,

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:12.590
you guys probably won
and beat the French.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:15.297
But it was in the
midst of a war that--

00:43:15.297 --> 00:43:16.340
SIMON JOHNSON: Always.

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.840
GARY GENSLER: All right, you're
recorded, by the way, video.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.600
Rob?

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.280
ROBLEH ALI: Yeah,
the Bank of England

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.323
was set up to finance
a war with France.

00:43:23.323 --> 00:43:25.740
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, was to
help finance a war with France.

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.240
ROBLEH ALI: And
what's interesting--

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.945
because the English
Civil War was actually

00:43:29.945 --> 00:43:33.027
in the mid-17th century,
so shortly after that.

00:43:33.027 --> 00:43:34.610
So that's after the
powers of the king

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.820
had been significantly
reduced, and became effectively

00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.010
a kind of
constitutional monarchy.

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:44.300
So the Bank of England was sort
of set up around that time.

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.850
GARY GENSLER: Same spirit
of checking the sovereign.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.650
So let's move on
a little bit, just

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:50.910
so we can get to what
central banks are doing.

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.300
But in essence, what
central banks do

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:56.060
is they oversee
the banking system.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:01.210
I mean, back to they promote the
economy through stable prices,

00:44:01.210 --> 00:44:06.130
and in some countries, also
this concept of a dual mandate.

00:44:06.130 --> 00:44:08.590
They manage the Fiat
currency-- money--

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:10.810
through supply and pricing.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:12.970
Oversee the banking system.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.570
And basically, are the
bankers to the government.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.790
When the government's
really in trouble,

00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:23.650
think back to the 1690s
when some noble lords

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.760
were funding the king--

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.400
it still happens that
central banks do sometimes

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:31.010
fund governments.

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:32.903
So the US Federal
Reserve balance sheet--

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:34.320
I'm not going to
spend time on it.

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.600
It will be in the
slides in Canvas.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.900
So let's talk about where
central banks approaches

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.940
to blockchain and crypto.

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:46.420
Some-- I would say a majority--
are monitoring and studying.

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:49.300
The US Federal Reserve would be
this way, the European Central

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:49.900
Bank.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.570
Rob has a better feel, because
he talks to central banks

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:53.380
all the time.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:57.310
But monitor and study
is the dominant place.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.620
Restrict-- restrict its use.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:04.220
I'd say that the People's Bank
of China is more towards this.

00:45:04.220 --> 00:45:06.400
They're kind of a mixture
between monitor and study,

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.300
because one of the readings was
actually from a senior policy

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.150
person at the People's
Bank of China,

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.490
and he's written some
remarkable pieces.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:19.720
Every few months, there's
a piece in like CNN,

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:24.790
or CCN, which is a crypto
newsletter, or Coin Telegraph,

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.700
that this one individual from
the Central Bank of China

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:28.865
is writing these pieces.

00:45:28.865 --> 00:45:31.240
Now, I don't know a lot about
the Central Bank of China--

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:34.450
he always puts at the bottom,
these are my personal views.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.100
But I have a
suspicion he would not

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:38.530
be allowed to write these
things if it weren't something

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.940
bubbling underneath.

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:44.130
But you can restrict
the use of crypto.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:47.700
And some countries, like China,
and elsewhere are doing that.

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.190
There's payment system
experimentation, which

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.682
we're going to chat about.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:53.640
And then there's this
thing called central bank

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.220
digital currency initiatives.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.422
And Rob and I know
the answer to this,

00:45:59.422 --> 00:46:00.630
but I'm curious to the group.

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.730
Central bank digital
currency, having read all

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.920
that you've read
for today, does it

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.350
rely on blockchain technology?

00:46:08.350 --> 00:46:10.270
Show of hands, yes or no?

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:12.970
So yes, it relies on--

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:14.620
my hand won't matter.

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.910
Does it rely on
blockchain technology?

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.160
Central bank digital currency?

00:46:21.247 --> 00:46:22.330
I don't see a single hand.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:23.110
How about no?

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.760
How many people think no?

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.440
Oh, you did your readings well.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.000
Did you read it-- thank you.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.310
She's-- Simon, I'm-- you know.

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:34.140
So central bank
digital currency is

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:37.320
inspired by this whole
crypto finance movement,

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:39.810
but it does not
necessarily depend

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.680
upon blockchain technology.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.740
But I think it's
central to this course,

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.590
and central to a study
of blockchain technology

00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:49.140
and money, because
it's absolutely

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:51.900
inspired by this whole movement.

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.820
Though, the first person
that wrote about it

00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:57.410
was Tobin in the
1980s, if I'm right.

00:46:57.410 --> 00:46:57.910
Right?

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.210
ROBLEH ALI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:03.240
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, 1987
or something, I think.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.960
Tobin wrote about
basically giving the public

00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:10.350
a direct tokenized means
beyond paper money--

00:47:10.350 --> 00:47:13.480
a digital means of an account.

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.230
But most people would say,
central bank digital currency

00:47:17.230 --> 00:47:19.540
relies on blockchain
technology, and you've

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.570
made me proud that you said no.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.090
Let's talk about
the pain points.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:26.740
This was last
Thursday's lecture,

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:31.660
but there's some payment
system pain points.

00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.960
I added one or two
because of your feedback,

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.190
but cost, delayed settlement,
chargebacks, fraud, privacy,

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:43.290
financial inclusion,
and the like.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:49.420
And for Rob and Simon, this
was last Thursday's discussion.

00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:52.330
So some of what the
public sector is doing

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:55.480
is non-blockchain
initiatives-- entirely

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.370
non-blockchain initiatives.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:01.000
The European Union,
the US, others,

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.580
are doing things
about faster payment.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.530
Basically trying to
move the payment system

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.110
to 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:12.130
not locked up on the weekend,
where you can actually move.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:16.600
And that merchants can
do it as well as banks.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.790
So whether it's the
target instant payment

00:48:18.790 --> 00:48:21.610
system, or what's known
as TIPS in Europe,

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.010
or faster payment task
force, which has led

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.550
to a faster payment mechanism--

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:29.680
I think, I'm guessing
Pria's husband's

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.300
working on that, right?

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:31.805
Does he--

00:48:31.805 --> 00:48:32.513
AUDIENCE: He was.

00:48:32.513 --> 00:48:35.140
GARY GENSLER: He was
working on the task force?

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:38.110
Shrimp joined us last
Thursday, and he talked

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.530
about-- he's at MasterCard.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.450
So a lot's going on.

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:45.490
I just note--

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.990
I put just two other countries.

00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:49.480
India's immediate
payment service

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.582
is really government
sponsored, government pressed.

00:48:54.582 --> 00:48:56.790
I think one of the gentlemen
that works on it, Simon,

00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:00.540
you have speaking at MIT'S
campus in a few weeks.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:01.710
Arvent worked on it.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:06.810
And in the UK, where
they're saying--

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:09.150
not only are we updating our
real time gross settlement

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:12.030
system, but there's
a government mandate

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.480
that banks have to open up
their bank accounts to what's

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.210
called open API.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:21.210
A lot is going on,
non-blockchain related,

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:25.690
related to payments, making
it faster and more access.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.750
But in the midst
of that, here is

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:31.990
a little bit of what's happening
in the blockchain space.

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.370
And with the help of the South
African white paper on this,

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.960
I break it into three phases.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:41.050
So I thank South
Africa's central bank.

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:42.940
First is phase one.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:44.870
Three countries wrote papers--

00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:48.100
Canada, Brazil, and Singapore.

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.410
Canada and Singapore
even called them

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:52.665
something-- it's called
Project Jasper in Canada,

00:49:52.665 --> 00:49:56.410
and Project Ubin in Singapore.

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.780
And they did some
experimentation, all

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.060
based on a Ethereum network--

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:06.320
could you do a better payment
system based on Ethereum?

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.360
So an open-source, blockchain,
permissionless system.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:13.980
And they tested out a new
real-time gross settlement

00:50:13.980 --> 00:50:14.480
system.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.700
And generally, the way
they do this is they

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.750
get a group of banks
in their country--

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:22.340
and if you were to read each
of their detailed reports,

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:24.600
there's some similarities
and some differences--

00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.200
but by and large, get a group
of banks in your country,

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:29.990
use the platform, try to do
a talking through, and see

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:31.025
if it will work.

00:50:31.025 --> 00:50:31.790
Elene?

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.830
AUDIENCE: So they built
a permissionless system?

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:35.372
GARY GENSLER: They
were trying to see

00:50:35.372 --> 00:50:39.830
if they could use the Ethereum
network to build a better

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:41.420
payment solution.

00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:43.880
AUDIENCE: Or are you saying
they developed a smart contract

00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.950
undercutting Etherium?

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:48.450
Or did they deploy their
own Etherium permissionless

00:50:48.450 --> 00:50:48.950
network?

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.120
Which one did they do?

00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:52.550
ROBLEH ALI: I think it
was, they just claimed

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:53.690
Etherium and deployed it.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:56.290
Like internet-- it wasn't
ever outside the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:56.290 --> 00:50:57.830
AUDIENCE: They
were doing mining?

00:50:57.830 --> 00:50:59.538
ROBLEH ALI: I don't
know how they did it,

00:50:59.538 --> 00:51:01.040
in terms of mechanism.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.540
GARY GENSLER: Now,
what you'll see--

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:06.180
because I want to
quickly go to phase two.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.960
Phase two, none of
them used Ethereum.

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.900
Phase two, two more
initiatives happened--

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:14.290
Japan and Europe together.

00:51:14.290 --> 00:51:16.890
And when I say Japan and Europe,
I mean the central banks.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:20.100
And all of these are
central bank focused.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:24.420
Japan and Europe added,
and South Africa.

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:27.360
And all five initiatives--

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:31.000
all have been
published already--

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:35.280
were happening in those various
states in mid to late '17.

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:38.340
And into '18, were
all on permission.

00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:41.220
They were looking at
Corda, Hyperledger Fabric,

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:41.950
and Quorum--

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:46.560
Quorum is the closed loop
system that JP Morgan.

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.560
We talked about Hyperledger,
Fabric, and Corda.

00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:55.730
So I think, Elene, this kind of
starts to answer your question.

00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:58.100
That they then
said, well, no, it's

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.110
not going to work
on a permissionless.

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:01.640
Every one of them
in phase one said,

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:03.140
we don't think this
is going to work

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:04.320
on a permissionless system.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.840
Let's then go into a
phase two experimentation.

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:13.340
We're now in kind of phase
three, or a third wave.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:15.650
We haven't heard from
Brazil recently--

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:19.370
don't know whether that
project is basically stopped.

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.730
But these are big countries
and big central banks,

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:25.700
that are interested is-- can
there be a payment system

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:27.840
solution?

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.160
So I'm just going to talk
about Singapore for a minute,

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:34.340
and give you a flavor for
outside of the readings,

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.680
but a little bit of what
the Singapore project is.

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:39.350
But it captures all
of these by just

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.590
talking about this project.

00:52:42.590 --> 00:52:45.800
This is from their papers.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:49.280
But they really see that we're
in a multi-phase project.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.990
And they are willing
to publicly say,

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:53.330
we're going to go further
than where we are right now.

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:54.800
We want to get to
the place where

00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:57.950
we have domestic
delivery versus payment,

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:00.800
and in the future payment
versus payment systems,

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.510
money versus money.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:05.270
Delivery versus payment,
DVP, is basically

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.540
a security versus money.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.540
So if you see the words DVP,
it's in the securities business

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:18.550
where you move a security
and a payment simultaneously,

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:20.500
and there's no credit risk.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.230
I will not give Rob the
security unless he gives me

00:53:23.230 --> 00:53:26.860
the cash, or vise versa.

00:53:26.860 --> 00:53:28.690
Ask me one day about when--

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:33.910
before we had DVP, what
the markets were like.

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:37.650
So Singapore is willing
to publicly announce--

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.540
we're going to take this
as far as we can go,

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:43.390
all the way to a
cross-border settlement

00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:46.690
of payments and securities
against each other,

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:50.170
D versus P versus P,
is what they call it.

00:53:50.170 --> 00:53:52.940
The D you can think
of as securities.

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.070
Will they succeed?

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:56.330
Do they need to stay
on a blockchain?

00:53:56.330 --> 00:53:59.000
I can't predict that.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.780
But they're willing to say,
we're going to give this a try.

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:04.530
Where are they right
now in phase two?

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:10.070
Well, they tested Corda,
Hyperledger Fabric, and Quorum.

00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:12.050
And they have a
full 60-page report

00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:15.350
they published a month or two
ago about how did each of them

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:20.360
work to do basically payment
versus payment, cash,

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.310
large cash movements.

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:24.680
But here are the six
criteria they tested,

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.320
and they say they passed
every one of them.

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.480
Now, I read the full
report, and I have to say,

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.790
it struck me that they
probably did pass it.

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:35.490
But I'm not enough of an
expert, and this stuff

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:37.860
gets very granular,
and the question still

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:42.510
is, could you just use an Oracle
database to do the same thing?

00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:44.550
And it's a fair question.

00:54:44.550 --> 00:54:47.550
But they tested it basically,
can you digitize the payments?

00:54:47.550 --> 00:54:50.130
Can you decentralize
the processing?

00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:51.720
Can you do the queuing--

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.830
the queuing of payments.

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:57.240
And a lot of
cross-entity payments,

00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.340
you have to net the payments.

00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:01.690
I'm going to pay Rob,
Rob is going to pay Hugo,

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.460
Hugo is going to pay me--

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:04.710
well, that doesn't make sense.

00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:08.550
You net it all, and it's
a queuing factor in all

00:55:08.550 --> 00:55:10.240
these real-time gross payments.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:10.915
Elene?

00:55:10.915 --> 00:55:12.790
AUDIENCE: So what is
decentralized processing

00:55:12.790 --> 00:55:13.770
mean here?

00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:15.350
So this was in what country?

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:16.350
GARY GENSLER: Singapore.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:17.350
AUDIENCE: Singapore?

00:55:17.350 --> 00:55:19.440
So there's a central
bank in Singapore,

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.060
it's clearly very centralized.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.820
What is the central [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.100
GARY GENSLER: It's up to them.

00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:24.642
And what they write
about, they think

00:55:24.642 --> 00:55:31.560
that you could lower the
single point of failure risk

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:33.280
by not having the central bank.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.820
They actively-- this is a
central bank writing the paper

00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:40.170
saying, we could have more
resilience in the system

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:43.460
if the database is
distributed amongst--

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.050
in this case, they had
11 banks participating.

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:48.570
And the 11 banks
have separate nodes.

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:51.720
Now, it's still a
permissioned system.

00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.570
You might say, and
somehow the central bank

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:57.120
has a notary node, maybe.

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:59.160
But it's amongst the 11 banks.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:02.040
And that there would be more
resilience to this system

00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:03.300
than having it centralized.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:05.850
AUDIENCE: And the central bank
still does monetary policy?

00:56:05.850 --> 00:56:08.520
GARY GENSLER: Central bank
still does monetary policy.

00:56:08.520 --> 00:56:11.040
Rob, what do you
want to add to this?

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.875
Because Rob swims
this lane, I don't.

00:56:12.875 --> 00:56:14.250
ROBLEH ALI: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.930
it's one of the big
challenges, right.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:21.480
Because the question of
how much the central bank

00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:24.310
consciously limits its own
power, I think is important.

00:56:24.310 --> 00:56:27.960
Because if you have
a system where--

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.490
because I think there is
an instinct of certainly

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:34.190
some central banks, they want to
maintain control of the system.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.080
Like, well, OK,
but we want to have

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.490
a special node for
the central bank,

00:56:38.490 --> 00:56:40.520
we can do all this,
that, and the other.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:42.350
And my argument is,
you actually want

00:56:42.350 --> 00:56:44.990
to limit the power
of the central bank

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.882
as far as you possibly
can, because it--

00:56:46.882 --> 00:56:48.340
to the extent that
the central bank

00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:50.007
has special powers
over the system,

00:56:50.007 --> 00:56:51.590
that creates a
weakness in the system.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:53.480
Because if that node
is then taken over,

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:57.588
then whoever can go
change the system--

00:56:57.588 --> 00:56:59.630
has effectively all the
power of the central ban.

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:06.020
Which takes away the
benefits of decentralization.

00:57:06.020 --> 00:57:08.360
To my mind, the point
of decentralization

00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:10.280
is increasing the
cost of the attack,

00:57:10.280 --> 00:57:13.700
by saying, well, to attack
the system, you have to attack

00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:15.540
50% of the nodes, or whatever.

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.370
But if you have this one special
node that could do everything,

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:18.953
then you only have
to attack one node.

00:57:18.953 --> 00:57:20.090
And it defeats the object.

00:57:20.090 --> 00:57:22.220
So I think when you're
speaking to central banks,

00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:24.470
you have to persuade
them of the need

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.930
to have a system that they--

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.030
like almost setting
up and let it go,

00:57:29.030 --> 00:57:31.550
rather than have to
continuously interfere with,

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:33.510
an have to have these
special powers in it.

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:38.050
GARY GENSLER: What's interesting
with so many countries,

00:57:38.050 --> 00:57:39.700
there's going to
be a wide variety.

00:57:39.700 --> 00:57:42.460
And I really do think that
many of the central banks

00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:45.520
are in that monitor
and study slipstream,

00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:50.140
and a couple are in let's
restrict the use slipstream.

00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:52.450
And even China that says,
we're restricting the use,

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:54.770
is still studying
the heck out of this.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:56.800
But some countries like
Singapore and Canada

00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.080
are in the forefront
saying, let's figure

00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:02.980
out-- maybe this technology
will make the payment system,

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:07.290
and thus the system of
Fiat money more resilient.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:11.860
It's still unknown, but they're
really trying to test the edge.

00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:12.360
Yes?

00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:15.150
AUDIENCE: So perhaps this is
just a peculiar observation,

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:17.940
but I feel like the
very institutions

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:21.270
that Satoshi and Bitcoin were
trying to disintermediate,

00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:23.640
are the ones that are taking
inspiration from this,

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:26.100
and then trying to advance
their own technology.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.950
And it feels-- is it
a competitive threat?

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:30.030
What's the disconnect?

00:58:30.030 --> 00:58:31.950
How are they
thinking about using

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:34.108
this for something
that was basically

00:58:34.108 --> 00:58:35.900
built to disintermediate
them [INAUDIBLE]??

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:37.353
GARY GENSLER: Remind
me your first name?

00:58:37.353 --> 00:58:38.040
AUDIENCE: Zahn.

00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:42.630
GARY GENSLER: Zahn-- so Zahn
is asking about Bitcoin,

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:45.570
and wasn't Satoshi
Nakamoto's innovation

00:58:45.570 --> 00:58:49.640
about doing something
not just decentralized,

00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:55.610
but not trusting--
trustless sort of system.

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:59.600
But every technology
evolution, whether it's

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:02.180
in electronics and
telecommunications,

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:07.190
or elsewhere, startups, if
they have something good,

00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:10.430
incumbents will look
at that technology

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:13.130
and see what to
adopt for themselves.

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.430
Partly because they're
threatened by the startups.

00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:19.130
And in this case, I really do
think central banks have felt

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:22.010
a little bit of heat on their
neck, a little bit of heat

00:59:22.010 --> 00:59:24.980
like, we've got to
think about our payment

00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.770
solutions and our
money solutions,

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:32.000
and maybe there's something
from blockchain technology.

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:34.340
But regardless of whether
it's the heat on the neck

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:39.620
or opportunity, incumbents
will always look at technology,

00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.150
and see.

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:43.760
And that's why the paper
that you've read sometimes,

00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.860
the Geneva Report,
that Simon and three

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:49.040
of our colleagues and I
co-authored this past summer,

00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:53.050
we called blockchain technology
a catalyst for change.

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:55.450
And we were agnostic,
partly because there

00:59:55.450 --> 00:59:59.830
were five of us
co-authoring it, but we

00:59:59.830 --> 01:00:02.860
felt that that captured
our five points of view.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:06.190
That it might be a catalyst
for change for incumbents,

01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:07.870
it might be a
catalyst for change

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:10.450
to inspire central bank
digital currencies, which

01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.890
frankly, don't have to be
on a blockchain at all.

01:00:13.890 --> 01:00:19.270
Or it might be some startup
that does really a unique thing,

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:22.192
and I mean unique
beyond crypto kitties.

01:00:22.192 --> 01:00:23.650
You know, something
more than that.

01:00:27.094 --> 01:00:31.030
Aviva-- I know you, Aviva.

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:33.040
AUDIENCE: So I was
just curious, are there

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.280
details about the timeline
for this, in the sense--

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:37.030
GARY GENSLER: Wait,
say that again?

01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:39.060
AUDIENCE: Are there
details about the timing

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.520
for like how long
it takes to process

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.450
a payment by the central bank,
like all the way to settlement,

01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:46.500
vis a vis Fiat currency?

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.290
GARY GENSLER: So the timeline
for the-- so not the study,

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:51.990
not this timeline, but you're
saying a timeline for--

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:55.540
AUDIENCE: No, for that specific
project, and this extract here

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:56.680
that they defined.

01:00:56.680 --> 01:00:57.347
Have they also--

01:00:57.347 --> 01:00:59.805
GARY GENSLER: I'd have to look
back-- it's a good question.

01:00:59.805 --> 01:01:02.400
I don't think Singapore has said
they're going to finish this

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:05.460
by 2019, but I don't
know whether they

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:08.720
said a date like 2021, or '22.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.810
But it's a multi-year project.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:12.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] for
a specific transaction

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:16.290
to process it all the way to
settlement, how long it takes?

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:21.870
GARY GENSLER: Oh, the test
case in Singapore and Canada,

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:22.930
within seconds--

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:24.960
but I don't know if it
was like nanoseconds.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.848
No, it's very quick.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:28.140
AUDIENCE: I have another
question for the three of you,

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.640
actually.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:32.670
How is the central bank
thinking about reporting

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.680
for these transactions?

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:38.310
Or is it a later-stage
problem to worry about?

01:01:38.310 --> 01:01:40.680
GARY GENSLER: Well,
the reporting,

01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.410
as I have read these reports--

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:44.160
and then I want to
move on to central bank

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.410
digital currencies, which we're
going to be largely talking

01:01:46.410 --> 01:01:48.035
about Thursday, but
I want to set it up

01:01:48.035 --> 01:01:51.090
because Rob won't
be with us Thursday.

01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:52.860
Reporting is-- this
is a ledger, this

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.130
creates a database, this
permissioned blockchains

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:58.460
amongst 11 banks in Singapore.

01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.990
And it's just a test,
it's just a test--

01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:03.300
is basically a form of a ledger.

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:07.290
So I don't think they've built
out any customer user interface

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.400
and reporting that way.

01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:14.400
But the transaction ledgers were
kept, similar to bank ledgers,

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.900
as I understood it.

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:20.050
But they didn't build
out a user interface.

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:21.953
Unless Rob, you
know any otherwise.

01:02:21.953 --> 01:02:22.720
No.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.900
So let's talk a little bit about
the next and the toughest--

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:28.360
central bank digital
currencies, that may or may not

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.520
be based on
blockchain technology.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.960
But they're absolutely inspired
by blockchain technology.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:38.020
So central banks currently
issue digital reserves.

01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.050
We saw that earlier.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:41.470
It's digital money already.

01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.720
And then physical tokens--

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.740
I keep my eye on this
physical token here, right?

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.090
So that's the form of money.

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:52.840
Commercial banks, then,
issue bank deposits.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.080
In the US, that's
about $13 trillion

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.920
to the public in bank deposits,
and there's only $1.7 trillion

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:00.490
of this.

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:02.680
So bank deposits are the
biggest form of money,

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.680
and it's all digital.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:09.040
Essentially, bank deposits
are intermediated central bank

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.450
digital currency.

01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:16.050
Those are my words, but it's
digital currency bank deposits,

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:18.240
it's just not directly
with the central bank.

01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.600
It's intermediated in between--

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:26.300
if you go back to that flow
chart that I had earlier.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:29.510
So the private sector is also
experimenting with stable value

01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:30.010
tokens.

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.570
We're going to talk about
that Thursday, there's

01:03:31.570 --> 01:03:33.940
some readings, so I'm
not going to dive in now.

01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.810
So there's a little
bit of competition.

01:03:36.810 --> 01:03:38.660
So it's like Zahn's
earlier question--

01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:41.340
the private sector,
Circle, and Tether,

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.560
and others are having
these stable value tokens.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:47.220
So there's a little bit of
competition coming that way.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.920
So the strategic question
for the central banks is,

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.870
should we allow direct
access to digital reserves?

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:56.970
We have this
intermediated central bank

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.520
digital reserve
called bank deposits,

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.980
but should we have
something direct to us?

01:04:01.980 --> 01:04:04.320
Like cash is a
direct relationship

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:07.140
between the central
bank and the holder.

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:10.380
That's really the strategic
question, when you--

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.780
I believe when you move
away from the technology,

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:15.420
you don't know have to
know about hash functions

01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.200
or anything.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.750
That's the strategic question.

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:20.650
Why do I think there's
some opportunities?

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:22.650
And we're going to dive
more into this Thursday,

01:04:22.650 --> 01:04:25.870
but I want Rob to see if he
wants to speak about this

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:26.700
and tell us.

01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.040
I think this is
a real question--

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.080
and Sweden has highlighted it--

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.760
they want a
continued involvement

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:33.840
in the means of payment.

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.220
Sweden is already down to
about 2% of GDP, or 1/2% of GDP

01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:40.350
is their kronas--

01:04:40.350 --> 01:04:43.680
the physical kronas-- the
US is still at 8% or 9%.

01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.830
But they're saying
nobody is accepting

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:49.500
physical kronas anymore
in Sweden and Norway,

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:50.610
and so forth.

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:53.670
Pretty soon, most retailers
will not take them.

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:55.380
So they're saying,
maybe the government

01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:58.950
needs to have a continued
direct relationship.

01:04:58.950 --> 01:05:01.530
Could it promote competition
in the banking system?

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.880
Because otherwise,
if you don't have it,

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:06.030
then the banks are controlling
the payment system,

01:05:06.030 --> 01:05:07.500
and the means of payment.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:10.080
Promoting financial
inclusion-- not everybody

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.190
will have a bank account.

01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:13.140
Well, maybe they could
have some digital form

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.950
of central bank money
instead of a bank account.

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:19.800
The pain points-- and I
would say for some countries,

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.080
some countries are clearly
looking at central bank

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:24.840
digital currencies to
avoid US sanctions.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:29.220
Venezuela and Iran both have
projects for central bank

01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.600
digital currency.

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.560
Sorry, question?

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:39.480
And so here, of course,
blockchain technology

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:41.310
could be relevant.

01:05:41.310 --> 01:05:43.890
For these six reasons,
or five reasons,

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:45.630
you didn't need
blockchain technology.

01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:48.255
But I'm going to say, blockchain
technology could be relevant--

01:05:48.255 --> 01:05:51.840
Fiat currencies on a ledger,
verification and networking

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:55.470
costs are critical to
the economics of money.

01:05:55.470 --> 01:05:58.350
So I wouldn't count blockchain
technology out of this,

01:05:58.350 --> 01:06:01.020
because blockchain technology
can lower verification

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.640
and networking costs.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:06.240
But I think we're too early
to know whether blockchain

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.970
technology will be at the
center of central bank

01:06:08.970 --> 01:06:10.350
digital currency.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:12.880
But it could have an effect.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:15.075
So the challenges.

01:06:15.075 --> 01:06:16.950
And again, we'll dive
more of these Thursday.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.350
Rob, you want to say anything
about these challenges?

01:06:21.350 --> 01:06:22.790
ROBLEH ALI: Yeah,
I mean, I think

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:24.380
Ben's speech was good on--

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.410
GARY GENSLER: Ben
Broadbent's speech.

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:26.660
ROBLEH ALI: Yeah, Ben
Broadbent's speech

01:06:26.660 --> 01:06:27.740
is good on that one.

01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.200
Because I think the
fundamental one is this--

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.570
how do you fund a productive
enterprise in the real economy?

01:06:33.570 --> 01:06:34.570
Right, that's the real--

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:35.240
GARY GENSLER: How do you--

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:36.920
ROBLEH ALI: How do you
fund productive enterprise

01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:37.680
in the real economy?

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.830
And at the moment, certainly
in the UK and Europe,

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:41.930
and I guess to a lesser
extent in the US,

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:44.550
but it's largely true
for the US, as well,

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:48.960
is that you are very much
reliant on bank lending.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.820
And if you do something which
essentially drains deposits

01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:55.070
from banks, are you like
fundamentally changing

01:06:55.070 --> 01:06:56.630
the nature of the system?

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.780
And how are you going
to create a system

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.660
which allows people to fund
mortgages, or fund businesses,

01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:03.420
or whatever it is?

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:06.230
And I think that's
the big challenge.

01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:09.260
So I think that's like the
central question, which

01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:11.580
I think is the
bullet three, effects

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.490
on credit allocation
in the economy,

01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:16.940
is the thing that I think weighs
on central bankers the most.

01:07:16.940 --> 01:07:19.730
GARY GENSLER: So basically, if
you disintermediate the banks,

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:21.560
and the banks are
not collecting--

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:24.710
again, using US numbers--
$13 trillion of deposits,

01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:29.250
but only $12 trillion of
deposits, or maybe $6 trillion

01:07:29.250 --> 01:07:32.950
of deposits, what are we
doing to credit allocation?

01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:35.130
Because for three
to five centuries,

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:38.880
or certainly since the
Industrial Revolution,

01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:42.390
banks form an important
feature in our economy

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:45.970
to promote the
extension of credit.

01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:51.060
And we had this six or eight
lectures ago, this graph

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:55.080
that in the US, debt to
our economy is about 3.8,

01:07:55.080 --> 01:08:01.380
or 380% of our economy in
debt it's not all bank debt,

01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:03.690
but bank debt is a
big piece of that.

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:07.740
Can you move credit allocation
away from the banking system?

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:11.280
Well, the answer has got
to be in some level, yes,

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:15.750
but what are the pros
and cons of doing that?

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.850
It's not whether you
can, it's whether it's

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:20.729
a better system, a better
economy, better growth

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:21.960
with or without it.

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:22.800
Shawn?

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.342
AUDIENCE: I was just
curious, can you

01:08:24.342 --> 01:08:26.880
use different interest
rates to represent

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.490
different level of risk?

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:32.776
And then use a differentiation
and interest point as a way

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:35.109
to fund the corporates, so
they can get the loan faster,

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:36.729
or they can get the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:36.729 --> 01:08:37.830
GARY GENSLER: So the
question is, could you use

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:39.540
interest rates to try to do it?

01:08:39.540 --> 01:08:42.390
Which leads us to
design considerations.

01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:49.870
Which is basically, I
listed that the last one.

01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:52.660
You could have a central
bank digital currency

01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:54.670
that had zero interest rate--

01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:56.800
interestingly, we'll
talk more Thursday--

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:57.760
Sweden said no.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.490
They think they'd put
an interest rate on it.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:02.370
But you could go
no interest rate.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:04.540
And I'd like to
hear your thoughts

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.450
Thursday, well, why did
Sweden come out there?

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:09.319
And what does that make sense?

01:09:09.319 --> 01:09:11.109
You could put limits
or caps on it,

01:09:11.109 --> 01:09:13.390
and say, these are only
low dollar accounts.

01:09:13.390 --> 01:09:18.310
You can only have X 100
euro, or X 100 krona,

01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:19.600
or Y number of dollars.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.000
And it's really just small
transactional accounts,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.130
equivalent to $20 bills,
not $100 or 500 euro notes.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.520
So you can put limits or
caps, or no interest rates,

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.160
and so forth.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.420
Do you make it widely
accessible, and so forth?

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:38.529
So there's all these
design considerations,

01:09:38.529 --> 01:09:41.112
which I'm guessing
Rob, you've talked

01:09:41.112 --> 01:09:42.279
to a bunch of central banks.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:46.120
Where do they come out on these
issues, as you see it, in 2018?

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:48.540
ROBLEH ALI: You've got a lot
of different opinions on it.

01:09:48.540 --> 01:09:50.649
I think the limits and
caps thing is a hard thing

01:09:50.649 --> 01:09:51.910
to practically implement.

01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:56.145
That was always the
sort of skepticism

01:09:56.145 --> 01:09:58.270
around that-- it's like if
you have these accounts,

01:09:58.270 --> 01:10:00.830
and you say, well, we're going
to only have one per person,

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:02.955
we're going to cap it at
a certain amount of money.

01:10:02.955 --> 01:10:05.530
What practically
happens in a wrong--

01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:07.550
is the government really
going to say, well, no,

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:08.550
you can't put any more--

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:11.480
Like there'll be a lot
of political pressure

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:17.270
in any crisis, so I think caps
are really seen as viable.

01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:19.770
And then, I think the interest
bearing thing is interesting.

01:10:19.770 --> 01:10:21.270
I mean, the only
reason cash doesn't

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:23.620
bear interest is because it's
technologically difficult

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.930
to make a paper bear interest.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:30.000
So I think with
digital currency,

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.960
they might as well give
yourself the option.

01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:33.835
Say, yeah, well, we can
set the interest rate

01:10:33.835 --> 01:10:37.358
to zero if you want to, but
why limit yourself to say,

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:38.650
well, we won't charge interest?

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.120
Because it's again--
it's like that's

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.912
a limitation that comes
from the technology

01:10:41.912 --> 01:10:44.410
of physical banknotes,
and there's no real need

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:48.410
to import it into the digital
world, when you could achieve

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:50.410
the same effect by just
setting the rate at zero

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.060
if you want to.

01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:55.030
GARY GENSLER: And one of the
reasons that some countries are

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:57.070
exploring this
option, is they think

01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:59.080
it'll be easier to
do monetary policy,

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.750
because you're going to have
negative interest rates.

01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:05.230
Physical cash makes it
hard for-- oh, nobody

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:06.610
like that, huh?

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:11.560
No, the two Elenes, you don't
like negative interest rates?

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.620
But for a while, we effectively
had negative interest rates.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.740
Certainly for
corporate deposits.

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:25.270
But if everything was digital,
and there was no physical cash,

01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:27.520
central banks say
we could actually

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:33.164
go and have no lower bound, no
zero bound to interest rates.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:34.590
ROBLEH ALI: I guess
you, in a way,

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:36.850
you don't necessarily need that.

01:11:36.850 --> 01:11:38.935
Because if you can
just create more money

01:11:38.935 --> 01:11:41.700
and pump it into the economy,
it has the same effect, right?

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.450
GARY GENSLER: Right,
so what Rob is saying

01:11:43.450 --> 01:11:46.870
is you could affect
that by supply of money,

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:48.730
rather than the
pricing of money.

01:11:48.730 --> 01:11:51.370
And so there's both.

01:11:51.370 --> 01:11:54.610
One of the most interesting to
me is the second bullet point--

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:56.500
is a token or account based.

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.950
And the two merge
together, in a sense.

01:11:59.950 --> 01:12:03.150
This piece of paper is a token.

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:06.707
Nobody's keeping an account that
when I hand this to Rob-- here,

01:12:06.707 --> 01:12:09.160
you can take it, Rob.

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:12.210
That's your fee, remember.

01:12:12.210 --> 01:12:15.580
So that's a token based
bit of money, that's

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.770
what is called token based.

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:19.960
Token based money
is more anonymous,

01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.760
and you can keep
it more anonymous.

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.440
Account base is
when you're actually

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:26.440
keeping the ownership
somewhere on a registry.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:29.320
Even though that $20 bill
is registered somewhere,

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:33.010
it has a serial number, it's
a token based bit of money.

01:12:35.830 --> 01:12:41.100
The Swedes, interestingly, say
they'd have to change the law--

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:44.520
their own central bank
laws-- for one of these two.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:45.690
And now I can't remember.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:49.470
But they have-- if
it's token base,

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:51.210
it would come under
their e-money laws,

01:12:51.210 --> 01:12:54.480
and I think they don't need
to change the law to do that.

01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:58.890
But in Sweden, they would have
to change their central bank

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.800
laws to do e-deposits,
because they would literally

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.100
be opening up their central
bank to something other

01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:06.450
than commercial banks.

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:10.260
That's it-- they have to go
to their legislative body

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:13.710
and parliament to actually
do an account based, and not

01:13:13.710 --> 01:13:16.770
a token based, if I recall.

01:13:16.770 --> 01:13:18.410
So there's some
also legal reasons

01:13:18.410 --> 01:13:20.160
why you might need to
do one or the other,

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.957
but one would have more
anonymity than the other.

01:13:22.957 --> 01:13:24.540
ROBLEH ALI: I think
it's worth noting,

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.210
on these token versus
account models,

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:29.798
it's not well-defined what
people mean when they say taken

01:13:29.798 --> 01:13:30.340
and accounts.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.700
So different central
banks will say this,

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.680
and mean different things.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.480
And also people who work on
Bitcoin will think about--

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:40.940
so when I see tokens, I think
about particular structure

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:42.960
and transactions,
which Bitcoin has.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.650
And when I think
about accounts, I

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:47.320
think of structure of
transactions that Ethereum has.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:49.728
And that's how I distinguish
between those two things.

01:13:49.728 --> 01:13:52.020
But I think having spoken to
different central bankers,

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:56.432
they think about it differently,
because e-money is like--

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.640
you could think about it as--

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.820
I mean to me, that's an
account based system.

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.922
But some bankers
think about it--

01:14:02.922 --> 01:14:05.130
some central bankers think
about that as token based.

01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:08.400
So it's worth noting
that the definitions are

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:11.190
very fluid in this area.

01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:15.493
GARY GENSLER: So we're going
to save this for Thursday.

01:14:15.493 --> 01:14:16.910
I'm not going to
go through this--

01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.620
it was in one of the readings.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:21.650
Garratt, who
testified in Congress,

01:14:21.650 --> 01:14:23.820
was so popular with
this, then the Bank

01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:25.820
of International Settlement
picked up this thing

01:14:25.820 --> 01:14:27.770
called the money flower.

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.270
But I'm going to save this, I
want to kick this to Thursday.

01:14:30.270 --> 01:14:32.270
But it's basically
the four things--

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:35.480
widely accessible, is it
digital, is its central bank,

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:37.090
is it token based?

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:40.550
And depending upon
where these intersect,

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:42.140
you can take any form of money.

01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.790
You could say, well, it's
not central bank issued,

01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:48.780
its token based,
private digital tokens,

01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:52.500
is down on the right hand corner
is one little piece of it.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:57.060
It's just a way to take these
four important features.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:15:01.640
And we already have
central bank digital money,

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:04.840
which is in the middle of all
this, it's called reserves.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:08.870
But we're going to hold
this for Thursday--

01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:11.540
but this crazy
little money flower,

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.320
central bankers who
are in this world,

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:18.260
they've been using this, because
this Professor Garratt came up

01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:19.400
with it.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:21.037
I mean, I've seen
this in other papers.

01:15:21.037 --> 01:15:22.370
ROBLEH ALI: It's very important.

01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:23.640
GARY GENSLER: They
love it, you know.

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.350
I don't know.

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:27.800
Money and flowers
together, there you go.

01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:29.895
But Rob, I don't
know if you want

01:15:29.895 --> 01:15:31.520
to come up and help
close it, but these

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:33.830
are the ones we're going
to talk about on Thursday.

01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:35.600
And since Rob won't
be here on Thursday,

01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:38.420
I'm kind of curious if he has a
point of view on any of these--

01:15:38.420 --> 01:15:40.070
and you can see
them here, as well.

01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:42.170
ROBLEH ALI: The UK one is
actually being stopped.

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:46.290
So I read something recently
that the UK government--

01:15:46.290 --> 01:15:48.680
I assume at the prompting
of the Bank of England,

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.960
although their fingerprints
are not directly on it,

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.250
I can imagine that
they were behind it.

01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:58.590
I think Uruguay is
an interesting one.

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:00.740
I recently went
to a presentation

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.800
by Uruguay central bank,
and what's interesting about

01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:07.240
that project is that it was
actually live and out there

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.073
in the hands of people,
paying for things in shops.

01:16:11.073 --> 01:16:12.740
And I think that's
what distinguishes it

01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:16.800
from a lot of the
other projects.

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.965
So for example, the
ones that Gary's talked

01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:21.810
about earlier in, say,
Singapore and Canada,

01:16:21.810 --> 01:16:24.590
are really just in-house
creative concepts,

01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:26.810
whereas the Uruguay
project was something

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:31.860
that actually has worked, and
they've taken an early form.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.900
The Swedish one, again,
is fairly early stage.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:37.560
The e-krona is
not out there yet,

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:39.750
they're just starting
to explore it.

01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:41.300
The Tunisia one
was interesting--

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.793
I've spoken to one of
the guys working on that.

01:16:43.793 --> 01:16:46.210
And again, that's interesting
because it's a live project.

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.980
It's continuing-- unlike
the Uruguayan project,

01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.080
it's a continuing project.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.330
So it'll be interesting to
see how it plays out there.

01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:56.303
And I think the reason being
is a lot of the thing that

01:16:56.303 --> 01:16:58.220
puts off central banks
from actually doing it,

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.678
is they don't know what effect
it would have on the banking

01:17:00.678 --> 01:17:01.750
system, or whatever.

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:03.807
And I think you
will start to see--

01:17:03.807 --> 01:17:05.640
when you start to see
people actually trying

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:07.730
it, and deploying a central
bank digital currency

01:17:07.730 --> 01:17:10.040
in the real economy,
then you will

01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:13.922
have a real pilot, or
a real world example,

01:17:13.922 --> 01:17:15.380
that you can then
research and say,

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.838
well, actually the
effect was this.

01:17:16.838 --> 01:17:19.690
Because at the moment, a lot of
the debate around central bank

01:17:19.690 --> 01:17:21.440
digital currency, what
would be the effect

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:22.910
be on the banking system?

01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:24.940
This is conjecture,
you can build a model.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:25.940
But it's very difficult.

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:28.107
But I think once you start
to see countries actually

01:17:28.107 --> 01:17:30.040
issue them, then you
get the evidence in.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:33.190
And then I think you'll
see a cascade effect.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.690
It will be very quickly, then,
the technology is proven out,

01:17:35.690 --> 01:17:37.732
and then more and more
countries will issue them.

01:17:37.732 --> 01:17:39.470
And also because of
the funding effect,

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:44.100
Gary talked earlier
about the cash--

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:48.530
like US dollars, physical cash,
is effectively $1.6 trillion

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.230
of interest-free borrowing
by the US government.

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:54.540
And if, say, the US government
issued digital dollars,

01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:58.787
then arguably you could
retire half the national debt

01:17:58.787 --> 01:17:59.870
and replace it with money.

01:17:59.870 --> 01:18:02.600
So there are these big
fiscal implications.

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.310
And the Body of the
Commonwealth paper,

01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:06.860
which my colleagues at
[INAUDIBLE] wrote, I think,

01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:10.160
two years ago, sort of
addresses that fiscal element.

01:18:10.160 --> 01:18:12.950
And I think that will be a
big attraction to politicians

01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:14.310
looking to spend money.

01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:16.820
GARY GENSLER: And
before we close, Simon,

01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.660
because you're rarely with
us, but from your perspective,

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:23.764
either from your chief
economist days at the IMF,

01:18:23.764 --> 01:18:25.460
or just because you--

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:30.170
Simon hosts the Tuesday night
blockchain seminar dinners,

01:18:30.170 --> 01:18:31.930
by the way, too,
for three years.

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:34.160
So Simon is way ahead--

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:36.680
one might say he was kind
of a blockchain Bitcoin

01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:38.180
maximalist three years ago.

01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:41.480
I think you've moved
more to the middle--

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.700
you can self-declare
where you are.

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.990
And Simon, Johnson,
and Nehan, Narula,

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:47.490
and Michael, Casey,
and I, are going

01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:52.280
to be standing up a blockchain
lab course in the spring.

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.200
So Simon?

01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.330
Your question is, what do
you think about all this,

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.640
and maybe for both of
you in the last minute,

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:02.003
when are we going to see a true
central bank test this out?

01:19:02.003 --> 01:19:03.920
I mean, there's nine of
them on this page that

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.123
are kind of feeling it out.

01:19:07.123 --> 01:19:09.540
SIMON JOHNSON: I don't think
there's any technical problem

01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:10.040
here at all.

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.710
I think Rob has clearly put
this out on a long time ago.

01:19:12.710 --> 01:19:14.930
I think the issue comes
down to what Rob said,

01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:16.280
what does it do to credit?

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.643
Who really wants to
find out the hard way?

01:19:18.643 --> 01:19:20.060
And what does it
do-- what happens

01:19:20.060 --> 01:19:21.890
in a crisis when
everyone-- you know,

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.480
let's say you're
not paying interest

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.213
on a digital central
bank currency,

01:19:25.213 --> 01:19:27.130
and you can get interest
on your bank account,

01:19:27.130 --> 01:19:28.730
but there's a crisis.

01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:30.735
And you say, well, I
don't want to have this--

01:19:30.735 --> 01:19:32.860
be holding the liability
of a private bank anymore,

01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:35.152
I want to be holding the
liability of the central bank.

01:19:35.152 --> 01:19:36.860
Doesn't everyone run
to the central bank?

01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:38.310
And what does that do to credit?

01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:40.160
And how you're going
to figure this out,

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.512
without actually running
something like on [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:43.970
GARY GENSLER: And
two predictions--

01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:46.830
how many years before
our country actually--

01:19:46.830 --> 01:19:49.615
because 180 countries,
nine of them

01:19:49.615 --> 01:19:51.170
are already bubbling around.

01:19:51.170 --> 01:19:56.750
Two of these-- Ecuador
stopped, Uruguay maybe stopped,

01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.400
and the UK Royal
Mint might have been

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.850
stopped by its own government.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:02.640
But when do you
think we're going

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:08.600
to see a country actually
have a direct digital account

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.800
to their reserves?

01:20:09.800 --> 01:20:10.910
For the retail public?

01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:12.110
ROBLEH ALI: It could
be a couple of years.

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:13.630
I mean, Tunisia is
the closest to--

01:20:13.630 --> 01:20:15.510
up on that list--

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:16.950
but a couple of years.

01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:18.120
For the first one, yeah.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.910
I mean, we're early
[INAUDIBLE] years,

01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.730
within two years,
at least, possibly.

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:27.170
GARY GENSLER: So back
together on Thursday.

01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.930
We're going to dig
back into these nine,

01:20:28.930 --> 01:20:30.680
and talk a little bit
more about the money

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.170
flower and the readings,
which I think, as I always do,

01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:34.775
I list them.

01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:41.540
Some of those are more fun,
and they're shorter readings,

01:20:41.540 --> 01:20:42.240
as well.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:48.290
So I will see you all on
Thursday at 2:30 to 4:00,

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:51.560
and I thank you once again.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.410

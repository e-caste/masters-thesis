00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.840
MARKUS KLUTE:
Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.360
In this short video, we want
to discuss length contraction.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.210
We're going to actually
derive length contraction.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.010
And we do this
with an experiment.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.290
The question is how long
is Bob's spacecraft?

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.300
The experiment is conducted
by taking two pictures.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.640
So let's [? read ?] it here.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.590
The first picture is when
Alice's and Bob's spacecrafts

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.690
just start to meet.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.410
Bob's relative to Alice's,
is moving with a velocity, v.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.360
And we take the
second picture when

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.290
the back of Bob's spacecraft is
meeting the front of Alice's,

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.240
just like it's shown here.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.160
And the pictures-- take
pictures of clocks.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.790
So in the first picture,
we see Alice's clock

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.100
showed a T A1 and Bob's T B1.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.810
And for the second equivalently
we see T A2 and T B2.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.360
So your task is now to express
the length of Bob's spacecraft

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.580
as Alice sees this
from these pictures

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.480
and as Bob now see it
from his own pictures

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.395
by comparing the time
and the velocity.

00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:17.660
Now pause the video and
try to work this out.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.400
So I did this here for you.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.920
We calculate the length.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.430
We can do this with
the velocity and simply

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.020
the product of the velocity,
and the time difference,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.990
and the pictures as shown
[? of ?] those two clocks.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.620
We see this for Alice,
and we see this for Bob.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.900
And now we can start to compare.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.680
For Bob, Alice now is moving.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.410
So the time difference
in Alice's clock

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.590
will be smaller by 1 over
gamma compared to what

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.740
Bob sees on his own clocks.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.820
Bob says, "Your clock is slow."

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:58.820
So we can use this.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.730
We can then calculate the
length of the spacecraft

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:09.070
as Alice sees it equal
to v times delta T A.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.920
And we'll just use the
time dilation here.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.770
In this equation, we find
that the lengths are actually

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.010
not the same.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.670
The length as Alice sees
this is 1 over gamma times

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.890
the length as Bob sees this
of the very same spacecraft.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.960
So the length of the spacecrafts
are not the same as seen

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.690
by Alice and seen by Bob.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.540
Now here you have to see that,
in this example, what I just

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.890
did is I changed around who's
moving and who's resting.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.820
So here the observation of
Alice of Bob's spacecraft

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.400
is that of a moving spacecraft.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.830
So Alice sees a
moving spacecraft,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.000
which is shorter than the
spacecraft itself at rest.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.430
So how can we resolve this?

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.160
Alice will argue that
the two clocks Bob used

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.960
are actually not synchronized.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.660
And if you paid a
lot of attention,

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.960
you'll see that I'm actually
not looking at the same clock.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.460
I'm [? having ?] a
look at the clock

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.877
at the beginning
of the spacecraft

00:03:06.877 --> 00:03:08.790
and at the end of
the spacecraft.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.400
And while they're
synchronized for Bob,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.230
they're not
synchronized for Alice.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.360
Who's right?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.470
Both are right.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.150
They're just observing
events or sequences

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.340
of events as two different
[? reference ?] points.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.770
PROFESSOR: Today,
what we want to do

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.760
is finish off our discussion
of Lotka-Volterra competition

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.666
models.

00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:27.540
So starting with this
idea of the two species

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.950
interacting competitively
but then moving on to try to

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.366
think about the
general properties

00:00:31.366 --> 00:00:32.450
of Lotka-Volterra systems.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.199
In particular, when
you have more species,

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.100
the kinds of dynamics
that you can get.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.270
Also, we're going to talk
about these non-transitive

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.770
interactions, which are the
rock-paper-scissors type

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.550
interactions that may facilitate
the maintenance of diversity

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.640
in populations or
ecosystems, in particular,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.910
in the presence of some
sort of spatial structure.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.204
And so we'll talk both
about this demonstration

00:00:53.204 --> 00:00:54.870
of rock-paper-scissors
type interactions

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.580
in the context of
male mating strategies

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.850
in lizards, this paper
that was by Curt Lively.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.424
And then we'll talk
about another paper

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:04.590
in the microbial realm,
where they showed that there

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.500
are rock-paper-scissors type
interactions in the context

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.940
of colicin production,
toxin production

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.870
in the context of bacteria.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.720
Then, at the end, we'll talk
about these population waves.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.761
There was a rather
mathematical reading

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:22.260
that I had originally proposed,
but then we kind of switched

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.730
things up a bit, so
that you could, instead,

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.739
read that rock-paper-scissors
paper-- that is confusing--

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:32.030
that I think is maybe more fun.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.580
But I'll tell you kind of this
basic idea of the population

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.242
waves, what happens, if you have
a combination of some growth

00:01:38.242 --> 00:01:40.200
process together with
some effective diffusion,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.100
you can get these
population waves that

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.890
correspond to this process
of range expansion,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.840
where a population expands
into new territory.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.950
I just started by
putting up what

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.780
we had from the last class.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.070
So this is the two species
Lotka-Volterra competition

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.930
model.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.870
So what we found was that,
for this to be competition,

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.960
for the species to be kind
of bad for each other,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.025
that that corresponds to
the betas being positive.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.720
Now, what we found is
there are four cases

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.675
in terms of the outcome of
this two species interaction.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.280
And we wanted to,
at least, try to get

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.040
some sense of why that was
and what the trajectories

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.180
might look like.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.370
If you look at and N1 and N2,
we can draw these nullclines

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.470
and then get a sense of
where the trajectories are

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.180
going to go.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.660
Now, the basic outcome of this
two species Lotka-Volterra

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.460
competition model are
really exactly the same

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.360
as the possible
outcomes when we're

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.160
thinking about frequency
dependent selection, where

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:54.310
we could get, in this case, that
species 1 dominates or species

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.329
2 dominates, 1 or 2.

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.620
But then we could also get
coexistence or bi-stability.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.460
And indeed, there
is, in general,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.770
a mapping from the
Lotka-Volterra kind of approach

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.560
here and the approach that
was kind of in Martin Nonwak's

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.444
book of thinking about
frequency dependent selection

00:03:19.444 --> 00:03:20.235
in this population.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.790
And so then it's not
a surprise that you

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.920
get the same four outcomes
between these two situations.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.260
And I think that this
is also highlighting

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.850
some very interesting and deep
connections between evolution,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.910
which is changes in, say,
allele frequency in a population

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.020
of a single species,
over time, and then

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.250
some of these ecological kind of
processes, where you're really

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.000
thinking about these
as different species.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.947
Now, of course, in the case
of the evolutionary dynamics

00:03:55.947 --> 00:03:57.780
that we analyze Martin's
book, though, those

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.220
were the evolution of
different clonal populations

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.487
in asexually
reproducing populations.

00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:08.320
Do you guys remember
what I'm talking about?

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.950
All right.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.619
So I just want to draw a couple
of these sorts of diagrams.

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:16.410
I'm not going to draw
out all four of them,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.220
because it does take some time.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.990
But hopefully, we can
reconstruct where we were.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.590
The case that we were analyzing
before, the N1 dot equals 0.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.280
We're going to have
it as a dashed line.

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.640
And N2 is going to
be-- well, maybe

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.040
we'll try to use thick chalk.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.380
Oh, wow, I missed.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.860
These are thick lines.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.310
So we'll draw these
nullclines over here.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.470
So the N1 dot-- and
indeed, one of the comments

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.920
is that it would be nice to
draw where the nullclines are

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.330
on the axes as well.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.410
And indeed, we can do that.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.800
We aim to please.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.530
So the dashed lines correspond
to N1 dot being to 0.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.600
So here's N1, N2.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.520
So N1 equal to 0
corresponds to this thing.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.260
And then we have this other
guy that's a line, here.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.230
Now what we found is
that, if N2 is equal to 0,

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:33.650
this intersects at K1, whereas
the intersection over here

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.050
is at K1 divided by beta 12.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.390
Now, we have our
other nullclines

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.160
that correspond to
N2 dot equal to 0.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.770
Now one of those lines is
indeed going to be along here.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.570
And the other line
can fall-- there

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.510
are four different
possibilities for how

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.780
we might draw it in relation
to this N1 dot equal to 0

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.420
nullcline.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.640
And depending on the
orientation of that,

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.760
we'll end up getting these four
different possible outcomes

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.170
of 1 dominating, irrespective
of the initial conditions,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.950
2 dominating, irrespective
of initial conditions,

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.440
or coexistence or bi-stability.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.940
So bi-stability is
the only-- so if you

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.220
start with a finite number
of each of these two species,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.090
then bi-stability is the only
case where the outcome depends

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:30.490
on the starting condition.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.400
So, of course, if you start out
without one of the two species,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.640
then you won't get creation
of those species, right?

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.060
Because the only way to
get creation of species 1

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.650
is to have some species 1
individual in this model.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.080
So we're going to get another
line, here, corresponding to N2

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.740
dot equal to 0.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.790
And I think that the one that
we were trying to analyze

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.120
was with the solid
line underneath.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.390
Is that consistent
with people's notes?

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.195
So we can draw some
other line here.

00:07:03.195 --> 00:07:06.580
It doesn't have
to the same slope.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.419
Now it's good to be
clear about where

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:09.710
these things are going to fall.

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.190
So K2 is this point.

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:16.450
And now K2 divided by
beta 21 is over here.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.730
Now recall that beta
12 is telling us

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.640
about how much
species 2 is reducing

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.570
the growth of species 1.

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:28.217
Whereas beta 21 is
how much species

00:07:28.217 --> 00:07:29.800
1 is reducing the
growth of species 2.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.240
Now, everything comes down
to the relative ordering

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.724
of these two quantities
and these two quantities.

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.640
And since there are two
possibilities on each,

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.348
that gives us the four
possible outcomes.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.290
And broadly, the idea
here is just that,

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.130
if the species are weakly
interfering with each other,

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.130
then what should happen?

00:07:57.449 --> 00:07:58.990
Yes, then you should
get coexistence.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:04.860
Coexistence is when
the betas are small.

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.846
Of course, this is
a concrete model,

00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:08.720
so you have to define
what you mean by small.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.450
And indeed, small
here ends up being

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.740
relative to the ratios of
these carrying capacities.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.710
If the carrying capacities
are just equal to, say, 1,

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:24.670
then that's saying
that the betas-- sorry,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.595
if the carrying capacities are
the same, then the simple way

00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:29.470
to think about this is
just whether the betas

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:34.390
are larger or smaller than 1,
whether each species interferes

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:37.940
with the other species more than
a member of that other species.

00:08:40.346 --> 00:08:41.970
So if carrying
capacities are the same,

00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:46.600
that's what demarcates
the different zones.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.440
So what we want to do is
take this sort of diagram

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.120
and try to figure out where
will the trajectories be

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.970
on this diagram?

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:59.440
Now, it's always good to
locate the fixed points.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.150
The fixed points
of the system are?

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:05.250
And somebody, words?

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.190
How would we define fixed
points in this system?

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:09.662
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:10.620
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.786
Both lines intersect, right?

00:09:11.786 --> 00:09:14.150
So when the dashed line
intersects the solid lines,

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.950
right?

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.380
So we have one such
fixed point here.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:23.666
We have another fixed point here
and another fixed point here.

00:09:27.046 --> 00:09:28.420
Have we figured
out the stability

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:30.460
of those fixed points?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:30.960
No.

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:36.705
What's the stability
of this fixed point?

00:09:42.175 --> 00:09:43.050
It's unstable, right?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:45.760
Because we've
already, previously

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.784
assumed that these r's
are greater than 0.

00:09:49.784 --> 00:09:51.450
We're assuming that
the species would be

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.590
able to survive on their own.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.520
And that's actually
true for both species.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:01.000
So this thing is unstable kind
of in both directions, right?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.770
And what are the
eigenvectors associated

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:03.686
with this fixed point?

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.910
On the count of three,
draw, use your arms

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:14.400
like the hands of a clock
to indicate the directions

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:16.210
of the eigenvectors.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:21.180
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.714
All right, all right.

00:10:23.714 --> 00:10:24.880
There's no diagonals, right?

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.780
Of course, you could also.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.450
I was waiting for somebody to
be kind of obnoxious and point

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.900
in the other direction.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.086
A surprisingly not
obnoxious class we have.

00:10:37.086 --> 00:10:38.960
So this is just saying
that, if you start out

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.290
just a little bit
of one species,

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.748
you'll just stay
with that species.

00:10:41.748 --> 00:10:43.490
It makes sense.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.330
Now, what do these lines
tell us about the directions

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:53.827
of the trajectories
or the orientations

00:10:53.827 --> 00:10:54.660
of the trajectories?

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.990
Why did I draw them?

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:09.000
Yes?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.175
AUDIENCE: These
trajectories are--

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:18.055
these are lines are nonlines.

00:11:18.055 --> 00:11:20.440
And one of the
derivatives [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:24.370
PROFESSOR: One of the
derivatives, all right.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:30.810
And in particular, let's
look at this line here.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.310
Are the trajectories?

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.000
Again, we're going
to do our arms

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.410
to indicate the orientation
of the trajectories.

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:42.790
In particular, there's
a trajectory right here.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:45.900
What direction will that
trajectory be pointing?

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.460
There's only going
to be one arm.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.670
Ready, three, two, one.

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.990
All right, we got a lot
of people not voting.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.560
All right, that means we need to
turn our neighbors and discuss.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.710
If you didn't vote,
it means, I think,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.002
not following what
we're talking about.

00:12:04.002 --> 00:12:04.710
Turn to somebody.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.849
If your neighbor agrees with
you about which direction

00:12:10.849 --> 00:12:12.390
you should be pointing
your arm, then

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.680
try to figure out
whether we know

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:19.301
which orientation the arrow
should actually be in.

00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:22.460
[SIDE DISCUSSIONS]

00:12:47.515 --> 00:12:48.890
PROFESSOR: We'll
figure this out.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.292
[SIDE DISCUSSIONS]

00:13:02.684 --> 00:13:04.350
PROFESSOR: Let's go
ahead and reconvene,

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.580
because it seems like some
people are being quiet.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:09.540
But I'm not sure if
that's because they think

00:13:09.540 --> 00:13:12.600
they know what's going on or
they're just very much unhappy

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.440
with the situation.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.460
Let me see a fresh voting.

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.775
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

00:13:21.312 --> 00:13:23.020
Definitely, it's going
up or down, right?

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:26.870
Because the definition of this
dashed line is that N1 dot

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.680
is equal to 0.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.544
We don't know what N2 dot is.

00:13:30.544 --> 00:13:31.960
We'll figure that
out in a moment.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.100
But what we know is
that the trajectories

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:38.180
we should be something, lines
here, either up or down.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.320
And we're going to find
that they're down but here.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.369
Now, on this solid line,
quickly, the orientation of

00:13:47.369 --> 00:13:47.910
trajectories.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.900
Ready, three, two, one.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.930
All right, perfect.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:55.870
So we know that
N2 dot is 0 here.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.150
Now, an actual direction of
the trajectory, at this point,

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:03.230
right here.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:06.050
Ready, three, two, one.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.370
OK, good.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:10.776
Because in the
absence of N2, we know

00:14:10.776 --> 00:14:13.150
that species N1 should just
come to carrying capacity K1.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:20.760
Same thing over here, we
should get arrows coming down.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.500
So indeed, what you can see is
that the arrows are coming down

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:23.650
here.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:26.024
That means they actually do
have to come down immediately

00:14:26.024 --> 00:14:27.825
to the right of them.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:29.200
Whereas over here,
the trajectory

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.310
is point right here, so
we can kind of figure out

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:37.780
that-- so they're coming here.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:39.780
And from far away,
they're coming here.

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:42.630
And you can see that they
have to come across here.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.740
And then they're going
to come into this point.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.010
So this is going to be
our stable fixed point.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:51.371
I'll color it in
to indicate that.

00:14:51.371 --> 00:14:53.370
From here, they're going
to curve around though.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.085
So if you start out right here,
you kind of do this business.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.810
From here, we come in.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.990
Are these lines allowed
to cross each other?

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.490
No.

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:25.330
Now, indeed, you
could actually see

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.960
here, what is the direction
of the other eigenvector

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.180
at this point?

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:37.640
Using a hand, arm,
ready, three, two, one.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.299
Right, it's kind of
something in there.

00:15:39.299 --> 00:15:41.590
Because there's all these
trajectories are coming here,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:44.420
and then they approach this
fixed point from this point.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:46.360
Because here, the
other eigenvector

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.110
is still horizontal, right?

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.180
Because we know, if we don't
have N2, then we just have N1.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:55.662
But this other eigenvector
is not purely straight up.

00:15:55.662 --> 00:15:57.870
The other one is along here,
because the trajectories

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:01.310
are coming in along that.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.010
Does that make sense?

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:06.900
So in this case, we
should just be clear.

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:12.050
We are in a situation
where K1 over beta 12

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:13.460
is greater than K2.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:20.580
Another way of writing that is
that beta 12 is less than K1

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.770
over K2.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:29.930
So that means species 2 does
not strongly harm species 1.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:36.930
Yet, we know that K1 is greater
than K2 divided by beta 21.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:42.120
So that means that beta 21
is greater than K2 over K1.

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:46.250
This is telling us that
species 1 is strongly

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:48.625
harming species 2.

00:16:48.625 --> 00:16:49.520
And that makes sense.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:51.420
In that case, species 1 wins.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:01.430
Does that outcome change
if we change the r values,

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.520
the division rates?

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:08.960
A is yes.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.950
B is no.

00:17:09.950 --> 00:17:12.390
I'm going to give
you 10 seconds.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:15.219
What I just said, if
I change r's does that

00:17:15.219 --> 00:17:16.010
change the outcome?

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.575
Ready, three, two, one.

00:17:22.165 --> 00:17:25.710
So we've got a majority
of B. So the answer is no.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:37.506
This statement that, in this
situation, species 1 dominates,

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:38.755
that's independent of the r's.

00:17:44.112 --> 00:17:45.570
And what you see
is the conditions,

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:48.350
here, only depend on
the what's in here.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.390
So the actual shape of those
trajectories will depend upon

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:51.920
the r's.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.420
So if it's the case
that species 2 is just

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.921
a faster grower than
species 1, then you

00:18:00.921 --> 00:18:02.420
might end up with
a situation where,

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:04.045
if you start with a
little bit of each,

00:18:04.045 --> 00:18:05.940
you might come way
up here-- well, no.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.196
I guess you might come
close to this fixed point.

00:18:10.196 --> 00:18:11.820
So you might think
that it really looks

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.390
like species 2 is about to win.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.500
But eventually, they'll
curve over and come back.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:20.930
And indeed, in the Strogatz
book, one of the chapters

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:24.770
that I recommended, he has an
example of sheeps and rabbits,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.560
the idea is that they
are competing species,

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.884
maybe eating similar foods.

00:18:28.884 --> 00:18:30.050
I don't know if that's true.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:32.410
But the rabbits can
divide more rapidly.

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:36.750
So here, the idea would be,
well, if the sheep can really

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:38.930
displace the rabbits,
because it's just bigger

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.650
and push them aside,
then what can happen

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:42.892
is that the rabbits
first divide rapidly.

00:18:42.892 --> 00:18:44.600
It looks like they're
going to take over,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.379
but, over time, eventually,
the sheep population kind of

00:18:48.379 --> 00:18:50.170
grow up, and they start
displacing rabbits.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:52.770
And you end up
excluding the rabbits.

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:55.130
This is this phenomenon
of competitive exclusion.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:06.570
And depending upon the
context-- OK, that's an e--

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.790
this is either more or less
maybe formally phrased.

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:14.210
But the idea is that, if
there are two species that

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.026
are too similar,
and in particular,

00:19:16.026 --> 00:19:17.650
if they're somehow
perfect competitors,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:19.060
they're really just trying
to eat the same thing,

00:19:19.060 --> 00:19:20.850
then you should
only end up with one

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.370
of the two species surviving.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.220
And that's the
kind of idea here.

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:29.840
Although, I think, you can
argue about the mapping I think.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.205
So this is one of
the four outcomes.

00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.979
And of course, it
takes 15 minutes

00:19:36.979 --> 00:19:38.520
to go through each
of these examples.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.430
So we're not going to
go through all of them.

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:45.280
But you should be
able to, for a given

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.600
a combination of betas and
K's, be able to figure out,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.410
using some combination
of algebra, derivatives,

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:57.185
fixed point stability analyses,
and drawing of things, well,

00:19:57.185 --> 00:19:58.935
you should be able to
do all of the above.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:05.805
Are there any questions
about where we are here?

00:20:13.512 --> 00:20:14.970
AUDIENCE: I guess
that none of this

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.571
holds in the
stochastic [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:20.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's
an interesting question.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:23.762
AUDIENCE: For example, in that
case, if r2 is much bigger,

00:20:23.762 --> 00:20:28.063
then you're going get almost,
very close to like K2,

00:20:28.063 --> 00:20:31.615
and then maybe just the
last individual [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:31.615 --> 00:20:34.530
and then you just
add that fixed point.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.520
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.660
So it's certainly the
case that, once you

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.690
have stochastic
extinction-- the thing is

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:43.839
that, you would probably
be most susceptible

00:20:43.839 --> 00:20:44.880
to stochastic extinction.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.300
In the case you
were talking about,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.920
you would be most susceptible
to stochastic extinction

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.760
when you're around
here, actually.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:58.800
These trajectories are still
always moving up in N1 space.

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.700
I think I know
what you're saying.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:06.300
We're going to maybe
zoom in onto this N1, N2.

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:08.780
Because we have this
unstable fixed point here.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.190
And the claim was that, if
you start out over here,

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.500
then the trajectory might
look something like this.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.500
And you'd say, oh, well,
you might go extinct here.

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.850
AUDIENCE: The idea
was just the statement

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:25.620
that [INAUDIBLE] r1, r2 are
very dynamical [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.150
PROFESSOR: It's true that,
I guess, things change.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.320
There are a number of things
you might want to say.

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:43.540
First of all, this is a purely
continuous and deterministic

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.090
description of the setting.

00:21:46.090 --> 00:21:49.670
It allows for
fractional individuals.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.440
There's no shocks
or perturbations

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.016
that you have to worry about.

00:21:54.016 --> 00:21:55.640
I guess the only
thing I wanted to say,

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.790
in regards to your
question, is that I

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.739
think the stochastic extinction
will not be dominated.

00:22:01.739 --> 00:22:04.030
We're talking about stochastic
extinction of species 1.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.529
It will not be dominated due
to a stochastic extinction here

00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:10.820
but stochastic extinction
at the beginning.

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.920
I haven't drawn this very,
very well, but, in this case,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:15.580
I think these
trajectories are always

00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:20.900
are going up in numbers
of the 1 species, which

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:22.910
means that you're most
likely to experience

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.048
stochastic extinction
at the beginning.

00:22:25.048 --> 00:22:25.548
Yeah?

00:22:25.548 --> 00:22:28.008
AUDIENCE: r1 and r2
should still really

00:22:28.008 --> 00:22:30.468
mess with stochastic
extinction a lot, right?

00:22:30.468 --> 00:22:35.830
Because the larger r1
and r2 are the quicker

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:39.670
we get out of the regime
of stochastic extinction.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.140
PROFESSOR: That's all true.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:49.420
We have to be careful
about many of these things.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.350
In particular, if you go and
you do a stochastic simulation

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.420
of this, so let's say you plug
this thing into a Gillespie

00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.430
simulation, can you get
stochastic extinction?

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.900
A yes, or B no, ready,
three, two, one.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.020
No.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.748
So the answer is no but why?

00:23:11.748 --> 00:23:12.666
AUDIENCE: It depends.

00:23:12.666 --> 00:23:16.810
If you take r
combination [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:17.790
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.555
So right now, as written,
there's no death.

00:23:22.577 --> 00:23:24.660
Although, I guess you could
say that this a death.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:31.420
There's a question of
how you partition things.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.850
So in principle, this is the
difference between the growth

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:36.450
and the death rate.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.640
But the most straightforward
way of doing such a simulation

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.220
is that you put this whole thing
in here as a rate for birth.

00:23:47.732 --> 00:23:50.065
Somebody is going to say, ah,
that's not how I was going

00:23:50.065 --> 00:23:51.267
to do the simulation, right?

00:23:51.267 --> 00:23:53.350
Well, that's probably how
you were going to do it.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.850
AUDIENCE: That's a terrible way.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.670
PROFESSOR: But if you did
that, if there's only birth,

00:23:56.670 --> 00:23:59.020
then you can't get stochastic
extinction, obviously.

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:01.829
But in general-- and
this is one of things

00:24:01.829 --> 00:24:03.370
we spend our time
a lot time thinking

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.040
about in this semester--
there are multiple ways

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.410
of doing kind of a
stochastic simulation

00:24:09.410 --> 00:24:11.420
from a deterministic equation.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.966
And this thing, you
could be more explicit

00:24:13.966 --> 00:24:15.340
and say, oh, this
thing is really

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.625
a B2 minus a D2, so a birth rate
minus a death rate for example.

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:21.750
And form the standpoint of
a differential equation,

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:23.280
it doesn't make any difference.

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.160
But if you do the
Fokker-Planck approximation

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.520
or you do a
simulation or whatnot,

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.720
then these lead to
different things.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.970
In particular, the rate of,
say, stochastic extinction

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.650
here increases as B and D
increase, because that leads

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.095
to more of these fluctuations.

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:48.911
So there are many things that
are different once you include

00:24:48.911 --> 00:24:49.910
the stochastic dynamics.

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:54.450
But it's always good to get
a base sense of the dynamics

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:57.910
from the standpoint of just
deterministic differential

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.860
equations before you think
too much about the stochastic

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.304
dynamics, because otherwise
you get overwhelmed quickly.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.370
Any other questions about that?

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.880
What I want to do is just
spend a little bit of time

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.890
to think about the more
generalized case of more

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:31.390
species.

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.970
And in particular, we could
convert this set of equations.

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.600
We can normalize by each of
their carrying capacities.

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:54.394
And we can convert
a set of equations

00:25:54.394 --> 00:25:55.560
to look something like this.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.760
So now we just have Xi
dot is equal to-- there's

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:03.850
some ri Xi, 1 minus.

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.270
And what we can actually
do is normalize everything

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:07.950
so that it's just
written like this.

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.020
And normally, what we
assume is that we've

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:21.990
done things such that alpha
i i is equal to 1 for all i.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.760
So this is just saying that
this is the normalization such

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.450
that each species
inhibits itself in a way

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:33.060
that it's just give a
simple logistic growth.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:39.545
And it's going to be logistic
growth with a carrying

00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:41.980
capacity equal to 1.

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.130
And then once you've
done that, then a species

00:26:45.130 --> 00:26:48.720
inhibits itself
with alpha i i 1.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.210
And then everything comes down
to what this alpha matrix is.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:02.380
And I would say that, as
always, it's really very, very

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.180
important that you
can go back and forth

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:07.920
between the non-dimensionalized
versions of equations

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.420
and the base version.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.280
This was something that,
on exam number two,

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:21.720
there were quite a lot of
problems where we asked about,

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.260
how does the
parameter change when

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.760
you change the strength of
expression or this or that,

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.620
right?

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.880
So this is something that
I think is very important.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.380
Because this comes up a lot.

00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:35.020
So in this case,
the alpha matrix

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.330
tells you kind of everything.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.270
And then there are
a number of things

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.450
that, well, the
mathematicians have proven

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:42.742
about these sorts of equations.

00:27:42.742 --> 00:27:45.116
And I just want to point you
towards some of those things

00:27:45.116 --> 00:27:45.960
to think about.

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:52.590
So first, I'm considering a
case where, again, alpha i

00:27:52.590 --> 00:28:01.290
j is greater than 0,
again, for all i and ji,

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:03.810
or greater than or equal to 0.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:10.240
So some of them can be 0.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.055
But the interactions, when
they exist, are competitive.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:23.040
So first, if you start
out in the region where

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.850
all of the species start,
between 0 and 1, then

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:28.150
you stay in that region.

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:36.100
If this is true initially,
then it will be true forever.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:41.550
That's good.

00:28:41.550 --> 00:28:45.560
Negative abundances, you maybe
were not so worried about.

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.050
But it's not as obvious that
you can't get above one,

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:51.440
because there's nothing
saying that, in principle, you

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:53.090
couldn't have
started there, right?

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:56.939
Or in principle, you
couldn't have gotten there?

00:28:56.939 --> 00:28:58.480
And certainly, it's
physical to think

00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.063
about starting outside
of that region,

00:29:00.063 --> 00:29:02.170
because we often talk
about carrying capacities

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.211
as something that's like.

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:10.146
If you think about, this is
an Xi as a function of time.

00:29:13.096 --> 00:29:15.720
So in these situations, it's not
crazy to think about something

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.017
above the carrying capacity.

00:29:18.017 --> 00:29:20.350
But this mathematical statement
about the Latka-Volterra

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.650
framework is that,
if you start out

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.500
with everything below
its carrying capacity,

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:25.500
then everything will
always stay there.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:42.060
And all the dynamics occur--
this is for i equal to 1 to N

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.710
Do I want to use a
big N or little n?

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:44.420
Does it matter?

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.750
So this is big N,
different species.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.650
The dynamics occur on
an N minus one manifold.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.150
If we have many
mathematicians, they

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.270
can explain what this
technically means.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:03.760
But basically,
what it's saying is

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.945
that there's going to be some
N minus 1 dimensional surface

00:30:06.945 --> 00:30:09.660
or volume or whatnot
where all the dynamics are

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.980
going end up being on.

00:30:10.980 --> 00:30:15.920
And what that means is that,
in particular, a limit cycle

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:28.440
requires two
dimensions, requires

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.510
2D, which means that
to get a limit cycle

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:36.990
requires-- so then N has to
be greater than or equal to 3

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.320
to get a limit cycle.

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.500
Can you see what I'm saying?

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:47.897
Whereas chaos
requires 3D, and that

00:30:47.897 --> 00:30:49.980
means that N has to be
greater than or equal to 4.

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:56.941
And indeed, you can get limit
cycles with N equal to 3.

00:30:56.941 --> 00:30:58.440
And you get chaos
with N equal to 4.

00:31:01.796 --> 00:31:03.170
There's another
theorem that says

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:10.360
that any dynamics are possible
for N equal to 5 or larger.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.550
And chaos seems as much as
I would want to ask for.

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:20.620
But there's,
apparently, a 4D torus,

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.764
something that is different.

00:31:22.764 --> 00:31:24.930
This is something to think
about in your spare time.

00:31:33.010 --> 00:31:35.900
Well, you know, like
a lot of things.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:41.440
And this is worth spending
a moment talking about.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:44.550
First of all, so here's
a two dimensional thing.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.550
The special thing, as
you might remember,

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:50.950
about continuous dynamics is
that these trajectories are not

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:53.670
allowed to cross
each other, right?

00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:58.990
Which means that you just can't
draw a chaotic trajectory,

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.210
because you're going to have
to cross yourself again.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.550
And that's also why a
limit cycle requires two,

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:10.070
because we originally tried
to draw a limit cycle in one

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:11.400
dimension, and it didn't work.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.080
Do you remember this?

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.360
And the same thing with--
you can imagine, here's

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.959
a nice limit cycle.

00:32:17.959 --> 00:32:19.000
And that could be stable.

00:32:21.730 --> 00:32:24.770
Oh, and incidentally,
you were right about.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:28.440
I was getting confused about
the Poincare-Bendixson theorem.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.390
Because I think there
are these funny things.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.280
It wasn't.

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.065
OK, well, you know,
all these people

00:32:34.065 --> 00:32:36.890
that complain about what I say.

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:40.499
Because if you have the
trajectories coming in,

00:32:40.499 --> 00:32:43.040
then what I said was that, if
you had an unstable fixed point

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:44.950
coming out, then you
could draw this region,

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.575
then you could be
guaranteed that there

00:32:46.575 --> 00:32:47.930
was a limit cycle in there.

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:52.887
But you cannot, just based
on what I had said, say that,

00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:55.220
if it's a stable fixed point,
then you won't get a limit

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.140
cycle.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.820
I mean in some other cases you
can prove that it doesn't work.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:04.570
Particularly, like in
the Latka-Volterra,

00:33:04.570 --> 00:33:08.439
there in one of
the crossings, it's

00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:09.980
now going to be a
stable fixed point.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.800
In that situation, you
can prove, mathematically,

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.420
that you can never get a
limit cycle oscillation

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.670
because of some divergence
condition of some function

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:18.311
and so forth.

00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:20.310
But in the example that
I was telling you about,

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.870
in the predator-prey, it was
true in that particular case

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:26.569
that, when that thing is stable,
you don't get oscillations.

00:33:26.569 --> 00:33:27.860
And when it's unstable, you do.

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.734
But both directions
do not follow

00:33:29.734 --> 00:33:30.900
from the Poincare-Bendixson.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.540
This is a limit cycle.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.020
Now, in a chaotic situation, you
have to be able to do something

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.440
where you kind of
come around and then,

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.190
every now and then,
you kind go over here.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.410
And then you go
around and around.

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.970
Something crazy happens.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:53.720
But you can see that
this situation doesn't

00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:57.450
work if it's only 2D, right?

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:59.430
Do you see why I'm saying that?

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:01.380
PROFESSOR: You don't?

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:03.040
You don't agree.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.436
It's just, if it's 2D, then
these lines cannot cross.

00:34:05.436 --> 00:34:06.810
So you need to a
third dimension,

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:09.730
so that they can just shoot
above and below each other.

00:34:09.730 --> 00:34:11.505
AUDIENCE: And what's
with the definition?

00:34:11.505 --> 00:34:13.790
Because you can come
up with trajectories,

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:16.639
like you can have trajectories
that asymptotically approach

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:21.112
the limit cycle but that
never cross themselves, right?

00:34:21.112 --> 00:34:21.778
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:34:21.778 --> 00:34:23.920
AUDIENCE: Those are obviously
not chaotic, but the y--

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.628
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:34:26.989 --> 00:34:29.310
So this is not actually
class in non-linear dynamics,

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.139
so we're not.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:33.510
So normally, you characterize
this Lyapunov exponent,

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:35.642
which tells you about
how the phase space is

00:34:35.642 --> 00:34:36.850
kind of growing or shrinking.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:38.725
In the case that you
were just talking about,

00:34:38.725 --> 00:34:41.150
that's a case where all the
trajectories come together.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:43.774
Because in this case where this
trajectory comes into the limit

00:34:43.774 --> 00:34:46.920
cycle, if you draw like
a blob of phase space,

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.020
it's going to come
together over time.

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:52.480
Whereas in a chaotic system, if
you have a blob of phase space,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.409
it's going to diverge and
fold and do all the craziness.

00:35:00.289 --> 00:35:01.992
Yes?

00:35:01.992 --> 00:35:03.867
AUDIENCE: So you said
[INAUDIBLE] essentially

00:35:03.867 --> 00:35:06.145
you need n greater
than or equal to 3.

00:35:06.145 --> 00:35:08.100
Is that just for this--

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:10.021
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:10.021 --> 00:35:10.520
Yes.

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.920
So this is in this
Latka-Volterra.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.700
Because, in general, you
can get a limit cycle

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:19.040
with two equations.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.150
And that's with the 2D.

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.270
And in general, you get a
chaos with three equations

00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:24.890
or three variables.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:29.870
But in the Latka-Volterra model,
it requires three and four,

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:30.990
respectively.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:34.139
That doesn't mean that
every four species

00:35:34.139 --> 00:35:35.430
Latka-Volterra will have chaos.

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.221
But it means that it's
possible to get one.

00:35:39.059 --> 00:35:41.100
And I think one thing
that's just rather striking

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:45.830
is that this really is kind of
the simplest, possible model

00:35:45.830 --> 00:35:49.870
you can ever write
down describing

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.587
how species might
interact or variables

00:35:52.587 --> 00:35:53.670
might interact or whatnot.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:55.630
And so it's really kind
of incredible to me

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:57.800
that you get all
these crazy dynamics.

00:36:00.205 --> 00:36:00.705
Yes?

00:36:00.705 --> 00:36:03.200
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask
about the n minus 1 thing.

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.415
This dynamic [INAUDIBLE]
n minus 1 [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:06.415 --> 00:36:07.081
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:07.081 --> 00:36:08.705
AUDIENCE: Over here
it just looks to me

00:36:08.705 --> 00:36:11.464
like-- we have n equals
2 and the dynamics

00:36:11.464 --> 00:36:17.004
are occuring on a plane,
on a two-dimensional plane.

00:36:17.004 --> 00:36:17.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.860
The transience or
whatever can occur.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.050
It requires the full N
dimensions to describe.

00:36:28.050 --> 00:36:30.890
Because you can
start-- to describe

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:35.120
all of the trajectories, clearly
requires all dimensions, right?

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:36.670
Because anywhere
you start, you have

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:39.550
to have specify it
by five dimensions.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:43.870
But the dynamics, as
far as like-- and here,

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.300
there aren't even any dynamics.

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.290
I think that you go to a point.

00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:53.565
AUDIENCE: What do
you mean by dynamics?

00:36:53.565 --> 00:36:55.680
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.480
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
I agree that there

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.850
is a-- so in the case
of the limit cycles

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:07.410
and so forth, this is really
like, at steady state,

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.830
it's doing something.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.640
So here, steady state, it
only goes to the fixed points.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:15.430
But if you have a three
dimensional system,

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:19.890
then you can have it steady
state, the trajectories

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:21.070
on like a plane.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:31.120
Yeah?

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.347
AUDIENCE: Is it because
there's like some concept

00:37:33.347 --> 00:37:39.550
of [INAUDIBLE] that can be
[INAUDIBLE] for the system?

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:43.100
PROFESSOR: I don't think
that that-- I'm not

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.800
aware of that being the case.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.605
But I'm hesitant to
say that it's not true.

00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:58.160
I want to switch
gears a little bit

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.389
and think about three
species interactions

00:38:01.389 --> 00:38:03.430
and, in particular the
three species interactions

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.460
when they're non-transitive.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.120
Because this is thought
to be potentially

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.355
a significant stabilizer for
diversity in populations.

00:38:28.388 --> 00:38:36.240
So this is non-transitive
interactions.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.990
And we often just say
rock-paper-scissors.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.130
Is everybody from a cultural
that plays rock-paper-scissors?

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:52.956
Yes?

00:38:52.956 --> 00:38:53.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.580
PROFESSOR: So this is a
true, human universal.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:00.015
Although I think that what we
call it does vary and so forth.

00:39:00.015 --> 00:39:02.180
You know how sometimes
the linguists

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:06.310
try to find this ur-language
that our ancestors spoke

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.590
50,000 years ago or whatever?

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.250
I think that you
probably do something

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:10.625
similar with
rock-paper-scissors,

00:39:10.625 --> 00:39:14.300
because it seems to be
a pretty common theme.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.710
But the idea here is
that you have-- wait,

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.810
which direction does it go?

00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:23.610
So paper beats rock,
scissors beats paper,

00:39:23.610 --> 00:39:25.574
but rock beats the scissors.

00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:33.570
So you can imagine that
this kind of dynamic

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:38.000
can be captured in the
Latka-Volterra type framework.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.480
So you just have to set
up these betas or alphas

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:43.900
so that this is true.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.500
And again, the way
to think about this

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.280
would be-- the simplest thing is
to think about it as dominance.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.250
So if you have the rock
species and the scissor species

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:56.050
together, then the rock species
will drive the scissor species

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.900
extinct and so forth.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.080
Now, this is the
kind of situation

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:04.600
that, in principle, can lead
to very complicated dynamics

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.240
in multi-species ecosystems
that, at least in many models,

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.720
can stabilize the coexistence
of multiple species via some

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.930
of these complex, crazy
dynamics that we were just

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:17.690
talking about.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:20.210
I would say that, as a
mechanism for the stabilization

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.630
of diversity, I don't
know how convincing

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.240
that is in terms of being what
explains why it is there's

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:30.970
so much diversity outside, when
you look outside the window.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.970
But, at least, it's
in principle true.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:37.966
And one of the topics
of these papers--

00:40:37.966 --> 00:40:39.340
certainly the one
you just read--

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:41.880
is that
rock-paper-scissors, i.e.

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.220
non-transitive
interactions on their own,

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:46.082
may not be sufficient,
but, in the presence

00:40:46.082 --> 00:40:47.540
of spatial structure,
maybe it does

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:52.750
allow for long-term coexistence
of these species or strategies

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:53.430
and so forth.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:56.680
And again, it's not always
clear in these situations

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:58.560
whether you're
thinking about ecology,

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.976
where these are
different species,

00:40:59.976 --> 00:41:01.720
or you're thinking
about evolution, where

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.570
these are different genotypes.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:06.090
And indeed, in the Kerr
paper that you read,

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.407
these are all E. coli.

00:41:07.407 --> 00:41:09.240
So it's all one species,
it's just that they

00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.270
have different mutations.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:13.360
So that's really
rock-paper-scissors

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.630
in the context of evolution.

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.560
Whereas in the male
mating strategies

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:24.120
paper by Curt Lively, that's
more of an ecological context,

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:26.540
but it still is evolution
within the species.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.910
Because these mating
strategies are heritable.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:41.850
I did tell you the base idea
of this lizard mating strategy

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:42.386
business?

00:41:42.386 --> 00:41:44.010
Or did I never say
anything about that?

00:41:44.010 --> 00:41:44.850
Not really?

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:45.690
OK.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:47.900
For some reason, I thought
that I'd alluded to it.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.960
Well, let me explain it to you.

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:54.800
I think it's kind of
an incredible paper.

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.990
So this is a paper
by my Curt Lively.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:59.010
So it's Sinervo and Lively.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:05.220
It was Nature in '96.

00:42:11.970 --> 00:42:14.010
And it's called "The
Rock-Paper-Scissors

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.450
Game and the Evolution of
Alternative Male Strategies."

00:42:16.450 --> 00:42:19.550
So what was known
is that there are

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:24.660
many examples of alternative
mating strategies in males.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.810
In particular, it's rather
common that there are,

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:34.310
what you might call,
territorial males

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.620
and what they often
call sneaker males.

00:42:41.930 --> 00:42:45.180
This is observed in fish
and various land animals.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:47.960
And in many of the cases,
these sneaker males

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.655
really do look
phenotypically like females.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.750
And this has been measured
using various kinds

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.980
of observational,
experimental approaches.

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:10.900
There's often what you
call negative frequency

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:14.150
dependent selection
between these strategies.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.340
The sneakers can
often, when rare,

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.050
spread in population of the
territorial and vice versa.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.350
But this was, at the
least the first case

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:31.230
I'm aware of where these
ideas had been demonstrated,

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:32.920
that there were really
three strategies.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.880
And the three
strategies implemented,

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:38.620
one of these rock-paper-scissors
interactions.

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:40.987
I want to maybe make
a little more space.

00:43:40.987 --> 00:43:42.570
If you guys are
available after class,

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:45.267
I encourage you to come
up and look at the paper,

00:43:45.267 --> 00:43:47.100
because they actually
have pictures of them,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:51.250
so you can identify
the sneaker males.

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:55.420
Because they actually
look different

00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.470
based on the coloring
of their throat.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:03.910
So these are lizards that live
in the mountains up outside

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.310
of the Bay Area in
California, in Merced County.

00:44:06.310 --> 00:44:08.790
They're side-blotched lizards.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.470
I don't know
anything about that.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:15.190
And what they showed
was that there's

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:23.920
these guys with orange throats
that are kind of aggressive.

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.820
And they defend a
very large territory

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.190
with a large number of females.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:34.250
And they fight off
any males that come.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:40.250
Then there are the dark blue.

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:44.960
Sorry, I should have
put that over here.

00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:51.450
So there are other lizards here
that are dark blue throats.

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:54.700
And these guys are less
aggressive with smaller

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.200
territories.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:04.260
So you can guess, if it were
just the orange-throated guys

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:07.280
and the dark-- and these are
genetically encoded strategies,

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.870
in the sense that they
do seem to be passed on,

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:14.930
and it's determined by the genes
that the male inherits-- less

00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:18.740
aggressive and small territory.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.979
Can you guess which one
wins between these two,

00:45:20.979 --> 00:45:21.770
against each other?

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:25.910
What's that?

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.540
AUDIENCE: The two
aggressive ones

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.123
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but if you just
have the two aggressive ones?

00:45:30.123 --> 00:45:30.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.320
PROFESSOR: This guy's going
to beat this one, right?

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.760
That's just because this
aggressive male has a larger

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:40.400
territory, and they
pass on more genes

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.324
than the less aggressive ones.

00:45:42.324 --> 00:45:44.990
However, what they found is that
there's a third mating strategy

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:47.920
here, which are
these sneaker males.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.640
And they indeed look
like the females.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.210
They have these yellow
stripes on their throats.

00:45:59.210 --> 00:46:01.740
They look like the female,
and they have no territory.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.330
Sneaker males, so they
don't defend any territory.

00:46:05.330 --> 00:46:08.850
Instead, they just
sneak into the territory

00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:11.040
of the other males
and try to mate

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.540
with the females
in that territory.

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:17.270
And what they show is that,
over the course of seven years,

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:20.304
in the mountains
of Merced, they see

00:46:20.304 --> 00:46:21.720
that the frequency
of these things

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:25.950
goes through an
entire oscillation.

00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:31.280
So they see just over one
period of this oscillation.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:33.560
And their argument is
that, although it's true

00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.090
that the aggressive males can
outcompete the less aggressive

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:39.990
ones, the sneakers
actually outcompete

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.700
these aggressive
ones, basically,

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.527
because these
aggressive males, it's

00:46:45.527 --> 00:46:47.110
just too large of a
territory for them

00:46:47.110 --> 00:46:49.670
to effectively defend it.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.370
So the sneakers can
actually outcompete

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:54.530
the aggressive males.

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:58.120
Yet the less aggressive ones
can outcompete the sneakers,

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:01.980
because they are trying to
defend a smaller territory.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.910
So they basically
measured the frequency

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:08.980
of these strategies and
also the number of females

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:16.670
in the different territories,
from 1990 to '96 or so,

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:20.250
and saw that this thing kind
of went around in some circle

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.780
in this frequency space of
alternative male strategies.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.520
Kind of an incredible paper.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:38.750
So the idea here is this
is a situation where

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.284
it is non-transitive.

00:47:40.284 --> 00:47:41.950
So there's this
rock-paper-scissors type

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:42.600
dynamic.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.877
And it's also spatial,
because these lizards are

00:47:47.877 --> 00:47:49.960
in some particular place,
they have some territory

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.680
and so forth.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.002
And in this other paper,
by Benjamin Kerr, what

00:47:53.002 --> 00:47:54.960
he wanted to do was try
to understand something

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.400
about what the role of
that spatial structure

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:00.010
might be in maintaining
the diversity.

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.742
So in this case, the argument
was that, if you go out

00:48:03.742 --> 00:48:05.450
and you look at these
lizards, the reason

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.199
that you see all three
of these strategies

00:48:07.199 --> 00:48:10.640
is because of this
rock-paper-scissors dynamic.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.510
If one of the strategies
becomes more rare,

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:13.940
it's going to have an advantage
relative to the others.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.299
It's going to spread.

00:48:15.299 --> 00:48:16.965
And what Benjamin
Kerr wanted to explore

00:48:16.965 --> 00:48:22.300
is whether that statement
could be made-- somehow

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.430
you can distinguish between
whether the spatial component

00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:26.760
is important or not.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.416
Of course, it's hard to do that
in the case of the lizards,

00:48:29.416 --> 00:48:30.790
but he was able
to implement this

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:36.780
in the case some chemical
warfare behavior in bacteria.

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:42.080
So in this paper by
Kerr, and it's also

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:53.790
a Nature paper from 2002.

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.150
So this paper is
called "Local Dispersal

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.890
of Promotes Biodiversity
in a Real Life

00:48:57.890 --> 00:49:01.437
Game of Rock-Paper-Scissors."

00:49:01.437 --> 00:49:02.270
So you guys read it.

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:04.025
So what were the
three strategies?

00:49:12.252 --> 00:49:14.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:18.400
PROFESSOR: So C is
the colicin producers.

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:25.430
Incidentally, just
this colicin production

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:29.510
is kind of an incredible
phenomenon already.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:34.280
So these are proteins that
are produced that bind

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.615
to other bacteria and can often
make pores in the membrane

00:49:37.615 --> 00:49:38.840
and kill them.

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.620
But the amazing thing about
the colicin production

00:49:41.620 --> 00:49:45.730
is that in E. coli
and other gram

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:48.790
negative bacteria, the only
way that these colicins are

00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:52.370
released is by cell lysis.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.270
So it's not just that
the cell is engaging

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.210
in some costly behavior in
order to make this protein that

00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.200
will kill other cells.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:01.830
But the only way that
the toxin is released

00:50:01.830 --> 00:50:05.840
is by the cell
actually bursting open.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.420
So it's clear then that
this has to be supported

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:14.950
by some kind of group level or
kin-selection kind of argument.

00:50:14.950 --> 00:50:17.930
This can never be good
for the individual,

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:22.330
because the individual
has had to spill its guts

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.890
in order to harm other cells.

00:50:23.890 --> 00:50:26.420
So the only way that
this can be supported

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.200
is by inhibiting the
growth of competitors

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.480
and allowing your
kind of kin mates

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:36.060
or other cells that also have
this plasmid, and, therefore,

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:40.200
also the immunity protein,
allowing them to grow better.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.350
So this is a very neat
example of an altruistic,

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:46.505
kind of warlike behavior.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.250
So this is one of
the strategies.

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:53.150
What was the other two.

00:50:56.394 --> 00:50:58.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:58.350 --> 00:50:59.236
PROFESSOR: Resistant.

00:50:59.236 --> 00:51:00.610
So there's R,
which is resistant.

00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:09.200
And between the C
and R, who wins?

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:10.080
AUDIENCE: R.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:12.060
PROFESSOR: R, that's right.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.560
There might be some
costs associated

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.860
with being resistant,
but the cost

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.670
is not as large as
actually bursting open.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.190
What's the last one?

00:51:31.307 --> 00:51:32.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sensitive.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.680
PROFESSOR: Sensitive, perfect.

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:36.360
So this is just the
normal bacteria.

00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:43.332
And the argument is
that there's often

00:51:43.332 --> 00:51:45.790
a cost to be resistant, which
means that sensitive bacteria

00:51:45.790 --> 00:51:47.630
will outcompete resistant.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:51.380
Yet, if it's just the sensitive
and the colicinogenic strains,

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:55.305
then this strain can
beat this strain.

00:51:55.305 --> 00:51:57.430
So this is the idea of the
rock-paper-scissors game

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.730
in this system.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.420
They do say that,
in some situations,

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:04.710
the fitnesses are such
that it's like this.

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.750
And it's good to take
these sentences seriously,

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:13.150
because, if they thought that
every time that you isolate

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:16.890
a resistant bacterium,
that it would satisfy this,

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.830
they would have said, when you
do this, this is what you see.

00:52:19.830 --> 00:52:22.700
Their phrasing tells
you that actually,

00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:26.170
depending upon which strain
you get here or there,

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:28.607
you may or may not see this.

00:52:28.607 --> 00:52:29.690
So you have to be careful.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.148
Just because there's a nice
paper that's written about this

00:52:32.148 --> 00:52:34.840
doesn't mean that, if you go out
and you find particular strains

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.360
that have these properties,
that it will always

00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:39.440
yield this particular outcome.

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:49.840
So they argue that these
strains, just because they

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.450
have a non-transitive
interaction,

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:53.010
does not necessarily
mean that they

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:59.660
will be able to coexist in
a well mixed environment

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.130
in particular.

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:06.880
And in their simulations
and the experiments,

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:10.130
where they did experiments
in a test tube,

00:53:10.130 --> 00:53:11.480
which strain died first?

00:53:16.918 --> 00:53:18.240
The sensitive strain.

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.660
Does that make sense?

00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:22.640
Yeah, right?

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:25.580
And the other thing to remember
is that these strains, there's

00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.860
no reason that they should
be accurately described

00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:31.647
by a Latka-Volterra
type formulation.

00:53:31.647 --> 00:53:33.480
And in particular, it
could just be the case

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:35.980
that, if you have
enough producers

00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:37.480
and they make enough
of the colicin,

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.271
then the sensitive
cells are just all dead.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:46.437
And that will, in general,
be hard to capture

00:53:46.437 --> 00:53:47.520
in this sort of framework.

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:55.680
So the idea is that if you
start with a bunch of N's, N

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.220
for each of these
three, then first you

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:01.680
see that the
sensitive cells die.

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:03.730
And once the sensitive
cells have died,

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:06.100
then you're really just
playing an interaction

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.240
between these two.

00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.040
In that case, you get the
colcinogenic strain dying,

00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:16.890
and you're left with just
the resistant strain.

00:54:24.537 --> 00:54:26.120
One thing I want to
caution you about,

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:29.980
though, is that, just
because in this experiment

00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:34.230
they saw that coexistence of
three rock-paper-scissors type

00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:36.720
strains was not possible in
a well mixed environment,

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:39.445
it does not mean that it
will always be the case.

00:54:42.305 --> 00:54:44.180
This is a very well
known paper in the field.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:48.500
And the thing is that it's easy
to forget what a paper shows

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.810
and what it doesn't show.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:53.515
So what this shows is
that there is maybe

00:54:53.515 --> 00:54:54.890
a set of these
three strains that

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.170
have a rock-paper-scissors
type interaction.

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:59.687
And in those particular
three strains,

00:54:59.687 --> 00:55:01.520
that are interacting
in this particular way,

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.500
via colicin killing
da-duh, then they

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.655
don't coexist in this particular
well mixed and maybe other well

00:55:06.655 --> 00:55:07.780
mixed environments as well.

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.524
But this does not
necessarily show

00:55:09.524 --> 00:55:11.190
that any rock-paper-scissors
interaction

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:16.317
in a well mixed environment
will not support coexistence.

00:55:16.317 --> 00:55:18.650
And in particular, you might
remember, in Martin Nowak's

00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:21.879
book, there are very
reasonable equations

00:55:21.879 --> 00:55:24.170
that display rock-paper-scissors
type interactions that

00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:26.395
can lead to coexistence.

00:55:26.395 --> 00:55:28.020
So you can kind of
spiral in that space

00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.360
to a state of coexistence.

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:30.762
So it's possible.

00:55:30.762 --> 00:55:32.470
But in this situation,
it doesn't happen.

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:40.592
Can somebody remind us how
they implemented the spatially

00:55:40.592 --> 00:55:41.550
structured environment?

00:55:46.194 --> 00:55:47.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:47.110 --> 00:55:47.776
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:55:47.776 --> 00:55:49.400
So they used agar plates.

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:53.190
They did this thing where
they took this plate,

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:56.969
and they kind of used a
hexagonal grid of some sort.

00:55:56.969 --> 00:55:58.010
Is it actually hexagonal?

00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:59.194
Yeah.

00:55:59.194 --> 00:56:01.360
I don't know how they decided
on the original order,

00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:06.020
but they said, OK, here
is a sensitive, sensitive,

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:10.222
resistant,
colicinogenic, resistant.

00:56:10.222 --> 00:56:11.180
I don't know, whatever.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:14.630
So they filled it up.

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:18.680
They put maybe 20 different
kind of patches there.

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:21.290
And then they
basically, each day,

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:23.200
they just used one
of these velvets,

00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:26.790
that we often use to
do replica plating.

00:56:26.790 --> 00:56:29.730
And then they just kind of
took off some of the cells

00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:31.230
and put it on a fresh plate.

00:56:31.230 --> 00:56:36.440
And then they did
this for a week or so.

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:39.240
And then they saw that
there was some sense

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:42.990
that there was a
spatial dynamic taking

00:56:42.990 --> 00:56:45.680
place, where the
spatial structure was

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:48.520
kind of reminiscent of this.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.556
The sensitive kind of
moved into the resistant.

00:56:51.556 --> 00:56:54.000
The resistant kind of moved
into the colicinogenic.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.990
Colicinogenic kind of
moved into the sensitive.

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:59.630
But they couldn't
actually see all of those,

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:03.767
because two of the strains, they
said, grew to similar density.

00:57:03.767 --> 00:57:06.100
That was between the sensitive
and the resistant, right?

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.420
So visually, they
can only distinguish

00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:11.710
the colicinogenic strain
relative to the others.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:15.540
But what they found, though,
is that, over a similar amount

00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:19.330
of time, they got
coexistence of all three.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:25.740
So R, C, S, kind
of all-- the number

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.840
is just a function of time--
stuck around in this spatially

00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.670
structured environment.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.230
So their argument is
that, in some cases maybe,

00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:36.490
this non-transitive
interaction is not

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.850
sufficient to maintain
diversity in a population,

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:43.140
whether it's genetic diversity
or species diversity.

00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.490
But it may be that
it's very important

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:48.260
to have this spatial component.

00:57:51.850 --> 00:57:53.520
If you're curious
about these things,

00:57:53.520 --> 00:57:56.510
there's also a nice
computational study

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:05.260
done by Erwin Frey, who studied
these rock-paper-scissors

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:07.190
dynamics as a function
of the mobility

00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:09.290
of the individual agents.

00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:12.964
And in that study,
he found that there

00:58:12.964 --> 00:58:14.630
was sort of a critical
level of mobility

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:24.440
in which you kind of switch
from a spatially structured

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:27.660
environment with coexistence
to, above some mobility,

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:31.410
you end up losing the diversity,
because it kind of goes

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:34.470
into this well mixed regime.

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:36.760
So if you're curious
about these things,

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.904
you can look up Erwin's paper.

00:58:41.766 --> 00:58:47.890
Are there any questions
about what they did here,

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:50.126
what you think it means?

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:50.626
Yeah?

00:58:50.626 --> 00:58:54.070
AUDIENCE: You said you
couldn't use [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:54.070 --> 00:58:56.038
How did they know if
it was [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.115
PROFESSOR: They can just scrape
off everything and plate.

00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.422
AUDIENCE: And then you can tell?

00:59:04.422 --> 00:59:05.130
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:07.060
Because, well, then
you can ask, oh, we're

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:10.370
those guys sensitive
to colicin or not?

00:59:10.370 --> 00:59:12.770
AUDIENCE: Why not actually
just inject them with colicin?

00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:13.436
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:13.436 --> 00:59:16.930
Or plate them on
something with colicin.

00:59:16.930 --> 00:59:20.780
This is a system that has
been very influential,

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:24.100
but it's really
not yet or has not

00:59:24.100 --> 00:59:27.400
been a domesticated kind of
model system in the sense

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:31.460
that they are not nice,
fluorescent proteins.

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.480
This is not on a
nice cloning plasmid.

00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:37.230
It was a natural plasmid.

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:41.390
And this resistant strain,
the way that they get it is,

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:46.060
basically, they take
some sensitive cells,

00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:47.370
and they add colicin.

00:59:47.370 --> 00:59:49.060
Let's say they supernatant
from here, and they ask,

00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:51.075
which cells grow> and then
that's a resistant cell.

00:59:51.075 --> 00:59:52.430
And it's genetically resistant.

00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:55.170
But then each one's
going to different.

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:57.730
They have done sequencing.

00:59:57.730 --> 01:00:00.660
It's a surface receptor that
the colicin maybe uses to go in

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:01.560
or other things.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:05.290
But indeed, we actually
did some experiments

01:00:05.290 --> 01:00:07.570
with some of these strains.

01:00:07.570 --> 01:00:09.675
And it's a little bit messy.

01:00:09.675 --> 01:00:12.710
And I think that there's a
sense that the field maybe

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:17.722
needs to just make some nice
plasmids, with nice colors,

01:00:17.722 --> 01:00:19.430
so that we can really
distinguish things.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:24.020
Because I think that this
system, despite 500 citations

01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:26.410
or so, almost none
of those citations

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:30.250
are experimental papers
really exploring this thing.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:34.640
Because I think that it still
is just a little bit messy.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.820
And I think that it's
also a very pretty system

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:38.908
to explore these ideas.

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:46.876
Yeah?

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:47.792
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:53.367 --> 01:00:55.200
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, why can't you

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.190
distinguish these?

01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:59.450
And they say it's because
they're similar densities.

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:02.790
I don't even know
if that's even.

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:09.650
Of course, well, if you
added sensitive cells here

01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:12.200
and sensitive cells
here and they grew up,

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:15.790
it's likely you're not
going to see a boundary.

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.780
And just more
generally, if you take

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:21.090
similar strains-- and these
are rather similar strains,

01:01:21.090 --> 01:01:23.340
this just has some mutation
relative to this-- then

01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.810
you won't, often, see a boundary
when the colonies kind of grow

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:28.732
up.

01:01:28.732 --> 01:01:31.212
AUDIENCE: So they just
didn't see boundaries.

01:01:31.212 --> 01:01:34.024
It's not like they didn't see--

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.940
PROFESSOR: So they saw
there were cells there,

01:01:35.940 --> 01:01:39.894
but they couldn't necessarily
say that it was true

01:01:39.894 --> 01:01:41.310
that the sensitive
cells were kind

01:01:41.310 --> 01:01:43.615
of spreading into the resistant
cell region, because they

01:01:43.615 --> 01:01:44.698
couldn't see the boundary.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.960
So in the last 20
minutes here, 15, 20,

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.240
I just want to say a few things
about these population waves.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:11.380
For many, many purposes,
there are strong arguments

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.620
to be made that, in the context
of evolution or ecology,

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:16.960
spatial dynamics matter.

01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.030
And the way that we often think
about the spatial dynamics

01:02:20.030 --> 01:02:22.857
is via some effective
diffusive process.

01:02:22.857 --> 01:02:24.440
And that's convenient,
because we know

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.700
a lot about how to model it.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.280
But it's also maybe a
reasonable description

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.340
of the motion of animals and
other living things over length

01:02:32.340 --> 01:02:34.590
scales that are large
compared to the movements

01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:36.700
of the animals.

01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:40.600
So what we do is we take
some equation, such as,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.260
well, we often have, say, dN/dt.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.220
So this is going to be
about population waves.

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:52.570
So we take our standard thing
where we say, oh, here's

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:58.180
r N 1 minus N/K.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.830
And then we just want to
add some spatial dynamic.

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:01.840
So what we're going to
do is we're going to say,

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.506
now, the derivative,
now it's a density.

01:03:03.506 --> 01:03:05.540
So we're going to use a
little n, just for fun.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:14.120
And we might still use
a K just for simple.

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.550
But then we have to add
some diffusive term.

01:03:22.097 --> 01:03:24.430
So there still is going to
be a local carrying capacity.

01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:27.100
Now this is in terms of
density of the organism.

01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:29.850
And we're going to assume that
there is some diffusive type

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.970
motion of the organism.

01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:34.600
Now this is this is, of course,
going over the life-scale

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.750
over which the animals
are actually doing things

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:39.880
over shorter time scales.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.390
So it could be that
different organisms

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:45.040
have very different
modes of motility.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:47.350
In some cases they walk
or swim, in some cases

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:49.860
they just get picked
up by a passing deer.

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:51.940
So there are a
wide range of ways

01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:54.100
in which organisms move around.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.630
But if you look at it over kind
of longer length time scales,

01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:01.890
then maybe it doesn't matter.

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:05.100
And certainly, if it's an
unbiased kind of motion,

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:09.950
with motility
being well-behaved,

01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:14.400
i.e., if the probability
distribution of these steps,

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.512
as long as it's not long-tailed.

01:04:17.512 --> 01:04:19.470
Similarly, Oskar Hallatschek,
over at Berkeley,

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:21.136
has been doing a lot
of fun work looking

01:04:21.136 --> 01:04:23.070
at epidemic spread
in cases where

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:26.110
this kernel, the kind of
step size distribution,

01:04:26.110 --> 01:04:27.710
has long tails.

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:31.510
It leads to qualitatively
different behaviors.

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:34.200
So if you're curious about such
things, check out Oskar's work.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:38.387
But for normal kind of the
step size distributions,

01:04:38.387 --> 01:04:40.470
then the central limit
theorem type considerations

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:42.920
just tell you that you
can maybe just look

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.737
at it like this over time
spatial scales that are bigger.

01:04:47.737 --> 01:04:48.237
Yeah?

01:04:48.237 --> 01:04:51.576
AUDIENCE: But is it a unique
correlation in your step?

01:04:51.576 --> 01:04:54.676
Because the central
limit theorem, as long

01:04:54.676 --> 01:04:56.475
as the variance-- I
guess, you're saying?

01:04:56.475 --> 01:04:58.350
PROFESSOR: That's why
I'm saying long-tailed.

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:00.302
AUDIENCE: If the
variance is infinite?

01:05:00.302 --> 01:05:02.510
PROFESSOR: Exactly Yeah, so
that's what I was saying.

01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:06.130
And indeed, people argue, in
the case of disease spread,

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:08.580
with modern air
travel and so forth,

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:10.290
that the probability
distribution

01:05:10.290 --> 01:05:13.440
of kind of step sizes
for infected individuals,

01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:16.950
over the next week,
is long-tailed, right?

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:19.130
Because there's a fair
chance that you're just

01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.730
going to stay around
your local neighborhood,

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:21.890
but there's a
smaller chance you're

01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:23.473
going to go to the
other side of town.

01:05:23.473 --> 01:05:27.540
But you might go to a
business trip over in DC.

01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.780
At some small right, though,
you also fly to South Africa

01:05:30.780 --> 01:05:33.010
and go to a conference.

01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:36.090
So all of these things have
reasonable probabilities,

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:39.240
and so there are arguments that
this is kind of some power law

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.200
type distribution.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:42.540
And in those cases,
you don't necessarily

01:05:42.540 --> 01:05:46.612
have finite variance, and
so then you can't just

01:05:46.612 --> 01:05:47.820
put everything under the rug.

01:05:51.237 --> 01:05:53.320
But we first want to
understand what happens here,

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:54.810
and then we can--
well, we're not

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:56.310
going to-- but then
other people can

01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:58.768
think more deeply about what
happens in fancier situations.

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:04.960
It is worth saying,
though, that this approach,

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:08.420
I mean it looks very
physics-y, in the sense that

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:13.020
physicists like simple
equations where we add diffusion

01:06:13.020 --> 01:06:13.610
and so forth.

01:06:13.610 --> 01:06:17.872
But this is not what a
physicist came up with.

01:06:17.872 --> 01:06:21.980
These are classic ideas
in evolution and ecology.

01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:26.780
The solution to this was
originally done by Fisher.

01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:28.920
So this was in the 1920s or so.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:30.560
So a long time ago,
originally to try

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.440
to understand not the
spread of a population

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:36.260
but the spread of a beneficial
allele in a spatial population.

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.290
And once again, this
highlights the deep connections

01:06:39.290 --> 01:06:42.090
between evolution and ecology.

01:06:42.090 --> 01:06:44.840
You can have a
genetic wave in space

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:47.460
of a of a beneficial
mutant spreading,

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:50.446
or you can have a population
wave of an invasive species

01:06:50.446 --> 01:06:52.821
or whatnot, and you end up
getting very similar dynamics.

01:07:00.596 --> 01:07:01.970
So the basic idea,
here, is that,

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:10.730
if you look at the density
as a function of position.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:14.180
If start with, there's
one individual.

01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.671
What's going to happen?

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:22.450
It's going to start
dividing, right?

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:24.337
So we kind of get up.

01:07:24.337 --> 01:07:25.420
And it's going to come up.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:27.590
And eventually it's
going to saturate

01:07:27.590 --> 01:07:32.900
at this carrying capacity, K.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.360
And then you end up getting
these spreading population

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.467
waves that look like this.

01:07:38.467 --> 01:07:40.050
And the reason we're
calling it a wave

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:44.000
is because the shape of this
front is the same over time.

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:59.450
So it can really to be described
as some function x minus vt.

01:07:59.450 --> 01:08:01.840
And we are going to,
maybe, typically assume

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.910
that we're in a situation
where we don't have

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:04.810
to think about the
left and the right,

01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:06.510
because it's just
too complicated.

01:08:06.510 --> 01:08:09.070
So we'll just imagine it being
that it's at saturation here,

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:10.861
and then we're looking
at some front that's

01:08:10.861 --> 01:08:12.860
moving to the right.

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:17.988
Now, by dimensional
analysis, we should

01:08:17.988 --> 01:08:20.279
be able to figure out what
the velocity is going to be.

01:08:22.707 --> 01:08:24.665
Remember how much we
liked dimensional analysis

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:27.600
in this class?

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.060
Yes.

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.910
So what we're
going to do is I'll

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:33.950
give you some
characters that you're

01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:35.765
going to be able to
use in your quest.

01:08:40.109 --> 01:08:48.069
So we can use r, K, D. I'll give
you a square root in case you

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:50.950
find it useful.

01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:59.600
And you can raise something
to the second power as well.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:02.080
So what you can do is you're
going to set up your cards

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:05.330
so that when I look at it,
from the left to the right,

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:08.380
it will describe the
velocity of this wave.

01:09:12.988 --> 01:09:14.029
I'll give you 30 seconds.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:24.049
So this is dimensional analysis
for this wave velocity.

01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:08.310
All right, do you
need more time?

01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.810
Yes?

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:10.000
OK, that's fine.

01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:08.800
All right, let's
go ahead and vote.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:16.730
Construct your answer, remember,
from me, from left to right.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:22.950
Ready, three, two, one.

01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:28.170
All right.

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.700
We have trouble.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:32.850
A key skill is being
able to imagine yourself

01:11:32.850 --> 01:11:34.680
in someone else's shoes.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:36.800
So if I'm viewing--
but that's OK.

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:47.250
So we have, here, this is
kind of units of 1 over time.

01:11:47.250 --> 01:11:51.850
This is what length
squared over time.

01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:54.515
Whereas this is a density.

01:11:57.090 --> 01:12:01.190
If we want something that
is a length over time,

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.190
then we're going to end up
having to take r times D

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:06.230
and take a square root.

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:14.230
So this should be DAC,
which is a square root

01:12:14.230 --> 01:12:16.689
of-- of course, it depends
on how you're entering it

01:12:16.689 --> 01:12:18.980
into your calculator, if you
have scientific calculator

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:21.920
or something else, maybe.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.290
And indeed, it ends
up, there's a 2 here.

01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:26.100
So this is the velocity.

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.658
Yes?

01:12:31.658 --> 01:12:32.574
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:47.970 --> 01:12:49.470
PROFESSOR: I see
what you're saying.

01:12:49.470 --> 01:12:51.840
But it ends up not being true.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:57.030
These derivative signs
don't have any units.

01:12:57.030 --> 01:13:00.210
So this still has
units of a density

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.150
divided by a length squared.

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:06.096
So for unit purposes, you just
look at this thing and at this.

01:13:06.096 --> 01:13:09.155
This squared does mean
there's a length squared

01:13:09.155 --> 01:13:11.530
in the denominator, but this
squared doesn't do anything.

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.210
So D is still a length
squared over time.

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.380
So this is the famous
Fisher velocity.

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:27.185
There are some
mathematical subtleties

01:13:27.185 --> 01:13:29.705
to all of this that we're
not really going to get into.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.630
I don't know.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:31.880
I'm having trouble-- velocity.

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:38.350
There are a few
features to highlight.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:42.497
If the organism grows
faster, the wave

01:13:42.497 --> 01:13:43.580
is going to spread faster.

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:44.860
That make sense?

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.660
If it has a larger mobility,
it also moves faster.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.000
That makes sense.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.260
Of course, the velocity is
given by both of those things.

01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:59.440
So this wave coming out really
is a population level property.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.130
Because it's not just growth.

01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:03.430
It's not just motion.

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:08.406
It's a result of the coupled
division and diffusion

01:14:08.406 --> 01:14:10.280
that leads to this
population wave spreading.

01:14:15.330 --> 01:14:17.440
Importantly, to first
order, it doesn't

01:14:17.440 --> 01:14:22.030
depend on the carrying
capacity, at least

01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:23.470
within the deterministic regime.

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:31.957
AUDIENCE: It's interesting that,
if the reproductive rate goes

01:14:31.957 --> 01:14:35.110
to 0, suddenly the
population stops spreading.

01:14:39.226 --> 01:14:40.350
PROFESSOR: So first of all.

01:14:40.350 --> 01:14:42.890
You'd say, oh, it would be
sort of surprising if it really

01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:44.910
kept on spreading in
the absence of growth.

01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:46.470
But what you're
pointing out is that,

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:49.232
if you just, at one
moment, turn off division,

01:14:49.232 --> 01:14:50.690
then there will
still be diffusion.

01:14:50.690 --> 01:14:52.330
It'll still keep on going.

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:55.820
But this is the velocity
of a wave when it's a wave.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:00.630
When it's described by
a function like this.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:03.400
So it's true that you
could turn off division,

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.456
and it'll still diffuse.

01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:06.080
But then the shape
is changing as well.

01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:18.450
I'm going to draw a
few lines describing

01:15:18.450 --> 01:15:22.310
possible populations.

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:27.850
Now, let's assume that they
have the same motion, diffusion.

01:15:27.850 --> 01:15:30.650
I want to know, which one
has the largest velocity?

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:51.110
Is it A, B, C, D?

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:10.030
It's the same diffusion.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.700
Per capita growth rate as
a function of the density

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.810
for three different organisms.

01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:47.865
Ready, three, two, one.

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.870
All right, so I'd say we have
a fair number of B's, D's.

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:03.670
It seems like it's B versus D.
Now, this is tricky because D,

01:17:03.670 --> 01:17:07.950
we have not explicitly
considered here.

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:12.232
But it turns out that the
answer is B. Certainly,

01:17:12.232 --> 01:17:13.940
between these three,
these are all really

01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:16.500
logistic growth functions.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.140
And so from the standpoint
of here, it's just this r.

01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:25.017
And r is the division
rate at 0 cell density.

01:17:25.017 --> 01:17:26.850
The per capita growth
rate at 0 cell density

01:17:26.850 --> 01:17:30.050
is what determines the
velocity in a Fisher wave.

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:32.400
And indeed, that's
true even if there's

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.583
no decrease in the
growth up right until you

01:17:35.583 --> 01:17:37.480
get to some carrying capacity.

01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:41.944
And indeed, all of these
cases, the division rate

01:17:41.944 --> 01:17:44.110
and the growth rate that's
relevant for the velocity

01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:49.445
is when it hits this axis.

01:17:49.445 --> 01:17:53.100
And indeed, all of these
waves are described as Fisher

01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.000
or pulled waves.

01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:59.810
Because there's a sense
that the entire wave

01:17:59.810 --> 01:18:02.480
is determined by the
front of the wave.

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.240
So we drew this profile.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:06.522
I didn't do that very well.

01:18:06.522 --> 01:18:07.730
Here, this is an exponential.

01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:16.029
And the exponential actually
is what's pulling this wave.

01:18:16.029 --> 01:18:17.820
There ends up being a
characteristic length

01:18:17.820 --> 01:18:23.160
scale here that is the
square root of D/r.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.230
So this is the length
scale of the exponential.

01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:30.000
And the velocity
and the length scale

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.630
are only functions
of the division

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:36.770
rate in the limit
below cell density

01:18:36.770 --> 01:18:38.040
or low density of organism.

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.187
The shape of what goes
on here changes, indeed,

01:18:46.187 --> 01:18:48.020
the bulk properties of
the wave, but doesn't

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:52.910
change the velocity.

01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:56.370
And I just want to make
one comparison of all this

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:59.020
to-- because there's another
qualitatively different kind

01:18:59.020 --> 01:19:02.660
of wave, which is a
so-called pushed wave.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:10.760
And that's what happens
if you have an Allee

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.060
effect, particularly like
a strong Allee effect.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:18.610
If this thing looks-- like
this is certainly possible.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.230
This is an Allee effect.

01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:27.939
Now, if you just said, oh,
the only thing that matters is

01:19:27.939 --> 01:19:30.230
the growth rate at low cell
density, you would say, oh,

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:32.300
this thing cannot
possibly expand.

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:35.130
Although it turns out
that it still is possible.

01:19:35.130 --> 01:19:37.770
And in this
situation, it would be

01:19:37.770 --> 01:19:41.200
called a push wave, where
your profile somehow

01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:42.500
maybe looks kind of similar.

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.910
But instead of it
being the front

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:45.920
of the wave that's
pulling the wave,

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.890
it's diffusion around the bulk.

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:49.430
Because the bulk
is the part that

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:51.840
is actually happily growing.

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:55.350
Because the front, here,
in this case, is dying.

01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:59.610
Yet it still is possible to
have a positive velocity.

01:19:59.610 --> 01:20:03.330
And so this is, then, a
qualitatively different kind

01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:05.681
of population expansion.

01:20:05.681 --> 01:20:07.180
So cooperatively
growing populations

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.280
expand very differently
from logistically growing

01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:11.200
populations.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:14.200
And one of things that the
reading in Physics Today

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.000
talked about is
these different rates

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.340
of loss of heterozygocity and so
forth in different populations.

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:23.990
And as you might
expect, the pulled waves

01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:26.570
have a smaller effective
population size

01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:31.137
than the pushed waves, because,
here, the relevant population

01:20:31.137 --> 01:20:32.720
is at the front if
it's a low density.

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:34.261
Whereas here, the
relevant population

01:20:34.261 --> 01:20:37.144
is the bulk that's
at high density.

01:20:37.144 --> 01:20:38.560
With that, I think
we should quit.

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:39.955
But I will see you on Tuesday.

01:20:39.955 --> 01:20:42.500
And we'll talk about this
neutral theory in ecology.

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.050
Thanks.

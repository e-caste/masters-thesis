00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.950
PROFESSOR: So today what we're
going to do is continue our

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.620
discussion of supply
and demand.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.430
This is sort of introduction
week, if you will.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.450
We've kind of talked about
supply and demand, and you

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.310
guys, rightly, immediately
were on to where do those

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.960
curves come from.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.730
And that's what we'll
start next week.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.320
But what I want to do today is
talk some more about what

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.390
determines the shapes of supply
and demand curves and

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.400
just think about an overview of
how we think about supply

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.310
and demand interacting in a
market and what determines how

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.720
responsive individuals and
firms are to prices.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.805
And, once again, remember
everyone should have a handout

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:00.530
that you should have picked up
in the back on your way in.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.380
So everyone should
have a handout.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.930
What we talked about last time
was the sort of qualitative

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.320
effects, the qualitative version
of the supply and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.360
demand model.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.770
We talked about what happens
when a supply curve shifts,

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.590
what happens when a demand
curve shifts.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.860
We talked about how either a
supply shock or a demand shock

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.190
could lead to the price
being increased.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.420
But they could have very
different effects on

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.660
quantity, et cetera.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.200
What we didn't talk about is
how big these effects are.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.230
I made up some numbers.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.380
I threw them on the graphs.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.610
But I didn't talk about where
the size of those

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.050
effects come from.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.490
And where they come from is the
shapes of the supply and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.180
demand curve.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.700
And that's what we'll talk about
today is what determines

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.500
the shapes of supply
and demand curves.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.790
And that will be the focus
of today's lecture.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.220
I'll talk both theoretically
about what determines these

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.390
shapes and empirically about
how economists go about

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.990
figuring out the shapes of
supply and demand curves.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.370
So, to think about this, let's
start with Figure 3-1, which

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:02.290
is a standard market diagram
we had last time.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.160
With an initial equilibrium at
point E1, with an initial

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.990
price P1 and a quantity Q1.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.600
That's the equilibrium
that's stable.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.280
Because at that price P1,
consumers demand Q1 units, and

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.430
suppliers are willing
to provide Q1 units.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.620
So that's a stable
equilibrium.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.040
Now we have some supply shift.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.830
Last time we talked
about somehow a

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.080
pork-specific drought.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.120
That leads the supply
to shift inward.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.600
So the supply curve
rises to S2.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.920
At that new price, initially,
you would have excess demand.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.610
But quickly the price increases
to shut off that

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:43.750
excess demand.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.620
And you end up with a new
equilibrium with a higher

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.950
price, P2, and a lower
quantity Q2, and new

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.930
equilibrium point E2.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.460
OK?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.340
And we talked that through
last time.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.360
What I want to talk about this
time is well, what determines

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.260
the size of that shift from Q1
to Q2 and that price increase

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.040
from P1 to P2?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.600
What's going to determine it
is the elasticity of supply

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.160
and demand.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.580
The elasticity of supply and
demand is how much do supply

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.790
and demand respond?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.500
Do the quantities supplied and
the quantities demanded

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.860
respond when the
price changes?

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.970
When we say, how elastic is
demand, what we mean is how

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.320
sensitive to price is the
quantity demanded.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.190
Or, alternatively, what is the
slope of that demand curve?

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.050
So the slope of the demand curve
will be the sensitivity

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.290
of quantity demanded to the
price consumers face.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.040
And that will determine the
market responsiveness.

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.350
In economics, it's always true
that the best way to think

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:54.970
about things is to
go to extremes.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:56.800
You have to remember that
extremes don't exist in the

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.740
real world.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.070
But it's a useful
teaching device

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.740
to think about extremes.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.260
So let's think about one extreme
case in Figure 3-2.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.380
Let's think about the case of
perfectly inelastic demand.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.090
Perfectly inelastic demand,
that's where there's no

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.150
elasticity of demand.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.120
What that means is that demand
for a good is unchanged

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.720
regardless of the price.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.880
So perfectly inelastic demand is
a case where demand for the

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.480
good is unchanged regardless
of the price.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.810
That would lead you to have a
vertical demand curve at a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.880
given quantity.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.250
What this says is regardless
of the price, people always

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.430
demand Q.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.820
Can anyone tell me what
would cause demand to

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.120
be perfectly inelastic?

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.620
In what types of situations
would demand be--

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.770
it's never perfectly
inelastic--

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.030
would demand be relatively
inelastic?

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.754
Yeah?

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:51.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.310
PROFESSOR: It's all
about substitutes.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.160
When there's no substitutes,
when there's nowhere to go, it

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.600
doesn't matter what
the price is.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.470
When there's no substitutes,
demand will be perfectly

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:06.930
inelastic, because you have to
have Q. It doesn't matter what

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.900
the price is.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.180
Because there's no substitute
for that good.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.860
So if you wanted amount Q of
that good for any reason,

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.080
you're always going to
want that amount Q

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.590
no matter the price.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.650
So a perfectly inelastic good
would have no substitutes.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.810
So you'd always want
Q no matter what.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.050
Can anyone think
of an example?

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.750
There's no perfectly inelastic
good in the world.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.930
But what sorts of goods?

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.412
Yeah?

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:28.340
AUDIENCE: Medicines.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.230
PROFESSOR: Medicines.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.590
Now, not necessarily
all medicines.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.140
So give me an example of a
medicine which would be more

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.390
or less inelastic.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.630
So I don't even need
a medical name.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.030
What sort of treatments?

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.130
AUDIENCE: Like heart
attack maybe?

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, something which
is sort of lifesaving.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.220
The best thing that we often use
is insulin for diabetics.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.250
Diabetics without getting that
insulin to manage their

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.100
diabetes will die.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.606
That seems like that's something
where there's not a

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:57.360
whole lot of substitutes.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.890
The substitute is dying.

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:01.300
So basically that's
where demand

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.850
is relatively inelastic.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.400
Or a heart transplant, when you
get a heart transplant or

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400
any kind of transplant, you have
medicine you take so you

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.390
don't reject the transplanted
organ.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.770
That sort of medicine demand
should be very inelastic.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.280
Elastic drug, well,
our favorite

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.540
example is always Viagra.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.570
It's something where you'd think
that you can probably

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.820
survive without it.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.350
And people would want less
Viagra if you charged a lot

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.720
more for it than if you
charged less for it.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.010
So elasticity is going to be
about substitutability.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.640
And that's going to determine
inelastic demand.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.720
Now, what happens with inelastic
demand when there's

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.710
a supply shock?

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.570
When supply increases,
what happens?

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.910
Well, in that case, there can
never be excess demand,

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.040
because demand doesn't change.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.280
So all that happens is
price just increases.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.050
If there's inelastic demand,
and there's a supply shock,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.630
then all that happens is an
increase in price and no

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.070
change in quantity.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.610
So with inelastic demand,
quantity doesn't change for a

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.280
price increase.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.540
Price just goes up.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.990
From a supply shock, prices
just goes up.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.710
Now, let's consider
the opposite.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.970
Let's look at Figure
3-3 and think about

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.420
perfectly elastic demand.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.390
Perfectly elastic demand is
demand where consumers,

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:29.730
essentially, don't care
about the quantity.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.440
They just care about
the price.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.805
That is, there are infinitely
good substitutes.

00:07:34.805 --> 00:07:37.615
A perfectly elastically demanded
good would be one

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:40.080
where there are, essentially,
perfect substitutes.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.060
An inelastic good is where
there's no substitute.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.640
A perfectly elastic good would
be where there's perfect

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.200
substitutes.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.980
Technically, if a good is
perfectly elastically

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.250
demanded, then you are
completely indifferent between

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:56.550
that good and a substitute.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.400
Well, if you're completely
indifferent, then if the price

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.760
changed at all, you would
immediately switch.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.660
And so the price can't change.

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.080
What's an example?

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.550
Once again, there's no
good example of a

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.420
perfectly elastic good.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:15.273
Yeah?

00:08:15.273 --> 00:08:16.100
AUDIENCE: Candy.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:16.790
PROFESSOR: What?

00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:17.140
AUDIENCE: Candy.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.990
PROFESSOR: Candy.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.500
OK.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.280
So you've got your
Wrigley's gum.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.930
I like the sugar-free,
minty gum.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:25.275
You've got Orbit and Eclipse.

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:27.060
And I go to the store, and
they're all pretty much the

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:27.590
same price.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.210
If Orbit was more than Eclipse,
I just buy Eclipse.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:30.660
They're the same.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.910
They're minty gum.

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.340
It doesn't make a difference.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.395
So basically the price
is the same.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:41.320
If there's a supply shock, I
don't know, they're made with

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.890
the same shit.

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:45.110
But let's say that Eclipse has
some magic ingredient.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.010
And let's say the Eclipse magic
ingredient got more

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.540
expensive, so the supply
curve shifted up.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.320
Well, Eclipse could not respond
by raising its price.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.590
Because I just switched
to Orbit.

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.430
Or we often think of McDonald's
and Burger King.

00:08:58.430 --> 00:08:59.290
Now, they're less perfect

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.750
substitutes, but pretty perfect.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.730
If McDonald's started charging
$10 for a hamburger, you

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.130
wouldn't go there anymore.

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:05.380
You'd go to Burger King.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:14.080
So if there's a supply shock to
a provider that's facing a

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.050
perfectly elastic demand curve,
they cannot raise their

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.160
price, because people
will just switch.

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.690
So quantity will fall a lot.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.970
Because if I'm supplying Eclipse
gum, and it suddenly

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.360
costs a lot more to produce
Eclipse gum, but I can't raise

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.340
my price, because I will lose
all my business to Orbit, I'm

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.510
just going to produce
a lot less Eclipse.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:37.690
Because I'm losing money now.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.630
So with perfectly inelastic
demand, the

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.080
quantity didn't change.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.440
With perfectly elastic demand,
we saw a big quantity change.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.090
So, more generally, what
determines the quantity change

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.430
in response to a price change
is the elasticity.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.760
More generally, we're between
these two cases of perfectly

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.020
elastic and perfectly
inelastic.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.720
And what's going to determine
the price change is going to

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.370
be the price elasticity of
demand epsilon which is going

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:13.560
to be the percentage change in
quantity for each percentage

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:19.998
change in price or, in calculus
terms, dQ/dP.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.570
So it's, basically, the
percentage change in quantity

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:26.940
for the percentage
change in price.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:33.620
So, for example, if for every 1%
increase in price quantity

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:37.990
falls 2%, that is a price
elasticity of

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:41.770
demand of minus 2.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:44.210
The price elasticity of demand
is the percentage change in

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:48.550
quantity for the percentage
change in price.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:54.260
So inelastic demand is
an epsilon of 0.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:58.200
There is no change in quantity
when price changes.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.470
Perfectly elastic demand is an
epsilon of negative infinity.

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:06.400
Any epsilon change in price
leads to a negative infinite

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.190
change in quantity.

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:08.560
Immediately, the quantity
goes to 0 if you try

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.250
to raise your price.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:12.072
So the price elasticity of
demand will typically be

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:14.270
between 0 and negative
infinity.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:19.340
And the larger it is the more
quantity will change when

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:20.590
prices change.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.611
Questions about that?

00:11:26.611 --> 00:11:27.593
Yeah?

00:11:27.593 --> 00:11:31.030
AUDIENCE: So that formula,
shouldn't it be dQ/dP times

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:35.940
P/Q because dQ/dP just refers to
the change of the quantity

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:37.413
with respect to price, not

00:11:37.413 --> 00:11:39.400
necessarily the percent change.

00:11:42.066 --> 00:11:43.075
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're right.

00:11:43.075 --> 00:11:44.520
I was trying to get too fancy
with my calculus.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:45.010
You're right.

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.500
Let's just stick with the
non-calculus formula.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.740
I never should deviate
from my notes.

00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:52.980
So let's just stick with the
non-calculus formula.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.310
OK, other questions
about this?

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:56.950
OK.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.480
So, basically, that's
the elasticity.

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.700
That's going to be
the elasticity.

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.380
Now, an interesting point about
elasticity is now, we're

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.650
not going to get into
producer theory

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.990
for a couple of lectures.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:13.140
But as a little peek ahead about
producer theory, let's

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.920
think about how elasticity
determines the money that

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.930
producers make from selling
their goods.

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:23.820
Well, if a producer sells Q
goods at a price P, they make

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:30.280
revenues R. Revenues are the
price times the quantity.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:37.140
The amount of money a producer
makes when it sells goods, its

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.300
revenues, this isn't
its profits.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:39.880
We're not having profits.

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:41.290
It's just the amount of money
it makes, not the amount of

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.430
money it takes home at
the end of the day.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:44.400
I'm ignoring the cost
of making the goods.

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.840
The amount of total
revenues it makes

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.210
is price times quantity.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:51.860
Well, we can then say that the
change in revenues with

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.610
respect to price is what?

00:12:55.610 --> 00:13:02.600
It's Q plus dQ, plus delta Q--
let me put it this way to make

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.720
my math clearer--

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:10.260
plus P times delta Q over delta
P. That's how revenues

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.840
change with respect to price.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.810
Or, in other words, plugging
in from the elasticity

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:25.965
formula, delta R over delta P
equals Q times 1 plus epsilon.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:34.620
So, in other words, what this
says is that if you're a

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.500
producer, and you're trying to
decide whether to raise your

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.360
price, whether that will
increase revenues, it all

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.420
depends on the elasticity.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:48.150
If the elasticity is between
0 and minus 1, then raising

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.120
prices will raise revenues.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.310
If the elasticity is greater
than minus 1, then raising

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:58.900
prices will lower revenues.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.230
We're often faced with the issue
of why did they charge

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.040
this much for this good, or
should they raise their prices

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.270
or not raise their price.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:08.540
Well, that's all about the
elasticity of demand.

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.710
The elasticity of demand will
determine whether they're

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.290
going to make more money by
raising their price or lose

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:15.820
money by raising their price.

00:14:15.820 --> 00:14:18.410
For Eclipse gum, their
elasticity of demand is well

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:20.650
above minus 1 in absolute value,
so they're going to

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:21.940
lose money by raising
their price.

00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:24.610
If they take the current level
of Eclipse, for every penny

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.260
they raise, they'll
lose money.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:28.790
For insulin, for every
penny they raise,

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.790
they'll make money.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.100
And then you might say well,
then how come the price of

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.950
insulin isn't infinity
and the price of

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.240
Eclipse gum isn't zero?

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.780
Well, that's what we'll talk
about in a few weeks.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.360
Because it also depends on the
costs of producing it.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.890
But at the end of the day,
that's what's going to

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:45.990
determine the money that's made
by producers when they

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.860
change their prices.

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:50.110
Questions about that?

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.790
OK.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.880
So now, that's how we think
about the shape

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.870
of supply and demand.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.600
The shape of supply and demand
is determined by these

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.360
elasticities.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.920
So now we have to get into OK,
well, where do we get these

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.860
elasticities from?

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:20.870
And that is the main topic of
empirical economics which is

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.370
estimating these kinds of
elasticities, estimating these

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:26.620
types of elasticities.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.220
So one of the first distinctions
I drew in the

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.900
lectures is between theoretical
economics and

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:39.520
empirical economics.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:44.160
Theoretical economics can tell
us this is what a graph looks

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.620
like and supply and demand.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.140
Theoretical economics can't
really tell us how big, for

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.360
example, an elasticity
is going to be.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.400
It can tell us, there's more
substitutes or less

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.840
substitutes so we
can rank them.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.450
We know the elasticity for
Eclipse gum has got to be

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.620
higher than the elasticity
for insulin.

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:06.620
But from the theoretical model,
we can't say what the

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.660
elasticity actually is.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.470
To say what an elasticity
actually is, we need to go to

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:12.870
an empirical model.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.940
We actually need to bring data
to bear on the question.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.840
And this is very difficult.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.680
Because here we face the
fundamental conundrum facing

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:26.220
the empirical economist which
is distinguishing causation

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.470
from correlation.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.840
And the whole guts of empirical
economics is all

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:37.490
about this question,
distinguishing causation from

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:38.740
correlation.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.895
The classic story that
illustrates this, it's due to

00:16:43.895 --> 00:16:46.130
my colleague, Frank Fisher,
from a textbook many years

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:50.420
ago, was the story of in ancient
Russia there was a

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.390
cholera outbreak, and many
people were dying.

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.840
So the government decided to
send doctors out to try to

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.470
solve the problem.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.850
And where there were
more people sick,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:04.030
they sent more doctors.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.190
Well, the peasants said,
wait a second.

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.420
We observe that where there's
more doctors, more people are

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:10.510
dying from cholera.

00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:12.700
So the doctors must be
causing the cholera.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.190
So they rose up and killed
the doctors.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:21.250
The peasants confused causation
with correlation.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.190
They thought that the fact that
you saw more people dying

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:24.800
where there's more doctors
meant that doctors were

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.455
causing the disease.

00:17:25.455 --> 00:17:26.310
Clearly that's wrong.

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:27.560
That's why they were peasants.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.435
But it's not just peasants
that make this mistake.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:39.070
For example, in 1988, Harvard
University, our illustrious

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.525
neighbor to the south,
I guess, west,

00:17:41.525 --> 00:17:42.180
east, I don't know.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:42.750
Which way is Harvard?

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.300
I don't know directions,
down the street.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.020
A Harvard University dean
conducted an interview with a

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:50.820
set of freshmen.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.140
And they found that those
that had taken

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.030
SAT preparation courses--

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:57.890
now, you all took SAT
preparation courses.

00:17:57.890 --> 00:18:00.650
But in 1988, not everyone did.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:04.310
Those who'd taken SAT
preparation courses scored an

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:07.460
average of 63 points lower--

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.070
this was back when the
SAT was 1600 points--

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.100
63 points lower on their SATs
then those that had not taken

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.620
preparation courses.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:18.690
The dean concluded that
preparation courses were

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.600
unhelpful, and that the testing
industry was preying

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.590
on the insecurities
of students to

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.800
provide a useless service.

00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:31.190
Why was the dean confusing
causation with correlation?

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:33.648
What did the dean get wrong in
drawing that conclusion?

00:18:33.648 --> 00:18:34.136
Yeah?

00:18:34.136 --> 00:18:38.040
AUDIENCE: What had probably
happened is the students who

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.968
got worse scores realized that
they wanted to try and improve

00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:42.920
their scores by taking
an SAT prep class.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:46.336
So that's why there is a lower
average score for the people

00:18:46.336 --> 00:18:47.312
who had taken the class.

00:18:47.312 --> 00:18:49.790
PROFESSOR: Generally, the people
who needed the help the

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.660
most took the most courses.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:55.330
And so they had an underlying
lower score.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:58.620
So, in fact, you can't tell
anything from the fact that

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:00.805
the people who took the prep
course scored worse.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.300
It's just another excellent
example of confusing causation

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:11.350
with correlation.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.330
And that's another example.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.640
Another example I like quite
a lot is studies of

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.200
breastfeeding.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.760
There are numbers of studies of
breastfeeding, especially

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:27.640
in developing countries, where
they found that the longer

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:31.720
children were breastfed
the sicker they were.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.540
So they concluded that

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.540
breastfeeding was bad for kids.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.140
Well, that's not the truth.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:40.650
The truth is the sicker kids
need to be breastfed more,

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.860
because breastfeeding is
actually good for kids.

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:46.320
And they just confused the
causation with the

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.550
correlation.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:49.040
Now, these are all
fun examples.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.970
But the truth is this is a
common mistake made by

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.880
citizens, policy makers,
everyone in the real world.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.210
It's taking two things that move
together and assuming one

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:01.110
causes the other.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:04.400
And this is the fundamental
conundrum facing empirical

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.010
economics in trying to address
these kinds of things like

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.170
measuring elasticities.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:15.120
So to understand that, let's
think about the issue of

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.150
trying to estimate the
elasticity of demand for pork.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.950
Let's say you have the exciting
job of estimating the

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.130
elasticity of demand for pork.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:26.020
That's your assignment.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.610
Well, you say, wait a second.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:35.920
What we learned in class, as
shown in Figure 3-4, is that

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:42.420
the price of pork can rise for
very different reasons.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:49.810
Figure 3-4, we start at an
initial equilibrium like E1

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:51.650
with a quantity like
Q1 and a price P1.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:21:00.160
Now, imagine that there was a
shift in demand, because the

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.390
price of beef rose, remember?

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.510
The price of beef rose.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.750
That shifted demand
from D1 to D2.

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.690
What did that lead to?

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:11.050
A higher price and a
higher quantity.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.660
So if you took that diagram--

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:15.730
forget the supply shift for a
minute, just imagine that's

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.100
the change--

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.150
and you said, aha.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.980
I can measure the elasticity.

00:21:20.980 --> 00:21:24.160
I see here there's a
change in price.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:26.280
I can then look at how
quantity changed.

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.650
And I'll get the elasticity
right after all.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.250
It's delta Q over Q
or delta P over P.

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:35.440
So I just look, and I take Q2
prime minus Q1 over Q1.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.490
That's the percentage change
in Q. I take P2

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:39.710
over P1 over P1.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:40.780
That's the percentage
change in price.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.750
And what do I get?

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.980
A wrong signed elasticity
is what I get.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.880
I get a positive elasticity,
because Q is going up

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:50.930
and P is going up.

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.780
Why?

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:56.140
Because I'm confusing causation
with correlation.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:01.920
It's not the price change that
caused quantity to change.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.240
In fact, it's the opposite.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:07.560
It's a taste shift, which caused
quantity to increase

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.450
which drove up the price.

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:14.460
It was a demand increase which
caused the quantity demanded

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.320
to increase which drove
up the price.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.310
So it's the quantity driving
the price, not the price

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.460
driving the quantity.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.630
So if you looked at that simple
example, as many people

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.680
in the real world do, they'd
say, hey, look.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:26.550
Higher prices cause
higher quantities.

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.220
You're getting the
wrong answer.

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.190
Because you're confusing
correlation which is the

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.020
higher price is correlated
with the higher quantity.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.420
Because there was a common
factor causing both of them

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.620
which is the demand shift
and not causation.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.965
The higher price did not cause
the higher quantity.

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:46.270
What do we need to do?

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:50.440
We need to distinguish why
the price increased.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.940
We need to distinguish
why the price

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.950
increased to measure this.

00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:03.360
If, instead, we looked at a
shift in supply such as the

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.680
case that's shifting from
S1 to S2 and moving the

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.150
equilibrium from E1 to
E2, then you would

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.960
get the right answer.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.210
Because then you'd say, look.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:15.610
Something independent
to consumers

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.290
shifted up the price.

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:19.970
Some shock to the supply of
pork shifted up the price.

00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:22.710
And we saw that their quantity
fell as a result.

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:26.610
What's the key?

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.650
The key is that to measure an
elasticity of demand, you're

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:33.170
measuring the slope of
the demand curve.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.830
So you need to shift along a
demand curve, not shift the

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:38.370
demand curve itself.

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:41.990
So if you look at this figure,
what's the concept we want?

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:44.830
We want the slope of
the demand curve.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:49.750
Well, you get that by shifting
from E1 to E2, because you

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.730
shift along the demand curve.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.040
So by looking at what happens
to quantity as price rises

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.540
from E1 to E2, you get the slope
of the demand curve.

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.105
You get that delta Q over
delta P you want.

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:03.010
But from E1 to E2 prime, you're
not shifting along the

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.360
demand curve.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.410
You're actually measuring the
elasticity of supply.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:09.272
You're measuring the elasticity
of supply.

00:24:09.272 --> 00:24:12.040
You're shifting along
a supply curve.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.640
So you're actually answering a
different question, a relevant

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.020
question, but a different one.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.750
That question is, what's the
elasticity of supply?

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:25.080
How willing are pork producers
to supply pork as

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.100
the price goes up?

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:30.470
So it's the same delta Q over
delta P. But here we did the

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.050
elasticity of demand.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:36.500
There's a corresponding
elasticity of supply which is

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.590
measured the same way.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.865
It's delta Q over delta
P, but it's for a

00:24:41.865 --> 00:24:43.460
different kind of shock.

00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.780
It's what you get from moving
along the supply curve.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:49.940
So if we went from E1 to E2
prime, we can use that to

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.540
measure the elasticity of supply
or the slope of the

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:54.890
supply curve.

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:58.230
And we do that if something
shifts demand to move us along

00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:59.420
the supply curve.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.250
From E1 to E2, we measure the
elasticity of demand as

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.130
something shifts supply
and moves us

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:10.390
along the demand curve.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:14.140
So what we need to measure the
elasticity of demand is

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.880
something which shifts
supply but does not,

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.930
itself, affect demand.

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:23.790
And the best example of this
that we use in economics, a

00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:28.610
great example, is government
policy which comes along and

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.630
changes the supply conditions
for a good.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:35.420
So, for example, let's think
about a tax on pork.

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:40.290
So if you go to Figure 3-5,
imagine the government came

00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.970
along and taxed pork.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.040
The government comes along
and taxes pork.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.240
Let's think about what
a tax on pork does.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.570
The government comes along, and
let's say the pork market

00:25:55.570 --> 00:26:01.300
is initially in equilibrium
at $3.30 with 220 million

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.360
kilograms of pork sold.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:08.610
Now the government comes along
and says that it's going to

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:14.500
charge $1.05 in tax for every
kilogram of pork.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:19.360
So it's going to impose
a tax of $1.05

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.990
per kilogram on producers.

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:24.350
So it's saying to producers of
pork, for every kilogram of

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.270
pork you sell, you have
to send a check to the

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.120
government for $1.05.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.900
For every kilogram of pork you
sell, you have to send a check

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:36.750
to the government for $1.05.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.520
Now, somebody talk me through
how a supplier

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.060
thinks through that.

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.390
How does a supplier
react to that?

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:45.518
What do they think?

00:26:45.518 --> 00:26:51.030
They're initially happy at
E1 selling 220 million

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:53.450
kilograms at $3.30.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.150
What happens when the government
comes in and says

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.570
you have to pay $1.05 for every

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:00.230
kilogram of pork you sell?

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.930
What happens?

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:03.752
Yeah.

00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:06.282
AUDIENCE: The producer decides
that the current amount of

00:27:06.282 --> 00:27:10.018
money they have will not be able
to buy as much inputs to

00:27:10.018 --> 00:27:11.464
create their products.

00:27:11.464 --> 00:27:12.265
So they can produce less.

00:27:12.265 --> 00:27:12.570
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.020
So, in other words, the cost
of producing just rose.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.110
So what do they do?

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:23.060
So, in other words, what they
say is look, effectively, if I

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:30.900
was happy before selling 220
million kilograms at $3.30, to

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.330
keep me equally happy selling
220 million kilograms, I'm

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.340
going to have to raise
the price.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.300
We should add this to
graph, actually.

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:42.060
If you draw a vertical line up
for me, one to the S2 curve.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.420
Draw a little dashed line up
from the E1 to the S2 curve

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.730
and then over.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:51.030
That price intersection
will be $4.35.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.330
So in other words, if you want
me to keep producing 220

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:57.490
million kilograms of pork,
I'm going to have

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:00.856
to get $4.35 a kilogram.

00:28:00.856 --> 00:28:03.120
And you might say, what gives
you the right to get that?

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.110
And it's not about rights.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.320
It's about what producers
are willing to do.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.770
That same mathematics, that same
supply curve that tells

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:16.050
us they're willing to sell 220
million kilograms at $3.30

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:18.460
says, if you want them to keep
selling 220 million kilograms

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:21.190
but also pay $1.05 to the
government, they're going to

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:24.820
have to get $4.35 a kilogram.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.160
So what happens is that's
a supply shift.

00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.060
And with the same reaction
we saw last time with the

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:34.180
drought, the price goes up,
consumers demand less, and you

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.910
reach a new equilibrium
at the price E2.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:43.060
You reach a new equilibrium
where you sell 206 million

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:49.140
kilograms for a price
of $4.00.

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.840
So someone tell me how I use
this example to find

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.303
elasticity of demand.

00:28:53.303 --> 00:28:55.275
Yeah.

00:28:55.275 --> 00:28:58.233
AUDIENCE: I guess you need to
know that the change in price

00:28:58.233 --> 00:29:00.205
traveled along the
demand curve.

00:29:00.205 --> 00:29:02.177
So you know that it's not
[INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:29:05.135 --> 00:29:06.614
PROFESSOR: OK, so tell me.

00:29:06.614 --> 00:29:08.093
You don't have to do the
math in your head.

00:29:08.093 --> 00:29:09.572
But how would I compute it?

00:29:09.572 --> 00:29:12.462
AUDIENCE: You would take E1 and
E2, and then you would do

00:29:12.462 --> 00:29:14.032
the price over the
quantity change.

00:29:14.032 --> 00:29:15.550
PROFESSOR: Right, exactly.

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:21.835
So the quantity change delta
Q over Q, is what?

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.960
It's minus 14 over 220.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.680
It fell by 14 million
kilograms over 220.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:39.990
The price change, delta P
over P, the price rose

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:41.320
from $3.30 to $4.00.

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:49.370
So the price change is
$0.70 over $3.30.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:55.330
And using those, you
end up with a price

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:59.900
elasticity of minus 0.3.

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:06.790
Or, in other words, there's
a 6.4% change in quantity.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:15.490
This is minus 6.4% for a
21% change in price.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:20.350
So quantity falls by 6.4% when
price goes up by 21%.

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.580
That's a price elasticity
of minus 0.3.

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:27.380
Or that's a relatively
inelastic demand.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.950
It's not perfectly inelastic,
but it's relatively inelastic.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.900
In other words, at that point,
pork producers could make

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.455
money by raising the price.

00:30:35.455 --> 00:30:37.760
Now, you might say well,
why didn't they?

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:41.560
That's something we'll discuss
in a couple weeks.

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.870
But at that point, demand
is relatively inelastic.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.020
And you've got a convincing
estimate, because you moved

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.190
along that demand curve.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.750
You used the supply shift.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:52.920
Now, we're going to talk about
taxation much, much later in

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.720
the semester.

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.780
Let me just talk for one minute
about what we learned

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:57.550
from this graph.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.670
What happens?

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.300
Well, the shaded area is the
money the government raises

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.240
from its tax.

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:09.490
The government has a tax
of $1.05 at 206 million

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:14.810
kilograms. So it raises $1.05
times 206 million kilograms

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.660
which is that shaded area.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.400
There are two points to note the
we'll come back to later

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.415
in the semester.

00:31:19.415 --> 00:31:22.740
The first point to note is the
amount of money the government

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.840
raises will depend directly on
the elasticity of demand.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.420
Can anyone tell me how much
money the government would

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:37.540
raise if you had a perfectly
inelastic demand?

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.043
Yeah.

00:31:41.043 --> 00:31:42.293
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:47.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.520
If we think about this demand
curve being perfectly flat, if

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.070
we think about this demand curve
being perfectly flat,

00:31:54.070 --> 00:32:01.700
then basically the producer
can't charge any more for

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.310
their good.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:07.290
So it's going to depend on
whether the producer is

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:11.510
willing to sell at $1.05 less
and how much less they're

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.870
willing to sell.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:12.992
If they're willing to sell a
lot less, they're going to

00:32:12.992 --> 00:32:15.790
make a lot less money.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.430
It's going to be where that
second supply curve intersects

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:20.820
a flat demand curve.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:22.240
So that quantity is going
to be a lot smaller.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.580
We don't have it
on the diagram.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:29.230
But you see where that dashed
line at $3.30 intersects S2,

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:30.500
that's way to the left.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:32.690
Quantity is going to fall
a ton in this market.

00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:34.690
When quantity falls, the
government is going to raise a

00:32:34.690 --> 00:32:36.170
lot less money.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:37.750
Because the government
raises $1.05 on every

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.660
unit sold at the end.

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:44.180
So if the government taxes
very elastically demanded

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:46.410
goods, it's going to
raise less money.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:49.710
If it taxes inelastically
demanded goods like insulin,

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:51.540
it's going to raise more money,
because the quantity

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:53.550
doesn't change.

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:53.810
Yeah.

00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.440
AUDIENCE: So cigarettes are
relatively inelastic.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.570
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:32:58.830
Cigarettes are relatively
inelastic.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.790
The elasticity is around
minus 0.5.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:05.350
So the government will actually
raise money by

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.670
raising the cigarette tax.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.670
Those of us, as good liberals,
think we should tax yachts.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:15.475
Let's tax yachts.

00:33:15.475 --> 00:33:17.640
Only rich guy have yachts.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:18.580
The problem is yachts are

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.730
incredibly elastically demanded.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.130
So you raise a lot less money
taxing yachts than you think.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:28.020
Because guys buy fewer yachts,
and you don't raise as much

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:28.640
money as you think you would.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:31.270
You still raise some, and it
still may be worth it.

00:33:31.270 --> 00:33:33.510
But you raise less
than you think.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:39.200
So that's one sort of
observation about this.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.800
It's basically how much money
you'll raise will be a

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:47.320
function of how elastic
the demand is.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.910
The other important observation
to make is why

00:33:50.910 --> 00:33:53.280
it's actually hard for
governments to figure out how

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.700
much money they're going
to raise for a tax.

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.730
Because, to figure it out,
they need to know these

00:33:58.730 --> 00:33:59.400
elasticities.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.860
That is, the naive thing to do
would have been to say what?

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:04.790
Well, we're selling 220 million
kilograms of pork.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.080
That's $1.05.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.240
We're going to tax
each kilogram.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.560
So that's 220 million
times $1.05.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.830
And that's how much
money we raise.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:12.540
Well, that's wrong, we
know, because that

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:14.659
assumes inelastic demand.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.699
If demand's elastic, they'll
raise less than that.

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.389
Well, if we want to figure out
how much a government is going

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:19.800
to raise from a tax, they've
got to know what these

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.639
elasticities are.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.754
And those are actually pretty
hard things to know.

00:34:22.754 --> 00:34:24.620
So that's why there's
uncertainty.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:27.860
That's why when politicians will
say, this tax will raise

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.360
x and you'll hear the New York
Times report, the tax will

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:35.030
raise x, that is a guess.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:36.850
Those are guesses, because
they depend on our best

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.530
estimate of the key elasticities
that determine

00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:40.600
how people respond.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:40.850
Yeah.

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.962
AUDIENCE: But in Washington
you have tax

00:34:41.962 --> 00:34:43.780
cuts that raise money.

00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:45.951
PROFESSOR: Well, some
claim you do.

00:34:45.951 --> 00:34:46.408
You don't actually.

00:34:46.408 --> 00:34:48.693
But some claim you have tax
cuts that raise money.

00:34:48.693 --> 00:34:51.810
That's because they think the
elasticity is very large.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:54.469
If the elasticity is
large enough, a tax

00:34:54.469 --> 00:34:56.760
cut can raise money.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.920
So, basically, that's all about
that some people think

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.660
that elasticities are large
enough that tax

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.180
cuts can raise money.

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:04.530
Those people are wrong.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:07.780
But that's what they claim.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:08.709
Yeah.

00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:09.959
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:35:12.381 --> 00:35:12.840
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.660
Excellent point.

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.390
You'll go through that
in section on Friday.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:18.890
So what I've done is I've done
an example of a constant

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.020
elasticity curve.

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.160
Actually, I've done something
here which is logically

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:23.900
inconsistent.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.160
This curve is linear which means
it can't be constant

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.570
elasticity.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.620
If it's constant elasticity,
it would have to curve.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:36.100
So what I've estimated here
is a local elasticity.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.200
I have estimated the elasticity

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.550
around that price change.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.590
But the elasticity, if this
curve is true, would be

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.850
different at different
points on this curve.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.020
If the elasticity is going to
be constant all over the

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.500
curve, and you're going to do
a constant elasticity of

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.320
demand, that's going to
be a curve that bends,

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.340
not a linear curve.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.270
So a linear demand curve
is not constant

00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:58.390
elasticity of demand.

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.910
We will typically ignore that
issue and focus on local

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:02.440
elasticities.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.440
But that is an important
issue.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.030
We'll discuss that in section
on Friday, the difference

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.590
between constant elasticity of
demand curves and linear

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:09.020
demand curves.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.120
But, typically, we're think
about local changes.

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:13.650
So if it's local enough, it
doesn't really matter.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:16.120
But, for a broad change, it will
matter what the shape of

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:16.940
the curve is.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:17.930
Good point.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:19.040
Other questions?

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.390
OK.

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:24.160
Let me then turn to another
problem we face

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.410
in empirical economics.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:27.850
So this is an example of a
problem we're facing in

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:29.680
empirical economics.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.640
Let me turn to an example of
another problem we face in

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.700
empirical economics estimating
elasticities.

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:38.950
It is that individuals often
choose the price they face.

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:45.730
Individuals, typically, often
don't just face a price that's

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:46.760
given to them.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.100
And then you can say, OK,
they're given a price, and we

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:48.700
see how they respond.

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.870
They often choose the
price they face.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.960
Let me explain what
I mean by that.

00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.380
A classic example of an
elasticity that matters a lot

00:36:56.380 --> 00:36:59.940
for policies is the elasticity
of demand for medical care,

00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.250
the elasticity of demand
for medical care.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:05.910
That is how much less medical
care will you use if you have

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:07.350
to pay for it?

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:10.580
So, for example, most of us have
insurance through MIT or

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:12.090
maybe through our parents.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.230
And the way health insurance
works is you pay a certain

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.270
amount per month or your parents
do, and, in return,

00:37:18.270 --> 00:37:21.630
that health insurance covers the
cost of your medical care,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:23.020
most of it.

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.530
But, typically, you have
to pay some of it.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.080
So how many people have
gone to the doctor in

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.660
the last six months?

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:32.760
Did you have to pay something?

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:33.754
How much did you pay?

00:37:33.754 --> 00:37:35.245
Did you pay a copayment?

00:37:35.245 --> 00:37:35.742
No?

00:37:35.742 --> 00:37:36.736
None of you?

00:37:36.736 --> 00:37:37.233
Yeah.

00:37:37.233 --> 00:37:38.227
How much did you pay?

00:37:38.227 --> 00:37:39.930
AUDIENCE: I think like $20.

00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.410
PROFESSOR: $20, $10, $5, that's
what's called the

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.270
copayment, or $0.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.760
Most insurance these days has
what's called copayments.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:51.230
A copayment is what you pay
when you go to the doctor.

00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:52.586
Insurance picks up the
rest. You don't know.

00:37:52.586 --> 00:37:54.420
You didn't know how much the
whole doctor visit cost. You

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:55.800
just went, you gave
them your card.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:57.025
They said your copayment
is $20.

00:37:57.025 --> 00:37:57.450
You gave them $20.

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:57.950
You don't know.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:00.510
The visit might have cost $100,
$200, $500, $1,000.

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:01.460
You don't know.

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:05.950
Your insurer picks up the rest.
You pay the copayment.

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:11.040
Copayments are rapidly on the
rise in health insurance.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.740
There's a rapid rise
in copayments.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:15.860
Increasingly, insurers are
saying, look, health care

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.700
costs are out of control.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:20.990
One way we're going to combat
them is by making people bear

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:23.700
more of the cost
that they use.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.020
I could go on forever about
how I'm a health care

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:26.300
economist. I could go on about
health care forever.

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:33.120
But just to fix ideas on why
this is an issue, in 1950, the

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:37.380
US economy spent 5% of our gross
domestic product, 5% of

00:38:37.380 --> 00:38:40.100
our size of the economy
went to health care.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.570
Today it's 17%.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.930
By 2075, it's projected
to be 40%.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.960
That is of every dollar that's
made in America, $0.40 will go

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.290
to medical care.

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:53.210
By 100 years later,
it's about 100%.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.130
Literally, if we do nothing,
the entire economy will be

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:56.270
health care.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:57.770
Obviously, that can't happen.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:38:58.970
We've got to deal with this.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.700
And one way that insurers and
some policy makers are saying

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:03.840
we need to deal with this is we
need to make consumers bear

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:06.260
more of the costs of
their medical care.

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.220
We need to make consumers pay
more when they go to the

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:10.780
doctor, so that they understand
the consequences of

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.870
their decision.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.980
Well, if we're going to do that,
a key question we need

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.920
to know is well, does it
affect their behavior?

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:21.300
If we make consumers pay more,
and it doesn't at all affect

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.050
their demand for medical care--
it's just a tax on

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:25.280
them, essentially--

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.220
then that's different than if
it causes them to use less

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:28.365
medical care.

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:29.770
It may be good, may be bad.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:31.390
We'll come back to that.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:34.850
But the key empirical question
is what is the elasticity of

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:36.420
demand for medical care?

00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:40.840
If you pay $20 and you pay $0,
how much less like are you to

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.730
use the doctor when you pay $20
versus when you pay $0.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.960
Well, we can all introspect
this and think about it.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:50.570
But, in fact, to answer this we
have to go to the data and

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:53.170
ask, well, what's
the difference?

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:55.650
So people, for many years,
went to the data.

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:58.030
And they said, look, there's all
sorts of differences out

00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:59.990
there across people and what
they pay for their copayments.

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:01.725
Some people have insurance where
they pay nothing, some

00:40:01.725 --> 00:40:02.810
where they have $20.

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:05.710
Some people have what they call
high-deductible plans.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.900
A deductible plan is where you
pay the full cost of your

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:09.950
visits until you reach
some limit.

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:13.420
So a $2000 deductible plan will
be one where you pay all

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.790
of your medical costs until
you've spent $2,000.

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.050
It's a big copayment.

00:40:18.050 --> 00:40:19.780
So we look across those people,
and people did.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.380
And they found, look, the people
that have plans where

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.670
they spend more for health care,
where they have a high

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.380
copayment, use a lot less health
care than where they

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.270
don't have to spend anything.

00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:36.750
The elasticity of demand
looks very, very high.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.600
What is wrong with
those studies?

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.700
What is wrong with the
conclusion those people drew?

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.790
They drew it by comparing people
who had plans where

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:49.050
they paid a lot to go to the
doctor, and therefore use a

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:51.635
lot less care to people who
didn't pay anything when they

00:40:51.635 --> 00:40:53.911
went to the doctor and
used a lot more care.

00:40:53.911 --> 00:40:57.210
I pick the $20 person, because
I picked on you already.

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:00.460
AUDIENCE: Probably they chose
to have a high-deductible

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.120
plan, because they don't often
go to the doctor already.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:07.810
PROFESSOR: The rational choice,
if you're young and

00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:10.830
healthy, for almost everyone in
this room, is going to be a

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:13.810
very high-deductible,
high copayment plan.

00:41:13.810 --> 00:41:16.930
Because it will cost you less
money, because the insurer is

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.045
shifting the money to you.

00:41:18.045 --> 00:41:19.300
But you don't use the
doctor anyway.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.510
So who cares?

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.820
So the healthier people are
going to choose the plans

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.800
where they pay more.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.375
So, of course, you're going to
find in the plans where people

00:41:27.375 --> 00:41:32.780
pay more they use less
medical care.

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:35.300
But is it because they're paying
more, or is it because

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.490
healthy guys choose
those plans?

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.820
It's causation versus
correlation.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:42.120
We don't know.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.400
Well, how can we figure
that out?

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.460
Well, if we were doctors, what
we'd do-- real doctors, not a

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.760
doctor like me, a real doctor,
a medical doctor--

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:55.980
what we'd do is we'd run
a randomized trial.

00:41:55.980 --> 00:42:00.320
So if doctors want to figure
out whether a drug works or

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:04.810
not, they don't just look at
guys who take the drug versus

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.790
guys who don't.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:07.820
They run a randomized trial.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:11.130
They randomly assign some people
to take the drug and

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.431
some people not.

00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:16.840
Now, when you run a randomized
trial, by definition, you get

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.500
a causal effect.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:21.510
Well, this room isn't
quite big enough.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.230
We all know the law
of large numbers.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:24.990
But imagine there were four
times as many people in this

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:27.000
room or five times as many
people in this room.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.620
OK?

00:42:27.620 --> 00:42:28.990
And I had you come
up to the front.

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:31.510
I flipped a coin and said half
of you are going to take the

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.470
drug, and half of you
are not, randomly by

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.260
the flip of a coin.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:39.400
Then, by definition, any
statistically noticeable

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.320
differences I get between the
group the takes the drug and

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.740
the group that doesn't is
caused by the drug.

00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:45.860
And how do I know that?

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.010
Because I know the groups are
otherwise identical by the law

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:49.090
of large numbers.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:51.140
By the law of large numbers, I
know that as long as I have

00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.050
enough people, they're
identical.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:55.800
So if the only difference
between them is that one's

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:59.390
taking the drug and one's not,
that's a randomized trial.

00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.540
That would be how I could solve
the causation versus

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.820
correlation problem.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:07.570
In medicine, thousands of
randomized trials every day

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:09.380
are being run.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.920
In fact, the FDA, before it
will approve a drug, will

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.040
typically require a
randomized trial.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.820
Well, in the social sciences,
it's harder to

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:16.770
run randomized trials.

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:20.220
Because we're actually trying
to understand things like

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.190
people's demand for medical
care, not whether a

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:23.390
drug works or not.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:26.430
But, in fact, one of the most
famous social randomized

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:28.680
trials in history was called
the RAND Health Insurance

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.820
Experiment run in the 1970s.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:33.450
This is where some innovative
health economists who

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.720
understood this problem that
we laid out about the fact

00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:37.330
that you can't just compare more
or less generous health

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.350
insurance policies, actually
randomized health insurance

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.310
policies across people.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:46.460
They recruited volunteers, and
they literally said, we're

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:47.700
going to randomize.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.580
Some people are going to have
policies where the health care

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:54.580
is free, and some people are
going to have policies where

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:58.840
they have to pay, essentially,
all the costs of health care.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:01.370
So they, essentially, randomized
across these

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:02.530
different groups.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.510
And, therefore, they can
assess what the price

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:06.360
elasticity was.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:09.370
Because they knew the price
difference between groups.

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:10.370
For one, the price was zero.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.580
For one, the price was one.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.710
They actually had a range of
prices they varied it across.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:16.480
They could look at the quantity
response, and they

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.280
knew that was a quantity
response to the price, because

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.810
people weren't choosing
their prices.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:22.450
The prices were being
assigned to them.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.680
What did they find?

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:26.940
Well, they found that medical
demand is elastic, although

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:28.690
not as elastic as the
previous study.

00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:30.375
It's somewhat elastic.

00:44:30.375 --> 00:44:33.200
It's not as elastic as the
previous studies found.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:35.260
They found that the elasticity
of demand for medical care is

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.950
around minus 0.2.

00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:41.710
So when the price goes up,
people use less medical care

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:45.540
but not that much less.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.790
Now, let's be clear.

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:47.770
Remember what elasticity is.

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:51.490
That delta Q over Q. The same
study showed that if you take

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:55.160
someone who paid nothing and
make them pay almost

00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:00.400
everything, their utilization of
medical care falls by 45%.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.830
That's consistent with that
small elasticity.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.280
Because that's a huge delta
P, percent delta P. So,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.130
basically, that's comes to the
question about local versus

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.500
global elasticities.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.060
So it's not saying that
prices don't matter.

00:45:14.060 --> 00:45:18.270
But it's not a very, very
elastically demanded good.

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:19.710
So that's how they measure
that price of

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:20.960
elasticity of demand.

00:45:22.990 --> 00:45:27.620
That experiment, which was run
over 35 years ago now, that

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.930
result drives much of what
we do in health policy.

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:34.370
So a lot of the estimates that
we saw for the recently passed

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:37.490
health reform bill
derived from how

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.080
do we get that estimate.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.650
We'll have to figure out how
people are going to respond

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:42.250
with their medical care when we
give them health insurance.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.260
The recently passed health care
bill just gave 32 million

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.420
people health insurance.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.170
Well, how are they going
to respond to

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:50.660
having health insurance?

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.450
We go back to the RAND estimates
and say, well, we

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:53.510
have this elasticity
of demand.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:54.480
We know what we're doing
to the price.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.840
We figure out how much medical
care is going to go up.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:00.370
But here's the other thing.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:01.420
Here's the question in
the lecture that

00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:02.640
that we'll close with.

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.030
Is that a good thing or a bad
thing that medical care fell

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:07.570
when the price went up?

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.990
And how would we tell
whether it's a good

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:11.210
thing or a bad thing?

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.810
So we know when we raise
the price, people use

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:13.960
less medical care.

00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:16.920
How can we tell if that's a
good thing or a bad thing?

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.890
In the same experiment,
how could we tell?

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.370
What could we do?

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:21.100
Yeah.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:23.590
AUDIENCE: Maybe you'll get
death rates or like--

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.190
PROFESSOR: You look
at their health.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.965
You say, look, the
same trial can

00:46:27.965 --> 00:46:29.210
answer a different question.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:30.790
We know that when you charge
someone for health

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:31.620
care, they use less.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.345
Well, are they sicker?

00:46:33.345 --> 00:46:36.340
The answer, not at all.

00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:40.450
People use less health
and were no sicker.

00:46:40.450 --> 00:46:41.200
Why?

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:45.250
Because we waste a huge amount
of health care in the US.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:46.710
A huge amount of health
care is wasted.

00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:50.190
So, in fact, we could cut back
quite a lot on health care,

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:51.500
and we'd be no sicker.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:53.160
And that's what the RAND
experiment showed, that we can

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.080
charge people to use
medical providers.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:58.820
And they'll use less medical
care, and they won't be sicker

00:46:58.820 --> 00:46:59.580
as a result.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.520
Which suggests that, actually,
as we try to think about

00:47:01.520 --> 00:47:03.770
getting our health care costs
under control in America,

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:06.570
making people pay something to
go to the doctor is not a

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:07.930
crazy thing to be
thinking about.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:08.425
How much?

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:11.220
Well that depends on efficiency
versus equity.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:14.860
We can't make someone who has no
income pay $1,000 to go to

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:15.650
the doctor.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.590
That, clearly, is a mistake.

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:20.840
But we can take a rich guy like
me and make me pay $50 to

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.840
go to the doctor.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:25.260
There's no reason
not to do that.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.140
So, basically, that's a lesson
of how you can use elasticity

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.960
of demand to help inform
the kind of

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.340
policies we need to make.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.830
OK, let me stop there.

00:47:32.830 --> 00:47:35.600
By the way, if you at all find
this stuff interesting, and

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.930
you haven't yet read
Freakonomics--

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.740
how many of you have
read Freakonomics?

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:39.980
That's amazing.

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:40.370
OK.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.670
If you haven't read
Freakonomics, you should.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:42.450
It's a great book.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.600
If you're lazy, the movie
is coming out.

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.230
And Freakonomics the movie
is premiering on

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:50.090
Friday the 30th at LSC.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.200
So if you're interested in
learning more about empirical

00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.860
tools in economics, you can
watch Freakonomics the movie

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.880
on Friday the 30th.

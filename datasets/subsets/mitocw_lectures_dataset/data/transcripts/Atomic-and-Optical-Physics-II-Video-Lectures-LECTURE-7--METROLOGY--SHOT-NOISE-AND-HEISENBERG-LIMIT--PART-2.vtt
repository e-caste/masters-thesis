00:00:25.197 --> 00:00:26.280
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.420
So it has been a little
bit more than a week

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.750
when we met the last time.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.540
Before I continue our
discussion of metrology

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.390
and interferometry.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.480
I just want to share
something I saw on my visit

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090
to the Netherlands.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.830
When I visited the University of
Delft and the Kavli Institute,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.840
they had just accomplished the
entanglement of two NV centers.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.340
And we had just talked in
class about the entanglement

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.990
of two ions.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.000
So I'm sort of
excited to show you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.910
that people have just
taken the next step.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.830
And what often the
next step means

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.780
is that in atomic physics, we
use pristine systems-- ions,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.960
neutral atoms in
[INAUDIBLE] vacuum chamber.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.160
And we create new
forms of entanglement.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.060
Or with quantum gases, new
forms of quantum matter.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.090
But ultimately, we hope that
those concepts, those methods,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.507
and this knowledge
translates to some room

00:01:35.507 --> 00:01:41.930
temperature materials or
solid state materials which

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.180
can be handled more
easily, and are therefore

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.530
much closer to applications.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.720
So NV centers are kind of
nature's natural ion trap,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.850
or nature's natural
neutral atom trap.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.870
Let's not discuss whether
this is neutral or ionized.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.540
It's a vacancy in nitrogen.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.990
And it has a spectrum
which looks like an atom.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.880
So you can say once you have
such a defect in nitrogen,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.410
you have an atom, a single
atom in an atom trap

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.920
or an ion in an ion trap.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.770
And you don't have
to create the vacuum.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.660
It's there.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.890
Every time you look
at it, it's there.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800
And you can excite
it with the laser.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.305
It has a spectrum
similar to atoms.

00:02:24.305 --> 00:02:28.770
It has spin
structure So you have

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.350
these vacancies in diamond.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.980
So these are little
quantum dots.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.960
But now you have two problems.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.960
One is you want to collect
the light emitted by them.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.930
And what is best is to mill a
lens right into the material.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.525
So this is the diamond material.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:52.880
A lens is milled.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.160
And that already gives
some [? culmination ?]

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.360
of the light emitted by it.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.020
But the bit problem
until recently

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.600
has been when you create
those some people call it

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.140
artificial atoms.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.970
Every atom is a
little bit different,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.220
because it experience a
slightly different environment.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.350
A crystal has strain, so if you
have seemingly two identical

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:22.760
defects in a diamond
crystal, the two defects

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.750
will have a
resonance line, which

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.810
is a few gigahertz difference.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.060
You would say, well, maybe
it's just [? apart ?] in 10

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.780
to the 5, but it means the
photons are distinguishable.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.970
So if you want to do
entanglement by having two such

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.240
artificial atoms emitting a
photon onto a beam splitter,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.020
and then by performing
a measurement we project

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.180
the atoms into Bell state-- I
hope you all remember what we

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.770
discussed for the trapped ions--
then you have to make sure that

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.930
fundamentally, those photons
cannot be distinguished.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.490
And the trick here is that
they put on some electrodes.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:05.550
And by adding an
electric field, they

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.790
can change the
relative frequency.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.300
And therefore, within
the frequency uncertainty

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.680
given by Heisenberg's
Uncertainty Relation,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.034
they can make the two
photons identical.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.985
And when, let's say, experiment.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:34.470
Well, you have two NV
centers, defects in diamond.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.190
You can manipulate with
microwaves coherently the spin.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.670
You need lasers for
initialization and readout.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.330
But then closer to what
we want to discuss,

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.370
you need laser beams which
excite the NV center.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.510
And then the two NV
centers emit photons.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.620
And what you see now is exactly
what we discussed schematically

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.500
and in context of the ions,
that the two NV centers now

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.100
emit photons.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.120
And by using polarization
tricks and the beam splitter,

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.120
you do a measurement
after the beam splitter.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.420
And based on the outcome
of the measurement,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.290
you have successfully
projected the two NV centers

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.560
into a [INAUDIBLE] state.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.320
OK, good.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.700
All right.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:11.240
Let me just summarize what our
current discussion is about.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.660
This section is called
Quantum Metrology.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.690
It is a section where we want
to apply the concepts we have

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.300
learned to precision
measurements.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.080
It's actually a chapter
which I find nice.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.640
We're not really
introducing new concepts.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.270
We're using concepts
previously introduced.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.490
And now you see how
powerful those concepts

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:36.790
are, what they can be used for.

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.600
So we want to
discuss the precision

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.050
we can obtain in
quantum measurement.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.490
We apply it here to an
atom in the interferometer,

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.900
to an optical interferometer.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.190
We could also
discuss the precision

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.920
of spectroscopic measurements.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.280
A lot of precision measurements
have many things in common.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.960
So what we discuss here
is as a generic example

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.710
for precision measurement
that we send light

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.580
from our center interferometer.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.760
Here is a phase shift.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.120
And the question is,
how accurately can we

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:15.442
measure the phase shift when
we use n photons as a resource?

00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:16.900
And of course, you
are all familiar

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.600
with the fundamental limit of
standard measurements, which

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.180
is short noise.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.430
And sort of as a warm up in
our last class Wednesday,

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:39.280
week ago, I showed you that when
we use coherent states of light

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.350
at the input of
the interferometer,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:45.080
we obtain the short noise.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.130
Well, it may not be surprising,
because coherent light

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:53.900
is as close as possible, has
similar to classical light.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.270
But then we discussed single
mode, single photon input.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:06.240
And by using the formalism
of the Mach-Zehnder

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.190
interferometer, we've found that
the phase uncertainty is again

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.920
1 over square root n.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.080
So then the question is, how can
we go to the Heisenberg limit,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.120
where we have an uncertainty
in the phase of 1 over n?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.910
And just as a reminder,
I find it very helpful.

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:35.230
I told you that you can always
envision if you have n photons

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:39.840
and you multiply it, put
the n photons together

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.669
by multiplying the
frequency by n,

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.960
then you have one photon
which [INAUDIBLE] with n times

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.390
the frequency.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.550
And it's clear if you
do a measurement at n

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:52.100
times the frequency,
your precision in phase

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.700
is n times better.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.970
So what we have to do is
we have to sort of put

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.130
the n photons together.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.150
And then we can get a precision
of the measurement, which

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:06.680
is not square root n,
but n times better.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.460
So this is what we
want to continue today.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.330
This is the outline I gave
you in the last class.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.620
If you have this
optical interferometer,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.520
this Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.050
And if you use coherent
sets or single photons

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.020
as the input state, we
obtain the short noise.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.150
Now we have to change something.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:31.570
And we can change
the input state,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.410
we can change the beam splitter,
or we can change the readout.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.780
So we have to change something
where we entangle the n

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:44.190
photons, make sure in some sense
they act as one giant photons,

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.800
with either n times
the frequency,

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:53.010
but definitely with n times
the sensitivity to phase shift.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:54.050
Any questions?

00:09:58.661 --> 00:09:59.160
Good.

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:04.040
The first example, which
we pretty much covered

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.740
in the last class, was an
entangled state interferometer.

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.100
So instead of having the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:16.760
as we had before, we have
sort of a Bell state creation

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.700
device.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.860
Then we provide the phase shift.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.610
And then we have a
Bell analysis device.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:30.590
And I want to use here the
formalism and the symbols

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.770
we had introduced earlier.

00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:40.090
So just as a reminder, what
we need is I need two gates.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:46.860
One is the Hadamard gate,
which in matrix representation

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.620
has this matrix form.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:53.590
And that means if you have
a qubit which is either up

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.840
or down and you apply
the matrix to it,

00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.890
you put it in a superposition
state of up and down.

00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:01.050
It's a single qubit rotation.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:03.720
You can say for the bloch
on the Bloch sphere,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.850
it's a 90 degree rotation.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.290
The second gate we need
is the controlled NOT.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:18.700
And the controlled NOT
we discussed previously

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:23.850
can be implemented by
having an interferometer

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:31.160
and using a non-linear Kerr
medium coupling another photon

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.510
to the interferometer
in such a way

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.710
that if you have a
photon in mode C,

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.280
it creates a phase shift
with the interferometer.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.190
If there is no
photon in mode C, it

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:44.350
does not create an
additional phase shift.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.940
And as we have
discussed, this can

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.695
implement the controlled NOT.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.220
So these are the ingredients.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:57.460
And at the end of
the last class,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:03.450
I just showed you what those
quantum gates can do for us.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:08.390
If you have two qubits at
the input, we apply the--

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:11.980
and I will assume they
are both in logical 0--

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.390
the Hadamard gate makes
the coherent superposition.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.490
And then, we have
a controlled NOT

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.900
where this is the target gate.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:25.960
Well, if this is 0, if
the control beat is 0,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.990
the target beat stays 0.

00:12:27.990 --> 00:12:29.960
So we get 0, 0.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.550
If the control beat is 1, the
target beat is flipped to 1.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.600
So we get 1, 1.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.250
So the result is
that we have now

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:41.060
created a state 0, 0 plus 1, 1.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.760
And if we apply a phase shift
to all the photons coming out

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:50.050
on the right hand side, we get
a phase shift which is too fine.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:51.720
So we already get the idea.

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.850
If we take advantage
of a state 1, 1,

00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.880
it has twice the [? face ?]
sensitivity as a single photon.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.360
And we may therefore
get the full benefit

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:04.580
of the factor of 2, and
not just square root 2.

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.330
And this is what this
discussion is about.

00:13:08.947 --> 00:13:09.446
Questions?

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:14.595
OK, so that's where we ended.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:26.650
We can now use
another controlled NOT

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.255
and bring in the third qubit.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.240
So what we create here.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:50.200
Just make a reference, this
is where we start today.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:59.900
So we create here the state,
which is either all beats

00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:13.260
are 0, all beats are 1, and
then the phase shift gives us

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:17.280
three times the phase shift phi.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:23.010
And therefore, by bringing
in more and more qubits,

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:25.770
I've shown you n equals
1, n equals 2, n equals 3.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:27.650
So now you can go to n.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:34.740
We obtain states which have n
times the phase sensitivity.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:50.800
Let me just mention in
passing that for n equals 3,

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:58.000
the superposition of 0, 0, 0
and 1, 1, 1 goes by the name

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.710
not gigahertz, GHZ.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:02.210
Greenberger.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:07.180
This third one is Zeilinger.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.220
The second one is--

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:08.887
AUDIENCE: Horne.

00:15:08.887 --> 00:15:09.594
PROFESSOR: Horne.

00:15:09.594 --> 00:15:10.260
Thank you.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.460
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
state.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.600
And those states play
an important role

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.120
in test of Bell's inequality.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:30.400
Or more generally, states which
are macroscopically distinct

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.270
are also regarded cat states
or Schrodinger cat states.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:48.170
If we apply a phase
shift and go now

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.920
through the
entangler in reverse,

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:55.770
just a reverse sequence of
CNOT gates and Hadamard gates,

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:03.010
then we have all
the other n minus,

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:04.960
have the n minus 1 qubits.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.460
All the qubits except
for the first reset to 0.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.680
But the first qubit is now
in a superposition state

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.850
where we have the
phase into the power n.

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:22.460
And now, we can
make a measurement.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:27.110
And P is now the probability
to find a single photon

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:29.150
in the first qubit.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.790
So in other words,
our measurement

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.895
is exactly the same
as we had before where

00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:36.230
we had the normal
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.080
We put in one photon at a time.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.940
And we determined
the probability.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:46.150
What is the photon at one of the
outputs of the interferometer?

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:49.620
But the only
difference is that we

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:54.820
have now a factor of n in the
exponent for the phase shift.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:00.340
And I want to show you what
is caused by this factor of n.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.810
Let me first remind
you how we analyzed

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:11.950
the sensitivity of
an interferometer

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.349
for single photon input before.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:19.630
So for a moment,
set n equals 1 now.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:23.010
Then you get what we
discussed two weeks ago.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.349
The probability is [INAUDIBLE]
as an interferometer.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:31.320
Sine also, cosine also
infringes with cosine phi.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:34.140
If you do measurements
with a probability P,

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.115
that's a binomial distribution.

00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:38.700
Then the deviation
or the square root

00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:41.890
of the variance in the binomial
distribution is P times 1

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:49.300
minus P. And by inserting p
here, we get sine phi over 2.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:54.250
The derivative of P, which
is our signal, with a phase

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.300
is given by that.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.590
And then just using
error propagation,

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.200
the uncertainty in the
phase is the uncertainty

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.670
in P divided by dp dt.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.280
So then we repeat the
whole experiment n times,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.350
and if your binomial
distribution and we

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:19.520
do m [INAUDIBLE] of our
[INAUDIBLE] with probability P,

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.630
we get an m under
the square root.

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:24.040
And then we get 1
over square root m.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.354
And this was what I
showed you two weeks ago,

00:18:26.354 --> 00:18:27.645
the standard short noise limit.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:35.590
But now we have this
additional factor of n

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:46.270
here, which means that
our probability has

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:51.600
a cosine which goes with n phi.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.920
When we take the derivative,
we get a factor of n here.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.990
And then dp d phi
has the derivative.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:05.570
But then we have to
use a chain rule, which

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:08.360
has another factor of n.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.220
And therefore, we obtain now
that the phase sensitivity

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.805
goes as 1 over n.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:21.320
And therefore, we reach
the Heisenberg limit.

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:26.400
So if you have now your n
photon entangler, the one I

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.930
just-- the entanglement
operation with these n cubits

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.760
is special beam spreader
replaced by the entangler,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.681
we have now a sensitivity,
which goes 1 over n.

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:42.180
And then of course,
if you want, you

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:44.100
can repeat the
experiment n times.

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.950
And whenever you
repeat an experiment,

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.254
you gain an addition with
the square root of m.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.400
Just give me one second.

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.185
We have this.

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:17.470
OK, so this is an example where
we had n qubits entangled,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.570
like here.

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:22.720
And the sensitivity of
this interferometer scales

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.070
now as the Heisenberg
limit with 1 over n.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:36.669
OK, I want to give you,
because they're all nice

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:38.460
and they're all special,
I want to give you

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:41.840
three more example how you can
reach the Heisenberg limit.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:52.300
The next one goes by the name
super beam splitter method.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.230
It's actually a very
fancy beam splitter

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:59.680
where you have two prods
of your beam splitter.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.160
One has 0 and one has n photons.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.190
And behind the beam splitter,
you have two options.

00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:09.950
Either all the n photons
are in one state,

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.970
or the n photons are
in the other state.

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.900
You never have
any other mixture.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.990
Of course, you know your
standard half silvered

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:24.440
mirror will not do that for
you, because it will split the n

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.650
photon state with some
Poissonian statistics

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.290
or whatnot into the
two arms and such.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:32.410
And you can calculate
exactly what a normal beam

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:33.450
splitter does to that.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.040
It's very, very different.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.152
This here is a very, very
special beam splitter.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.070
Just to demystify this
beam splitter a little bit,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:56.660
I want to show you that, at
least conceptually, there

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:00.550
is an easy implementation
with atoms.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.500
I really like in this section
to grab an example from atoms

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.720
and to grab an example for
photons, because it really

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.090
brings out that the
language may develop equally

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.360
applies to atoms and photon.

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:14.980
So if I take now
an easy example,

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.790
if I take an example of the
Bose-Einstein condensate with n

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.740
atoms, let's assume
we have a double well.

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:24.950
But now we have
attractive interactions.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.050
This is not your standard BEC.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.130
Your standard
Bose-Einstein condensate

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:36.840
has repulsive interaction,
with attractive interaction.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.740
If you go beyond a certain
size, certain a atom number,

00:22:40.740 --> 00:22:42.350
the condensate will collapse.

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.190
So let's assume we have a
Bose-Einstein condensate with n

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:45.900
atoms.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.940
There are some
attractive interactions,

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.090
but we stay within
the stability diagram

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:57.115
that those atoms do not-- that
those atoms do not collapse.

00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:03.900
So now, if the atoms
are attractive,

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.280
they all want to be together.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.700
Because then they lower
the energy of each other.

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:10.940
So if you have something
with attractive interaction,

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:13.210
you want to have
n atoms together.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:21.390
But if your double
well potential

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:28.990
is absolutely symmetric,
there is no symmetry breaking,

00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:32.480
and you have an equal
amplitude for all the atoms

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.703
to be in the other well.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:46.020
So therefore, under the
very idealized situation

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.410
I described here,
you will actually

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.990
create a superposition
state of n atoms

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.770
in one well with n
atoms in the other well.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:57.790
And this is exactly
what we tried

00:23:57.790 --> 00:23:59.690
to accomplish with
this beam splitter.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:17.690
OK, so if we have this
special beam splitter, which

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:21.070
creates that state,
then when we add a phase

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.680
shift to one arm of
the interferometer,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:31.860
we obtain-- which looks very
promising-- a phase shift

00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.800
phi multiplied by n.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:57.050
And if we read it
out, we have now

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:04.850
if you pass it through the
other super beam splitter,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:10.460
we create again a
superposition of n0 and 0n.

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:18.520
But now, because
of the phase shift

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.280
with cosine and sine factors,
which involve n times

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.150
the phase shift.

00:25:30.020 --> 00:25:33.080
For obvious reasons,
those states

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.420
also go by the name noon states.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.940
That's the name which everybody
uses for those states,

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:44.410
because if you just read
n00n, it gives noon.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:48.440
So this is the
famous noon state.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:51.880
So it seems it smells
already, right,

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:55.040
because it has a
phase shift of n phi.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:26:00.720
Let me just convince you
that this is indeed the case.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:11.680
So the probability
of reading out

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:15.730
0 photons in one arm
of the interferometer

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:19.440
scales now with
the cosine square.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:27.810
If you do one
single measurement,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:40.860
the binomial
distribution is the same

00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.170
as before, but
with a factor of n.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:54.520
The derivative has
those factors of n.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:27:06.970
And that means that the variance
in the phase measurement

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.080
is now 1 over n.

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.950
If you want a reference,
I put it down here.

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:20.260
As far as I know,
the experiment has

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.680
been done with three
photons, but not

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.840
with larger photon number.

00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:33.302
Questions?

00:27:33.302 --> 00:27:34.298
Collin.

00:27:34.298 --> 00:27:36.788
AUDIENCE: This picture
with the double well,

00:27:36.788 --> 00:27:41.072
isn't there going to be-- all
right, some people would say

00:27:41.072 --> 00:27:44.447
you spontaneously break the
symmetry and [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:44.447 --> 00:27:48.848
either ends up in one
side or the other.

00:27:48.848 --> 00:27:50.315
Like isn't this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.940
PROFESSOR: Well,
Bose-Einstein condensation

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:59.270
with attractive interactions
was observed in 1995.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.300
And now, 18 years later, nobody
has done this seemingly simple

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.570
experiment.

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:08.710
And what happens
is really that you

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.900
have to be very,
very careful against

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.210
any experimental imperfection.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.900
If the two double well
potentials are not

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.740
exactly identical,
the bosons always

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.300
want to go to the
lowest quantum state.

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.020
Well, that's their
job, so to speak.

00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:24.370
That's their job description.

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:26.540
And if you have a
minuscule difference

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.590
between the two, the
dates of the two wells,

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:32.250
you will not get a
superposition state.

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:34.480
You will simply
populate one state.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.739
And how to make it
experimentally [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:36.739 --> 00:28:38.030
this is a really big challenge.

00:28:40.626 --> 00:28:41.125
[? Tino ?].

00:28:41.125 --> 00:28:42.740
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.190
Let's say we're somehow
able to make the double well

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.660
potential perfect.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.110
But if we didn't have
attractive interactions,

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.720
then wouldn't he just
get a big product state

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.310
of each atom being
in either well?

00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:00.414
PROFESSOR: OK, if you're
a non-interacting system,

00:29:00.414 --> 00:29:02.205
the ground state of a
double well potential

00:29:02.205 --> 00:29:06.990
is just your metric state 1
plus 2 over square root 2.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.920
And for non-interactive
BEC, you figure out

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.900
what is the ground
state for one particle

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.770
and then take it to the power n.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.106
This is the non-interactive BEC.

00:29:15.106 --> 00:29:17.605
STUDENT: So then entanglement
is because of the interaction,

00:29:17.605 --> 00:29:18.490
right?

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.590
PROFESSOR: If you have
strong repulsive interaction,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.620
you have something
which should remind you

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:25.900
of the [INAUDIBLE] insulator.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:27.110
You have n atoms.

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:30.310
And n over 2 atoms go
to one well. n over 2 go

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:31.840
to the other well.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.850
Because any form of number
fluctuations would be costly.

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:38.400
It will cost you additional
repulsive interaction.

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:40.460
So therefore, the
condensate wants

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.640
to break up into
two equal parts.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.260
So that's actually
a way how you would

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.650
create another non-classical
state, the dual flux

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.690
state of n over 2,
n over 2 particle.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:58.140
And for attractive
interactions, well you

00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.540
should create the known state.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.340
OK, so this was now
a state n0 and 0n.

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:16.410
There is another
state, which you

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.530
have encountered
in your homework.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:25.350
And this is a superposition
not of n0 and 0n and n0.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:30.670
It's a superposition of n
minus 1n and n n minus 1.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.660
This state goes by the person
I think who invented it,

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.560
the [? Yerkey ?] state.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:41.190
And you showed in your homework
that with that, you also

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.260
reach Heisenberg Limited
Interferometry, where

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:49.150
the phase scales is 1 over n.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:53.820
What I want to add
here to it is how

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.560
one can create such
a [? Yerkey ?] state.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:59.960
And again, I want
to use the example

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.800
with an atomic
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.135
And here's the reference where
this was very nicely discussed.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:16.420
So let's assume we can create
two Bose-Einstein condensates.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.300
And they have exactly n atoms.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.330
And I would actually refer
to [? Tino's ?] questions how

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:30.050
to make them have
two n atoms in a trap

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.310
and then make a
double well potential,

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:35.250
deform the harmonic oscillator
potential to a double well

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:36.260
potential.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:40.060
Then for strong
repulsive interactions,

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:41.760
the condensate
will symmetrically

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.580
split into two flux states,
each of which has n atoms.

00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.830
So now how can we create the
[? Yerkey ?] state from that?

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:56.910
Well, we simply have--
we leak out atoms.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.980
We leak atoms out of the trap.

00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:03.640
My group demonstrated an RF
beam splitter, how you can just

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:08.070
split in very
controlled way start

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:11.810
rotating the cloud
on non-trapped state.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:14.970
And then atoms slowly leak out.

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:17.240
Well, when you can
measure, of course,

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.470
you can take an atom
detector and measure

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.640
that an atom has
been out-coupled,

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:26.065
that an atom has
leaked out of the trap.

00:32:26.065 --> 00:32:28.220
If you don't like
RF rotation, you

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:31.810
can also think that there
is a tunneling barrier,

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:35.240
and atoms slowly leak out
by whatever mechanism.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.290
And the moment you
detect that an atom,

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:42.275
you then project the state in
the trap to n minus 1 atom,

00:32:42.275 --> 00:32:45.030
because you've measured
that one atom has come out.

00:32:45.030 --> 00:32:47.415
But now you use a beam splitter.

00:32:47.415 --> 00:32:51.610
And a beam splitter could
simply be a focused laser beam.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:54.030
And the atoms have
a 50% probability

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.860
of being reflected or
end up tunneling through.

00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:01.250
So therefore, if you
have now a detector

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:03.430
which measures the
atoms on one side

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:08.470
and the atoms on the
other side, then you

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:14.020
don't know anymore when the
detector makes click form which

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.710
atom trap the atom came.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.260
Or more formally,
a beam splitter

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.340
transforms the two input modes
ab into a plus b and a minus b

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:27.790
normalized by square root 2.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:32.840
So therefore, if
this detector clicks,

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:40.120
when you project the remaining
atoms into the symmetric state,

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:44.840
here you detect one atom
in the mode a plus b.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:49.220
And that means that
the remaining atoms

00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.930
have been projected into
the [? Yerkey ?] state.

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:54.070
If the lower atom
detector would click,

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:56.600
well, you get a minus sign here.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:00.540
So that's one way how at
least in a conceptually simple

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:05.120
situation, you can prepare
this highly non-classical state

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.910
by starting with
a dual flux state

00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:11.480
of Bose-Einstein
condensates, and then using--

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:16.050
and this is an ongoing theme
here-- by using a measurement,

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.060
and then the
post-measurement state is

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:21.469
the non-classical state
you wanted to prepare.

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.830
Question?

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:35.330
Yes.

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:37.274
AUDIENCE: How can you
ensure that only one

00:34:37.274 --> 00:34:42.620
atom leaves the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.650
PROFESSOR: The idea
is that we leak atoms

00:34:44.650 --> 00:34:46.870
out very, very slowly.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:48.989
And then we have
a detector, which

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:52.090
we assume has 100%
quantum efficiency.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.820
So therefore, we simply wait
until the detector tells us

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.060
that one atom has leaked out.

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.050
And in an idealized experiment,
we know the atoms either

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:03.791
have been measured
by the detector,

00:35:03.791 --> 00:35:05.040
or they are still in the trap.

00:35:07.781 --> 00:35:09.405
AUDIENCE: And also,
is there a property

00:35:09.405 --> 00:35:14.740
that holds the [INAUDIBLE]
you detect atoms [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.360
PROFESSOR: In principle
yes, but the idea here

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.490
is if you have a very
slow leakage process,

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.160
the probability that you detect
two atoms at the same time

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.250
is really zero.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.270
You leak them continuously
and slowly, but then

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:34.130
quantum mechanically, that
means for most of the time,

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:34.970
you measure nothing.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.530
That means the leakage
hasn't taken place.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.430
The quantum mechanical
system has not developed yet.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:42.940
But the moment you
perform a measurement,

00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:45.040
you project-- it's
really the same

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.680
if you say you have
n radioactive atoms.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.870
You have a detector.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.610
And when the
detector makes click,

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:54.540
you know you have n minus
1 radioactive atoms left.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.900
It's just applied here
to two atom types.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.852
Other questions?

00:35:58.852 --> 00:35:59.768
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:02.522 --> 00:36:03.900
PROFESSOR: No.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.000
And maybe I'll tell
you now why not.

00:36:10.825 --> 00:36:14.080
We have discussed
the noon state.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.620
And we have discussed here
a highly non-classical

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.970
superposition state.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.230
Let's just go back
to the noon state.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:28.060
We have n atoms here, zero here,
or n atoms, or the reverse.

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:32.970
But now, assume a single atom
is lost, is lost from your trap

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:35.230
by some background
gas collisions.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:39.880
And you have surrounded
the trap with a detector.

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.540
So if you have the noon state,
the symmetric superposition

00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:46.030
state, all atoms here
and all atoms there.

00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:49.135
But by your background process,
by an inelastic collision,

00:36:49.135 --> 00:36:50.680
you lose one atom.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:51.950
And you detect it.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.705
You could set up your
detectors that you

00:36:53.705 --> 00:36:57.520
know from which
that you figure out

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:59.900
from which trap was
the particle lost.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.000
So therefore, a
single particle lost

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.080
if you localize from which
trap the particle is lost

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:11.140
would immediately project
the noon state into a state

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.670
where you know I have n or
n minus 1 atoms in one well,

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:19.720
and 0 in the other well.

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.510
So I've already told
you, with the attenuator,

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.300
you can never assume
an attenuator is just

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.345
attenuating a beam.

00:37:27.345 --> 00:37:31.050
An attenuator can always
regard it as a beam splitter.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:34.420
And you can do measurements at
both arms of the beam splitter.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.360
Or you have to consider
the vacuum noise which

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.620
enters through the other
part of the beam splitter.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:44.580
And if you are now add that
those atoms, n atoms, in a trap

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.050
have some natural loss
by inelastic collision

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.670
or background gas
scattering, the loss

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:53.110
is actually like a beam
splitter that particles

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.280
don't stay in the trap, but
go out through the other part.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.070
And then you can measure it.

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:01.400
So in other words,
every loss process

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:03.836
should be regarded as
a possible measurement.

00:38:03.836 --> 00:38:05.210
And it doesn't
matter whether you

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:08.240
perform the measurement or not.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:11.470
And I think it's just obvious
that the noon state, the moment

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.920
one particle is lost and you
reduce this particle to figure

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:19.410
out if n particles are here
or n particles are there,

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:22.320
the whole superposition
state is lost if you just

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.210
lose one single atom out of n.

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:34.060
So the lifetime of a noon state
is then not your usual trap

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.120
lifetime, where you
lose half of the atoms,

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.660
1 over e of the atoms.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.280
It is n times faster because
it is the first atom lost,

00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:44.370
which is already
completely removing

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.034
the entanglement of your state.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:39:00.450
So more quantitatively, to
say it more specifically,

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:04.180
the limitation is loss.

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:09.970
When you have a fully entangled
state, maximally entangled

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.230
state, usually a
loss of one particle

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:17.850
immediately removes
the entanglement.

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:22.260
We had the situa-- no,
that's not a good example.

00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:26.060
But for the most
entangled state,

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.840
usually-- and for
the noon state,

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.820
it's trivial to see-- a
single particle lost allows

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.560
you to measure on which side
of the potential barrier

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.700
all the atoms are,
and all the beauty

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.207
of the non-classical
state is lost.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:44.910
So if you assume that
in a time window,

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:47.360
you have an infinitesimal
loss, a loss

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:51.010
of epsilon, what
usually happens is

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:53.730
if you have an entanglement
of n particles,

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.330
then you lose your entanglement.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:58.820
If you expand 1
minus epsilon to n,

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:02.470
it becomes 1 minus
n times epsilon.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:06.340
So that's one reason why
people have not scaled up

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.160
those schemes to a
large number of photons,

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.010
or a large number of atoms.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:14.060
Because the larger n
is, the more sensitive

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.930
you are to even very,
very small losses.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:29.540
Questions?

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:31.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:32.275
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:32.275 --> 00:40:33.608
AUDIENCE: Or is that physically?

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:38.910
PROFESSOR: The
super beam splitter

00:40:38.910 --> 00:40:42.580
would create the noon state.

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.700
I've not explained to
you what it physically

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:46.810
would be for photons,
but I gave you

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:50.870
the example for atoms
to BECs in a double well

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:53.540
potential with
attractive interaction.

00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:55.740
So to start with
the condensate in--

00:40:59.090 --> 00:41:00.840
AUDIENCE: Start with
a bigger [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.200
PROFESSOR: If you start with
a double well potential,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.780
and you put in n
atoms initially in,

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:10.030
but then you switch
on tunnel coupling,

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:12.970
then you would
create the noon state

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.040
if the interactions
are attractive,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:18.220
and if everything is idealized,
that you have a completely

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.650
symmetric double well potential.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:31.336
OK, the last example is the
squeeze light Interferometer.

00:41:31.336 --> 00:41:33.250
I just want to
mention it briefly,

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.880
because we've talked so
much about squeezed light.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.200
So now I want to show you
that squeezed light can also

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:46.400
be used to realize Heisenberg
Limited Interferometery.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:57.520
So the idea is, when we plot
the electric field versus time,

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.400
and if you do squeezing
in one quadrature,

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:07.670
then for certain times,
the electric field

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.770
has lower noise
and higher noise.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.130
We discussed that.

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:15.090
And the idea is that if there is
no noise at the zero crossing,

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:19.280
that this means we can determine
the zero crossing of the light,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.095
and therefore the phase
shift with higher accuracy.

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:36.120
You may also argue if you
have this quasi-probabilities,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:45.260
and with squeezing, we have
squeezed the coherent light

00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.010
into an ellipse.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:43:01.070
And things propagate
with e to the i omega t.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:07.000
Then you can determine
a phase shift,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.370
which is sort of an angular
sector in this diagram,

00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:13.040
with higher precision
if you have squeezed

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.890
this circle into an
ellipse like that.

00:43:16.890 --> 00:43:17.950
So that's the idea.

00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:24.780
And well, it's fairly clear that
squeezing, if done correctly,

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.860
can provide a better
phase measurement.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:31.280
And what I want to show
you here in a few minutes

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:36.040
is how you can think about it.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:40.500
So we have discussed at length
the optical Interferometer,

00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.440
where we have just a
coherence state at the input.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.360
This is your standard
laser Interferometer.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.880
But of course, very importantly,
the second input port

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:53.120
has the vacuum state.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.540
And we discussed the
importance of that.

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:57.920
So the one difference
we want to do now

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:02.990
is that we replace the
vacuum at the second input

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:06.540
by the squeezed
vacuum where r is

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:09.200
the parameter of
the squeezed vacuum.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:14.660
OK, so that's pretty
much what we do.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.610
We take this state, we
plug it into our equation,

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.340
we use exactly
the same formalism

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.010
we have used for
coherence states.

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:22.980
And the question,
what is the result?

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:29.150
Well, the result will be that
the squeezing factor appears.

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:38.560
Just as a reminder,
for our Interferometer,

00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:43.200
we derived the sensitivity
of the Interferometer.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:45.500
We had the quantities x and y.

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:51.430
And the noise is delta in this
y operator squared divided by x.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:55.240
This was the result when we
operate the Interferometer

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.050
at the phase shift
of 90 degrees.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:44:58.850
Just a reminder.

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:00.010
That's what we have done.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:01.720
That's how we
analyze the situation

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.795
with a coherent state.

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:17.270
The signal x is
now-- the signal x

00:45:17.270 --> 00:45:22.475
is the number
measurement a dagger a.

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:33.325
And we have now the input
of the coherent state.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.962
And b dagger b.

00:45:38.962 --> 00:45:41.340
We have an input
mode a and a mode b.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.480
They get split.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.370
And then we measure
it at the output.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.550
And we can now at the
output have photons--

00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:50.340
a dagger a, which come
from the coherent state,

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:54.900
and b dagger b, which come
from the squeeze vacuum.

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.410
So this is now using the
beam splitter formalism

00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:05.590
applied to the Interferometer.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.640
So this is now the
result we obtain.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:12.410
And in the strong local
oscillator approximation,

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:16.790
it is only the first
part which contributes.

00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:20.550
And this is simply the number
or photons in the coherent beam.

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:28.990
The expectation value
of y is 0, because it

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:32.680
involves a b and
b dagger operator.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:40.310
And the squeezed
vacuum has only,

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:43.400
if you write it down, in the
n basis, in the flux basis,

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:44.920
has only even n.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.000
So if you change
n by one, you lose

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.910
overlap with the
squeezed vacuum.

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:52.480
So therefore, this
expectation value is 0.

00:46:52.480 --> 00:47:05.840
For the operator y squared,
you take this and square it.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:09.660
And you get many, many terms,
which I don't want to discuss.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.740
I use the strong
local oscillator.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:14.970
Limited a dagger and
a can be replaced

00:47:14.970 --> 00:47:18.660
by the eigenvalue alpha
of the coherent state.

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:22.910
So therefore, I factor
out alpha squared

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:29.570
in the strong local
oscillator limit.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:35.515
And then what is left is
b plus b dagger squared.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:44.900
And since we have
squeezed the vacuum,

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:49.280
this gives us a factor
into the minus r.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:58.200
So if we put all those
results together,

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:05.060
we find that the phase
uncertainty is now

00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:07.820
what we obtained when
we had a coherent state

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.030
with the ordinary vacuum.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:12.460
And in the strong
local oscillator limit,

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.050
the only difference
to the ordinary vacuum

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:21.600
is that in this term, we've
got the exponential factor e

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:25.780
to the minus r.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:27.770
And since we have
taken a square root,

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:31.340
it's e to the minus r over 2.

00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:38.750
So that result would
actually suggest

00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:47.730
that the more we squeeze,
that delta phi should go to 0.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:50.430
So it seems even better
than the Heisenberg limit.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:59.460
However-- well, this is
too good to be true--

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.310
what I've neglected here
is just the following.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.660
When you squeeze more
and more, the more you

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.920
squeeze the vacuum,
the more photons

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:12.250
are in the squeezed vacuum,
because this ellipse stitches

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.880
further and further out and
has overlap with flux states

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:18.230
at higher and higher
photon number.

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:24.670
So therefore, when you go to
the limit of infinite squeezing,

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.530
you squeeze out
of the limit where

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.480
you can regard the local
oscillator as strong,

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.530
because the squeezed
vacuum has more photons

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:32.980
than your local oscillator.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:36.820
And then you have to
consider additional terms.

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:39.070
So let me just write that down.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:52.620
However, the squeezed vacuum has
non-zero average photon number.

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.670
And the photon number
of the squeezed vacuum

00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:06.880
is, of course, apply b dagger
b to the squeezed vacuum.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.730
This gives us a sinc function.

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:14.480
And we can call this
the number of photons

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.515
in the squeezed vacuum.

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:26.880
So we have to consider now
this contribution to y square.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.770
So we have to
consider the quadrator

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.620
of the ellipse, the long
part of the ellipse,

00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:42.390
the non-squeezed
quadrator component.

00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:52.910
And we have to
consider that when

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:57.010
we calculate the expectation
value of y square.

00:50:57.010 --> 00:51:00.270
And then we find
additional terms,

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:02.800
which I don't want
to derive here.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.886
And the question is then, if
you squeeze too much, you lose.

00:51:06.886 --> 00:51:08.635
So there's an optimal
amount of squeezing.

00:51:13.220 --> 00:51:19.290
And for this optimal
amount of squeezing,

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:25.670
the phase uncertainty
becomes approximately one

00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:28.610
over the number of photons
in the coherent state,

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:31.880
plus the number of photons
in your squeeze vacuum.

00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:35.345
So this is, again, very close
to the Heisenberg limit.

00:51:43.810 --> 00:51:46.560
So the situation
with squeezed light

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.830
is less elegant, because
if you squeeze too much,

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:52.510
you have to consider
additional terms.

00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:55.190
This is why I gave you the
example of the squeezed light

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.690
and the squeezed
vacuum as the last.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:52:00.080
But again, the Heisenberg
limit is very fundamental

00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.190
as we discussed.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:03.710
And for an optimum
arrangement of the squeezing,

00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:06.830
you can also use a
squeezed vacuum input

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:09.890
to the Interferometer to
realize the Heisenberg limit.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.823
Any questions?

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.710
Why is squeezing important?

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:29.350
Well, squeezing caught the
attention of the physics

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:32.840
community when it was
suggested in connection

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:35.080
with gravitational--
with the detection

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.810
of gravitational waves.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.620
As you know, the
laser Interferometer,

00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:44.630
the most advanced one is
LIGO, has a monumental task

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:47.290
in detecting a
very small signal.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:54.230
And pretty much everything which
precision metrology can provide

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.870
is being implemented
for that purpose.

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:00.230
So you can see, this is
like precision measurement.

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:02.120
Like maybe the trip
to the moon was

00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:10.290
for aviation in
several decades ago.

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:13.690
So everything is really--
a lot of things pushing

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:15.430
the frontier of
precision measurement

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:19.290
is motivated by the precision
needed for gravitational wave

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.070
detection.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:27.110
And what I want to show
you here is a diagram

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:29.240
for what is called
advanced LIGO.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:31.470
LIGO is currently
operating, but there

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.500
is an upgrade to LIGO
called advanced LIGO.

00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:36.860
And what you
recognize here is we

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:44.010
have a laser which goes into
a Michelson Interferometer.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.640
And this is how you want to
detect gravitational waves.

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.030
But now you realize
that the addition here

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:52.430
is a squeezed source.

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:55.191
And what you are
squeezing is not,

00:53:55.191 --> 00:53:56.690
while it should be
clear to you now,

00:53:56.690 --> 00:53:58.680
we're not squeezing
the laser beam.

00:53:58.680 --> 00:54:01.470
This would be much, much harder,
because many, many photons are

00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:02.700
involved.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:10.360
But it is sufficient to
squeeze the vacuum and couple

00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:14.420
in squeezed vacuum into your
cavitational wave detector.

00:54:25.890 --> 00:54:29.300
If you wonder, it's a
little bit more complicated

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.820
because people want to
recycle light and have

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:35.650
put in other bells and whistles.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:38.590
But in essence, a
squeezed vacuum source

00:54:38.590 --> 00:54:41.950
is a major addition
to advanced LIGO.

00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:42.758
Yes.

00:54:42.758 --> 00:54:44.382
AUDIENCE: Where is
the squeeze actually

00:54:44.382 --> 00:54:45.830
coming into the system?

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:48.370
I see where it's drawn,
but where is it actually

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.064
entering the interferometer?

00:54:50.064 --> 00:54:54.420
At that first beam splitter?

00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:59.739
We have to now-- there are
more things added here.

00:54:59.739 --> 00:55:02.030
Ideally, you would think you
have a beam splitter here,

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:04.380
the laser comes in
here, and you simply

00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:06.550
want to enter the
squeezed vacuum here.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:08.270
And this is how we
have explained it.

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.660
We have one beam splitter
in our Interferometer.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.630
There is an input
port and an open port.

00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:16.480
But what is important
here is also

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:22.900
that the measurement--
here you have

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:27.040
a detector for reading
out the Interferometer.

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:31.260
And what is important
is that the phase

00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.750
is balanced close to the point
where no light is coming out.

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:39.090
So you're measuring the
zero crossing of a fringe.

00:55:39.090 --> 00:55:41.180
But that would mean
most of the light

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:43.150
would then exit
the Interferometer

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:44.920
at the other port.

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:49.650
But high power lasers are
very important for keeping

00:55:49.650 --> 00:55:51.995
the classical short noise down.

00:55:51.995 --> 00:55:54.740
So you want to work with
the highest power possible.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:57.760
And therefore, you can't
allow the light to exit.

00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.040
You want to recycle it.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:01.450
You want to use
enhancement cavities.

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:05.020
And what I can tell you is that
this set up here integrates,

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:08.440
I think, the signal
recycling, the measurement

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:09.790
at the zero fringe.

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:12.000
And you see that kind
of those different parts

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.320
are copied in a
way which I didn't

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.090
prepare to explain it to you.

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:19.660
All I wanted you to
do is pretty much

00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:23.410
recognize that a squeeze
light generator is important.

00:56:23.410 --> 00:56:25.660
And this enters
the interferometer

00:56:25.660 --> 00:56:27.130
as a squeezed vacuum.

00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:35.860
What I find very
interesting, and this

00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.640
is what I want to
discuss now is,

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:42.120
that when you have an
interferometer like LIGO,

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.080
cavitational wave
interferometer,

00:56:45.080 --> 00:56:48.380
and now you want to squeeze.

00:56:48.380 --> 00:56:50.150
Does it really help to squeeze?

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:51.960
Does it always help to squeeze?

00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:54.780
Or what is the situation?

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.750
And this is what I want
to discuss with you.

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:11.440
So let's forget about signal
recycling and enhancement

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.160
cavities and things like this.

00:57:13.160 --> 00:57:17.690
Let's just discuss the basic
cavitation wave detector, where

00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:20.440
we have an input,
we have the two arms

00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.480
of the Michelson interferometer.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:27.160
And to have more
sensitivity, the light

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:30.310
bounces back and forth
in an enhancement cavity.

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:33.100
You can say if the light bounces
back and forth 100 times,

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:35.390
it is as if you had
an arm length which

00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:37.830
is 100 times larger.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.010
And now we put in
squeezed vacuum

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.540
at the open part of
the interferometer.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.945
And here we have
our photo-diodes

00:57:45.945 --> 00:57:47.070
to perform the measurement.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:58:00.710
So the goal is to measure
a small length scale.

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:03.680
If a cavitation wave comes
by, cavitational waves

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.410
have quadrupolar character.

00:58:05.410 --> 00:58:07.970
So the metric will
be such that there's

00:58:07.970 --> 00:58:11.070
a quadrupolar perturbation
in the metric of space.

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:16.090
And that means that, in
essence, one of the mirrors

00:58:16.090 --> 00:58:17.560
is slightly moving out.

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.910
The other mirror is
slightly moving in.

00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:22.680
So therefore, the interferometer
needs a very, very high

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.080
sensitivity to displacement
of one of the mirrors

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.380
by an amount delta z.

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:33.650
And if you normalize
delta z to the arm length,

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:36.790
or the arm length times
the number of bounces,

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:41.020
the task is to
measure sensitivity

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.315
in a length displacement
of 10 to the minus 21.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.320
That's one of the
smallest numbers

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.220
which have ever been measured.

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:54.680
And therefore, it is clear
that this interferometer

00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:57.886
should operate as close
as possible to the quantum

00:58:57.886 --> 00:58:58.760
limit of measurement.

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:06.880
So what you want to measure here
is, with the highest accuracy

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:12.420
possible, the displacement
of an object delta z.

00:59:15.090 --> 00:59:21.050
However, your object fulfills
and uncertainty relationship,

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:24.580
that if you want to measure
the position very accurately,

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:31.020
you also have to consider that
it has a momentum uncertainty.

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:34.020
And this fulfills Heisenberg's
uncertainty relation.

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:37.460
You will say, well, why should
I care about the momentum

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.740
uncertainty if all I want
to measure is the position.

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:46.850
Well, you should care
because momentum uncertainty

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:50.630
after a time tau turns
into position uncertainty,

00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:53.950
because position uncertainty
is uncertainty in velocity.

00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:56.120
And if I multiply
it by the time tau

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:58.420
it takes you to perform
the measurement,

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:00.890
you have now an
uncertainty in position,

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.215
which comes from the original
uncertainty in momentum.

01:00:08.090 --> 01:00:13.040
So if I use the expression
for Heisenberg's Uncertainty

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:17.130
Relation, I find this.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:24.170
And now, what we
have to minimize

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:28.350
to get the highest precision
is the total uncertainty

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:34.850
in position, which is
the original uncertainty,

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:37.694
plus the uncertainty due
to the motion of the mirror

01:00:37.694 --> 01:00:38.985
during the measurement process.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:45.270
So what we have here
is we have delta z.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:48.320
We have a contribution which
scores as 1 over delta z.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:53.850
And by just finding out what is
the optimum choice of delta z,

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.940
you find the result above.

01:00:56.940 --> 01:01:01.050
Or if you want to say you
want that this delta z tau is

01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:05.460
comparable to delta z, just
set this equal to delta z,

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:12.510
solve for delta z, and
you find the quantum limit

01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:19.560
for the interferometer,
which is given up there.

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.640
So this has nothing
to do with squeezing.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:25.340
And you cannot improve on this
quantum limit by squeezing.

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.200
This is what you got.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.610
It only depends on the
duration of the measurement.

01:01:32.610 --> 01:01:35.696
And it depends on the
mass of the mirror.

01:01:41.410 --> 01:01:53.860
Now-- just get my
notes ready-- there

01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.880
is a very influential
and seminal paper

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:00.400
by Caves-- the reference
is given here--

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.000
which was really
laying out the concepts

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.910
and the theory for quantum
limited measurements with such

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:10.220
an interferometer, and
the use of squeezed light.

01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:15.420
Let me just summarize the
most important findings.

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:20.150
So this paper explains that
you have two contributions

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:27.760
to the noise, which
depend on the laser

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:30.030
power you use for
your measurement.

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:33.390
The first one is the
photon counting noise.

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:36.870
If you use more and
more laser power,

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.760
you have a better
and better signal,

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.420
and your short noise is reduced.

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:45.170
So therefore, you have a better
read out of the interferometer.

01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:46.970
And this is given here.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:51.240
Alpha is the eigenvalue
of the coherent state.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:54.810
But there is a second
aspect which you may not

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.560
have thought about it,
and this is the following.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.140
If you split a laser
beam into two parts,

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.060
you have fluctuations.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:09.350
The number of photons left
and right are not identical.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:11.420
You have a coherent
bean and you split it

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.450
into two coherent
beams, and then you

01:03:13.450 --> 01:03:16.060
have Poissonian
fluctuations on either side.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:19.820
But if you have now Poissonian
fluctuations in the photon

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:23.400
number, if those photons
are reflected off a mirror,

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.510
they transfer photon
recoil to the mirror.

01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:32.860
And the mirror is pushed
by the radiation pressure.

01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.008
And it's pushed,
and it has-- there

01:03:35.008 --> 01:03:37.560
is a differential motion
of the two mirrors

01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:40.545
relative to each other due to
the fluctuations in the photon

01:03:40.545 --> 01:03:43.740
number in the two arms
of the interferometer.

01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:50.530
So therefore, what happens is
you have a delta z deviation

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:55.580
or variance in the measurement
of the mirror, which

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.930
comes from radiation pressure.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:01.970
It's a differential radiation
pressure between the two arms.

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:06.860
And what Caves
showed in this paper

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:10.520
is that the two effects
which contribute

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.580
to the precision
of the measurement

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:15.670
come from two different
quadrature component.

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:18.770
For the photon
counting, we always

01:04:18.770 --> 01:04:21.900
want to squeeze the
light in such a way

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.870
that we have the narrow
part of the ellipse

01:04:25.870 --> 01:04:31.880
in the quadrature component
of our coherent beam.

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:33.960
We've discussed
it several times.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.340
So therefore, you want to
squeeze it by e to the minus r.

01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:45.190
However, when what has a good
effect for the photon counting

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:47.092
has a bad effect
for the fluctuations

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:48.175
due to radiation pressure.

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:03.350
So therefore, what
happens is-- let's

01:05:03.350 --> 01:05:05.240
forget squeezing for a moment.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:10.440
If you have two contributions,
one goes to the noise,

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:13.890
one goes with alpha squared
of the number of photons.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:16.820
One goes inverse with the square
root of the number of photons.

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:20.390
You will find out that
even in the interferometer

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:23.490
without squeezing, there
is an optimum laser

01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:25.630
power, which you want to use.

01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:28.100
Because if you use
two lower power,

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.470
you lose in photon counting.

01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:31.570
If you use two higher
power, you lose

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:35.600
in the fluctuations of
the radiation pressure.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:43.610
So even without squeezing,
there is an optimum laser power.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:48.900
And for typical parameters,
so there is an optimum power.

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:52.020
And what we're
shown in this paper

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:56.620
is whenever you choose
the optimum power which

01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.810
keeps a balance between
photon counting and radiation

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:02.462
pressure, then you reach
the standard quantum

01:06:02.462 --> 01:06:03.670
limit of your interferometer.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.240
But it turns out that
for typical parameters,

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:13.580
this optimum is 8,000 watt.

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.960
So that's why
people at LIGO work

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:18.840
harder and harder to develop
more and more powerful

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.510
lasers, because more
laser power brings

01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:24.370
them closer and closer
to the optimum power.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:27.360
But once they had
the optimum power,

01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.730
additional squeezing
will not help them

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:33.430
because they are already at
the fundamental quantum limit.

01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:38.090
So the one thing which
squeezing does for you, it

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:42.420
changes the optimum
power in your input beam

01:06:42.420 --> 01:06:44.810
by a squeezing factor.

01:06:44.810 --> 01:06:47.320
So therefore, if you
have lasers which

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:51.220
have maybe 100 watt
and not 8,000 watt,

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:55.792
then squeezing helps you to
reach the fundamental quantum

01:06:55.792 --> 01:06:57.000
limit of your interferometer.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:10.680
So that's pretty
much all I wanted

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.320
to say about precision
measurements.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.520
I hope the last example--
it's too complex to go

01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:19.170
through the whole analysis--
but it gives you at least a

01:07:19.170 --> 01:07:22.740
feel that you have
to keep your eye

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:24.310
on both quadrature components.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:27.200
You can squeeze, you
can get an improvement,

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:30.440
in one physical
effect, but you have

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.020
to be careful to consider what
happens in the other quadrature

01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:34.724
component.

01:07:34.724 --> 01:07:37.140
And in the end, you have to
keep the two of them balanced.

01:07:42.430 --> 01:07:43.210
Any questions?

01:07:50.970 --> 01:07:51.470
Oops.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.100
OK.

01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:17.520
Well, we can get started with
a very short chapter, which

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:27.180
is about g2.

01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:31.410
The g2 measurement
for light and atoms.

01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:51.750
I don't think you will
find the discussion I

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:53.910
want to present to
you in any textbook.

01:08:53.910 --> 01:09:00.729
It is about whether g2 is 1 or
2, whether we have fluctuations

01:09:00.729 --> 01:09:01.899
or not.

01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:05.819
And the discussion will be
whether g2 of 2 and g2 of 1

01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:08.899
are quantum effect
or classical effects.

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:16.810
So I want to give you
here in this discussion

01:09:16.810 --> 01:09:21.920
four different derivations of
whether g2 is 1 or g2 is 2.

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.649
And they look very,
very different.

01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:25.370
Some are based on
classical physics.

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:28.420
Some are based on the
concept of interference.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:31.270
And some are based on the
quantum indistinguishability

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.270
of particles.

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:36.869
And once you see you all those
four different explanations,

01:09:36.869 --> 01:09:38.410
I think you'll see
the whole picture.

01:09:38.410 --> 01:09:41.680
And I hope you
understand something.

01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:45.430
So again, it's a long
story about factors of 2.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:49.020
But there are some factors of 2
which are purely calculational,

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.060
and there are other
factors of 2 which

01:09:51.060 --> 01:09:53.779
involve a hell of
a lot of physics.

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:56.740
I mean, there are people
who say the g2 factor of 2

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.210
is really the difference between
ordinary light and laser light.

01:10:00.210 --> 01:10:03.390
For light from a
light bulb, g2 is 2.

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:05.550
For light from a laser, g2 is 1.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:07.590
And this is the only
fundamental difference

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:09.410
between laser light
and ordinary light.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:12.460
So this factor of
2 is important.

01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:19.890
And I want to therefore have
this additional discussion

01:10:19.890 --> 01:10:20.745
of the g2 function.

01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:32.390
So let me remind
you that g2 of 0

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:45.900
is the normalized probability
to detect two photons or two

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:52.770
particles simultaneously.

01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:16.140
And so far, we have
discussed it for light.

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:21.205
And the result we obtained by
using our quantum formulation

01:11:21.205 --> 01:11:26.400
of light with creation
annihilation operator,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:31.480
we found that g2 is 0.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:36.810
In the situation that we had
black body radiation, which

01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:41.950
we can call thermal
light, it's sometimes

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:45.020
goes by the name chaotic light.

01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:47.190
Sometimes it's called
classical light,

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:50.350
but that may be a misnomer,
because I regard the laser

01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:52.930
beam as a very
classical form of light.

01:11:56.580 --> 01:11:59.340
This is sometimes
called bunching

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.270
because 2 is larger than 1.

01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:03.780
So pairs of photons
appear bunched up.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.310
You have a higher probability
than you would naively

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:12.270
expect of detecting two
photons simultaneously.

01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:19.670
And then we had the situation of
laser light and coherent light

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:24.240
where the g2 function was 1.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.660
And I want to shed some
light on those two cases.

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:35.640
We have discussed the extreme
case of a single photon

01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.430
where the probability
of detecting two photons

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.040
is 0 for trivial reasons.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:42.662
So you have a g2 function of 0.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.930
But this is not what I
want to discuss here.

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:51.570
I want to shed some
light on when do we

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:53.720
get a g2 function of 1.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:56.800
When do we get a
g2 function of 2.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:04.010
And one question
we want to address,

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:09.560
when we have a g2
function of 2, is

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:19.790
this a classical
or quantum effect?

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.010
Do you have an opinion?

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:32.133
Who thinks-- question.

01:13:32.133 --> 01:13:34.133
AUDIENCE: When we did the
homework problem where

01:13:34.133 --> 01:13:35.930
we had the linear's
position, like alpha

01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:38.870
minus alpha
[INAUDIBLE] plus alpha,

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:41.810
we found that one can
have a g2 greater than 1,

01:13:41.810 --> 01:13:43.770
and one can have
a g2 less than 1.

01:13:43.770 --> 01:13:46.710
So maybe g2 isn't a
great discriminator,

01:13:46.710 --> 01:13:49.160
whether it's very
quantum or very classic.

01:13:53.017 --> 01:13:54.725
PROFESSOR: Let's hold
this thought, yeah.

01:13:54.725 --> 01:13:55.830
You may be right.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.430
Let's come back to that.

01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:06.580
I think that's one opinion.

01:14:06.580 --> 01:14:09.700
The g2 function may
not be a discriminator,

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:14.070
because we can have g2 of 1
and g2 of 2 purely classical.

01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:18.350
But why classical light
behaves classically,

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:21.200
maybe that's what we
can understand there.

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.670
And maybe what I
want to tell you

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:27.490
is that a lot of classical
properties of classical light

01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:31.110
can be traced down to the
indistinguishability of bosons,

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:33.020
which are photons.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:35.610
So in other words, we
shouldn't be surprised

01:14:35.610 --> 01:14:38.340
that something which
seems purely classical

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.090
is deeply rooted
in quantum physics.

01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:44.290
But I'm ahead of my agenda.

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:46.390
So let me start now.

01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:48.510
I want to offer you
four different views.

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:05.034
And the first one is that
we have random intensity

01:15:05.034 --> 01:15:05.575
fluctuations.

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:09.960
Think of a classical
light source.

01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:20.450
And we assume that if
things are really random,

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:22.590
they are described by a
Gaussian distribution.

01:15:25.650 --> 01:15:28.930
And if you switch on
a light bulb, what

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:31.920
you get if you measure the
intensity when you measure what

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.290
is the probability that the
momentary intensity is I,

01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:40.240
well, you have to normalize
it to the average intensity.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:47.890
But what you get is pretty much
an exponential distribution.

01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:49.610
And this exponential
distribution

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:51.980
has a maximum at I equals 0.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.790
So the most probable
intensity of all intensities

01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:57.420
when you switch
on a light bulb is

01:15:57.420 --> 01:16:00.210
that you have 0 intensity
at a given moment.

01:16:00.210 --> 01:16:06.140
But the average
intensity is I average.

01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:12.550
So you can easily, for
such a distribution,

01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:14.350
for such an exponential
distribution,

01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:18.710
figure out what is the
average of I to the power n.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:22.000
It is related to I
average to the power n,

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:25.060
but it has an n factorial.

01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:28.730
And what is important is the
case for our discussion of n

01:16:28.730 --> 01:16:32.770
equals 2, where the
square of the intensity

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:36.850
averaged is two times the
average intensity squared.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:44.120
And classically, g2
is the probability

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.900
of detecting two
photons simultaneously,

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.990
which is proportional
to I square.

01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:51.230
We have to normalize it.

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:54.220
And we normalize it
by I average square.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:56.940
And this gives 2.

01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:01.910
So simply light with
Gaussian fluctuations

01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:06.630
would give rise to
a g2 function of 2.

01:17:06.630 --> 01:17:10.800
Since it's random fluctuations,
it's also called chaotic light.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.780
And the physical pictures
is the following.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:19.350
If you detect a photon,
the light is fluctuating.

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:22.440
But whenever you detect
the first photon,

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:25.440
it is more probable that you
detect take the first photon

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:28.490
when the intensity
happened to be high.

01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:30.760
And then since the
intensity is high,

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.720
the probability
for the next photon

01:17:32.720 --> 01:17:34.390
is higher than the
average probability.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:43.340
So therefore, you get
necessarily a g2 function of 2.

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:44.560
So this is the physics of it.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.040
So let me just write that down.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:18:07.800
The first photon is more
likely to be detected

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:19.400
when the intensity
fluctuation-- when

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:21.720
intensity fluctuations
give high intensity.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:29.330
And then we get this result.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.780
Yes.

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:48.350
Let us discuss a second
classical view, which

01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:50.690
I can call wave interference.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:18:59.610
This is really important.

01:18:59.610 --> 01:19:01.890
A lot of people get
confused about it.

01:19:01.890 --> 01:19:07.120
If you have light
in only one mode,

01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:10.550
this would be the
laser of, for atoms,

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:11.935
the Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:19.310
One mode means a single wave.

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:24.470
So if we have plain waves, we
can describe all the photons

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:26.350
or all the atoms by
this wave function.

01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:31.910
So what is the g2 function
for an object like this?

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.850
AUDIENCE: 1.

01:19:35.850 --> 01:19:39.920
PROFESSOR: Trivially
1, because if something

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:48.835
is a clean wave, a single
wave, all correlation functions

01:19:48.835 --> 01:19:49.335
factorize.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:00.140
You have the situation that
I to the power n average

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:03.230
is I average to the power n.

01:20:03.230 --> 01:20:08.570
And that means that
gn is 1 for all n.

01:20:13.670 --> 01:20:19.850
OK, but let's now
assume that we have two.

01:20:19.850 --> 01:20:23.000
We can also use more, but
I want to restrict to two.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.840
That we have only two modes.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:29.170
And two modes can interfere.

01:20:29.170 --> 01:20:35.550
So let me apply to those
two modes a simple model.

01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:39.650
And whether it's simple
or not is relative.

01:20:39.650 --> 01:20:42.070
So it goes like as follows.

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:49.990
If you have two modes,
both of Unity intensity,

01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:53.430
then the average intensity is 2.

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:09.430
But if you have interference,
then the normalized intensity

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:13.450
will vary between 0 and 4.

01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:16.040
Constructive interference
means you get twice as much

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:16.650
as average.

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:19.640
Destructive means
you get nothing.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:22.380
So therefore, the
[? nt ?] squared

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:30.300
will vary between 0 and 16.

01:21:30.300 --> 01:21:33.940
So if I just use the two
extremes, it works out well.

01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:36.830
You have an I
square, which is 8,

01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:39.110
the average of
constructive interference

01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:41.370
and destructive interference.

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:44.900
And this is two times
the average intensity,

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:48.220
which is 2 squared.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:52.400
So therefore, if you
simply allow fluctuations

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.860
due to the interference
of two modes,

01:21:54.860 --> 01:21:57.960
we find that the
g2 function is 2.

01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:13.280
So this demonstrates
that g2 of 2

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:18.875
has its deep origin
in wave interference.

01:22:27.890 --> 01:22:34.230
And indeed, if you take a
light bulb which emits photons,

01:22:34.230 --> 01:22:37.760
you have many, many atoms
in your tungsten filament

01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:40.620
which can emit, re-emit waves.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.760
And since they have
different positions,

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:46.790
the waves arrive at your
detector with random phases.

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:49.290
And if you really write
that down in a model--

01:22:49.290 --> 01:22:51.540
this is nicely done in
the book by Loudon--

01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:54.390
you realize that
random interference

01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:58.590
between waves results in
an exponential distribution

01:22:58.590 --> 01:23:00.600
of intensity.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:02.700
So most people wouldn't
make the connection.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.050
But there is a deep and
fundamental relationship

01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:11.270
between random interference and
the most random distribution,

01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.780
the exponential
distribution, intensity

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:18.700
which characterises thermal
light or chaotic light.

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.380
So let me just write that down.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:34.680
So the Gaussian intensity
distribution-- actually

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:39.350
it's an exponential
intensity distribution.

01:23:39.350 --> 01:23:41.290
But if you write the
intensity distribution

01:23:41.290 --> 01:23:43.280
as a distribution in
the electric field,

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.910
intensity becomes e square.

01:23:44.910 --> 01:23:46.850
Then it becomes a
Gaussian [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:50.650
So Gaussian or exponential
intensity distribution

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:57.130
in view number one is the
result, is indeed the result,

01:23:57.130 --> 01:23:59.055
of interference.

01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:05.110
Any questions?

01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:06.656
So these are the
two classical views.

01:24:06.656 --> 01:24:07.780
I think we should stop now.

01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:13.590
But on Wednesday, I will present
you alternative derivations,

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:18.690
which are completely
focused on quantum operators

01:24:18.690 --> 01:24:21.960
and quantum counting statistics.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:25.430
Just a reminder, we have
class today and Friday.

01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:28.390
And we have class
this week on Friday.

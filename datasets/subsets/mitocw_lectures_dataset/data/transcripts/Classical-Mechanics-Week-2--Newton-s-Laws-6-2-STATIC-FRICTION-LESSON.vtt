00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.480
We considered a case
where an object is moving

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.810
along the surface, but now
let's consider what happens,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.730
that if we apply a force here,
and the object stays at rest.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.580
Well, we still have
the normal force

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.300
distributed over the surface.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.990
But now because the
object is at rest,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.210
there is another kind
the contact force now

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.890
is what we call static friction,
the tangential part of that.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.470
And the contact force is
still the perpendicular part,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.520
the normal force, plus
the tangential part,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.250
which we refer to
as static friction.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.040
Now what happens
with static friction

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.280
is that if we don't apply
a force at all, then

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.550
there is no static friction.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.200
In fact, you can see
in this simulation,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.100
that if we slowly increase
the applied force,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.950
then the static friction
force gets bigger and bigger.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.069
It depends on what we're
doing to the system.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:09.850
But at a certain point, when we
apply a large enough external

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.920
force, the object
suddenly starts to slip.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.030
That's what we call the
just-slipping condition.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.240
And the reason for
that is static friction

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.110
has reached its
maximum possible value.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.990
That has to do with the
physics of the interaction

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.330
between the surface
and the object.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.320
So also, there's a
very subtle thing,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.500
is that as you see when we pull
the force and it just slips,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.130
suddenly the friction
has gone from static

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.690
to kinetic friction, and it's
gotten a little bit smaller.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.580
How do we express
those properties?

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.130
Well, what we have is the idea
that the static friction can

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:56.380
vary in magnitude between 0
and some type of maximum value,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.340
depending on the other
constraints on the system.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.090
And the maximum value
of static friction,

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.009
we have a force law,
which is that it's, again,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.720
proportional to
the normal force,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.340
but the coefficient is
called now the coefficient

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.130
of static friction.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.990
And this coefficient
of static friction

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.690
is slightly bigger
than the coefficient

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.620
of kinetic friction,
which explains

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.070
why that arrow got a little
bit smaller when it just

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.270
started to slip.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.310
Now again, like
kinetic friction,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.910
static friction is opposing
this external force.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.470
And depending on the direction
that the object moves,

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.870
for instance, if we
applied the external force

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.290
in the opposite direction,
here, then the static friction

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.240
that's distributed over the
surface is opposing that force.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.590
But there may be many systems
in which we're actually not

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.430
quite sure which way the
static friction points.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.940
And as the course
develops and we

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.770
look at more
complicated examples,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.010
we'll see that the
direction of static friction

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.742
can depend on all the other
constraints on the system.

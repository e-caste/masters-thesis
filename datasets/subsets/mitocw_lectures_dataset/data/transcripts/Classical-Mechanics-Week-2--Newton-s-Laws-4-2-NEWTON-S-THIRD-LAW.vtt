00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.820
Newton's third law states
that forces always come

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.650
in equal and opposite pairs.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.100
One way we can write that is
if you imagine two objects,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.790
object one and object two, the
force exerted by object one

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:24.000
on object two is equal and
opposite to the force exerted

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
by object two on object one.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.400
This makes explicit that
real forces always arise

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.090
from a physical interaction.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.390
For any force in a
problem, you should always

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.541
be able to identify the other
member of the interaction pair.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.660
Newton's third law
is the most subtle

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.690
and sometimes the most confusing
of his three laws of motion

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.050
so I'd like to do an
example that will help

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.850
clarify how to think about it.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.850
So I'm going to pick a
very extreme example.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.580
Let's imagine the collision
between a marble moving

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:08.670
this way and a train
moving that way.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910
And so we'll say that
the mass of the train--

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.270
I'll write that
as "m sub train"--

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.840
and the mass of the
marble is m sub marble.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.740
And obviously, the
mass of the train

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.450
is much larger-- I'm
going to write that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.980
as several greater-than
signs-- much, much larger

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.520
than the mass of the marble.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.009
And so the question I want to
consider is, at the instant

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.880
that these two objects collide,
which experiences the greater

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.410
force?

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.289
So think about that
yourself for a moment.

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.280
In terms of outcomes,
clearly, the marble

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.320
will be smashed by the train
whereas the train will not

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.560
be noticeably affected
by the marble.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.030
So your intuition
might therefore

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.539
suggest that it's the marble
that feels the greater force.

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.890
But that's incorrect because
Newton's third law tells us

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.430
that forces come in
equal and opposite pairs.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.020
And what that tells
us is that each object

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.490
will exert an equal
but oppositely directed

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.120
force on the other.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.170
Now I chose a very
extreme example

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.192
to capture your attention.

00:02:18.192 --> 00:02:20.180
But that might seem
like a surprising result

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.810
but Newton's third law tells us
that the forces on each object

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.210
are going to be
equal and opposite.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.900
But just because
the forces are equal

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.790
doesn't mean that the
motion will be equal.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.570
The accelerations
of the two objects

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.470
are vastly different because
of their different masses.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.079
And the accelerations
and the forces

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.850
are related by Newton's
second law, F equals m a.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.340
So if I write that in
terms of the acceleration,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.310
the acceleration of
the marble, "a marble,"

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.790
is equal to the force divided
by the mass of the marble

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.120
whereas the acceleration
of the train

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.950
is equal to-- so since I
wrote "F" for the force acting

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.540
on a marble, I'm going to write
minus F for the force acting

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.490
on the train.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:19.270
So that's minus F divided
by the mass of the train.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.660
And so if I want to look
at the ratio, how big is

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.970
the acceleration of
the marble divided

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.600
by the acceleration
of the train?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.620
And let's take the absolute
value so we're just

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.079
talking about magnitudes here.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:43.340
That's going to be equal to
the mass of the train divided

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.900
by the mass of the marble.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.480
But the mass of the
train is much, much,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.210
much larger than the
mass of the marble

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.000
so the right-hand side here
is a very, very big number.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.220
And that tells us that
relative to the acceleration

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.110
of the train, the
acceleration of the marble

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.710
is going to be enormous.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.670
Even though the force
experienced by each object

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.270
is identical, because of
their different masses,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.090
their accelerations
will be very different.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.548
So that gives us
an example of what

00:04:08.548 --> 00:04:13.640
we mean by Newton's third law,
in terms of the interaction

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.610
pair and equal and
opposite forces acting.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.500
I want to reiterate that
for any force in a problem,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.150
you should always be able
to identify the other member

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.200
of the interaction pair.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.220
So forces always come in pairs.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.690
It's important to keep in mind
that these force pairs don't

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.054
both act on the same object.

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:39.470
They never act on
the same object.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.330
The interaction
pair always involves

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.590
a pair of objects,
two different objects.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.650
And let me just make that
explicit with an example.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.900
The example I'll consider
is, imagine a person standing

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.738
on the ground.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.310
What are the forces
acting on this person?

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.940
I'll draw the force
diagram here, say.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.660
There's gravity,
mg, acting downwards

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.630
and there's a normal force
upward exerted by the ground.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.959
And those two balance to give
a net force of zero, which

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:20.750
is why the person is
standing on the ground

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.610
and not sinking down into
the ground, for example.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.900
Now, you might look at
gravity and the normal force

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.120
and wonder if those are
an interaction pair.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.330
And they're not because notice
that these two forces are both

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.550
acting on the same
object, the person.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.460
The interaction
pair always comes

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.790
from realizing what is exerting
the force on the object.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.320
So let's look at each
of these in turn.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.000
Gravity is exerted by the Earth.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.180
So if the Earth-- and this
means really the entire Earth--

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.480
exerts a force mg on the
person, Newton's third law

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.860
tells us that the person
exerts a gravitational force

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.800
on the entire Earth
of mg upwards.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.750
Now, that might seem
remarkable to you

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.210
if you're just standing
around on the floor

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.480
that you are exerting
a gravitational force

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.352
on the planet but you are.

00:06:14.352 --> 00:06:16.060
However, this is like
the example we just

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.200
talked about a moment ago.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.820
The masses are
extremely different

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.320
even though the
forces are the same.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.290
So the acceleration of the
Earth due to this person's mass

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.490
is negligible because
the Earth is so much more

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:28.740
massive than the person.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.680
But Newton's third law
tells us that there

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.290
is a tiny acceleration on
the Earth due to the person.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.970
That is the third
law pair for gravity.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.680
mg downward exerted by
the Earth on the person

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.680
is paired with mg upward on the
Earth exerted by the person.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.270
Now, for the normal force
acting on the person,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.620
that force is exerted
by the ground.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:56.030
So the ground exerts an
upward force N on the person.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.360
Newton's third law
tells us that that

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.130
means that the person must
exert a downward force

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.280
N on the ground.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.930
That is the interaction
pair for Newton's third law

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.950
for the normal force.

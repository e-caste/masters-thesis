00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.800
We are going to spend
the rest of this lecture

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.220
by looking into an interesting
subclass of Markov chains

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.190
for which steady-state
convergence exists--

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.250
the class of birth
and death processes.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.440
So what is a birth
and death process?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.300
It's a Markov
chain whose diagram

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.080
looks like this-- the
states of the Markov chain

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.860
start from zero and go to
some finite integer number m.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.370
And if you are at a typical
state in the middle, say i.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.470
Then next you will
either go to the right--

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.740
or up by one unit-- or
you will go to the left--

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.590
or down by one unit-- or
you will stay where you are.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.450
And this will happen with
the following transition

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.580
probabilities-- here p i--
i function of the state--

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.030
here q i.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.060
And this one the remaining
1 minus p i minus q i.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.350
So it's like keeping track
of some animal population.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.470
Animals get born.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.760
They die.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.410
The assumption here is
that at any point in time,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.380
either one animal gets born, or
one dies, or nothing happens.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.020
There are no multiple
deaths, no births

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.670
happening at the same time.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.500
There are many
practical applications

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.840
where this structure provides
a basic first-level model.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.200
An example of a
chain of this kind of

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.650
was the supermarket
counter example

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.620
that we discussed before,
where the states represented

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.630
the number of
customers in a queue.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.759
A customer arrives and the
queue increases by one.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.780
A customer leaves and the
queue decreases by one.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.810
Or nothing happens and
the queue stays as it is.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.180
Now, in this supermarket
example, the p's and the q's

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.140
were all taken to be the
same across the states.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.890
But we can generalize.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.500
For example, the
departure rate, q,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.590
could be different
from state to state.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.750
For example, with lots of
customers in the queue,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.810
perhaps the clerk
will work faster.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.530
Such a chain can also be used
to model the spread of disease

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.730
in a population.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.960
For example, the states could
represent the number of people

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200
in a given population
that have the flu.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.730
One more person gets the flu.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.670
The count goes up.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.590
One more person gets healed.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.510
The count goes down.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.750
These probabilities, in
such an epidemic model,

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.210
will certainly depend
on the current state.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.640
If lots of people
already have the flu,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.630
the probability that
another person catches it

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.650
would be pretty high.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.590
But if no one has the
flu, then the probability

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.910
that one gets a transition--
where someone catches the flu--

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.550
would be pretty small.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.360
The rate at which new people
get the disease definitely

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.980
depends on how many
people already have it.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.170
And that motivates cases
where those p's, here,

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.830
depend on the
state of the chain.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.600
There are lots of
other applications

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.490
for which these special
Markov chains are useful.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.310
So how do we study them?

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.230
Such a chain consists of a
single aperiodic recurrent

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.480
class, and so has a well-defined
steady-state behavior.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.600
To calculate the
steady-state probability

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.490
pi of i of a state i,
you can write the system

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.680
of m linear
equations in the pi's

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.340
that we had discussed before.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.250
But this may be cumbersome,
and in fact, more work than one

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.110
actually needs to do.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.350
There is a very
clever shortcut that

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.770
applies to birth
and death processes.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.240
And it's based on the
frequency interpretation

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.400
that we discussed
in a recent clip.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.020
To see this, let's
draw a line somewhere

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.340
in the middle of
this chain, and focus

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:59.480
on the transitions between this
left part and this right part.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.980
Assume that the line
cuts through the middle

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.190
of two adjacent states, i
and i plus one, like here.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.700
And so you zoom here
and this is the picture

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.210
of what you have here.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.790
So what is the
chain going to do?

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.519
Let's say it starts on the left.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.750
It's going to move around.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.150
And at some point, it makes a
transition to the other side,

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.350
going here.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.730
And that is a transition
from i to i plus 1.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.720
And now, once it's
on the right side,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.830
it's going to move
around as well.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.159
And then at one point, it will
come back to that part again.

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.880
And this is a transition
from i plus one to i,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.159
and so on and so forth.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:47.570
Now, there is a certain balance
that must be obeyed here.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.409
The number of upward transitions
through this line cannot be

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.340
very different from the number
of downward transitions from

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.200
this line.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.490
Because if we cross
this way, then

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.180
in order to cross
again this way,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.320
you will have first to
cross down the other way.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.300
You can not go up 100 times
here, in that direction,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.790
and go down here 50 times.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.570
If you have gone
up 100 times, it

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:28.260
means that you have gone down
99, 100 or 101, but nothing

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.850
different from that.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.680
So the long-term frequency with
which transitions of these kind

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.110
occur has to be the same
as the long-term frequency

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.200
that transitions
of that kind occur.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.820
Or, in this diagram, the
frequency of that kind

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.010
has to be the same as the
frequency of that kind.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.490
So what are these frequencies?

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.320
We discussed that before.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.600
The fraction of times at
which transitions of this kind

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.210
are observed is the
fraction of time

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.460
that we happen to be at that
state, which is pi of i.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.360
And out of the times that we
are in that state, the fraction

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:14.040
of time that transitions of
that time happen is p of i.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:20.420
So the overall frequency
will be pi i times p of i.

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.570
And with the same argument,
this is the frequency

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.290
with which transitions
of that kind

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:34.130
are observed-- pi i
plus 1 times q i plus 1.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.600
Since these two
frequencies are the same,

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:44.020
we get an equation that relates
pi of i to pi of i plus 1,

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.570
like this.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.159
So this is the frequency
that we observed here,

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:54.010
of this transition.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:58.340
And these are the frequencies
of these transitions.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.680
And they have to be equal.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:04.270
This has a nice form, because
it gives us a recursion.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:09.720
If we knew pi i, we can
calculate pi i plus 1 as such.

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.220
So it's a system
of equations that's

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.250
easier to solve than
the original system

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:31.310
of linear equations
which we presented before

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.140
for a general Markov chain.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.380
But how do we get started?

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:42.870
If we knew pi of 0, then we
could use it to find pi of 1.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:50.070
Then from pi of 1, you can
get pi of 2, pi of 3, etc.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.590
But we don't know pi of 0.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.620
It's one more unknown.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.710
It's an unknown and we
need to actually use

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.410
the extra normalization
conditions

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:09.100
that the sum of all the pi
j, has to be equal to 1.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.550
After we use that
normalization condition,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.791
then we can find all of the pi
by first solving for pi of 0.

00:08:15.791 --> 00:08:16.290
How?

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.860
This can be returned
pi 0 plus pi 1,

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:28.670
which is pi 0 times p0
over q1 plus pi of 2, which

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:36.200
is pi of 1 times p1 over
q2, pi of 0 times p0 times

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:47.030
p1 over q1 times q2, which is
pi 2, plus et cetera equals 1.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:49.890
This equation allows
us to find pi of 0.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.140
And then we use this recursion
to find pi of 1, pi of 2,

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.900
pi 3, et cetera.

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:10.040
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.480
PROFESSOR: Today we're going to
discuss bioenergetics, continue

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.020
that discussion and use
that as a transition

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.540
into also beginning to see how
that applies to understanding

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.620
glycolysis, the pathway that
allows glucose breakdown.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.980
So just as a reminder of
a couple of the points

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.100
that we discussed last
time, so last time

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.780
we discussed what makes
reactions favorable.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.430
And so remember, you could
have any reaction, A to B--

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.020
A to B could be a single step.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.050
A to B could be an
entire pathway, all steps

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.260
in the pathway, that
whether or not that reaction

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.380
or pathway happens is
determined by thermodynamics.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.130
It's not determined by enzymes.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.810
Enzymes are
important, of course,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.560
to control the rate
of reactions so they

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.440
may allow things to happen
that otherwise wouldn't happen.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.630
But whether the
reaction happens or not

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.310
is determined by free energy.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.370
And so free energy,
delta G, remember

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.770
we discussed is the
following relationship.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.460
So it's related to
this constant delta G0

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.740
prime, which is related
to the equilibrium

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.970
constant for any pair of
products and reactants

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.020
as well as this formula rt
times the log of the products

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.980
over the reactants.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.780
And so remember this means
that whether a reaction happens

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.030
depends on the
equilibrium constant,

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.510
but it also depends on the
actual conditions present.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.390
That is how much substrate
and how much product is there.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.400
And so what this means is that
biology can come up with ways

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.150
by keeping the product
concentrations low to do things

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.510
that may move in the opposite
direction of what you would

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.210
predict from equilibrium.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.410
And also by coupling these
less favorable reactions

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.700
to more favorable reactions,
you can also allow biology

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.410
to do unfavorable stuff.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.260
And this is, of course, where
the role of ATP comes in.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.180
And we discussed this at the
end of last time as well.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.860
Of course, what's important
then becomes the ratio of ATP

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.300
to ADP.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.340
And to illustrate that,
we use this example.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.160
We use the-- remember ATP
hydrolysis has a delta G0 prime

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.460
of minus 7.5 kcals per mole.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.048
That, of course,
tells you this is

00:02:30.048 --> 00:02:31.340
about the equilibrium constant.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.010
That tells us the equilibrium
lies to the right.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.400
We can couple it to this
first reaction in glycolysis,

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.880
which traps glucose in the cell
by adding a phosphate group.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.200
Delta G0 prime for this is
positive 3.3 kcals per mole.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.650
This positive number tells
you that the equilibrium

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.730
lies towards the left.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.300
But when we couple these
two reactions together,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.250
we add these two
numbers together,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.880
and now we get a delta G0 prime
of minus 4.2 kcals per mole,

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.580
which are the coupled reaction.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.220
The equilibrium lies
now again to the right.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.430
And that's how we can use
ATP hydrolysis in order

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.280
to carry out this
unfavorable process, trapping

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.060
the glucose in the cell.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.140
Now how much glucose
will be trapped?

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.945
Well, of course, that will come
from this reaction up here.

00:03:19.945 --> 00:03:21.320
And that's because
whether or not

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.970
a reaction occurs
or not of course

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.070
depends not on the
equilibrium constant

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.120
but on the actual conditions and
the delta G of that reaction.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.060
And so we can just plug
that in for this system.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.430
And so we see delta G0 prime
minus 4.2 kcals per mole.

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.230
That says equilibrium
lies to the right.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.110
But how far really
depends on the conditions.

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.500
And that's defined by this ratio
of products over reactants.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.070
And you can imagine that
this term here, as long

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:54.200
as it's less than 4.2, you
will favor glucose trapping

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.760
inside the cell,
whereas, of course,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.210
if it's greater than
4.2, then you'd favor--

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.080
the opposite direction
would be favorable.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.520
Now this is really critical
because this really

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.480
explains how it is
that ATP actually

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.760
works to help cells
do various reactions.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.070
And so if an ATP-ADP
ratio exists such

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.680
that it can make
delta G less than 0

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.750
for the reaction
that it's coupled to,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.320
that is how it provides
the energy that then allows

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.000
unfavorable reactions to occur.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.690
And so please do not
make the common mistake

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.855
that many, many biologists
make when they state,

00:04:38.855 --> 00:04:41.030
oh, ATP equals energy.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.350
There's a lot of ATP.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.960
The cell must have
a lot of energy.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.020
Remember it's the
ratio of ATP to ADP

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.680
that provides the energy.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.400
And so that means
ATP can be sky high,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.170
but if ADP is equally high,
there's no energy there.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.060
Consequently, ATP
can be very low.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.260
But if ADP is extremely
low, now you still

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.790
have a high ATP to ADP ratio.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.570
And that is what
provides the energy.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.570
And that's because this occurs
regardless of concentration.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:15.590
It's because it's this
ratio of ATP to ADP

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.120
that ultimately says how much
energy is there for the ATP

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.680
to drive a reaction.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.540
In other words, delta G,
or whatever the reaction

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.630
is coupled to, is going
to be proportional

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.280
to the ratio of ADP to ATP.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.690
Great.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.270
Now how much ATP
do you need then?

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.895
What ratio do you need
to drive a reaction?

00:05:40.895 --> 00:05:42.770
Well, it's hard to say
that in absolute terms

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.460
because it's going to be defined
by how that ratio is coupled

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.940
to the ratio of whatever
other reactants and products.

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.410
It also tells you, remember,
as we talked about before, we

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.690
can switch the directions
of these reactions

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.190
and we just flip the signs.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.280
The directions
here are arbitrary.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.170
And so that means
it also tells us

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.290
how much energy we need
to put in if we're going

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.590
to charge up an ATP-ADP ratio.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.470
In other words, if
we want to synthesize

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:17.930
ATP, that is take
ADP plus phosphate

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.300
and make an ATP,
well, what's this?

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.490
What we just-- the
exact opposite sign

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.830
of that delta G0 prime
is going to now equal

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:31.230
plus 7.5 kcals per mole.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:35.940
And so that means that the
equilibrium of this reaction

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.470
is going to lie to the left just
as that one lied to the right.

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.720
And it's going to lie to
the left by that much.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.990
And if we want to know
how much energy it then

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.410
takes to make ATP,
well, obviously, it's

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.390
not going to happen
because equilibrium

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:52.560
favors this direction.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.720
It's not spontaneous
in that direction.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.970
But at various
conditions, we can

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.030
know by plugging in our
formula delta G equals delta

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:09.305
G0 prime plus 7.5 kcals per mole
plus RT times the log of ATP.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.420
So if I have my ADP--

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.740
I'm sorry-- my ATP concentration
sufficiently low relative

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.410
to my ADP concentration,
I can still

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.720
make this reaction happen.

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.360
Now that's not going to give
you an ATP-ADP ratio that

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.360
is actually consistent with
being able to do anything

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.930
else into the cell.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.970
And so but what it says is that
if I am able to couple energy

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:48.320
from nutrient metabolism
to this reaction

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.750
and overcome this positive
7.5 kcals per mole,

00:07:53.750 --> 00:08:00.425
that basically will allow me to
now synthesize ATP and maintain

00:08:00.425 --> 00:08:06.170
an ATP-ADP ratio in the cell
that allows cells to carry out

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:08.030
other functions
by the same rules

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.920
that we talked about that
would be unfavorable.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.160
Now there's lots of implications
here for metabolism,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.270
because it says how much input
you need to synthesize ATP.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.210
How much energy you
need to synthesize ATP

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:26.420
is going to depend on how
charged this ratio is.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.810
And how useful that ratio is
to catalyze other reactions

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:35.539
is also going to depend on
how charged that ratio is.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:39.590
And in essence, this is why
we cannot store energy as ATP.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.409
This is why we didn't
eat ATP for breakfast

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:46.280
and instead ate cereal that
has a bunch of glucose in it,

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:50.420
because we can use that glucose
to get ATP but the ATP itself

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:53.660
is not something that we
really can burn to get energy

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:55.160
in a sustained way.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:02.180
In other words, the
delta G of ATP synthesis,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.840
making ATP is going
to be proportional

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.770
to the log of the ratio of ATP
over ADP for all the reasons

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.420
I described.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:19.280
The delta G of using
ATP, ATP hydrolysis,

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.940
using ATP to drive
reactions is also

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:28.010
proportional to RT times the
log, in this case, of the ADP

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.950
to ATP ratio.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:34.850
And so because you need to
consume this ratio to get

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:40.460
energy, and you need to put in
energy to create this ratio,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:45.110
you are constant-- and how much
is an exponential property--

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.200
you are constantly
having to generate

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.990
ATP in a way that
allows you to then

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:54.050
have a ratio that
can then be consumed

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.450
to fuel other reactions.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.380
And that's what's shown
here on the slide.

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:02.090
So I just graphed here
what the ATP-ADP ratio

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.940
is relative to a
theoretical delta

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.040
G that's shown here as a linear
scale, here on a log scale,

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.530
that basically there's this
logarithmic relationship

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.660
and so you need an exponential
increase in energy input

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:21.860
to drive this ratio up higher
in order to, quote unquote,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.190
"store" more energy that
can be used for later.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.720
And so this system is not one
that you can use as an energy

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.630
storage system and
ultimately explains

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.480
why cells have to do
constant metabolism,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.630
have to constantly do
some sort of metabolism

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.750
to keep this ATP-ADP
ratio charged

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.070
for it to be in a useful range
to have an ATP-ADP ratio that

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:48.830
can be coupled to
drive otherwise

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:52.640
unfavorable reactions
in our cells.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.440
So to say this
another way, our cells

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.400
need to constantly catabolize
nutrients, burn glucose,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.930
burn some other fuel.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:01.760
They have to do
this because they

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.000
have to keep that ratio
charged in a range

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.120
where that can then support
other cell functions,

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:15.160
allow them to fight entropy
and maintain order in biology.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.610
We alluded last time if
you stop making ATP, well,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.020
what's going to happen?

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.030
Well, that ATP-ADP
ratio the cell

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:24.960
has is going to fuel
whatever reactions it

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.480
can do until suddenly that ratio
falls below the point where

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.930
it's useful to drive those
unfavorable reactions.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.060
In fact, if you
stop ATP production,

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.840
you will consume that
ATP-ADP ratio in seconds.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.300
And this is why if you
poison ATP production,

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.340
cells die very quickly.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.430
Remember last time we mentioned
you have a heart attack,

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.200
blood flow stops
going to a tissue.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.380
No more nutrients and
oxygen. Cells die quickly.

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.750
Cyanide poisoning
does the same thing.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:55.690
Cells die quickly if
you stop their ability

00:11:55.690 --> 00:12:00.920
to maintain this ATP-ADP
ratio in the right range.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:03.910
And so remember
the concentration,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.030
the absolute concentration
of ATP for these reasons

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:09.980
is not a good indicator
of cell energy.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:12.430
The correct indicator
of cell energy

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.670
is the ratio of ATP to ADP.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:24.960
This term is sometimes referred
to as the energy charge.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.390
And so that can be
the ATP to ADP ratio,

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:37.530
or oftentimes more correctly
is the ATP to AMP ratio.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.260
Why the ATP to AMP ratio?

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.030
Well, that's because
once you understand this,

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:46.770
you can now understand that
cells have a failsafe mechanism

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.790
to protect themselves if
this ratio of ATP to ADP

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.770
becomes too low.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.150
What is that mechanism?

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.850
Well, you can carry
out this reaction.

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.120
Take two ATP molecules
and turn them

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:05.880
into transfer a phosphate
to make an ATP plus an AMP.

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.680
Why is that a
failsafe mechanism?

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.640
Well, if they care about
this, if the ATP-ADP ratio is

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.580
what maintains your
ability to drive

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.340
these thermodynamically
unfavorable reactions,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:21.090
if I sacrifice the
denominator by removing an ATP

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:24.750
and get an ATP out of it,
I've now at least temporarily

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.610
fixed that ratio.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:30.090
Now this is something that
obviously cannot go on forever.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.490
But in the short
term, it does allow

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.020
cells to protect that ratio.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:39.870
And in fact, what cells actually
defend is this ATP-AMP ratio.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:44.820
And it's very, very difficult
to change the ATP-AMP ratio

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.040
in a cell and
actually have it live.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.730
So it's really
this ATP-AMP ratio

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.880
that is most formally
related to what

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.740
would be called energy charge.

00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:00.840
But this is really why
this is important is

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.880
for all the reasons
that I just described.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:04.930
All right.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.840
So hopefully, it's
clear to you now

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:14.110
why cells have to keep ATP-ADP
ratio in the right range, why

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.570
this is useful for
them to now carry out

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:19.570
all of these unfavorable
reactions-- fight entropy,

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.590
stave off death.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.430
And they can even have a
failsafe here and sacrifice ADP

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:31.280
as a way to try to maintain
that as a very last resort.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.390
It also says why cells have
to always do catabolism,

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.090
because you always need
the energy input to keep

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:39.970
that ratio in the right range.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:43.330
However, you might imagine
that, in real life,

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:46.180
the messiness of
biology, that there's

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.850
lots of situations
where the demand for ATP

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.310
will suddenly increase.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.950
Well, of course, maybe you can
just metabolize more sugar,

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.760
do more nutrient catabolism to
try to keep that ratio high.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.480
But that takes time.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.610
And so you need ways for
cells to quickly respond

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.540
to then allow them to mobilize
all of this extra thing to--

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.760
extra fuel to do that.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.000
For example, we're walking
around our ancestors

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.120
on the plains somewhere
and a lion appears.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.020
We don't have time to
mobilize a bunch of new fuel.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.670
We have to be able to
run away really quickly

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.610
or the lion's going to eat us.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.670
And so cells have systems
to suddenly respond

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:33.050
to I need a lot more ATP demand
to run away by having ways

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:37.040
that one can buffer
this ATP-ADP ratio,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.940
protect it in the short
term, and allow cells time

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:45.360
to ramp up nutrient metabolism
in order to keep this high.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:45.860
All right.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.800
Well, if we wanted to
create such a buffer system,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.050
how would we actually do it?

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:52.820
Well, obviously,
we have to follow

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:56.360
all the rules of thermodynamics
that we discussed.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.970
And we have to do
so in a way that

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.550
actually illustrates
how it is that

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.620
very well how metabolism works.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.290
In other words, if
suddenly the ATP-ADP ratio

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:14.750
drops, if we have a sudden
drop in ATP-ADP ratio

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.400
because we have
increased demand,

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.070
needing to run away
from a lion, how

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.350
could we actually
create a buffer system

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.210
that protects this?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:28.010
Well, to do it, we would
need to couple ATP-ADP

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.920
to some other product
reactant pair,

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:37.850
let's call them x and y,
such that the ratio of y to x

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:44.180
is coupled to the
ratio of ATP to ADP.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:46.670
And you want it
coupled in such a way

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:51.560
that if that ratio goes down,
this ratio can now protect ATP,

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:55.730
basically favor ATP
to ADP synthesis.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:57.920
However, when
nutrients are plentiful

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.830
and this ratio is really
high, it then in turn

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:05.180
can charge up this ratio so
that it can buffer it later

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:09.210
when the ATP-ADP
ratio starts to fall.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:12.300
Now the most famous
example of this

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.400
actually comes from
muscle physiology.

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.599
And it's best described
in terms of muscles

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:21.270
and how they quickly
respond to increased demand,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.460
like that running
away from a lion.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.670
However, it in fact applies
to many, many cells,

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.410
including most non-muscle
cells in animals.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:32.790
All right.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.040
And I should say
that it turns out

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.520
that if you turn off ATP
synthesis in a muscle,

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.970
people have estimated that
your ATP-ADP ratio will fall

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:46.230
into a range where it is no
longer useful to do anything

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:50.820
within a matter of seconds, some
claim even less than a second.

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:54.580
And so this system ends
up being very important.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.300
Now the system that muscle
uses, and many other cells

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:06.170
do as well, is something called
the creatine/creatine phosphate

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.550
system.

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:10.790
Now if you guys are
weightlifters or bodybuilders

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:13.460
out there, you probably
have heard of creatinine

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.710
because it's a very
popular supplement that

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.160
is taken for weightlifting,
something I obviously

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.720
don't do a lot of.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.120
But that creatine/creatine
phosphate is out there.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:30.410
I'll describe to you what it
actually does for muscle cells.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.470
And you can decide for
yourself if this is actually

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:39.050
useful as a energy or
weightlifting supplement.

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:41.300
So what is
creatine/creatine phosphate?

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.600
What does it look like?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.410
Well, it's basically
looks like this.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.090
By the way, I will use
this abbreviation often

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.310
throughout this course,
just a shorthand

00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:58.360
to draw a lot of
these structures.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.850
So this here would be
a carboxylic acid group

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:08.550
drawn like this or like that,
drawn to the carboxylic acid

00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:12.510
group just so you
understand my shorthand.

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.920
OK.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:34.610
So this here is the
molecule creatine.

00:19:34.610 --> 00:19:42.410
If I put a phosphate here, this
now becomes creatine phosphate.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.350
Again, just to remind you,
this P with a circle over it

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.860
is a phosphate group.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.160
I'll draw this particular
phosphate group

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.770
because it's a
nitrogen-phosphate bond,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:55.560
a phosphoramidate bond.

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:59.160
This is actually a bond that is
more labile than the PO bonds

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.250
that we're used to seeing in
the phosphodiesters like ATP,

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.170
et cetera.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:04.800
All right.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.920
So that's creatine and
creatine phosphate.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:18.910
And if we draw out the
reaction, creatine phosphate

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:26.680
goes to creatine plus inorganic
phosphate, so hydrolysis

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.330
of creatine phosphate.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:36.427
This has a delta G0 prime
of minus 10 kcals per mole.

00:20:36.427 --> 00:20:37.260
What does that mean?

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:38.983
It's negative.

00:20:38.983 --> 00:20:40.650
Tells us about the
equilibrium constant.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:43.020
Equilibrium lies to the right.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:48.591
Remember ATP to ADP
hydrolysis shown over there,

00:20:48.591 --> 00:20:51.090
that hydrolysis has
a delta G0 prime

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.760
of minus 7.5 kcals per mole.

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.980
Equilibrium also
lies to the right.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.570
This number is more negative.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:59.970
This equilibrium lies
further to the right

00:20:59.970 --> 00:21:03.120
than ATP hydrolysis does.

00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:06.810
So now what happens if
we couple this reaction

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.040
to the ATP hydrolysis reaction?

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:16.260
So now we can do ATP
plus creatine goes

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:23.510
to creatine phosphate plus ADP.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.640
So we've coupled those
two reactions together.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.240
So delta G0 prime, ATP
to ADP is minus 7.5.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.580
Creatine phosphate
to creatine in

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:37.730
that direction is negative 10.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:41.480
In this direction, it
would be positive 10.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.640
And so as I've
drawn the reaction,

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:49.700
this delta G0 prime will
be plus 2.5 kcals per mole.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:56.590
10 minus 7.5 plus 2.5,
which tells us then

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:01.960
that this equilibrium
now lies to the left.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.880
However, which direction
this reaction actually goes

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.120
is not determined only
by the equilibrium.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:14.210
It's really determined by delta
G. So we can calculate that.

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:20.800
So delta G equals
delta G0 prime plus RT

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:37.340
log of, as we've drawn
it, creatine phosphate

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.690
over creatine and ADP over ATP.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.920
So you can now imagine
that this term here

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.460
is the sum of those two.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.450
So it's plus 2.5.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:59.370
And so if this term is less
than 2.5, what does that mean?

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:00.680
Well, if it's--

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.310
I'm sorry.

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:06.290
Less than negative 2.5, then
delta G will be negative

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:09.890
and you will favor creatine
phosphate production.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.420
If this term is greater
than negative 2.5,

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.030
then delta G will
be positive and you

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:20.360
will favor ATP production.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:22.020
Why is that important?

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.950
Well, if you think
about the conditions,

00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:28.190
how you could make
this term less than 2.5

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:32.600
or less than negative 2.5 or
greater than negative 2.5,

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.130
basically, what's
going to happen

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:42.620
is that if the
ATP-ADP ratio is high,

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.710
lots of energy around,
no problems charging up,

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:49.520
lots of things to use, charge
up this ATP/ADP to a very

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.480
high ratio, well, now you
will favor this direction,

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.880
creatine phosphate synthesis.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:03.380
However, if ATP/ADP begins
to fall and is lower,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.340
well, now this term
is going to flip

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.970
and you'll now favor
ATP production.

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:15.380
And so basically, by charging
up this creatine/creatine

00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:18.410
phosphate ratio, it
now creates a situation

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.910
where it can buffer that ATP/ADP
ratio so that when times are

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:24.680
good, you charge up the buffer.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:27.560
When times are bad, you
then consume the buffer

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.520
in a way that allows you
to protect your ATP/ADP

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.330
ratio for a short time.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.210
And this is illustrated
very nicely here

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.330
in this slide that
basically shows what

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.020
happens in muscle physiology.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:42.500
And so this is just
a theoretical curve

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:45.830
that if you suddenly need
to contract your muscle

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:50.090
and you stop ATP production,
well, ATP levels will fall.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:54.350
That ATP/ADP ratio more
correctly will fall rapidly

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:55.820
within the cell.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:59.030
Creatine phosphate
will then now kick in

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:03.620
to protect that ATP/ADP
ratio as you can ramp up

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:07.250
either anaerobic or aerobic
metabolism to now buffer

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:13.450
that ATP/ADP ratio and keep
that muscle functioning.

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:17.680
Now I want to make one point
because oftentimes biochemistry

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.280
textbooks will refer
to things like ATP

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.140
or creatine phosphate
as, quote unquote,

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:26.860
"high energy compounds."

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:28.810
And of course, I guess
they are high energy

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.780
because they have these
labile phosphate-nitrogen

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:35.690
or phosphate-oxygen bonds.

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.320
And because they're labile,
hydrolysis is favorable.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.560
And to a certain extent,
it's that hydrolysis

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.710
that is providing energy.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.810
But remember it's
not the metabolite

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:50.650
or the bond in isolation that's
really providing the energy.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:56.380
It's these ratios of ATP to ADP,
creatine phosphate to creatine,

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.200
that allow you to couple,
for all the reasons

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.750
we've spent now a lecture
and a half discussing,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:08.380
two other reactions that really
provides biological energy.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:11.120
All right.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.490
Now we're ready
to discuss how it

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:19.130
is that we can use glucose
oxidation, nutrient catabolism,

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:24.890
to keep ATP/ADP high, that is
in a useful range, where it can

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.890
allow cells to do
otherwise thermodynamically

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.570
unfavorable things.

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:32.550
So how could we
make this happen?

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:35.960
Well, just like this example
with creatine and creatine

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.350
phosphate, if we want to
use nutrient catabolism

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:43.700
to do the same thing, we
need to couple reactions

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.940
of glucose oxidation,
nutrient catabolism, that

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.500
will allow us to
synthesize ATP, ADP to ATP,

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.810
and have that
synthesis be favorable

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:59.150
despite the high
ATP/ADP ratio in cells.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:00.660
So let's think about it.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:01.730
So what is this?

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:02.900
Nutrient catabolism.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.520
What did we talk
about last time?

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.480
Oxidizing glucose
to carbon and CO2.

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:11.580
So here's our reaction for that.

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:19.880
So here's carbohydrate,
glucose CH2O6 plus six O2

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:25.850
goes to six CO2 plus six H2O.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:33.170
That's the chemical
formula for burning wood.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:41.570
So delta G0 prime for this
is minus 686 kcals per mole.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.460
Quite a negative number.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:52.850
Equilibrium greatly favors
the completely burned state,

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:56.880
oxidized state, of
that carbohydrate.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.360
And so you can imagine
that this equilibrium is

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.160
so favorable to the right, if
we couple this reaction to ATP

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.240
synthesis, you're clearly going
to have plenty of energy there

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.580
in order to maintain
that ATP/ADP

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:15.350
ratio in the right range
to be compatible with cells

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.670
using it to do other things.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:18.170
All right.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.600
So how do we actually do that?

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.720
Well, if we do it,
we have to follow

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.050
the same rules of thermodynamics
and do the same things

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:28.130
that we did before.

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:34.160
Basically, we have to do
this reaction in a way

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:37.820
that we can draw out a
similar type of equation

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.360
as we did for creatine
and creatine phosphate.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.650
And at the highest level, that
is how nutrient catabolism

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:49.620
will allow us to keep
ATP/ADP ratio high

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.910
even as ATP hydrolysis
is constantly

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:56.540
fueling all these other
unfavorable processes

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:58.810
in the cell.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:03.510
Now if we did this all in one
step, our burning wood example,

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.320
lots of heat is generated.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.760
That's too much energy.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:11.210
Not so good for biology.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:15.320
But rather what biology does,
as we alluded to last time,

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:17.780
is that because what we
talked about in the beginning,

00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.150
that all of the things
that we discussed

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.610
are true for
individual reactions

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:28.370
or many, many reactions,
basically, if we turn A into B

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:31.400
and we do it in one
step, like burning wood,

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:37.400
or we do it in 500 steps, the
thermodynamic consequences

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.570
are exactly the same.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:45.530
And so what we need to do is do
stepwise catabolism of glucose

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:48.890
and take advantage of the fact
that that delta G change is

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:52.820
the same whether it's
one step or many steps

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:57.830
and in that stepwise fashion
build in reactions where

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:03.500
we create intermediate
chemistries that allow us to do

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:06.740
things like we did with
creatine and creatine phosphate

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:12.110
such that we can favor ATP
synthesis when ATP/ADP ratio is

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.130
in the physiological range.

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:16.010
And in essence,
this is the magic

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:22.800
of how biology does this
and basically couples

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:26.770
nutrient catabolism in
order to provide energy.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:30.330
And so the pathway that
we're going to discuss today

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:31.860
and in the next
lecture is something

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:41.130
called glycolysis, which
simply put is glucose lysis.

00:30:41.130 --> 00:30:45.060
It's the stepwise
chemical oxidation

00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:47.640
of glucose, which we know
from our burning wood

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.500
example is favorable.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:54.150
And we're going to use this
pathway that basically will

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:58.350
be a pathway to allow the
stepwise lysis of glucose,

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:03.180
a favorable reaction, to
individual steps that set it up

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.360
in a way such that
ADP to ATP synthesis

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:12.780
is favored despite a
physiological ATP/ADP ratio.

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.720
Now I want to point out that
this really illustrates,

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.360
back to that high
energy compound thing,

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:21.220
that ATP is not the only
energy currency in the cell.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.370
In fact, glucose is much more
energy for a cell than ATP.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.910
You get much more energy
released from burning wood

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.670
than you get from
hydrolyzing ATP.

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:35.040
And in essence,
this is why we use

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:38.400
glucose-- why nature
has used glucose,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.940
and other molecules like
it, as an energy storage

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.880
device, because here is a
relatively stable molecule,

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.490
can sit around for
a long time, and you

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:52.670
can burn it when you need it to
keep your ATP-ADP ratio high.

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:54.080
All right.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.260
So, at the level of
reactions and pathways

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:01.520
now, how can we use glucose
oxidation and couple

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.140
it to drive ATP synthesis?

00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:05.540
Well, hopefully it's
very clear that we

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.400
have to basically
set up a situation

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.230
like this
creatine-creatine-phosphate

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.540
system that we
already discussed.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.200
And so I want to
start by discussing,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:19.220
what are the reactions in
glycolysis that ultimately

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:27.620
behave like this and allow this
favorable ADP-to-ATP synthesis?

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:30.350
And then we will go
ahead and consider

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.380
how we can make
those reactions work

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:36.560
in the context of an
entire pathway that

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.550
allows glucose oxidation.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.680
All right.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:49.050
Now, like creatine,
phosphate, and creatine,

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.080
both of the steps
in glycolysis that

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:56.190
favor ATP synthesis
involve intermediates

00:32:56.190 --> 00:33:01.860
where you have phosphate
on some molecule,

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:09.210
plus ADP goes to ATP
plus the phosphate

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.170
coming off that molecule.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:14.040
Now, if we go to our
creatine-creatine-phosphate

00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.370
system, obviously
this equilibrium

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.340
needs to lie to the right.

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:25.650
And so the first one
of these is as follows.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:56.980
It involves this molecule,
phosphoenolpyruvate, also

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.403
referred to as PEP.

00:33:59.403 --> 00:34:00.820
You will see
throughout the course

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.360
that we love to give
these little acronyms

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.450
to our metabolites because
it's hard to constantly

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.699
say and write out
phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:34:09.699 --> 00:34:12.190
Much easier to say PEP.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:19.929
So phosphoenolpyruvate
plus ADP goes to ATP.

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.840
Plus, if I take the
phosphate off of there,

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.219
I get this molecule.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.875
This molecule is enolpyruvate.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:43.525
Enolpyruvate can be
rearranged as follows.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:08.370
To make this molecule
a ketone pyruvate.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.040
You'll note-- hopefully remember
from your organic chemistry

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.920
classes that ketones
like pyruvate

00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:15.300
can exist in two forms.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.690
They can exist in the ketone
form or the enol form,

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:21.990
rearranging via the
chemistry that I've shown.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:33.770
The keto form is greatly
favored over the enol form.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:38.690
However, by having a phosphate
trap pyruvate the enol form--

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.140
phosphoenolpyruvate, when
you remove the phosphate

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:45.290
and it's wanting to
exist in the keto form,

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.010
greatly enhances the
energetics of this--

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.260
basically makes the
reaction, the equilibrium

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:54.260
want to lie very
far to the right.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.750
And by the way of
chemical tricks like this

00:35:56.750 --> 00:36:02.330
and others like it, you will see
used over and over in biology.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:04.490
In fact, this is
illustrated, if we

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:07.730
asked what's delta G0
prime for this reaction,

00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:14.560
it's minus 15 kcals per mole.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.100
That tells us that the
equilibrium of this reaction

00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.120
lies to the right.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:23.520
In fact, it lies far to the
right, and in fact, this is--

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:29.360
you may remember ATP hydrolysis
is negative 7.5 kcals per mole.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:35.380
So lies twice as far to the
right as ATP hydrolysis does.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:41.830
And in fact, this minus 15 kcals
per mole is the most favorable,

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.950
at least in terms of
individual reactions

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:48.940
that at least I know
of in metabolism.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:49.990
All right.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:37:02.930
Well, if this equilibrium
for this is PEP to pyruvate,

00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:06.095
this here is delta
G0 prime for ATP-ADP.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.200
So if we want to
know what's delta G0

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.130
prime for the entire reaction,
well, if PEP to pyruvate

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:21.990
is minus 15, ATP to
ADP is minus 7.5.

00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:24.100
Well here, we're going in
the opposite direction,

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.890
so it'd be plus 7.5.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:31.230
So it's minus 15 plus 7.5, means
that for the entire reaction,

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:36.660
this is minus 7.5
kcals per mole.

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:41.430
Means that this is favorable,
equilibrium lies to the right.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:42.420
If we drew out--

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.340
I'm not going to do it again
because I've done it a lot,

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.400
but if we redrew
out this equation,

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.580
replacing pyruvate and
PEP in the correct places,

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.040
there for creatine,
phosphate, and creatine,

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.040
you would see that there's
lots of conditions within cells

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:59.250
that will favor
ATP synthesis even

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:03.820
when ATP-ADP ratio is high.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.320
All right.

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:11.505
This reaction is catalyzed by an
enzyme called pyruvate kinase.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:23.570
And pyruvate kinase is a classic
example of a, quote-unquote,

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:26.550
"irreversible reaction."

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.600
However, I want to point
out that the enzyme pyruvate

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.830
kinase is actually named for
the reverse reaction that's

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:36.210
supposedly irreversible.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:37.170
Pyruvate kinase.

00:38:37.170 --> 00:38:39.680
If you take pyruvate and
you act on the kinase

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.530
as you learn from
Professor Yaffe,

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.780
that phosphorylates something.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:44.238
You phosphorylate
pyruvate, you get

00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:47.220
phosphoenolpyruvate
pyruvate kinase.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:54.590
And so remember that absolutely
no reaction is reversible.

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:57.440
It's only reversed-- what they
mean by irreversible when they

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.980
say pyruvate kinase step in
glycolysis is irreversible,

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:04.220
is that it is
effectively irreversible

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.190
under the conditions that
are compatible with life

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:09.110
that exist in cells.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:14.600
Of course, if you have very
low ADP and very high ATP,

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.400
you can come up with a
way to net synthesize PEP.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:23.180
You just can't drive
the reverse reaction

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.080
under the ATP-ADP and the
PEP pyruvate ratios that

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:30.160
physiologically exist in cells.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:33.190
However, this is
set up in a way such

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:38.050
that you can favor ADP-to-ATP
synthesis by converting

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.050
PEP to pyruvate in
a pathway, as we

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.440
will see happens in glycolysis.

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.640
All right.

00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:50.780
Now, the second reaction
that I want to--

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:56.360
that allows ATP
synthesis in glycolysis

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:10.050
is catalyzed by an enzyme
called phosphoglycerate kinase.

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:13.630
And this carries out
the following reaction.

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:28.160
OK.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:41.090
So this molecule is
1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:42.830
abbreviated 1,3-BPG.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:13.120
And basically the phosphate
is transferred from here

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:24.050
to ADP, which gives you this
molecule, 3-phosphoglycerate

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.710
or 3-PG.

00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.830
So this reaction,
the delta G0 prime

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:36.790
for the entire coupled reaction,
both steps of the reaction,

00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:42.222
is minus 4.5 kcals per mole.

00:41:42.222 --> 00:41:43.930
Tells you about the
equilibrium constant.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:47.650
Equilibrium lies to the right,
doesn't lie as far to the right

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:52.660
as the PEP plus ADP goes to
ATP plus pyruvate reaction,

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:55.660
but nonetheless, is
one where there's

00:41:55.660 --> 00:42:00.640
lots of conditions that are
favorable in cells to maintain

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.630
a high ATP-ADP ratio,
although we will see later

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:08.393
that this reaction actually
runs quite close to equilibrium

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:10.060
in cells, so there's
actually conditions

00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:12.250
where it can go in the
opposite direction as well,

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:15.290
and we'll get to that
later in the course.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.710
I want to point out one thing
about this, one thing that

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:20.290
makes this reaction
favorable, as you notice here

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:23.980
that this is a phosphate
on an acid group,

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.290
a so-called acid anhydride.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.180
And this is a pretty
good phosphate donor.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:31.840
And so you want to lose
that phosphate, which

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:35.200
is one of the reasons
why this reaction is

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:42.160
favorable for ATP synthesis
even at high ATP-ADP ratios.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.020
All right.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.930
So these are the two
reactions in glycolysis

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:50.560
that can favor ATP synthesis
at a high ATP-ADP ratio

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:53.210
just like creatine and
creatine phosphate.

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:58.330
And so hopefully now it's become
apparent to you that if during

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:02.230
our pathway of glucose
catabolism we can build

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:07.030
a pathway that couples what
we already know is favorable,

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:10.640
glucose oxidation, to
generate these intermediates,

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:15.970
PEP and 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,
lacerate we can then build

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:20.560
a pathway where those reactions
can make synthesis of ATP

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:25.640
favorable even though there's
a high ATP-ADP ratio in cells,

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:29.560
and in fact, maintain that
high ATP-ADP ratio in cells.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.750
And in essence, this is
the logic or the goal,

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.490
if you will, of
glycolysis and why

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:40.975
it's important to
provide energy to cells.

00:43:40.975 --> 00:43:41.475
OK.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:14.800
All right.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:22.100
Now, if we're going to make a
pathway where glucose oxidation

00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:27.310
is coupled to making PEP
and 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:32.730
it's obvious we need to add
phosphate to the system.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:37.020
There's no phosphate
molecule on glucose.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.510
Now already mentioned earlier--

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.520
and I just erased it--

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.770
that to trap glucose in
the cell, the first step

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:50.220
in glycolysis,
you add phosphate.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:53.280
But that phosphate donor is ATP.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:57.330
And so ATP being the phosphate
donor doesn't help us here.

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:59.970
If we're going to use
phosphate transfer here,

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.540
we need to have phosphate
added into the system

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:04.830
if this is going to work.

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:08.280
We can't have ATP as
our phosphate donor.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:12.780
You also saw lots of
reactions from Professor Yaffe

00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.990
that involved phosphate
transfer reactions.

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:21.820
But again, ATP-- or GTP
is the phosphate donor.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:27.030
And so for this system to work,
we need a way to get inorganic

00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:33.780
phosphate onto a carbohydrate
or we can't make things like PEP

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:38.970
or 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate
that will allow ATP synthesis.

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:43.860
Now we already saw earlier that
additional phosphate to glucose

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:45.120
is not favored.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.170
Remember, delta G0 prime
of phosphorylating glucose

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:53.540
was plus 3.3 kcals per mole.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:55.480
And it turns out
that says equilibrium

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.780
lies to the wrong side,
so we can't net do that

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.910
without ATP or energy input.

00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:04.100
And it turns out this is true
for other sugars as well.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.710
And so you need energy input
to add phosphate to the sugars.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:15.820
Plenty of energy input
from glucose oxidation,

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.200
but we need a reaction where
phosphate addition is coupled

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.930
to another reaction
that makes it favorable,

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:26.970
and we have to do this
without making ATP.

00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:28.680
And again, it
illustrates, again,

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.530
the biological energy
is not just about ATP.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.760
At a deeper level It's
something different.

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:37.840
And so to really discuss
this and understand it,

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.420
I need to introduce
two concepts that

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.070
are going to come up again over
and over again in this class

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:47.440
and across metabolism.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.820
The first of these is a
very high-level bioenergetic

00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.810
concept, although it's
really an energetic concept,

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:59.270
and it comes back to what
we already talked about.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.980
So, we know burning
wood is favorable.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:20.660
The CN H2O N plus oxygen
going to CO2 plus water.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:26.060
That's burning wood,
lots of energy released.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:28.500
Drew it up there for a
single-glucose molecule

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.130
and what the energy
release the delta G0

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:33.870
prime is for that reaction.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:35.520
Now I want to point
out chemically

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:39.480
what is going on
in this reaction.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.000
Chemically what is
happening for this

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.190
to occur is that
electrons from the carbon

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:50.610
are being moved
to the oxygen. You

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:55.440
are changing the oxidation
state of carbon and of oxygen

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:59.640
in order to carry
out this reaction.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:04.230
Oxygen is a better electron
acceptor than carbon,

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.110
and so transferring
those electrons

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:12.240
from the carbon to the
oxygen is favorable.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.580
That is, in essence, what is
going on in this very favorable

00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:21.570
reaction to burn wood.

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:26.740
Let me illustrate that a
bit more explicitly here.

00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.080
So the carbon-- most of the
carbons in carbohydrates

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.100
are alcohols.

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:41.570
So here, you can call
this our carbohydrate,

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.630
with the exception of the
ketone or the aldehyde

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:48.000
if it's a ketose or an aldose.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.805
All the other carbons in
the sugar are alcohols.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:59.800
All the other bonds there.

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:09.430
And so if we oxidize
that carbon--

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.090
that is, if we remove
electrons from the carbon,

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:13.990
how can we do that?

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:26.250
So this here generates
this H- hydride ion.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.180
This is, in essence,
two electrons

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:31.070
that we are removing
from the carbon.

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:41.030
That gives us a ketone.

00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:48.510
So if we oxidize the alcohol
and we remove two electrons,

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:51.930
we get the ketone.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.855
We could oxidize
this ketone further.

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.060
That will give us
the carboxylic acid.

00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:08.945
If we oxidize it even
further, now we get CO2.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:20.640
So, moving in this
direction, this is oxidation.

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.600
Transferring electrons from
the carbon to the oxygen

00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.390
to go in this oxidation
direction, that

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:32.850
is glucose oxidation
is what's happening

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:35.130
when we're burning wood.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.320
It's what happens
when we burn glucose.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.415
Energy is released.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:57.980
This is largely what catabolism
is about in biological systems.

00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.650
Now then reasons,
then, that if we're

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:05.150
going to move in the opposite
direction, so-called reduction,

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:14.060
that is going in this direction.

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.930
Reduction.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:29.240
That's largely energy storage
or anabolism in metabolism.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:34.160
We are storing energy
that we can burn later.

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.540
And of course, what's the
more extreme version of this?

00:51:38.540 --> 00:51:41.600
Well, what if we add two more
electrons to the carbon going

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.380
in this direction?

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:45.090
Well, what do we end up with?

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:53.450
Well, now we end up with
the saturated carbon.

00:51:53.450 --> 00:51:57.530
more reduced than the alcohol
is the fully saturated carbon.

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.260
You will see later that
this is what fat is.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:02.810
You saw that in some of
the earlier lectures.

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.330
It's also what gasoline is.

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:06.200
What's gasoline?

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:10.010
It's fully saturated
hydrocarbons that we then

00:52:10.010 --> 00:52:14.060
burn to CO2 and derive energy.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:18.230
Just like burning wood, burning
gasoline all in one step,

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.620
oxidizing the gasoline
gives you energy.

00:52:21.620 --> 00:52:23.420
There's more energy in gasoline.

00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.610
You can release more
energy per weight

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.310
from gasoline, from
fully-saturated hydrocarbons

00:52:28.310 --> 00:52:30.170
than you can from wood.

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:31.580
Same thing happening here.

00:52:31.580 --> 00:52:33.410
What has more
calories in your food?

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:38.660
Everyone knows fat has more
calories per weight than sugar.

00:52:38.660 --> 00:52:42.570
It's because the more
reduced our carbon is,

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:47.810
the more energy it stores, and
as we oxidize that carbon, that

00:52:47.810 --> 00:52:51.400
is what releases the energy.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:57.700
And so energy transduction
in biological systems--

00:52:57.700 --> 00:52:59.735
and actually, in
non-biological systems,

00:52:59.735 --> 00:53:02.110
as I just illustrated with
the wood and gasoline example,

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:04.450
but definitely in
biological systems,

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:09.370
is largely about oxidation
and reduction reactions,

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:14.570
and you are going to see this
coming up over and over again.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:19.790
Now, based on what I just said,
the real magic, if you will,

00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:26.020
of glycolysis can be further
refined to say that what

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:31.420
glycolysis does is it couples
the favorable oxidation

00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:38.050
of carbon with reactions that
allow phosphate additions

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.780
and production of
intermediates, like PEP

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:45.490
and 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,
where synthesis of ATP is

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:51.190
favored despite the high
ATP-ADP ratio in cells.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.800
If you think about
it, that process

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.800
then allows you to
keep that ATP-ADP ratio

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:58.810
in the range where
it can then be

00:53:58.810 --> 00:54:01.510
useful for all the reasons we've
been talking about now for two

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.740
lectures.

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:06.850
Allows the cell to couple that
ATP-ADP ratio, that-- in ATP

00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:10.210
hydrolysis to
otherwise carry out

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.240
otherwise unfavorable reactions.

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:13.960
OK.

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:20.720
So, based on that,
arguably the key,

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:24.530
or at least a very important
reaction in glycolysis,

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:30.170
is the oxidation step which
happens to add the phosphate

00:54:30.170 --> 00:54:34.260
and also happens to make
1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,

00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.360
which we saw earlier can be
used to drive ATP synthesis.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:40.460
And so that reaction
is the following.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.360
So this molecule hopefully
looks familiar to you

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.090
from the carbohydrate lectures.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:09.310
This is D-glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:55:09.310 --> 00:55:11.200
I will abbreviate
it frequently is

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.830
G-3P for glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate,

00:55:14.830 --> 00:55:17.380
but it's D-glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.420
Remember, it's a D,
sugar, because the OH

00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:23.930
group is pointing to the
right as we drew it this way.

00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:27.670
It's also an aldose because
it's a aldehyde sugar,

00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.950
and it's phosphorylated
on the 3 position--

00:55:29.950 --> 00:55:33.520
remember the way we
numbered sugars was starting

00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:34.390
at the carbonyl--

00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:36.740
1, 2, 3.

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:38.920
This is carbon-3,
phosphorylation on the 3

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.210
position.

00:55:40.210 --> 00:55:43.370
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:44.060
OK.

00:55:44.060 --> 00:56:09.850
So, this step generates
1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:11.380
Well, to do this,
there's actually

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:14.720
two things that happened here.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.040
First we had to add
the phosphate to this.

00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:20.320
It says two phosphates on
it. bisphosphoglycerate,

00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.030
this has a single phosphate.

00:56:22.030 --> 00:56:25.630
So inorganic phosphate
has to be added

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:28.720
to generate that molecule.

00:56:28.720 --> 00:56:34.000
By the way, adding that
phosphate delta G0 prime

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.300
is positive plus
1.5 kcals per mole.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.440
That means even
equilibrium, this reaction

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.960
would lie to the
left, of course,

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.880
because delta G0
prime is positive.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.470
However, remember the next
step downstream of this

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:54.490
is the one shown over here
where we do ATP synthesis.

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:56.390
That step is very favorable.

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:58.810
So this is an example
where metabolism

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:03.000
has coupled a very favorable
step to a step that's

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:03.870
less favorable.

00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:08.280
That can keep the 1,3-BPG levels
low and pull the entire system

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.700
forward, the metabolic trick we
discussed in the last lecture.

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:13.680
OK.

00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:15.810
You'll note the other thing
that's happening here,

00:57:15.810 --> 00:57:18.810
other than adding
that phosphate group,

00:57:18.810 --> 00:57:26.700
is that we've changed this
aldehyde to a carboxylic acid.

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:29.970
That is an oxidation reaction.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:32.970
Ketone to the acid is
an oxidation reaction.

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:37.540
I will illustrate over
here this so you can see

00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:41.970
why it's an oxidation reaction.

00:57:41.970 --> 00:57:43.370
So here's our aldehyde.

00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:47.240
If we take electrons
from the carbon

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:55.160
and that generates this
hydride ion to electrons,

00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.660
what are we left with?

00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:01.907
Well, we're left with
this intermediate

00:58:01.907 --> 00:58:04.365
that will never exist with a
positive charge on the carbon.

00:58:14.810 --> 00:58:18.380
Water, which, of course, is
abundant in biological systems.

00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:19.250
And then come--

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:24.100
OK.

00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.960
And it basically
illustrates that as I

00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:30.490
go from the aldehyde
to the acid, of course,

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.040
I make a proton
and a hydride ion,

00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:36.280
but really, I have changed the
oxidation state of the carbon

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.330
from the ketone
to the acid state.

00:58:40.330 --> 00:58:45.460
Two electrons are lost there,
is shown as that hydride ion.

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:47.110
OK.

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:48.950
So, what does that mean?

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:52.690
Well, that means that we
have to maintain that balance

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:55.640
in this reaction as well.

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:59.230
So water is going
to have to come in

00:58:59.230 --> 00:59:02.110
and a proton will be produced.

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:05.080
But the key thing
is we also generate

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:12.300
two electrons, this hydride
ion that have to go somewhere.

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:19.110
Now, finding a place for
those two electrons to go

00:59:19.110 --> 00:59:24.360
is what brings up the
second high-level concept

00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.810
that I now need to spend
some time discussing.

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:08.260
And this second
high-level concept

01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:15.190
that I need to introduce
is the role of cofactors,

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.730
and cofactors also
is effectively

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:26.230
the role of vitamins
and what role

01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:31.130
that these things
play in metabolism.

01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:36.075
Most vitamins are used to
support metabolic reactions,

01:00:36.075 --> 01:00:37.700
and we're going to
learn all about what

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:40.430
many of the vitamins that you
guys are familiar with reading

01:00:40.430 --> 01:00:42.800
the side of your
cereal box actually

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.190
do throughout the course.

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:51.900
Now cofactors, as I said,
often involve vitamins,

01:00:51.900 --> 01:01:02.200
are molecules that provide
useful chemical groups that

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.530
facilitate the reaction
chemistries that

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:07.390
are needed in metabolism.

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:13.790
So they provide some
useful chemical groups

01:01:13.790 --> 01:01:20.230
to facilitate some
of the chemistries

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:24.810
that we need to carry
out metabolic reactions.

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:44.530
They are, in general, in small
non-stoichiometric quantities

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:46.780
in order to carry
out this function.

01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:47.830
What do I mean by that?

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:51.700
Meaning that you can imagine
that the cell will convert lots

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:57.240
of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
to 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.690
but the enzyme, you don't need
one enzyme for every time you

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:01.860
convert that reaction.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:04.770
The same enzyme can do it
over and over and over again.

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:06.660
Well, it turns out,
cofactors are much more

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.520
like enzymes in that respect.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:11.220
They need to be
recycled in a way

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:13.980
that they can catalyze
the turnover of reaction

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.960
many, many, many
times, and it'll

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:17.790
be much clearer what
I mean by this when we

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:20.070
get into some of the details.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.730
Now, the vitamin concept
comes from the fact

01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:38.710
that often these cofactors
or parts of the cofactors

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:43.660
are not made by animals,
not made by humans.

01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:49.600
If they're not
made by us, but we

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.270
need them to do our
metabolism, well now we

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:55.360
have to get them from the
diet, and this is really

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:56.830
the concept of vitamins.

01:02:56.830 --> 01:02:59.470
These are small
things that we have

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:02.140
to get in quantities
from the diet,

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:05.170
and it turns out they're very
important to help us carry out

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:07.630
the metabolism we do.

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:09.550
As an aside, the
vitamin industry

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.380
is a very big business.

01:03:11.380 --> 01:03:14.980
Lots of unfounded
claims out there.

01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:16.480
I'm not going to get into--

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.770
that can get very political.

01:03:17.770 --> 01:03:20.890
I'm just going to say that
just know that more is not

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:23.680
always better, and the
goal for this class

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.340
is really to understand
what some of these vitamins

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:30.130
actually do.

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:31.300
OK.

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:35.950
Now, the relevant cofactor for
the reaction that we're talking

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:41.080
about is a cofactor called
nicotinamide adenine

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:47.590
dinucleotide, which is always
abbreviated NAD or NAD+.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:04:05.325
This stands for nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide.

01:04:05.325 --> 01:04:09.330
You see why we want to
abbreviate that NAD.

01:04:09.330 --> 01:04:14.070
And basically what nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide is is it's

01:04:14.070 --> 01:04:17.640
a factor that can solve
our problem of where

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.810
to put these electrons in
this oxidation reaction.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:26.140
That is, you can
accept two electrons

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:29.350
from a reaction
like this one here

01:04:29.350 --> 01:04:36.370
and cycle to another form
of the cofactor called NADH.

01:04:36.370 --> 01:04:37.240
All right.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.490
What is nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide?

01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:42.760
Well first, let's draw
what it looks like.

01:05:48.232 --> 01:05:48.810
OK.

01:05:48.810 --> 01:05:51.660
Sorry it's squeeze
down here a little bit.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:57.500
So this here is adenine.

01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:01.455
This group up here
is nicotinamide.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:10.270
So if you look at this,
this is a dinucleotide.

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:14.710
And so down here, this, of
course, is, from here down,

01:06:14.710 --> 01:06:16.660
is AMP.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:18.680
That phosphate is now over here.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:21.460
This is a separate
nucleotide, where

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:25.330
rather than having
one of the AGCTU bases

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:29.770
that you're used to from RNA and
DNA, nicotinamide is the base.

01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:36.510
And so it's this AMP
plus this nicotinamide

01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:40.410
base is a monophosphate,
or a nicotinamide adenine

01:06:40.410 --> 01:06:42.930
dinucleotide.

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:49.820
This, the nicotinamide
group, is derived

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:53.840
from a vitamin called niacin.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.670
And so from the side
of your cereal box,

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:57.170
this is what niacin does.

01:06:57.170 --> 01:07:01.310
It allows you to generate
the nicotinamide group that's

01:07:01.310 --> 01:07:04.670
part of this cofactor,
nicotinamide adenine

01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:06.770
dinucleotide.

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:10.700
Now, nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:16.800
is useful because of what that
nicotinamide group can do.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.130
And so I'm not going to
draw out the whole molecule,

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.950
but I'll show you.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:27.960
So NAD+, which is the oxidized
form of nicotinamide adenine

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:32.270
dinucleotide, is as
I drew it up there.

01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:38.930
So this here would be
attached to the rest

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.880
of the dinucleotide.

01:07:45.490 --> 01:07:48.880
So this is the oxidized form.

01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:55.580
I can have-- here's my
hydride ion, which, remember,

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.410
is two electrons.

01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:08.070
If I carry out that chemistry
to add those two electrons

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:26.479
to the nicotinamide
group, you now end up

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:33.970
with the reduced form
of nicotinamide adenine

01:08:33.970 --> 01:08:36.580
dinucleotide NADH.

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:41.710
So the difference between
NAD+ and NADH, it's the H,

01:08:41.710 --> 01:08:44.710
but it's really the two
electrons that were added

01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:53.380
in adding that H. So it's
oxidized form and reduced form.

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:57.760
So remember, I want to stress
this again, at least in biology

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.920
we can't create
or destroy matter.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.810
You can do that in
nuclear physics,

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:05.080
but we can't do that in biology.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:08.729
And so that means that if we
do an electron transfer like we

01:09:08.729 --> 01:09:13.200
did in this reaction where
we oxidized the aldehyde

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.080
in glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate to the acid

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.279
in 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,
those electrons have to be

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:21.790
accounted for.

01:09:21.790 --> 01:09:24.240
And so if one
molecule is oxidized,

01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:27.279
another one has to be reduced.

01:09:27.279 --> 01:09:29.430
So redox reactions
always-- that is,

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:31.859
redox, oxidation-reduction
reactions,

01:09:31.859 --> 01:09:34.470
always have to happen in pairs.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:39.000
And so over there we have the
aldehyde in glyceraldehyde

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:50.399
3-phosphate is oxidized
to form the acid

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:52.299
in 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:58.950
As part of that reaction,
we can couple it such

01:09:58.950 --> 01:10:03.780
that the nicotinamide group,
which is oxidized in NAD,

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:10.580
can be reduced to the
nicotinamide group that

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.077
is found in NADH.

01:10:14.780 --> 01:10:20.540
So that means we can
draw this in here,

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:34.190
is that having that cofactor
coupled to this reaction

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:40.720
now allows us to fix the redox
problem of this reaction.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:45.730
Now this reaction
here is catalyzed

01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:56.925
by an enzyme called glycerol
3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

01:10:56.925 --> 01:10:58.300
I'll draw that
out in the second.

01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:42.010
Often abbreviated GAPDH,
the loading control

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:45.190
in all of your western
blots, is the enzyme GAPDH,

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:48.630
glyceraldehyde
phosphate dehydrogenase.

01:11:48.630 --> 01:11:53.890
That is the enzyme that
carries out that reaction.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:55.710
Now notice, the name fits.

01:11:55.710 --> 01:12:00.120
It's a dehydrogenase,
it's removing a hydrogen,

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.690
removing two electrons
as a hydride ion,

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.550
but it's really--
what's important here

01:12:05.550 --> 01:12:08.960
is the electrons moving,
not the hydrogen itself.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.700
So in that way it's a
little bit misleading.

01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:15.600
And you will see that in
general, dehydrogenases

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.470
are classes of
enzymes that catalyze

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:23.110
oxidation-reduction
reactions, and as a result,

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:27.090
often involve
NAD/NADH as cofactors

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:33.560
because they facilitate those
electron transfer reactions.

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.790
OK.

01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:36.860
So now we're able
to describe how

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:41.670
GAPDH works in great detail.

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:47.520
And so the chemistry of
GAPDH works as follows.

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.420
And so in the active
site of GAPDH,

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:54.420
there's a cystine residue.

01:12:54.420 --> 01:12:58.570
That cystine residue
has a sulfur shown here.

01:12:58.570 --> 01:13:03.900
Also bound near the active
site is in NAD molecule

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:07.020
to catalyze the reaction shown.

01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.400
That NAD has to be in the
oxidized state, so it's NAD+.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:18.300
And so glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate binds

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:19.320
in the active site.

01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:29.660
There's glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:39.850
By the way, I will show you how
many reactions in metabolism

01:13:39.850 --> 01:13:41.800
work chemically.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.790
Obviously we don't have time in
this class, an overview class

01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:48.970
to go into all the great
chemical details of what's

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.465
going on and exactly
how everything works,

01:13:51.465 --> 01:13:52.840
but I'll at least
try to give you

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.490
a flavor of some of
the chemistry that

01:13:54.490 --> 01:13:56.930
happens throughout the course.

01:13:56.930 --> 01:13:57.430
All right.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:58.750
So once you have, then--

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:20.400
OK.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.530
So now you have this
intermediate bound

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:25.860
into the enzyme active site.

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:33.460
You can now carry out the
oxidation of that carbon.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:39.810
So these are two electrons
being removed as a hydride ion.

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:43.350
They can be transferred
to NAD in the active site.

01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:46.500
That generates NADH
by the exact chemistry

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.940
that I just showed you.

01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:05.950
OK.

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:11.440
That NADH now needs
to be exchanged out

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:18.490
or the enzyme will not
be able to catalyze

01:15:18.490 --> 01:15:21.855
the next series of reactions,
and that NADH will then

01:15:21.855 --> 01:15:23.230
go somewhere else,
and of course,

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:26.050
has to be cycled back to
NAD, but that doesn't happen

01:15:26.050 --> 01:15:28.000
in this reaction, per se.

01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:59.550
OK.

01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:08.030
Next, this here, you'll
notice, is that by the way

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:11.690
this chemistry worked, we
formed this thioester bond

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:13.500
in the active site.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:16.580
This is another thing that you
will see over and over again

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.020
in metabolism.

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:21.060
This sulfur in the thioester
bond is a good leaving group,

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:24.410
and so it's really setting up
a situation that will now help

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:27.570
with the phosphate addition.

01:16:27.570 --> 01:16:30.920
So here, I'll draw out
inorganic phosphate.

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:49.970
And that, of course, will give
us the identical enzyme active

01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:58.310
site that we started with
plus 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate.

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:14.070
And that 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate
can now be coupled to ATP

01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:18.900
synthesis to make
3-phosphoglycerate.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:23.550
And so you can see, in essence,
what this reaction has done is

01:17:23.550 --> 01:17:28.950
that it has coupled oxidation
of the aldehyde to the acid,

01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:32.610
the aldehyde in
3-phosphate to the acid

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:35.700
in 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,
which can then do

01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:38.920
phosphorylation of
ADP to make ATP.

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:47.500
So in essence, this is
oxidative phosphorylation.

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.060
Now I realize in high
school or in other classes,

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:57.850
oxidative phosphorylation means
something different to you,

01:17:57.850 --> 01:18:00.280
and of course, we will
discuss the process that

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.950
is called oxidative
phosphorylation in great detail

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:04.880
later in this course.

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.360
But I want to point out that
the chemistry that's actually

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.430
happening here in glycolysis is
also oxidative phosphorylation.

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:17.890
It's basically how you coupled
this favorable carbon oxidation

01:18:17.890 --> 01:18:20.620
that's occurring
at this GAPDH step

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:25.060
in a way that allows
you to synthesize ATP

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:30.580
at a high ATP-ADP ratio, which
in the end will allow cells

01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:34.350
to do otherwise
unfavorable things.

01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:35.700
OK.

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:42.900
Now we're ready to discuss these
reactions, the GAPDH reaction,

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.990
the pyruvate kinase reaction,
the phosphoglycerate kinase

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:49.680
reaction, and how they
fit into glycolysis

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.300
as a metabolic pathway in a
way that allows cells to use

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:57.120
glucose metabolism-- that
is, the breakdown of glucose,

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:01.350
the burning of glucose
as a way to get energy.

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:06.210
And that pathway is, of course,
glycolysis or glucose lysis

01:19:06.210 --> 01:19:08.520
that we mentioned earlier.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:12.420
Glycolysis is a very ancient
and ubiquitous pathway.

01:19:12.420 --> 01:19:15.630
It's used by essentially
all life on Earth

01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:21.200
and probably has been for at
least 2 to 3 billion years.

01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:23.780
Glycolysis, I guess,
as a pathway was,

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:27.860
quote-unquote, "discovered"
mid-19th century

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:30.530
by Louis Pasteur,
and Louis Pasteur,

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:34.670
of course, described
life, microorganisms

01:19:34.670 --> 01:19:38.420
as being responsible for
the process of fermentation.

01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:42.980
That is, conversion of glucose
into alcohol, something

01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.290
many college students are
interested in, as well

01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:48.950
as other organic acids.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:52.310
And of course, fermentation
to make alcohol

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:57.740
or to store other
types of organic acids

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.870
has been used in
food preservation

01:19:59.870 --> 01:20:03.560
for centuries, which is really
why Pasteur's discoveries were

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:06.890
so impactful at the time.

01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:08.600
Now even though Pasteur
discovered this,

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:11.330
he didn't really understand
chemically how it worked,

01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:14.670
and it actually took
decades to figure that out.

01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:17.360
And when it was finally
figured out and described

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.670
as the pathway
called glycolysis,

01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:23.510
this was done by two chemists,
two chemists in Germany, Embden

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:24.710
and Meyerhof.

01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:28.040
And basically what they
did is they pieced together

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:31.430
several enzymatic or
chemical activities that

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:35.570
have been purified from cell
lysates mostly from yeast

01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:39.290
and used those to build
a pathway that described

01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:43.370
chemically how you
could start with glucose

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:47.030
and chemically break down that
glucose in a way that made

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:50.130
sense in this
fermentation pathway,

01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:53.750
and that is why glycolysis
is sometimes called

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:56.780
the Embden-Meyerhof pathway.

01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:35.820
Now, glycolysis
does not completely

01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:38.940
convert glucose to CO2.

01:21:38.940 --> 01:21:44.310
Instead, what glycolysis
does is it converts glucose--

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:58.540
so I will draw here
in the pyranose form.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:05.960
It converts glucose
by a number of steps

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:12.890
into two molecules of the
organic acid pyruvate, which,

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:19.040
of course, was the product of
that pyruvate kinase reaction

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.495
that we showed earlier.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:34.450
Note that the fermentation
that Louis Pasteur described

01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:39.220
was further metabolism of that
pyruvate into something else.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:50.840
In the case of yeast, it was
ethanol or ethyl alcohol,

01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:51.920
or something else.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:23:04.210
The fermentative
product in mammals

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:08.770
is this organic acid lactate.

01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.500
And what we will
see next time is

01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:15.280
that this fermentation
of pyruvate

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.200
into one of these
other molecules

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.010
ends up being an alternative
to the further oxidation

01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:26.000
of pyruvate to CO2
which requires oxygen,

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:30.050
and the reason oxidizing
pyruvate to CO2

01:23:30.050 --> 01:23:33.230
requires oxygen is
because ultimately we

01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:37.820
have to regenerate that NADH
we made in glycolysis to allow

01:23:37.820 --> 01:23:41.780
that cofactor to cycle and
glycolysis to keep moving.

01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.930
Fermentation gives
us an alternative way

01:23:45.930 --> 01:23:49.290
to do this, which we'll
discuss in great detail

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:51.180
in the next lecture.

01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:56.570
But first I want to
focus on glycolysis

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:59.690
and what we can describe
next time as really how

01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:03.020
we can build a pathway to
turn glucose into pyruvate.

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:06.170
This glycolysis, this
Embden-Meyerhof pathway,

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:08.450
and some of the
details of that pathway

01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:11.820
are shown here on this slide.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:14.720
And this is where we'll
start off the next lecture,

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.910
discussing how each of these
steps in glycolysis function

01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:26.120
in a way that allow a pathway
to generate phosphoenolpyruvate,

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:30.050
1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate,
incorporate this GAPDH

01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:34.220
reaction, and do so in a way
that's overall energetically

01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:37.640
favorable to allow the cell
to couple this oxidation

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:42.710
of glucose to keeping ATP-ADP
ratio in the right range

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:46.720
to support other unfavorable
functions in the cell.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.610
OK, thanks.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.350
GARY GENSLER: So let's
turn to this world

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.310
of initial coin offerings.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.420
And so we're going to chat
about it today and next Tuesday.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.080
Next Tuesday, we'll come back
to the regulatory side of this.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.382
And in fact, there were
some new things out

00:00:37.382 --> 00:00:39.090
of the Securities and
Exchange Commission

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.480
even last week on
initial coin offerings.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.970
But we're going to spend a
little time on ICOs today.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.010
And so of course, we've
talked about Bakkt already.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.360
And we'll talk about
their characteristics.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.090
What is an initial
coin offering?

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.160
What is this new
form of crowdfunding?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.980
How to evaluate initial coin
offerings-- and some of this

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.870
will be familiar,
because it's how

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.990
to really evaluate any
blockchain technology

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.390
project in some regard.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.670
And then I'm going to
share some statistics,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270
and then hopefully wish you
all a Happy Thanksgiving

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.200
and call it a day.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.940
So the study
question was, what is

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.460
this new form of crowdfunding?

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.240
Does anybody want to tell me?

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.390
What is an ICO in
the easiest way?

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.183
You're going home for
Thanksgiving and somebody says,

00:01:34.183 --> 00:01:35.350
what have you been studying?

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.640
And you say ICOs.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.190
What is an ICO?

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.687
Yeah?

00:01:40.687 --> 00:01:42.770
AUDIENCE: It's a startup
that sells its own crypto

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.070
token to raise money.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.605
GARY GENSLER: So it's a--

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:51.460
AUDIENCE: Sells its own
crypto token to raise money.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.280
GARY GENSLER: So it's a way
to raise money with a crypto

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.623
token, pretty simple.

00:01:56.623 --> 00:01:58.040
AUDIENCE: And in
addition to that,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.640
it gives people an expectation
that the token's value

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.288
will go up in the future.

00:02:03.288 --> 00:02:05.830
GARY GENSLER: Did anybody read
the optional reading for today

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.835
about the dude that actually
came up with this idea?

00:02:09.835 --> 00:02:11.315
Do you remember his name?

00:02:11.315 --> 00:02:11.815
|

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:12.940
AUDIENCE: JR.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.365
GARY GENSLER: JR,
Willett, is it?

00:02:14.365 --> 00:02:14.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.570
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.690
I mean, I don't know if
anybody watched the video,

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.780
but this individual
in 2010 came up

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.930
with an idea of saying
Bitcoin is out there.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.420
I mean, Bitcoin was
selling for like $0.06,

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.970
$0.10 a Bitcoin or something.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.620
He said, if you could put
something on top of Bitcoin--

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.960
I don't even know if you
use the term smart contract.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.090
But he did say, if you
could put an application

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.670
on top of Bitcoin-- it
was before Vitalik Buterin

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.800
came along with Ethereum.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.930
He said, you could
raise a lot of money.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.930
And he went to conference
after conference

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.300
and tried to convince people.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.550
And there's even
this one feedback

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.040
where somebody said to
him in an email exchange,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.680
you're probably
breaking the law.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.480
This can't be legal.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.790
But he couldn't get
anybody to adopt this idea.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.390
And he's not wealthy now either.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.690
He missed the whole ICO
way, but he was basically

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.450
the inventor of this
initial coin offering,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.610
saying that the
technology of Bitcoin,

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.740
even the scripting
language, was enough

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.800
that you could maybe raise
money on top of Bitcoin

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.180
with an application layer.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.650
And we'll sort through.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.650
Now, I'm going to see if I
can do a little video for you.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.920
This shouldn't be
too hard for me.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.560
So this is a two minute
video of all the ICOs

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.420
that have ever happened.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.000
And Elementus, I've
shown you this picture,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.040
but you know there wasn't much.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.850
Where we are we?

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.560
Are we in 2015 now?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.940
Nothing.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.650
So you see the
first ICO that they

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.068
mark in there is Ethereum
itself raised $18 million.

00:04:06.068 --> 00:04:06.860
I apologize.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.360
It's only going to
take two minutes,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.480
but you're going to see
the whole history of ICOs.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.330
And then there's nothing.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:16.970
It's really-- so you
can see no country,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.110
no official sector is really
focused on this in 2016.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.510
But then there's going
to be a big offering

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.550
in the middle of 2016.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.910
Anybody know who that is?

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.320
Dow.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.940
$168 million, and it fails.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.570
It spectacularly fails.
$50 million of it is stolen

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.730
and it leads to the Ethereum
fork and things like that.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:48.750
But still not a lot, and
then, by the summer of '17,

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.350
Katy bar the door.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.730
Tasos and quarter billion
dollars, Filecoin,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.100
a quarter billion dollars.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.340
And then oh, I pulled the
one that finished in 2017.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.730
I'm sorry.

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:10.150
So there's the final chart
that goes all the way

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.930
through August.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.150
Now, some say that
it's not $28 billion.

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.670
Some say it's $23
billion, because there's

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.390
no really good figures.

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:24.010
But EOS raises $4.2 billion and
Telegram raises $1.7 billion,

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:26.560
huge amounts of money.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.730
And this is in a period--

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.820
almost all of this was raised
and in about 12 months,

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.300
from June of '17 to June of '18.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:38.430
Call it $25 billion
in that 12 months.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.800
And now, it's trickling off.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.100
Now, it's less than
$0.5 billion month.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.970
But that $25
billion in 12 months

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.640
compares to venture capital--

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.890
and Simone, you might help me.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.450
But venture capital worldwide
is about $150 billion

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.930
a year in a 12 month period.

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.480
I think the figures range
from $125 to $170 billion.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.950
So just to give you a
sense, in this 12 month

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.200
period, it's, give or take,
20% of the size of all venture

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.400
funds, 20% to 30% roughly
of all venture funds.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.250
And again, it's tailing
off, but it's significant.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:23.090
If you can come up with
an idea in these 12 months

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:28.460
and raise the money,
JR Willett's idea,

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.600
this was the moment.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.430
So what are initial
coin offerings?

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.700
What's the more detailed
characteristics?

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.980
Well, number one,
they're proceeds

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.180
that help build a network.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.060
That's what Vitalik
Buterin actually did back

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:51.330
in 2013 is when he published,
in 2014 is when he went live.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:57.540
But he was raising $18 million,
hired a law firm, big, big law

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.580
firm in--

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.020
I can't remember if it was
Perkins or Skadden Arps,

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.990
but a big US law firm, partnered
up with a Canadian, Joe

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.270
Lubin, who saw this
potential in a 19

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:13.983
or 20-year-old kid who
had great writing skills.

00:07:13.983 --> 00:07:15.150
He knew a lot about Bitcoin.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.275
He had been writing about
it for a number of years,

00:07:17.275 --> 00:07:20.238
but he also had a great idea.

00:07:20.238 --> 00:07:23.800
He moved off to Switzerland for
regulatory and other reasons

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:28.150
set up a foundation for
tax and other reasons,

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.080
and did it in a very
professional way.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.900
But you can look at
their sources and uses.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.880
You can go back to
the original offering

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.340
and say they were willing
to say what they were going

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.650
to use the $18 million for--

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.030
law fees and counting fees
and the usual things you

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.370
do when you start something.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.190
So it's proceeds to
help build up a network.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.220
But just like that moment,
it was before the network

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:51.845
could be used.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.390
So that was pre-functional.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:59.950
We're going to show
statistics later,

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.620
but anybody want to take
a gander in the last three

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:03.740
months.

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.320
So this isn't back 2014.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.660
I'm talking about
third quarter of 2018.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.490
What percentage
of token offerings

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:13.600
were offered before the
network is functional, fully

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.930
functional?

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.090
Alin?

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.060
AUDIENCE: 99%.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.820
GARY GENSLER: Anybody
else want to take a--

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.990
argue with Alin?

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.940
Just because he is a
computer scientist?

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:26.785
Tom?

00:08:26.785 --> 00:08:28.182
AUDIENCE: I was
going to say 95%.

00:08:28.182 --> 00:08:29.390
GARY GENSLER: All right, 95%.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.430
All right, so
we've got a market.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:33.320
So 95%, 99%.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:40.140
Does anybody want to say that
more than 5% were functional?

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.640
No?

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.500
All right, I'll give
you the number later.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.920
It's in between the two of you.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.690
It's in between the two of you.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.370
So it's raising money before
something is functional.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.180
It's like raising the
money for a Broadway play

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.685
before you've got the
actors and the script.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:07.160
Or it's even worse than that.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.600
You don't even have the idea.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.580
But usually, you have an idea.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.550
Usually-- what
percentage of ICOs

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.890
are marketed on just an idea?

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.510
Anybody?

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.720
I have that
statistic later, too.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.080
Rahim, you have a view?

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.205
What do you think?

00:09:24.205 --> 00:09:26.296
AUDIENCE: I would
think maybe of these

00:09:26.296 --> 00:09:28.480
with an idea, maybe 60% to 70%.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.980
GARY GENSLER: 60% to 70%.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:30.550
Sean?

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.040
AUDIENCE: I would say 90%.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.830
GARY GENSLER: 90%.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.290
All right, no, it's in
between the two of you.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:37.490
Rahim is a little closer.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.860
It's about 75%, just an
idea, or at least as defined

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.060
by a certain tracking center.

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.910
So it's usually you have
an idea, you market it,

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:51.500
you raise some
money, or at least

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.880
during these boom periods
in the last 15 months.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.750
The development, while open
source, is largely centralized.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.210
But in fact, in
the last quarter,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.420
the last three
months, well over half

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.550
isn't even open source
technology any longer,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:12.380
partly because it's so
based on just an idea

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.940
that people aren't publishing
their source code until later.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.550
They will eventually
publish some source code.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:22.670
But at the moment of the
initial coin offering,

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.810
a majority don't even have open
source software at that moment,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.310
even though they say later
they'll publish this software.

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.000
But even if it's open source,
it's highly centralized.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.190
Please.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:42.160
AUDIENCE: I don't understand
how open source is related

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:50.450
to [INAUDIBLE] if I say I'm
going to sell something,

00:10:50.450 --> 00:10:54.530
these are the coins you
should use to pay me back.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.772
Where is open source connected?

00:10:57.772 --> 00:10:59.230
GARY GENSLER: So
there's a movement

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:03.250
in technology and
software development--

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.130
certainly, it was
started in the 1990s,

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.810
but it may have been earlier.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.820
But now, it's very
prevalent-- where

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.220
you publish your software
and everybody can see it.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:15.070
So it's transparency
in software.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.160
That's called the
open source movement.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:22.510
In the blockchain technology,
when Satoshi Nakamoto first

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:27.130
published the Bitcoin
software in January of 2009,

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.320
it was open source.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.210
It meant everybody could
see the computer code.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.190
And you could even--

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.140
it's actually
published under an MIT

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.680
license, which meant you didn't
have to pay any fee to use it.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.940
Zero fee, you can copy it,
you can use the Bitcoin core

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.780
software.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.880
That's the definition.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.160
That's the best
definition of open source,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:50.530
because it's with
an MIT license.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.320
But it's truly open.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.480
That's what I'm
referencing here.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.690
And the relevance is
that, though there

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:01.590
is a big open source
movement in a lot of fields

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:04.750
and in blockchain and
certainly in Bitcoin

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.630
and the Ethereum
network is open source,

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:13.330
many, many developments
and initial coin offerings

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:16.090
don't publish their
code until months later.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.850
They raise the money, they're
still developing their code.

00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:23.500
Are you with me?

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.854
So Brotish?

00:12:25.854 --> 00:12:27.854
AUDIENCE: So why do
investors put in their money

00:12:27.854 --> 00:12:29.271
even before the
code is published?

00:12:35.035 --> 00:12:36.490
GARY GENSLER: So
why do investors

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.770
put their money in before
the code is published?

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:47.300
Why do investors put
money into any investment?

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.190
Sabrina?

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:48.827
AUDIENCE: FOMO.

00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:49.910
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.430
AUDIENCE: FOMO.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.710
GARY GENSLER: What's FOMO?

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:56.622
Fear of missing out.

00:12:56.622 --> 00:12:57.680
All right.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.477
Oh by the way,
Sabrina and Thalita,

00:12:59.477 --> 00:13:01.310
I announced that anybody
that was here today

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.860
got double credit for
participating right

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.470
before Thanksgiving.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.120
So I just want to let you know.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.190
I live by that.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.450
So fear of missing out.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.120
Why else do people
invest in any investment,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.608
even if you're just
investing in Apple stock?

00:13:17.608 --> 00:13:18.650
AUDIENCE: To get returns.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:21.690
GARY GENSLER: To get
returns, to get a profit,

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.400
to take risk and a return.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.330
Brotish?

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:27.997
AUDIENCE: I think in
one of the readings

00:13:27.997 --> 00:13:32.090
they mentioned that one strategy
of putting money in an ICO

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.190
is going to the board
and understanding.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:37.070
So I thought that that
was a prerequisite

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.300
for the investment.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.840
I also happened to
attend one seminar here

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.730
where there was a
company called BlockTEST,

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:45.748
which is funded by a--

00:13:45.748 --> 00:13:47.040
GARY GENSLER: What's it called?

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.200
Block--

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.040
AUDIENCE: BlockTEST.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.780
It's MIT alumni.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:58.450
So they evaluate these
codes and run some solutions

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:00.590
to verify whether
they're doing what

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.960
they're supposed to be doing.

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.130
So I thought that it
was a prerequisite

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.487
for the investment.

00:14:05.487 --> 00:14:07.070
So that's where my
question came from.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.695
GARY GENSLER: So you assume that
you could always read the code

00:14:09.695 --> 00:14:11.740
to make the investment.

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:16.210
In the fall of 2017 and
into the spring of 2018,

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:18.740
I would suggest that
wasn't always the case.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.710
And in fact, it usually
was not the case.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.590
I think if these
things are to persist,

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:30.010
my prediction is you'll
see more and more rigor

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.800
in this marketplace.

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:34.600
Oh, I skipped promoters.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.940
The people starting it keep some
of the coins for themselves.

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.710
This is not that different
from any venture capital round.

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:43.570
When you're raising
money and you're

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.800
selling equity or selling a
preferred stock in something--

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.680
you'll know this, any
of your taking ventures

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.390
course or if you worked in it--

00:14:52.390 --> 00:14:54.560
you're going to keep equity
for yourself as well.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:57.310
So this is just how much
do you keep for yourself,

00:14:57.310 --> 00:15:01.300
how much do you
sell to the public,

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.600
but just translated to a
new form of capital raising.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.270
Instead of it being
applied to your equity,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:12.870
you're applying it to this
new form of fund raising.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.710
They're fungible
and transferable,

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.740
meaning you can sell them.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:21.010
Sometimes, you can't sell
them for a number of months.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.720
Technically speaking,
sometimes you

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.620
can't sell him until the
platform is functioning.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:29.470
But often, you can
still sell them

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.720
by private agreement,
private arrangements.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.510
Ethereum-- let me just mention
something about Ethereum.

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:43.610
When Ethereum was first sold,
for 12 months, the only record

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.820
you had that you were
purchasing Ethereum was

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.110
the email return back from
either Vitalik or others who

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:52.930
said, yes, you've purchased it.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:55.900
It wasn't even that you had
a private key for 12 months.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:58.480
You had an email confirmation.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.060
But you could, based on
that email confirmation,

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:06.430
sell the right to what later
you would be issued, a coin.

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:07.170
Sorry?

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
along those lines,

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:12.460
I've seen a number of ICOs
use SAFTs, simple agreement

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.440
for future tokens.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.720
And I guess I'm wondering
what the trade-offs are

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.490
versus directly issuing the
tokens at time of the ICO.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.213
And then more specifically, that
just feels like you're not even

00:16:24.213 --> 00:16:25.630
getting the token,
you're not even

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.890
getting the rights to the token
until the network launches.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.280
That seems like a second
order, really far removal

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:38.230
from even close to any form
of a utility on a network.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.100
GARY GENSLER: Is this
an answer to the SAFT?

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.160
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:44.510
So isn't it because
under the US--

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.930
I mean, right now,
the coins aren't

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.890
considered as a security.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:51.610
And if you are
doing ICOs, then you

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:55.900
can only sell it to accredited
investors [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.490
if you are based
in the US, and you

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:01.210
can do some things other
than that outside the US.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:07.569
And so I think SAP is
trying to see if coins can--

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:11.079
at some point, they can
be considered as not

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.829
as securities.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:18.160
So I think the purpose
of SAP is to, I guess,

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.530
expand the basically
investor base so

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.750
that more people can purchase.

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.620
GARY GENSLER: So
it's Jihee right?

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.270
So Jihee's answer delved
into the regulatory,

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:35.410
but I'm going to take it up
a level from the regulatory.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.360
What you said was
accurate, but there's a--

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.730
it's selling something
for future delivery,

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:45.420
because the token
currently is not usable.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:48.140
Just in the last quarter, I'm
talking about the last quarter

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.690
of 2018, three
quarters of the ICOs

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:57.680
that were started or launched
were just on an idea.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.130
So they hadn't yet
written the code.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:02.910
A token wouldn't even be usable.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.450
So you have some
economic basis to say,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.500
I'm trying to sell you something
that will be a future delivery.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:15.510
When Vitalik Buterin even did
Ethereum, you got an email.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.530
It was not called a simple
agreement for future token.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:22.830
Is that what SAFT is?

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.980
But it was a simple
email for a future token.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:29.730
I mean, it was, in essence,
an economic arrangement

00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:33.420
where you exchanged
Bitcoin for an email.

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:36.240
And that email, some
12 months later,

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.390
you would get a private key
when the genesis block happened.

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:42.270
And most of these
still had to deal

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.880
with that economic arrangement.

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:48.330
Then a law firm
here in Boston took

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:53.150
an arrangement that was
handled in securities offerings

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:56.400
and they created something,
and they put out, in essence,

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:58.600
a legal white
paper, if you wish,

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.460
called a Simple Agreement
for Future Tokens, SAFT,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.320
to try to address,
they thought--

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.098
they thought-- I think they
were wrong, by the way.

00:19:07.098 --> 00:19:08.640
But they thought
they were addressing

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:15.090
a bunch of regulatory issues
that somehow this SAFT, this

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.710
would be maybe have to register
under the securities laws

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:20.910
in the US.

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:23.520
But when you finally
got the token,

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.590
maybe later it would not have
to be a registered security.

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:32.760
And they were trying to do
a two-tiered arrangement.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.860
But even before you got to this
Boston law firm that did this,

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.810
you still had the
economic reality

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.780
that you were trying
to raise money

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.600
today to get a token later.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:50.842
And then the lawyers
got involved to try to--

00:19:50.842 --> 00:19:52.300
I would say they
were trying to get

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.750
between the wallpaper and
the wall of regulation

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:58.510
and say, we'll register
the first thing,

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.900
we'll give it a fancy name.

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.950
We'll call it a SAFT.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.280
We won't register the second
thing when you finally

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:05.390
get the token 12 months later.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:08.340
I think they'll probably
end up mistaken on that.

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:13.050
But I think that
was the background.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.760
Let me hit a couple
other points.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.760
Scarcity is usually,
but not always, fostered

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.030
through some monetary policy.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:26.370
If we go back to Nakamoto
consensus and Bitcoin,

00:20:26.370 --> 00:20:28.400
what's the monetary
policy there?

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.360
Anybody remember that monetary?

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.220
I call it monetary
policy, but it's

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.600
the control of the supply
of the money supply.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.750
So what's the money supply
algorithm in Bitcoin?

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:41.470
Eilon?

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.333
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:43.333 --> 00:20:44.125
GARY GENSLER: Half?

00:20:44.125 --> 00:20:45.330
Half of what?

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:50.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
reward for the blocks.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:51.540
GARY GENSLER: So
there's a reward.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.750
The Bitcoin monetary
policy is a reward of--

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.345
anybody remember
the reward today?

00:20:57.345 --> 00:20:58.220
AUDIENCE: 12.5 coins.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:20:59.940
GARY GENSLER: 12
and 1/2 coins today.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:04.550
It started at 50 coins
every how many minutes?

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.770
10 minutes on average.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.400
But every 200,000
blocks, it halves.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.740
So somewhere out in
the 22nd century,

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:15.740
it will cap at 21 million coins.

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:19.210
But way before that,
the monetary policy,

00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:23.330
it's slowing and slowing
and slowing the growth rate.

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:27.950
So embedded in the algorithm of
Bitcoin is a monetary policy.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.420
Is it immutable?

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.340
How many people would say
that's hard coded and immutable?

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.150
Not a hand.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.250
How many people would say
it's actually not immutable?

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.330
So what can change it?

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:43.180
Alan, you didn't raise
your hand either way.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:46.850
AUDIENCE: It depends how
you define immutable.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.877
GARY GENSLER: Yes,
I'm listening.

00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:52.710
AUDIENCE: If you change
the monetary policy,

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.878
you're going to have a fork.

00:21:53.878 --> 00:21:55.670
You're going to have
the old folks sticking

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:56.890
with the old policy
and the new folks

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.098
sticking with the new policy.

00:21:58.098 --> 00:21:59.855
And now, what has changed?

00:21:59.855 --> 00:22:01.980
Some people argue nothing
has changed, while others

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.022
argue something has seen.

00:22:03.022 --> 00:22:04.022
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:06.350
So Alin's pointing out not
everybody will go along

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:07.980
with the new monetary policy.

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.130
But I would note on
Ethereum, they've

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.680
changed their monetary
policy two or three times.

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.530
And they haven't had
to use a hard fork.

00:22:15.530 --> 00:22:19.130
So they've changed
their block reward.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:23.870
And in changing a block reward,
by lowering the block rewards,

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.390
by consensus, they
effectively are

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:29.660
changing their monetary policy,
because they're changing,

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.520
in essence, their
inflation rate.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.230
But most initial coin
offerings have some algorithm,

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.550
some built in, what we'll
call, money supply policy

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:46.470
or monetary policy,
but not all of them do.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.030
Some, if you read
them closely, they

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.480
can issue as much as they
want whenever they want

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.620
and so forth.

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:56.550
But I would say the majority
have a monetary policy.

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.100
If this space, if this
world really took off a,

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:03.660
lot of monetary policy
economists would study it.

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.610
But there's not a
lot of deep research

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.070
yet on what works,
what doesn't work.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.590
It's a playground
or a sandbox if it

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.700
were to ever take
off as to exploring

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.290
hard monetary policies.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.110
Sean?

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:20.130
AUDIENCE: So just based
on those six criteria,

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:21.660
maybe apart from the last one.

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:22.800
It looks to me like--

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.580
GARY GENSLER: You want
to get rid of that one?

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:23.940
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:25.520
It looks to me
like a Kickstarter.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.430
GARY GENSLER: Like a what?

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:27.430
AUDIENCE: A Kickstarter.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.040
GARY GENSLER: A Kickstarter.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.110
So this looks like
Kickstarter to you?

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:40.590
But does Kickstarter
give you something else?

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:41.442
Anything?

00:23:41.442 --> 00:23:45.670
AUDIENCE: It depends on how
you structure the terms.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.680
Basically, most of the items
that are posted on Kickstarter,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.240
they use the funding
to build their product.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.600
It's before it's
actually functional.

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.115
And it's also open source.

00:23:59.115 --> 00:24:02.160
It's pretty much the same.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.093
GARY GENSLER: Shimon?

00:24:03.093 --> 00:24:04.760
AUDIENCE: There's a
very big difference,

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:07.670
which is that Kickstarter,
you fix the price

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.240
and you let the market
determine the quantity, right?

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.670
And arguably, you
fix the quantity

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.730
and you let the market
determine the price.

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.860
That's a big difference
between those two,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:23.460
and the fact that there's
a secondary market, right?

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.980
You can also sell your items,
lieke the super early bird

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:29.600
items in a secondary market.

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:30.550
Sure, you could.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.940
And again, this is nothing--

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.130
yes, you can.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.050
I mean, I would argue that
it's a lot harder, right?

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:43.390
But it also is the case that,
if I'm selling a new widget,

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:48.450
I'm not going to sell the
early birds for $30, right?

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.480
That's the price, right?

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.490
And here, you're letting--

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:56.018
the auction is for the
price not for the coin.

00:24:56.018 --> 00:24:58.310
GARY GENSLER: So there are
similarities to Kickstarter.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:02.150
There's similarities to other
crowd funding mechanisms,

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:07.740
but there's also some real
distinctions in terms of--

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:09.890
one, of course, this
is all digital assets.

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.610
And Kickstarter often there
is a service or a good,

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.070
a physical good, or a
service you're getting.

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:18.290
But also, what Shimon does?

00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:19.242
Hugo?

00:25:19.242 --> 00:25:21.200
AUDIENCE: Just to push
back on that last point,

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.510
often the ICOs are
priced in theory.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.690
And then only on the secondary
markets do the prices change.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.000
Isn't that the case?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.430
If you want to spit
in an ICO, they'll

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:38.240
be like, oh, here's 1,000 points
for 0.1 F. And that, I guess,

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:41.603
varies based on price
fluctuations in US dollars,

00:25:41.603 --> 00:25:43.020
if you're still
taking US dollars.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.500
But since you're using
Ether to pay for the ICO--

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:51.590
GARY GENSLER: Hugo's
saying it's not really

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:58.080
that price is variable until it
gets to the secondary market.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:02.030
But I would contend that one
big difference between most

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.310
of what's done on
Kickstarter, not everything

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:07.610
but most, and here
is here the investors

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:10.610
really are looking
and anticipating

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.960
profits and returns.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.480
And when I think
of most people that

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.938
are going into
Kickstarter, they're

00:26:15.938 --> 00:26:22.100
getting one product, one unit
of something as a reward.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.360
And they're not looking
for a significant profit

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.740
or appreciation.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.887
They could-- maybe a
modest, but not a--

00:26:29.887 --> 00:26:31.220
AUDIENCE: The secondary market--

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:33.470
the super early birds in
the secondary market--

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:36.470
GARY GENSLER: Super
early birds, yeah.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.710
So there is monetary
policy and this last point,

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.050
that purchases really
are anticipating profits

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.810
through appreciation.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:46.280
So that's what I think of.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.150
Now, how to you evaluate ICOs?

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:50.720
You're not going to be
surprised by my first one.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.170
It's what we've talked a
lot about in this class.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.090
Assess the viability
of the token use case.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.440
Like, does it make any sense?

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.710
Does it make any sense?

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:06.590
Do you need to use
an append only log

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.810
with a consensus among
a bunch of parties

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:12.200
that can write to a ledger?

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.520
So append only
logs and consensus,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.860
throw a bunch of
cryptography in there, too.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.800
And do you need a native token?

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.020
Those basic
fundamental economics

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:25.600
that we've talked about
a lot this semester,

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.820
hopefully, will save
you off from investing

00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.480
in really bad ICOs.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:35.230
But beyond that, which I think
is over 50% of what you should

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.970
do, read the white paper.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:44.670
I tell you, if anybody could
read the Telegraph white paper

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:48.030
that they raised $1.7
billion and please tell me--

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.562
feel free to tell
me what they are

00:27:49.562 --> 00:27:51.270
going to use that
money for, because I've

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.342
read it a number of times
and I wouldn't invest in it,

00:27:55.342 --> 00:27:57.300
because it felt like they
could raise the money

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.040
and do almost anything
they want with it.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.570
I mean, they're an
incredible company.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.430
They've got hundreds
of millions of users.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:09.758
And they have incredible
resources to draw upon,

00:28:09.758 --> 00:28:11.550
but I'm still not sure
what they're using--

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.880
what I will ultimately be
able to use the coin for,

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.420
what service I
can get from that,

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.290
and what they're
using the money for.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.330
So I would say, read
the white paper.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.950
And if there's
source code, which

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.335
is less than half the
time there's source code,

00:28:28.335 --> 00:28:29.960
have somebody you
trust read the source

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:32.140
code if you can't read it.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.490
Who's the team?

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:38.320
Just like any venture
capital investor,

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.760
you want to know who's the team.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.840
What's their history?

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.860
What's their experience
and so forth?

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:46.120
But I start with the
economics and the white paper

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.380
before I get to the
team and the website.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.930
Is there venture
capital involvement,

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.290
and who and which ones?

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:59.890
Now, VCs often will
take part of the--

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.370
at this stage will take
part of the equity and also

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.170
part of the coin round.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.780
So they're doing
hybrid investments.

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.070
It's very rare, now
in November of 2018,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.570
that a venture
capitalist will only

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.330
take a part of the token round.

00:29:16.330 --> 00:29:19.510
In late '17, there were still
some they were just getting

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:23.830
on this parade and
taking parts of the pre--

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:26.890
basically, the
pre-round of the tokens.

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:31.990
But now, they want part of
the actual equity and tokens.

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:34.330
Erik, were you asking?

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:37.240
AUDIENCE: No, it's just
that's exactly what we

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:43.780
got from a VC that mentioned
that they go with a free ICO

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.600
round of investment
first as a means

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.160
to assess the capability
of the full body offering,

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.363
and then go through
the ICO again.

00:29:53.363 --> 00:29:55.030
GARY GENSLER: But
their first investment

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.295
is either preferred or an
equity-like instrument.

00:29:58.295 --> 00:29:59.170
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:01.750
And I feel like it changes
completely the time

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.080
from the investment for a
venture capitalist, which

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:07.840
normally would for
five to 10 years.

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:10.460
And here, it's like
you're going to hide

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:15.910
for the next few months, and
then just resell the coins

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.050
right after.

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:18.190
What is the time frame?

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:21.370
GARY GENSLER: So
Alexis's observation

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:25.330
is this might shorten the time
frame for venture capitalists.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:29.530
I would say yes during
this 2017-2018 period.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.510
I don't know if
that will persist.

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:36.770
But yes, I think that, for
venture capitalists saying,

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:39.680
well, I can be taken up
by selling the company,

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.580
I can be taken out
of my investor term--

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.000
how am I going to sell my
investment, my take out?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.650
I can take the company public,
I can sell the company, or maybe

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:57.960
I can ICO, and if
you can do it sooner.

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.060
And what happened a lot in
the fall of '17 and into '18

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:03.710
is many venture
capitalists changed

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.060
their standard contracts and
their standard documentation

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:11.390
when they were
investing in start ups

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.740
to say also that they could
participate in the ICO round

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:17.630
and that they could participate
in the early rounds.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.442
But if you're assessing
an ICO and you're

00:31:19.442 --> 00:31:20.900
thinking about
investing in it, you

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.530
want to know what venture
capitalists are backing it.

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.150
And then a big thing
that folks look at--

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.970
I put it fifth on the
list, as you can see--

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:33.770
is what's the community.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.480
How many Redis
post, Medium posts?

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.385
How many people are following
Bitcoin talk, et cetera,

00:31:38.385 --> 00:31:39.260
et cetera, et cetera?

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:42.370
There's eight or 10 of
these talk channels.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.020
And I don't know
the ratios anymore,

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.750
but it used to be
if you could get

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.530
to like 7,000 to 10,000
folks following you on Reddit

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.300
and Medium and
everything, you knew

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:55.910
you could raise
a successful ICO.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.000
Like in the heyday, if
you could get your numbers

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.820
to a certain
following, then that

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:07.920
was enough momentum to raise
your $15 to $30 million.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.030
I think that's probably
a little less so now.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:11.660
Tom?

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.160
AUDIENCE: I mean, this is just
the definition of the greater

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.570
fool theory, right?

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.980
If enough people believe
that your token is valuable,

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.610
then it's valuable.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:23.490
So I get that it's the fifth
thing on the list for a reason.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.323
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:32:24.323 --> 00:32:26.100
But if you're a
momentum investor

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.420
and you're just saying--

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.730
or if it's FOMO
investing as Sabrina

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.988
said, to see how big
the community is.

00:32:33.988 --> 00:32:35.280
And is there an interest in it?

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:36.860
Does this have a following?

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.850
I said I'm neither a
maximalist nor a minimalist.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:43.260
I'm just not--

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.150
I'm not trying to--

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.320
but this is real economics.

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:51.630
If you had 100,000 people
following in a community,

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.760
probably more likely
it's a successful ICO

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.960
in terms of raising money.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.840
It doesn't mean it's going to be
successful as a token later on.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.490
Here?

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:05.960
AUDIENCE: You don't actually
use it as a specific criterion,

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.650
but you can use it maybe as
a filter, the first filter.

00:33:10.650 --> 00:33:12.990
If you have that
the person who's

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.750
publishing the white
paper has not been posted,

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:18.540
he's never been
there, then it raises

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.840
a little bit of suspicion.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:23.760
And then you have to
go on and do some more

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.860
research on the paper, on the
idea, on the guy, whatever.

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.230
GARY GENSLER: It is a way
to see whether there's

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:34.485
other people even tuning
in and showing interest.

00:33:37.045 --> 00:33:38.670
And it could be the
greater fool theory

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:41.940
just because if Tim
Draper, Mike Novogratz

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.960
is invested, who are both
very savvy investors and very

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.030
successful investors, you
might say, do I want to be in?

00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:52.050
Or is that my time to
say it's not to be in,

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.750
because they've already
gotten the best of it.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:59.090
Either way, I mean, they're
still good investors.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.430
What's their monetary policy?

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.830
Again, how's it
going to affect--

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:07.760
can they-- is it one
of the majority that

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.324
has a fixed monetary policy?

00:34:09.324 --> 00:34:10.699
Or is it one of
the minority that

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:14.800
has no monetary policy at all?

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.449
How did they
distribute the tokens?

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:17.545
And I mean in two ways.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.590
Basically, some will actually
disclose a cap table,

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.699
a capitalization table of
the tokens, the same way

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:31.159
you can think of a
capitalization table of equity,

00:34:31.159 --> 00:34:35.320
but who owns the tokens
pre-sale and post-sale.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.690
So that's what I mean
by token distribution.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:42.752
Are they keeping 10% for the
founder or 80% for the founder?

00:34:42.752 --> 00:34:45.880
It might change your
view on all of it.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.850
But also token distribution
is how are they selling it

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:54.100
during what's usually a 30 to
60 day period or 15 to 60 day

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:54.940
period.

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:58.270
The longest that I am
aware of is 350 days.

00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:00.940
EOS sold over 350 days.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:04.940
Every day was a form
of a Dutch auction.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:09.610
It was a remarkable way
that they sold 4.2 billion.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.220
I doubt that anybody who
did EOS at the beginning

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.262
thought they were going
to raise over $1 billion.

00:35:14.262 --> 00:35:17.500
In fact, maybe nobody thought
they'd raise over $100 million,

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:21.270
because they started
in the summer of '17.

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.360
But they did a
distribution over 350 days.

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.270
Most, though, are done
over 15 to 60 days or so.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:28.920
Please.

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:32.670
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.470
how are ICOs accounted for?

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.950
Do they go as equity
on their revenue?

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:39.192
Where do they fall?

00:35:39.192 --> 00:35:40.650
GARY GENSLER: So
terrific question.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:46.640
How are ICO proceeds
accounted for?

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.550
Who's our accountant?

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.590
Aviva?

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:50.627
AUDIENCE: No idea.

00:35:50.627 --> 00:35:52.460
GARY GENSLER: All right,
no idea from Aviva.

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.930
I want to try to
answer it, but anybody?

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.560
AUDIENCE: I think that's
another important feature.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:02.150
It's the token economics, how
you use potential incentive,

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:07.310
[INAUDIBLE] and for the
profit of the project,

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.540
the project would
repurchase their tokens

00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:14.108
in a way similar to a dividend.

00:36:14.108 --> 00:36:15.650
GARY GENSLER: But
how do you book it?

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.390
What's the debit and
what's the credit?

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.700
AUDIENCE: Marketable
securities and cash.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:23.950
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:36:23.950 --> 00:36:25.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:28.545
GARY GENSLER: I hope this works.

00:36:28.545 --> 00:36:31.280
You know of the
T account, right?

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.280
We've got the T account.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:36.368
Over here's cash, right?

00:36:36.368 --> 00:36:38.410
Because you receive cash
when you sell something.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:40.410
What's the credit item?

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:41.410
AUDIENCE: Question mark.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:42.460
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.410
AUDIENCE: Retained earnings.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.190
GARY GENSLER: You think
it's retained earnings?

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.773
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:45.773 --> 00:36:48.450
GARY GENSLER: You think
it's just retained earnings?

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.480
AUDIENCE: They're
selling nothing.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.480
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.760
So the question
is, is it earnings?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.520
Is it a revenue item
when you sell it?

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.400
Or some people book it
as deferred revenue.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.660
So there's two ways
you can book it.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.260
You could also book
it as a liability,

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:13.650
but it's either deferred
revenue or current revenue.

00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:16.080
All right, what could
motivate you to book

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.710
it as a deferred revenue
instead of current revenue?

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:20.367
What's that?

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:21.450
AUDIENCE: Taxes, probably.

00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:22.650
GARY GENSLER: Taxes.

00:37:22.650 --> 00:37:24.660
So some book it as
deferred revenues,

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:27.390
because they don't
want to book taxes.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:31.320
And God knows whether
that's really the right way

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.340
to book it.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:39.380
And others book it right as
a revenue item right now.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:41.800
But I don't know of anybody,
whether they're booking it

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.600
as deferred revenues or
current revenues, that

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:49.770
wants to book it to trigger
that it's a security.

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:53.640
So most law firms that I
understand, they're not they're

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:57.000
not accountants, but they
don't want their clients

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.630
to book it in a way that will
make it look more like equity.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:05.630
So it's either deferred
revenue or current revenue.

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.760
Some, I've heard, have
called it a liability,

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.730
but I think that's the minority.

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:12.730
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if it takes too much time

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:18.760
to go through a use case to
make these examples tangible.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:21.070
If I'm promising
to deliver a good,

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:27.220
then the company is getting
back the tokens, right?

00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:32.310
How do you put it back
out again in the market?

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:34.560
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is what is the use case.

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.750
So some use cases,
the token is issued

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:40.340
and it's really
for the community.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.130
And some tokens come
back to the company.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:46.970
So a file storage,
Filecoin, for instance,

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:52.490
they raised $250-some
million, the equivalent of.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.230
And in that case,
I think the token

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:57.680
would be used
within the community

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:01.010
rather than back to the company.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.290
So even like
Ethereum, when you use

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:08.690
Ethereum as a form of
buying computing power,

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:11.800
it doesn't go back to
the Ethereum Foundation.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:15.750
So the most dominant--

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:19.550
and that's why it really should
be booked as current revenue,

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:23.330
because it's not even that the
software provider is providing

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.240
a service later.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.850
The most dominant use
case is, like in Ethereum,

00:39:30.850 --> 00:39:36.620
that you're using the Eth for
other people in the network.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.890
It's a monetary unit
that's not coming back.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:42.880
There are some
where it comes back,

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:48.910
and then it's basically returned
to the corporate treasury.

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:52.176
So it's two different models.

00:39:52.176 --> 00:39:53.807
Have I lost you or
are you with me?

00:39:53.807 --> 00:39:54.682
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:54.682 --> 00:39:56.470
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:01.020
One way is that it gets
returned to the company.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:04.740
That's the more narrow case.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.390
Usually, it's you're selling
a token that will be used.

00:40:07.390 --> 00:40:09.660
And I'll give it to
Eilon, because Eilon

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.510
gives me file storage.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:13.200
Eilon will give it
to Tom, because Tom

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.730
gives Eilon file storage.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.570
In Ethereum, it literally
keeps going around

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:21.540
and it doesn't get returned to--

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:26.680
it never gets burned and
never gets extinguished

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.300
and handed back to the company.

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:34.900
AUDIENCE: And the pricing
strategy on that first issuance

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:37.510
depends then on the value
of, if it's storage,

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:40.330
on the value of storing--

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.050
GARY GENSLER: Well, in theory--

00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.700
it's theory.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.210
I think that a lot of this has
been on speculation and FOMO

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:51.610
and things like that and a
bubble, a 15 month or 18 month

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.510
bubble.

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.700
But on theory,
yes, it should be--

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.740
to be in equilibrium,
it should be

00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:01.480
a discount to the
future value of storage,

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:04.930
because today you're
buying a token that you

00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:07.530
might be able to use tomorrow.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.580
But because there's a
probability weighting

00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:13.610
that you won't be able to
use it if they don't complete

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:17.300
the software, if they
don't complete the rollout,

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.520
it should sell at
a-- in equilibrium,

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:26.730
it should sell at a discount
to its eventual utility value.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:29.170
That would be where it
would be in equilibrium.

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:30.550
Shimon?

00:41:30.550 --> 00:41:31.900
AUDIENCE: So this is a question.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:37.840
Even in the bad
use case, they're

00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:41.160
not pre-determining
what one unit of coin

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:43.017
is good for, right?

00:41:43.017 --> 00:41:44.100
GARY GENSLER: Usually not.

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:47.040
Some white papers
do, but usually not.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:49.140
AUDIENCE: Because
it's not just--

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.480
if they told you,
OK, one unit will

00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.933
buy you one terabyte of
storage, now, of course,

00:41:53.933 --> 00:41:55.350
the value of a
terabyte of storage

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.558
would depend on the electricity,
cost of electricity,

00:41:57.558 --> 00:41:59.623
and hardware, and all
that stuff in the future--

00:41:59.623 --> 00:42:01.790
I don't know-- and the
supply, and blah, blah, blah.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:09.360
[INAUDIBLE] It's very hard to
pin down the fundamental value

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:15.080
of that coin outside of
how it's going to scale

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.090
and how the community will
be and all that stuff,

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:22.980
because there's no
clear allocation

00:42:22.980 --> 00:42:25.500
between the coin and the
service that you would get.

00:42:28.375 --> 00:42:29.250
Does that make sense?

00:42:31.328 --> 00:42:32.370
GARY GENSLER: Let me see.

00:42:32.370 --> 00:42:36.095
You're asking absolutely
the right question.

00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:38.220
It's one that I've been
kicking around a little bit

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:42.120
with a couple other faculty
members in the finance group

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:46.590
here, with Antoinette and Leonid
who have done a lot of research

00:42:46.590 --> 00:42:47.770
in this area.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.100
And we're all like,
we're not sure exactly.

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:52.230
And these are some
of the most world

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:54.950
class talented finance faculty.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:43:00.990
Like, how do you really get
to the value of a token, one,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.720
when there's so little
written in these white papers

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.590
about this specificity?

00:43:06.590 --> 00:43:09.540
And I gave one reading, which
was Christian's reading,

00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.960
and I apologize, because
it has a lot of formulas

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.230
and everything.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.390
But he grapples with this.

00:43:15.390 --> 00:43:17.220
Where is it in equilibrium?

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.942
What's the equilibrium price?

00:43:18.942 --> 00:43:20.400
And the equilibrium
price should be

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.560
some discount to
that future value

00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.920
of the service or the good.

00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.670
And if there is more uncertainty
of what that service or good,

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.880
it almost has to be
a greater discount.

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.780
And yet, it appears that the
market has been pricing it

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.600
at a way premium.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.920
So I think, if you
didn't take anything

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.920
from Christian's paper,
that's what I was trying

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.740
to-- that the market
has been at a premium,

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:48.710
even though it probably
should be discounted.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.300
And that's why issuers--

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:53.720
that's why entrepreneurs have
tapped into it, because it's

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:56.910
a form of cheap financing.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.438
It's been a remarkable
area of cheap financing.

00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:00.938
Please.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:07.997
AUDIENCE: So as we look
forward to Filecoin [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:07.997 --> 00:44:10.080
so if we look at that and
we flash forward to when

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.900
it's actually functional
and whatever--

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.210
GARY GENSLER: And
it's no longer SAFT.

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.250
AUDIENCE: When it
actually ever comes out,

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.706
so is the idea that
Filecoin at that point

00:44:19.706 --> 00:44:21.450
would transition to
realized revenue?

00:44:21.450 --> 00:44:25.200
And then if I pay
Don, three Filecoins

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:28.470
or whatever the unit is for
storage, that he books that

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:31.380
as income and is taxed on that?

00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:35.580
Has there been any
thought as to how--

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:37.230
GARY GENSLER: If Don
is selling files,

00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:40.020
yes, he would have to book
income, as I understand it.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:44.280
And you're transferring a coin,
just like you're transferring

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:47.940
a euro or a yen or a dollar.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:53.520
And at the time, the IRS
has spoken to this five,

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.020
six years ago.

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.170
It's marked to
market value the day

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:02.700
that you, in essence,
deliver the service

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.960
and receive the coin.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.030
I mean, I'm not
entirely sure what

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:07.800
happens if you get
the coin a day later,

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.690
but it's basically
the market value

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:18.330
at an exchange rate that day
back to Fiat, always translated

00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.380
back to the Fiat currency,
in this case the US dollar.

00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:27.900
AUDIENCE: So if you
extend that example,

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.570
where does Filecoin gain
revenue on the transaction

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.580
between Andrew and Don?

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:33.775
Are they charging
a transaction fee?

00:45:33.775 --> 00:45:34.900
GARY GENSLER: I don't know.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.290
I'll try to figure that
out by next Tuesday,

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.590
because we get ICOs twice.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:44.290
I'll dig in and try to answer,
and if anybody else knows.

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:50.290
But the revenue models vary
with thousands of these.

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:53.970
Whether, in essence,
Filecoin's entire revenue model

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:54.835
was the ICO?

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.620
No?

00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:03.050
The second big piece
of the revenue model

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.990
is retaining some ownership.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.330
So let's look at
Ripple, the company.

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.390
Ripple, the company, though they
did their genesis block back

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:18.270
in 2013, they basically
distributed 20% of their tokens

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:20.970
and kept 80%.

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.000
And subsequently, they
have been slowly selling

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.980
and they're now down to 61%.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.700
But their revenue model
on XRP is, in essence,

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:33.310
selling the XRP.

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.400
They only came up with
a real use case of XRP

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.580
in 2018 in a prototype
called XRapid.

00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.840
They had XCurrent, which was
a messaging system prior that

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.660
didn't need to use XRP at all.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:51.810
So for four years,
you had no use of XRP,

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:55.190
as I understand it zero use.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:59.320
Today, it's the second
highest valued cryptocurrency.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:02.990
It's past Ethereum with
the fall-off of the value

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:04.936
of Ethereum and Bitcoin.

00:47:04.936 --> 00:47:09.110
And at $18 billion, I couldn't
tell you what it's worth.

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:13.660
I can tell you that's what
coinmarket.com or .cap says

00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:15.900
they're worth.

00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:20.770
But their revenue model is
selling XRP in that case.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.030
And so many of them,
their revenue models

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:29.330
are the initial ICO, keep a
bucket, whether you keep 10%,

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:33.140
or in that case it was 80%, and
then try to monetize and sell

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.880
it over time.

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:40.110
And even in Ethereum, which
was, in essence, an ICO,

00:47:40.110 --> 00:47:44.920
they kept about 9% in
the Ethereum Foundation.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:48.570
They're down to 1% ownership
in the Ethereum Foundation.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.370
So they don't receive--
and when Ethereum

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:54.000
moves around the network, the
Ethereum Foundation and Vitalik

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.740
Buterin don't
receive any of that.

00:47:58.530 --> 00:48:01.600
But I'd have to look at Filecoin
to see whether, in essence,

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.120
they burn any.

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.330
In essence, does any of
it go back to the issuer?

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:07.770
I don't think so,
but I'll check.

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.766
Take this, and then we'll move
on to a couple statistics.

00:48:13.766 --> 00:48:17.100
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
who is regulating the ICO.

00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:18.100
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.750
So who regulates
the ICOs we're going

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.750
to talk a lot about on Tuesday
after Thanksgiving, when we

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:27.520
can thank and eat some turkey.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:28.990
So can we hold that for Tuesday?

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:32.848
But it really depends
on the jurisdiction.

00:48:32.848 --> 00:48:35.140
Here in the US, it would be
the Securities and Exchange

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.760
Commission, because
most of these

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:41.560
are really non-compliant
securities offerings.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:47.587
And last Friday, the
SEC put out a release.

00:48:47.587 --> 00:48:49.420
I mean, they've put out
many, many releases.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:52.060
But last Friday's,
maybe we'll put that up.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.430
Sabrina and Thalita
if you remind me,

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.670
I'll shoot you a link and
we'll put it into Canvas.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:59.230
But it's only two
or three pages.

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:00.688
But for the first
time, they really

00:49:00.688 --> 00:49:02.970
talked about illegal
securities offerings.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.860
So they used the word illegal.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:07.810
And they're starting
to get to the place

00:49:07.810 --> 00:49:11.530
where they're shutting some
of these down that were not

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:16.800
necessarily scammy
or fraudy, but just

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:18.330
saying you didn't register.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:25.050
But generally speaking, it
would be securities regulators,

00:49:25.050 --> 00:49:27.320
if it's regulated.

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:30.110
In some jurisdictions, it's not.

00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:31.610
So this is the most
important thing.

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:36.600
Can you assess the
viability of token use case?

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.340
You remember my little slides.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.410
But again, it's the
strategic questions.

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:44.220
And these are the same questions
I'm asking you to think about

00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:46.050
in your final papers.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:48.510
Basically, what's the
value creation proposition

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:49.350
or pain points?

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.060
What are competitors doing?

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:54.060
How are competitors
facing off in this?

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:55.620
And if you're
looking at any ICO,

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.480
just think about the
competitive landscape.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:00.960
Some of them are quite populated
with a lot of competition.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:04.180
File storage, Filecoin
is not the only one,

00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.180
so you look at the others
and see how they're

00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:09.390
addressing the same issues.

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:12.090
And really, why is a
blockchain technology or native

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.920
token even the solution?

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.900
And then you get
digging into it.

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.200
Why do you need an
append only log?

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.660
What verification and networking
cost are actually addressed?

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:28.010
What transactions are
actually recorded on a ledger?

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.060
I mean, these are the
basic building blocks

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.210
that if you take anything
away, hopefully it's

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:41.060
this one page of questions
to have some critical skills

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.100
as you go off and
somebody says, well, I've

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:48.980
got this great blockchain
idea or great token.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:53.120
And then not to forget all the
darn challenges that we still

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:59.060
have-- scalability, performance,
privacy, security, network

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.360
coordination, and
interoperability.

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:06.750
I know only you say there's no
challenges of interoperability.

00:51:06.750 --> 00:51:09.757
AUDIENCE: No, no, no, don't
put words in my mouth.

00:51:09.757 --> 00:51:11.840
GARY GENSLER: So these,
I'm not going to rereview,

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.978
but they're going
to be in Canvas

00:51:13.978 --> 00:51:15.020
if you want to grab them.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:19.250
I mean, this is the same
conceptual framework for an ICO

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:22.220
or even in a
permissioned blockchain,

00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.880
which I sense a lot of you
are thinking about doing.

00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.930
So some statistics, and
then we'll close it out.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:30.110
And these are just fun charts
that will all be in Canvas.

00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:33.620
And I just went around
finding different websites.

00:51:33.620 --> 00:51:37.970
I don't know that you can
trust any of these numbers,

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:40.350
but they're the best
numbers out there.

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:43.210
So here are some
of the industries.

00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:45.320
23% is infrastructure.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.730
That's $5 billion of raised,
but most of that, I think,

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:50.960
is the EOS.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.290
I think that's called an
infrastructure project,

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.120
infrastructure
because EOS is trying

00:51:56.120 --> 00:51:58.230
to compete with Ethereum.

00:51:58.230 --> 00:52:01.710
Finance communication trading
and investment payments,

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:07.140
you see some consistency, a lot
of financial sector use cases.

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:12.080
Gaming, and then you're
down to 2% and 3% slices.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.640
So there's just a little sense
of some of the industries.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.420
And again, this will
all be on Canvas.

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:18.980
Here's published ICOs.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:22.520
We peaked at about 500 a
month, 400 or 500 a month

00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:25.010
in February through April.

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.290
We're down to about
200 a month now.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:29.910
Now, this means published.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:32.490
That doesn't mean they've
necessarily raised.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:35.910
We're just under about 5,000
that have been published.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.360
Maybe 3,000 give or take
have raised some money.

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.160
And only about half
of those actually

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:45.360
exist today, or that you can
find them somewhere and so

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:46.330
forth.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.490
The market-- this is the third
quarter based on a website

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.710
called ICO Rating.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:55.320
They publish a quarterly report.

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.750
I'm not saying it's
completely exhaustive.

00:52:57.750 --> 00:53:03.040
1.8 billion ICOs raised
down 78% from Q2,

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:05.560
just to give you a
sense of the size.

00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:09.400
But $1 billion of blockchain
VC raised in the same quarter.

00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:16.770
ICOs surpassed VC
investment in blockchain

00:53:16.770 --> 00:53:18.660
in the third quarter of '17.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:22.340
Before that, VC
raise was higher.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:23.670
And I think it's coming back.

00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:27.930
And it's a reasonable shot that
in one or two more quarters,

00:53:27.930 --> 00:53:30.660
the VC number will be
higher than the ICO number.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:34.830
But this is just a hunch
as to where we're headed.

00:53:34.830 --> 00:53:38.635
Some other statistics--
of the 600,

00:53:38.635 --> 00:53:43.350
this is one quarter, about 200
a month or 600 for the quarter

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:47.820
that they tracked, 84% are
on the Ethereum and platform.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:52.620
Almost every data source I can
find ranges from 80% to 85%.

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:56.450
So it's still highly focused
on Ethereum platform.

00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:00.600
And I would say as the
ICO boom comes off,

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.670
it's probably also
one of the reasons

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:06.120
that Ethereum, the price
and valuation of Ethereum

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:12.520
has come off as well, just
because of the relationships.

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.490
Only 4% of these
600, or 24 of them,

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:19.310
got listed on an exchange,
that they raised enough money.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:20.290
But look at that.

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:24.750
57% raised less than
$100,000 a piece.

00:54:24.750 --> 00:54:27.410
So it's highly
concentrated in a small--

00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:33.430
67% percent of the DApp
ICos were unsuccessful,

00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:35.320
whatever their measurement
of unsuccessful.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:39.850
They didn't raise money or they
raised a little bit of money,

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:41.260
but the website went dark.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:44.520
That's all within three months.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:47.970
And again, I can't speak to
how they measure success.

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:53.470
But 76% were just an idea.

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.540
This is, again,
based on ICO rating.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:55:00.715
And 1.37%-- you were at 1%?

00:55:00.715 --> 00:55:03.320
You were at 5%?

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.510
But 1.7% had their code.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:09.850
So 3% were either fully ready
or had their source code.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.140
So you want to read the white
paper if you're really curious.

00:55:15.140 --> 00:55:18.830
But 76%, you might say how can
you raise money on an idea?

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:20.710
This is really prefunding.

00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:24.020
And this is even after
the bloom is off the rose.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:29.190
This is the third quarter 2018.

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:32.220
Here's the industries again
for the third quarter--

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:35.590
exchanges and wallets,
financial services, trading.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:43.550
So it's deeply finance, a little
bit health care, and so forth.

00:55:43.550 --> 00:55:44.213
And let's see.

00:55:44.213 --> 00:55:45.880
I think I have one
or two more of these.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.500
Oh, this is how they've done.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:48.800
This is interesting to me.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.040
This is the returns
in the third quarter.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.340
Now, I know this is
actually before the sell-off

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.400
for the last week and a half.

00:55:56.400 --> 00:56:00.000
The only sector
that went up is--

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.540
I don't even know
which ICOs these are--

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:05.710
the marketing and advertising.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.552
Everything else got clobbered.

00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:13.310
I've been around markets for
a long time, three or four

00:56:13.310 --> 00:56:14.270
decades.

00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:17.990
When you get this type
of return picture,

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:22.650
there's going to be fewer
ICOs rather than more ICOs,

00:56:22.650 --> 00:56:26.940
because it just keeps cutting
down the investor enthusiasm.

00:56:26.940 --> 00:56:30.380
I don't think it's FOMO anymore.

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.000
What's the opposite of FOMO?

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.347
AUDIENCE: Here.

00:56:33.347 --> 00:56:34.430
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:43.560
So all right, so study
questions for next Tuesday

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:46.850
is just we're going
to go back to ICOs,

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:48.740
talk a little bit about
the scams and frauds.

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:50.948
We're going to talk about
the Securities and Exchange

00:56:50.948 --> 00:56:51.500
Commission.

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.070
We've already talked a lot
about their design feature.

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:57.800
So it's going to be
like going back to some

00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:59.030
of the regulatory things.

00:56:59.030 --> 00:57:04.080
I'll try to look up on the
Filecoin questions as well.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.840
We will drop one
more reading in,

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:07.790
which is just this
quick two-pager

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.030
from the SEC from
last Friday that

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.080
may be worthwhile looking at.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.300
And this is the
best thing I could

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:17.570
do to say Happy Thanksgiving.

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:22.010
I know it's a Bitcoin
turkey, blockchain turkey,

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:23.120
and the like.

00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:27.350
But I do think it's
an interesting thing.

00:57:27.350 --> 00:57:30.020
ICOs are a new means
of crowdfunding.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:32.270
And there's been so many
different ways to raise money

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:34.340
over centuries.

00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:38.630
This is not equity, it's not
debt, it's something else.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:41.300
I don't know how much of
it will last three and five

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:46.010
years from now, but the
idea that you could pre-fund

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:49.770
an idea, a deferred
revenue or some sort,

00:57:49.770 --> 00:57:55.040
but it's not your revenue,
is an interesting evolution

00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.560
in the markets of finance.

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.350
But I think if you can't assess
the viability of the use case

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:03.440
and figure out what
really is the benefit

00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:05.170
of the token economics--

00:58:05.170 --> 00:58:08.840
that comes back to, is
there really a benefit

00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.390
to having a native
token on a network

00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:16.400
for a good or a service, for
file storage, for ride sharing,

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.460
and so forth?

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:20.903
And then I think this will
just be looked back-- decades

00:58:20.903 --> 00:58:22.820
from now, people look
back and say, well, that

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:26.630
was a small, little,
odd thing that happened

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:29.340
back there in the 2010s.

00:58:29.340 --> 00:58:31.800
But it might be.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.230
I'm not all the way to zero.

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:36.150
I think there might
be a reason why

00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:38.850
folks want to have
a native currency,

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:43.260
a native token to
jumpstart a network

00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:46.800
and to motivate a network
over time, whether it's

00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:52.410
like swords and skins and
shields in a gaming site.

00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.410
The majority of ICOs
have failed already.

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.607
And because they keep
failing so fast--

00:58:58.607 --> 00:59:00.190
I don't know-- by
the end of this year

00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:03.150
or certainly by the middle
of next year, over 90% or 95%

00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:08.430
of them will have failed, like
if you take the whole total.

00:59:08.430 --> 00:59:10.490
So it's pretty clear
it's going to come down.

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:12.240
There's going to be
less and less probably

00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.820
in this ICO thing.

00:59:13.820 --> 00:59:16.630
It doesn't mean that
blockchain technology is over.

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:20.070
It just means that this
wave, I think, will diminish.

00:59:23.020 --> 00:59:25.325
So Happy Thanksgiving.

00:59:25.325 --> 00:59:26.700
Is there a question
before we all

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.997
go to Thanksgiving and
airports and trains?

00:59:28.997 --> 00:59:30.330
AUDIENCE: Just a quick question.

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:39.382
Does any ICO take ownership of
the company besides [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:39.382 --> 00:59:41.340
GARY GENSLER: So we'll
talk about this Tuesday.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:43.710
The question is,
can you ever have

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:48.190
an ownership right in a token?

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:50.280
The answer is yes,
you could structure

00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:55.130
it to have voting rights,
governance rights, dividend

00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.630
rights.

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:58.780
There are a handful
that have done that.

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:02.860
But after the DAO
or DAO issuance,

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:07.110
which did give some governance
rights and cash flow rights,

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:11.760
the SEC spoke to that in a paper
one year ago or 15 months ago.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.110
There's very few of them.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:16.350
Most of them are what you would
call either utility tokens

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.080
or service tokens,
where you have a right

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:21.780
to get a service
or a good usually

01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.840
from the rest of that
network, rather than back.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:28.720
I'll check on Filecoin, but the
answer is yes you can do it,

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.780
but it's a rare
case that does it.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.380
So thank you.

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.730
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:00:32.730 --> 01:00:34.590
Thank you for all
being in this class.

01:00:34.590 --> 01:00:36.440
[APPLAUSE]

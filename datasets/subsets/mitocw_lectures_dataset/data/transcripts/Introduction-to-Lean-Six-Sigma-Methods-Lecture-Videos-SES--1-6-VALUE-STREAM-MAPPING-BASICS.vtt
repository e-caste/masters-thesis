00:00:29.255 --> 00:00:31.130
PROFESSOR: First, I
want, on a personal note,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.672
I went through the
course this summer

00:00:32.672 --> 00:00:35.830
and I'm really happy to
see so many health care,

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.060
or so many attending from the
health care sector, because I

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.700
think in the future
it's going to be quite

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.630
impossible to function
in good structures

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.170
without knowing something
about this process improvement,

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.917
Lean Six Sigma.

00:00:53.917 --> 00:00:55.750
Because otherwise, I
don't think that you're

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.210
going to be able to contribute
in a good and productive

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.870
manner.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.130
So, really important, and
very nice to see you all here.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.030
All right.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.240
At the end of this, you'll be
able to sketch a basic value

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.370
stream map, demonstrate some
basic analysis of those maps,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.380
and then recognize some steps
for process improvement using

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.450
your value stream map.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.080
You recognize this?

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.810
Back to the hot dog stand.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.720
And it may not look exactly
like the ones you made.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.840
So, starts with
taking the order,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.480
placing it in the "in" tray.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.060
Get the order, cook the
dogs, put them in the bun,

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.800
and wrap them at the fruit.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.650
And then it's a
question of, do they

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.120
need another hot dog or not?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.610
If they don't, they will
go up to the order out,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.910
if they do then you go over.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.100
Check if the order is OK.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.080
At the beverage delivered
to the customer,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.710
and the customer leaves
with their hot dogs.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.440
So, value, as we think
about it in Lean,

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.270
is really value
for the customer.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.220
it's not value for us.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.295
And in particular
in health care,

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:19.890
we know so much about
the engineering side.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.220
But in health care we really
have a difficult time coming

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.060
to terms with this.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.270
We struggle with it, because
it is oftentimes about,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.020
how do things work best
for us, and not so much,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.675
how do things work
best for the patients?

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.950
If it was the other
way, we probably

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.478
wouldn't have waiting rooms.

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:40.520
We do have waiting rooms.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.200
We have waiting rooms all over.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.610
In fact, I work in the
Emergency Department over at BI,

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.060
and we have recently
decided that we're

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.100
going to make it
a formal process

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.560
to open our waiting room.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.720
Because we don't really
want it, and it's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.000
going to be paged out
as a formal process,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.540
as a formal step, that
now we decide we open it,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.190
and we will not
have it open if we

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.620
have any open beds
in the Department,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.660
because it doesn't
make any sense.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.920
Anyway, that would be
value for the customer.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.470
Identify the value
stream, map out

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.810
the end to end linkages between
the processes, what goes on.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.060
Then we focus on
making flow continuous

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.690
from one end to the other.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.570
Pull, that we heard
about earlier on.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.820
Let the customer
pull the value rather

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.600
than us producing a whole bunch
of things that then get piled

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.510
up and some of it gets wasted.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.850
Then we do it over
and over again,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.480
because we're never really
going to reach perfection.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.380
But we're going to strive
for the perfection.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.640
So value stream mapping, it's a
tool to improve our processes,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.660
our whole production,
by identifying

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.610
steps that add value.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.290
And also by identifying
waste in our processes.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.990
We follow the value
creation process,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.630
we talked about, from
one end to the other.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.760
And you need to go
to Gemba to get out

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.040
there and see what happens.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.200
You can't sit in an office--

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.790
you can sit in an
office and you can

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.210
think that you know what
is actually happening.

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.840
But in reality you don't.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.550
I have some examples,
I'll get to that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.840
a little later, from our final
hospital, if we have the time.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.620
But when you go and look at
what actually takes place,

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.890
you get surprised,
even in the environment

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.000
that you work in yourself.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.370
Because we all think that
we have the solutions

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.510
to the problems that we
encounter, and sometimes we do,

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.490
and sometimes we actually don't.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.630
The value stream map is the
process maps that we've done.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.540
Some of you have
already added your data.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.820
It can be time data, it can
be quality data, inventory,

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.900
resources, people,
things, and whatever else.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.080
But don't clot your
maps with things that

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.160
are not really useful for you.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.080
So there are some steps to
creating these values to be

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:21.560
maps, and the first is to
define customer value, and then

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.700
the process.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.155
And we can discuss
what customer value is.

00:05:27.155 --> 00:05:29.630
That is a debate you can
see among yourselves here

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:31.430
with the maps that
you've created.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.100
You did not all
agree on what adds

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.530
value, what
customers potentially

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.660
would be willing to pay for.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.360
An example.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:45.170
We've just done a Lean project
with our registration people.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.610
Patients need to be
registered, right?

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.860
And is that a value
added process?

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.660
We weren't quite
agreeing on that,

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.290
at least not initially, because
you can say, well, I mean,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.180
patients, they don't care.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.950
But in fact, if you
dig a little deeper

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.770
they probably do, because
if you aren't registered,

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.720
your visit is not
linked to your record,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.460
and then it's not
part of your history.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.920
And then it's hard to
tie everything together.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.250
So identify the value
added and the waste

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.870
steps is the next one.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.180
And then, in order
to change things

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.890
for the better in
the future, you

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:21.530
need to understand what
you're currently doing.

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.960
So you do a map of
the current state.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.420
Where are we now?

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.400
And then you analyze that map
and you find opportunities

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.590
for improving things.

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:39.110
You can look at bottlenecks,
you can look at work load

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.920
balancing, and you can have
that as an open discussion

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.020
of what can you make better.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.047
And now you've just heard
the module on people.

00:06:50.047 --> 00:06:51.380
And that's actually interesting.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.950
If you involve everybody
in this process,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.400
you can get a lot of
good synergy in it.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.940
And by involving
some of the skeptics

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.830
you can actually win
them over sometimes.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.080
We've done that too,
surprisingly enough.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.540
But it is possible.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.180
Then you use that to create
your future state map,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.890
and then you make an
action plan for how

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.400
you are going to get there.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:20.520
And I think we'll get to that on
day three, in the A3 thinking.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:26.040
All right, we're back to this
one that follows the value

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.450
creation process.

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:30.920
And you have, in
your groups, assessed

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:35.390
the values and the wastes
for each of the processes.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:39.140
And now it's time
to add some data.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.590
I think that we'll
just go with the map

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.700
that you had handed out, all
the data should be on it.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.820
Time's in seconds, and there's
some quality measurements

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.245
as well, because
the processes there

00:07:53.245 --> 00:07:55.120
weren't perfect the
whole way through, right?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.260
It was 100% every time.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.410
We know our demand, our
current demand at least,

00:08:00.410 --> 00:08:02.790
for the 50 customers.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.860
And we know how long
we're open, so we

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:10.350
know how long time we have to
fulfill the orders as they are.

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.770
The takt time is
our available times.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:18.180
It's 4 hours time 60 minutes,
that should be 240 minutes.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.370
And the demand is 50 customers.

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:26.430
So we have 4.8, or 288
seconds per customer.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:31.680
We also know that the cycle
time from what we added up

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:36.159
is actually 446 seconds.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:39.030
So we can all understand that
they're pretty stressed, right,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.169
because they're spending more
time than they really have.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.330
And then there's the
alternative calculation

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:51.030
where you've taken the set out
and the clean out time out.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.520
Some of you might have
been thinking about that

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.500
and done that when
things are slow.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.130
And that gives you a
little shorter takt time.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.590
But there's still an imbalance
between the takt time

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:02.430
and the cycle time.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.270
So you're still in the negative.

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:06.940
But you have two workers.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:11.330
So the question is, can
you meet their demands?

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:12.080
All right.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.410
If you take the second
handout that you

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.460
got, with the
different processes on,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.960
write down in your groups.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.900
You have 10 minutes, you'll
get a warning after 7.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.610
Write down who is doing what,
how much time they're spending,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:32.270
and then as well whether it's
value added or non value added.

00:09:35.313 --> 00:09:36.980
All right, we're going
to start off here

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:38.720
because you look very ready.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.070
You're starting to search
for solutions, here.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:47.450
Sasha, how much is
he working, or she.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.390
GUEST SPEAKER 1: 159, OK.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:53.030
Andy?

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.920
224.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.330
OK, now, Wait and Neither
should be the same.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:02.600
So let's look at value
added, non value added.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:09.800
209, 174, 63 wait.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:15.348
All right, that
seems reasonable.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:16.640
Let's see if other folks agree.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.610
And again, just like
last time, these things

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.350
are kind of open
to interpretation.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:24.470
Hopefully, actually, this
mix is pretty prescribed,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.490
but this is up to your judgment.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.970
So we're expecting some
different answers here.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.760
So this time we've got,
basically because we

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.550
constrained the problem down,
these answers tend to agree,

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.630
these are still, people
have different opinions

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:42.930
about different things.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:44.970
And so we have a
fair range there.

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:47.750
But it does look
like, as an over all,

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.790
that this isn't a bad process.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.980
There's more value added
than non value added.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.688
So that's pretty good, actually.

00:10:54.688 --> 00:10:56.480
So these people are
not wasting their time.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.480
But there is a substantial
fraction of non value

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.880
added and wait time
in the process.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.390
And what can we say
about Sasha and Andy?

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:06.125
Balanced process?

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.890
No.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:14.600
That may be an
opportunity to do better,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.090
and gets right at
this issue of, well,

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.880
our cycle time, our
takt time, the time

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.120
that each individual
person is working

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.530
don't match up right now.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:28.513
So back to Bo, and we'll see
where we can go from here.

00:11:28.513 --> 00:11:29.930
PROFESSOR: And you
could also say,

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:32.390
with the differences
on the value

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.060
added and the non
value added time,

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:38.030
what would you do to understand
that better, now we're sitting

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.530
and doing it on paper here?

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.683
AUDIENCE: I can't
answer that question.

00:11:43.683 --> 00:11:44.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:45.890
I have another comment.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:49.903
We watch the process.

00:11:49.903 --> 00:11:50.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:11:50.570 --> 00:11:51.710
AUDIENCE: You could go
and watch the process.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.640
PROFESSOR: Go and
watch the process.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.080
And how about talking to
the people there, right?

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.370
The customers.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.522
AUDIENCE: That brings me to
that, in CQI you would give it,

00:12:02.522 --> 00:12:03.980
I can't actually
remember now, it's

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.600
been a while since
I've implemented these.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.890
But we would give it a number.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:12.980
So that not every unit of
Andy and Sasha would equal 1.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:15.800
And I think maybe we would
value some of her chit chat

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.650
as personal relations that
actually people may be coming

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.880
back to get the hot dogs.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.500
Not because hot dogs
are great to eat

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.860
and they love these hot dogs,
but she brings them back.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.610
So her time spent chatting,
although taking up time,

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:31.580
may be given more than
one, or his less than 1.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.650
So they may be
doing balanced work

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:37.993
if you look at it
on a deeper level.

00:12:37.993 --> 00:12:39.660
PROFESSOR: At least
that's an assumption

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.700
until you have clarified
with the customers

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.820
whether this is really
something that they value.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:48.830
GUEST SPEAKER 1: That's
actually a comment

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.450
that can be taken in a couple
of different directions, right.

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:54.540
Right now this is absolute
time spent doing everything.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.120
So based on this, should
Sasha chit chat more or less?

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.120
Does it do any good
if she does less?

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.533
No, actually it solves
nothing and makes

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:06.450
the customers annoyed.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.090
So maybe more is
the answer there.

00:13:09.090 --> 00:13:10.450
That's right.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.140
Yeah, and now this is
just the time, right.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.660
You're also getting into sort
of a value judgment of who

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.630
is doing more for the
company, and that's dangerous,

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.140
so we won't go there very far.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.170
But certainly it's not
hurting anything for her

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.200
to keep doing that right
now, because she's actually

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.180
underutilized compared to Andy.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:32.460
OK, so we're actually
going to do some numbers

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:33.690
on that thought.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:38.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and we are
going to do, let's see here.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:39.870
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
Click, there we go.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:45.150
PROFESSOR: If we look at
Sasha's tasks, we all got 159.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.510
50 orders.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:52.590
So she is working 133 minutes
out of the 240 minutes

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.510
available.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:02.940
And Andy was 224
seconds per order.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.600
So working effectively
187 minutes out

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.120
of the 240 minutes available.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:15.570
And so their work time,
or their workload.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.570
Sasha's working 55%
of the available time

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:24.300
and Andy is 78 of
the available time.

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:31.080
And their capacity, if
you, let me see here,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:34.530
the touch time per order, if
you take the waiting time out,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:41.350
should be 224 seconds, which
is defined by the one that's

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:45.320
the slowest, which is Andy.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.120
OK.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.910
So if you say that's 224.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:56.930
So they should be able
to serve 64 customers.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.950
GUEST SPEAKER 1: That's
if Andy maxes out.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:04.100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, working
100% of the available time.

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.900
That's not always a good idea.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.550
It's hard, at least.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:14.030
So we're not going to talk
about the variations right now,

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.770
we're going to do that later.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:16.710
GUEST SPEAKER 1: We
got a question here?

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:17.293
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:20.570
Just looking at this
data, if we were analyzing

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:23.750
this company saying, what can
we do to create a Lean process.

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:25.340
Would our initial
thought be, OK,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:27.205
what are the tasks
that aren't needed

00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:29.190
and how do you delete
them from the process?

00:15:29.190 --> 00:15:32.420
Or would we say, OK, what are
the tasks that Andy's currently

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.680
doing that we could, perhaps,
reallocate to Sasha such

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.368
that we have a more continuous
flow to the process?

00:15:39.368 --> 00:15:40.910
PROFESSOR: That is
what you are going

00:15:40.910 --> 00:15:45.020
to be discussing in the next
exercise that is coming up here

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.950
in a minute or two.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.790
And then you can determine
what you find more feasible.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.040
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Although
you have a good point there,

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.440
because the thing
you said second is

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.180
the one that's in the exercise.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.820
The thing you said
first gets at that issue

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.400
of, well, let's make
Sasha more efficient.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.740
Or not, because as we
get a little deeper

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.040
into the analysis, we find
that that's not actually

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.460
going to help us.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.103
So hold the rest
of that thought.

00:16:12.103 --> 00:16:13.520
PROFESSOR: But the
best first step

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.100
is to do what you've
done now and analyze

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.300
what's actually going on.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:23.320
We saw that our current
production, the 50 customers,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.390
is actually a little
less than they

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.980
can produce the
way they're doing,

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:31.780
or the way they
could be doing things

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.610
if they were working 100%.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:37.270
So they need to improve
their processes in order

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:38.830
to meet their growing demand.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.147
They're a popular stand.

00:16:40.147 --> 00:16:41.980
Whether it's the talking,
the chit chatting,

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.580
or the quality of the hot dogs,
we don't know at this point.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.700
But we can see that they're
underutilized 55% to 78%.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.120
And their work is
not balanced, either,

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.950
and their cycle
time per customer

00:16:56.950 --> 00:17:02.000
is too long, regardless
of how you calculate it.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.150
So you should be able to shorten
that by looking at it, OK.

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.270
And that is your next job.

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.180
Help them figure out
what they can improve.

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.180
How can they improve
their utilization?

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.849
How can they reduce
their cycle times?

00:17:19.849 --> 00:17:23.270
So now you can change the
order that they do things in.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.650
And find out what they need
to do in order to serve

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:32.350
75 customers and 100 customers.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:34.920
So this is 10 minutes.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.430
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK, so
this is a brainstorm.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.620
That's actually sort of
a technical term, right.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:45.085
Have people gone through
brainstorming exercises before?

00:17:45.085 --> 00:17:45.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.000
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So
it's interesting,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.620
the medical people
are saying yes.

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.730
Engineers?

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:50.360
Yeah, OK.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.490
So you're throwing
ideas out there,

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.250
no idea is rejected
at this point.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.220
Let's just collect thoughts.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:01.160
PROFESSOR: Let's
start back up and hear

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.120
if you have some suggestions
for changes, improvement.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:09.600
Go ahead.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.965
AUDIENCE: So we started to look
at the process of just taking

00:18:12.965 --> 00:18:14.590
the orders, because
it seemed like that

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.460
was where a lot
of inefficiencies

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.690
were disseminating from.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:22.272
Or rather, a lot of the
hold ups, from our chart,

00:18:22.272 --> 00:18:22.980
were coming from.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:24.630
So we thought that
it might actually

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.320
be a better idea if
there were precreated

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:32.050
tickets, where a customer
could write in their name,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:33.330
write in what they want.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:35.070
And then give it to Sasha.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:40.575
And then while Sasha was
filling their drink order,

00:18:40.575 --> 00:18:41.520
they could pay her.

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:45.660
And that would get rid of her
adding the beverage later on,

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:51.570
her rechecking the order,
some of those inefficiencies.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.590
The other bird that it kills is
that, while wait time, capital

00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:58.260
wait time, might not
change initially,

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:02.100
the perceived wait time would
change for the customer.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.055
Because if you hand them
the drink ahead of time

00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:07.555
they have the perception that,
hey, things are coming along.

00:19:07.555 --> 00:19:09.472
GUEST SPEAKER 1: All
right, yeah, that's good.

00:19:09.472 --> 00:19:11.250
They always bring
the wine first.

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:13.042
AUDIENCE: Get your drink first.

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:15.000
PROFESSOR: So they can
sell you an extra glass.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.500
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
Yeah, that's right.

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.292
It's already gone by
the time dinner comes.

00:19:18.292 --> 00:19:21.990
PROFESSOR: Any
other suggestions?

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:23.290
Want to go, back table?

00:19:23.290 --> 00:19:23.790
Yeah?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:27.210
AUDIENCE: So we've thought,
for steps number 10 and 11,

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.840
with some different preparation
work, such as keeping

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.540
double the amount
of stocked items

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.110
and double the amount of trash
bins, et cetera, condiments,

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.090
they could cut that
time in half and only

00:19:39.090 --> 00:19:41.460
do that work every two hours.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:42.420
PROFESSOR: Right, OK.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.884
AUDIENCE: Since Sasha is not the
one actually picking the order,

00:19:49.884 --> 00:19:51.770
she's just filling
order tickets,

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:54.420
she ought to help Andy
out in the kitchen,

00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:02.380
by being the one to do
part of steps 4 and 5.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.160
Yeah.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.220
If Andy puts the dog in the
dinner, wraps it in foil,

00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:09.348
she can just add
the fruits of choice

00:20:09.348 --> 00:20:10.765
and put it in a
selling container.

00:20:10.765 --> 00:20:14.230
That way she doesn't have
to recheck in step 7,

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:17.020
because she's the one
actually doing it.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.570
So when we recalculate
the numbers for that,

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:23.800
originally right now it's 50
of value added time, 36 of not.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.030
From 4 to 8 is 36 of non value
time and 33 of wait time.

00:20:28.030 --> 00:20:31.062
When we change what they're
doing in each part of that,

00:20:31.062 --> 00:20:33.520
so that he's just doing the
dogs and she's doing everything

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.770
else, and we take out that
sitting on the counter wait

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.760
time, it all becomes
80 of value added time.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.692
So we have no non value added
time anymore, and no wait time.

00:20:42.692 --> 00:20:43.900
So we've eliminated all that.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.440
And we have 80 of value, versus
the 50 that's originally there.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.160
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.400
Does it change any of the times
in between the two of them?

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.642
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it would.

00:20:58.415 --> 00:21:00.040
PROFESSOR: Sasha is
going to work more?

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.330
AUDIENCE: A little bit more.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.410
20 seconds more.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:07.690
She was originally, from 4
to 7, 21, and now she's 40.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:09.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.180
So those are seconds
that is going from Andy?

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.350
AUDIENCE: From Andy to Sasha.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.060
We had a similar
suggestion where

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.580
Sasha would do some of the
work of filling the container.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:25.990
But we kind of envisioned it
as a flow or a [INAUDIBLE],,

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.240
and that she would
fill the containers

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.990
and then Andy could
just look down

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:35.050
and see how many containers
are just waiting for him.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:38.170
And then he could just put
the hot dogs in, wrap them up,

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:40.000
and then you have a bag.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.160
They would already
have the fruit.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:46.030
She would put the
bun in the foil.

00:21:48.792 --> 00:21:50.000
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I like that.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.330
Very nice.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.443
PROFESSOR: Other suggestions?

00:21:54.443 --> 00:21:56.860
AUDIENCE: We have the customers
getting their own beverage

00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:59.494
and putting their
own toppings on.

00:21:59.494 --> 00:22:02.973
That cuts down on time, and
it also reduces the errors.

00:22:02.973 --> 00:22:05.800
You're picking your hot
dog, you can't screw it up.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:09.890
And then, the customer
knows what they want.

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:13.390
And it would also give them
more control over particulars,

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.216
ketchup versus
mustard, or whatever.

00:22:16.216 --> 00:22:18.615
And we also have them
getting their own fruit.

00:22:24.181 --> 00:22:26.089
PROFESSOR: All right, very good.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.280
More suggestions?

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.750
All right, so, what
you have done here

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:41.310
is, you have rearranged
some of your processes.

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:51.240
You have changed the workload in
between the two in the business

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:51.833
here as well.

00:22:51.833 --> 00:22:53.250
So that they're
working more even,

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:55.350
or have a more even workload.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.080
And you're involving
the customers, saying,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.060
customers can do some
stuff themselves.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.270
They can pick up the fruit,
they can pick up the drink.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:06.540
Don't need to have someone
doing that for them.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.440
Right.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.120
And some of you focused on
reducing the, or involving

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.850
the customers, to make the
wait time go down as well.

00:23:14.850 --> 00:23:16.110
I like that.

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.600
What else do we--

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.810
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So did
anybody go to Fresco's today?

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:26.190
That lunch place, a
little deli, catty corner.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.830
I guess not, no.

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.520
they have a great system
there, which is apocryphal.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.060
I'm not sure if
this story is true.

00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:37.590
But I know one of the
Saturday Night Live

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.590
people actually lived in
Cambridge for a long time.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:44.250
It's alleged to be the
"cheeseburger cheeseburger"

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.750
inspiration.

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:48.550
You say what you want
in a yell, right.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:51.020
There's no ticket,
there's no, you know.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.960
And then they yell back, to make
sure they understood the order.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.210
BLT small fries!

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:01.350
BLT small fries!

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.287
Takes one second to
say, low error rate.

00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:06.870
High training, that guy has got
to keep it in his head, right.

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:15.060
Yeah, so, most of the
other possibilities

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:19.120
are definitely up
here, some good ideas.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.410
And this part, by the way,
is also pretty realistic,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:23.910
in the sense that this is art.

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:26.700
You don't know the answers,
none of these techniques

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:29.260
tell you the answer.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.900
What they do is
frame the problem

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:33.722
and help you understand
what problems

00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:34.680
you're trying to solve.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.190
You're not trying to
make Sasha stop chatting.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:40.860
You're trying to improve
the overall performance

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:44.290
of the system.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.100
One question we have with this
is that not all the time was

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.500
allocated, and it's unclear
exactly why the wait

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.580
times are the way they are.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:54.690
The question of
the flow of orders,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.840
and so maybe from 11 to
1 they are at capacity,

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:01.590
and there's just no
demand 10 to 11 or 1 to 2.

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.990
So there might not
even be the opportunity

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.940
to increase the capacity
to hire another person

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.775
or to do something different.

00:25:08.775 --> 00:25:10.400
PROFESSOR: And that's
the kind of thing

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.010
you would find out by
actually going and observing

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:15.830
the process, rather than
us sitting in a classroom

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.520
here and saying, this
is the way it is.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.020
GUEST SPEAKER 1: That's right.

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.990
On the other hand,
there are things

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.140
that always help, even if there
is that issue of, maybe some

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.760
of the time they're slammed.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.280
Balancing always helps.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:34.650
Eliminating non value
added steps always helps.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:36.902
So there are some things
you can do confidently.

00:25:36.902 --> 00:25:38.360
There are other
things that you may

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.652
have to actually go and see,
well does this make sense.

00:25:40.652 --> 00:25:41.990
Will this work.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.523
And possibly even
experiment with, try it,

00:25:44.523 --> 00:25:46.190
see how it goes the
next couple of days.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:53.260
PROFESSOR: So, a few things
that we thought about.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.490
The "in" order, where
it's sitting, what is it,

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:57.670
30 seconds, here in step 2.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:26:01.270
And the "out" order.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:02.140
Take those away.

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.490
Inspection, we heard
earlier, that inspection

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:10.810
doesn't add much.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.972
GUEST SPEAKER 1: I
really like this.

00:26:12.972 --> 00:26:14.680
I don't think I've
heard that one before.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.760
The thought of consolidating
Sasha's work and the inspection

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:20.920
into one step.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:24.470
So then you get the quality,
but there's no extra step.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:29.650
So, that's a good solution
to not apriori eliminate

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:32.500
inspection, which might
lead to quality issues.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.610
PROFESSOR: And balance the work
you've already done, as well.

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:40.180
Now we're down here to
create a future state

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:45.160
map to visualize how we want
this to look in the future.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.417
And then, create the
action plan for how you're

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:48.625
going to achieve your change.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:53.190
Because talk alone won't do it.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:27:00.080
So, make the map, create a
plan, set some deadlines,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.930
and assign some
responsibilities for who's

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:06.370
going to do what
to change things.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:09.830
So the value stream map
is useful to visualize

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.560
what is going on in the
interactions and the flows,

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.480
and gives you the linkages
between your information

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.530
and your product flows.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.260
It gives you a
language that you can

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.310
talk about with the ones
who are in the group.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:26.300
And you can identify your
constraints and capacities

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.170
and wastes.

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:29.990
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Do
you have a question?

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:31.830
AUDIENCE: I just have a
question about the process.

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.720
Maybe I'm having
difficulty visualizing it.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.960
But it seems like we're
following the hot dog

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.210
in a linear way, whereas it
seems like some of this stuff

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.600
happens simultaneously.

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.230
So I'm not sure, some
of the seconds overlap.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.470
It's not like Sasha's
seconds happen only

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:51.460
after Andy's seconds happen.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:54.150
So that's a little
bit hard for me

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.800
to understand in
this flow model.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:58.530
PROFESSOR: And that,
as I perceive it,

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.920
that can sometimes be a
problem to look at it like that

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.330
in a process map.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.730
And I have a slide a
little bit later where

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.920
you can look at
swim lanes, as well.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.380
Because it can depend
on who is doing what.

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:14.380
And that can happen at
the same time as well.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:16.110
So you're absolutely right.

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:18.260
They do happen simultaneously.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.670
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
The classic issue,

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:24.553
which you're keying on, I think,
is like, in a real hot dog

00:28:24.553 --> 00:28:26.970
stand there would be a bunch
of hot dogs on the grill that

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:28.905
would be cooking
at the same time

00:28:28.905 --> 00:28:30.780
that all this other
stuff is going on, right.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.470
So there are some processes
that are maybe out of phase.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:35.640
And that's true.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.420
That's a real issue.

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:40.890
The map doesn't
catch that very well.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:44.280
That issue of some
things happening out

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:46.530
of phase with other things.

00:28:46.530 --> 00:28:48.100
But it's a tool.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.110
It's not a perfect tool.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.355
It doesn't solve all
of your problems.

00:28:51.355 --> 00:28:52.230
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.350
So, tips for creating it,
involves the entire team.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.680
Everybody who's involved
in these processes

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.210
need to be involved.

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:02.880
It can't only be a
few people that maybe

00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.140
have management positions.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.440
You need to have the
people doing the work come

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.490
and be involved in this.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.220
Because they're the ones who
understand the work the best,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.050
and can come up with
the best suggestions

00:29:13.050 --> 00:29:15.300
for how to change it.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.540
And you need to
actually go to Gemba,

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:22.380
go and see, use the post it
notes like you've done now,

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.150
on your map, put that on.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.140
And then you can
use your symbols,

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:29.310
you can use whatever
you pretty much like.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.530
There are some that are
more use than others.

00:29:31.530 --> 00:29:37.260
But however you want
to do it as long

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:40.230
as you make sure you
have a common language.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.480
Here's a little bit
about the swim lanes.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.430
Because you can have
different providers,

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:48.030
or different processes, at the
same time in an organization.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:52.380
And you can try to
map it out like this.

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.690
So, things that take
place at the same time.

00:29:54.690 --> 00:30:00.300
Or you can have the castle wall,
with production times and wait

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.600
times added up in the end.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.830
Have your wait times and
your productive times.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.740
So there are many
ways, and there

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.350
are some resources, where you
can learn a whole lot more

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.240
about this.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.990
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Can
I say one more thing?

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:19.880
When you do a value
stream map, make sure

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.010
that you bring it to the
people doing the work

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:23.522
to get their validation.

00:30:23.522 --> 00:30:25.730
Say, did I leave anything
out, did I forget anything.

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:28.188
Because oftentimes,
you miss something.

00:30:28.188 --> 00:30:30.480
And they could say, oh, but
you forgot that we do this.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.647
And I think that's really
important, because then it

00:30:32.647 --> 00:30:35.187
gets them to buy into what
you're doing, as well.

00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:37.020
GUEST SPEAKER 3: And
even more strongly, you

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.270
should have those people
participating in the creating

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:40.920
of the value stream map.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.990
PROFESSOR: That's
actually what we do at BI.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.900
The ones doing the
processes, and it's often

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.660
from different provider
groups, we involve them,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.200
we invite them, and we help
them come up with this.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.576
GUEST SPEAKER 2: And then
post them on the floor,

00:30:54.576 --> 00:30:57.475
so they can see them
and they comment.

00:30:57.475 --> 00:31:00.100
PROFESSOR: A good technique for
all of these things that you do

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:04.960
is, take pictures of these
things, and you can post them

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.410
or you can email them
out to people, and say,

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:10.420
this is what we
found, please give us

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.140
if you have any comments.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.140
GUEST SPEAKER 2: This is
also a really good link

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:17.020
between administration
and front line workers,

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.670
because I know in
most hospitals,

00:31:18.670 --> 00:31:21.640
the administrators take
turns walking around

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.020
to visit the floors.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:24.775
And a lot of them are
not clinical, might

00:31:24.775 --> 00:31:25.960
be the CFO or something.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.640
They come around, they go,
how are you doing today,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.150
do you need anything,
how are you doing today,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:30.025
do you need anything?

00:31:30.025 --> 00:31:32.020
But if you have a value
stream map posted,

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.180
they can go to that map
and you can discuss what

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.440
you're working on together.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:38.110
And it just brings it
to a different level.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:41.140
We call it Board Walks.

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:42.440
Give them something to look at.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.732
GUEST SPEAKER 4: And the same
is true in an engineering

00:31:44.732 --> 00:31:45.340
environment.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:46.220
Not just health care.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.165
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Absolutely.

00:31:48.165 --> 00:31:53.470
PROFESSOR: And for
health care, if you dare,

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:58.150
go and find a patient who's
arriving to your emergency

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:02.380
department, to your area of
work, wherever that may be.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.660
Follow that patient.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:08.470
If you're a phlebotomist, go
find a patient registering

00:32:08.470 --> 00:32:09.640
for their blood draw.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.765
Follow them the whole
way through, OK.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:16.930
Take a chill pill
before you do it,

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.770
because at least in my field,
in the emergency department,

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:21.820
I've tried.

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.640
And I think IHI calls
it "The Walk Of Shame".

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.380
And it really is.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.440
But it is important,
because otherwise you

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.300
will not understand.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.290
Most of us, I mean,
we have different ways

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.730
into the health care system.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:39.130
Again that is my perspective.

00:32:39.130 --> 00:32:44.170
So let's be honest, my wait time
in my own emergency department

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:47.500
is probably not going to be
the same as somebody else's.

00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.770
And another thing is, I
don't have the same need

00:32:50.770 --> 00:32:54.850
to frequent an emergency
department, right.

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:56.770
There are things I
can just fix myself.

00:32:56.770 --> 00:33:00.160
But go, find a patient,
ask them politely

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.080
if you can follow them
for their journey.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:09.650
And then stick with it, take
notes, bring your stopwatch.

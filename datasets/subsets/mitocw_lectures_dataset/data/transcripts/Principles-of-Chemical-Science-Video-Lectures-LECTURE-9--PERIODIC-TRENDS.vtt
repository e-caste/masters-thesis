00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:22.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.070
Let's get started.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.740
Can you go ahead and take 10
more seconds on this first

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:46.430
clicker question here?

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.880
OK.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.250
So it looks like most of you
got that the electron

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.860
configuration that we're writing
here is for copper.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.450
So I'm actually going to give
the benefit of the doubt that

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.650
the people that didn't get it
right were rushing to get out

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.350
their clickers and didn't
have time to think

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.390
it all the way through.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.800
Remember that when we're talking
about 4 s 1, 3 d 10,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.480
that's one of those exceptions
where a completely filled d

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.150
orbital is more stable
than we would expect.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.190
So, that's actually the electron
configuration we have

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.180
when we're talking about
copper and some other

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.250
exceptions in the periodic table
that you're going to be

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.040
looking at.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.560
So, hopefully, if you were to go
back and look you could see

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.960
that this is, in fact, copper.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.660
We're actually going to do one
more clicker question to get

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.120
started with today, and as we
do, I'll explain something

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.180
we're going to be trying today,
which is a little bit

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.020
of a friendly competition in
terms of answering the clicker

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.900
questions correctly.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.070
So we've tagged each of your
numbers to your actual

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.630
recitation, so we can see
today which recitation

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.000
actually is going to be doing
the best in terms of clicker

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.870
questions, who's going to get
the most correct today.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.670
So, you may or may not know this
about your TAs, but this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.260
is a pretty competitive group of
TAs we have this year, and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.440
they like to brag about how
smart their recitation is, how

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.220
good questions they're getting
in the recitation section.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.290
So, do your TA proud today and
see if you can be part of the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.300
recitation that gets the most
correct in terms of a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.040
percentage.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.720
And at the end of class we'll
announce which recitation that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.150
is, we'll also make sure to
give you a little bit of a

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.550
prize if you are, in fact,
in that recitation.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.190
So we have extra incentive
to get these

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.260
clicker questions right.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.040
So, in this one we're selecting
the correct

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.470
electronic configuration
for an ion.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.700
So, why don't you go ahead and
take 10 more seconds on this

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:47.770
second clicker question
for our intro.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.430
OK.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.380
So, it looks like we have
a little bit of a mixed

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.360
consensus here.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.310
Let's go over this question.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.190
And I know there's a lot to
talk about about this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.620
competition, but let's just get
into listening mode here

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.510
and talk about how we can figure
out what the correct

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.060
electron configuration
is for this ion.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.760
Remember, ions are a little
bit different.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.850
The first thing we need to
do is write the electron

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.720
configuration for the atom
itself, and then we need to

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.250
take an electron away.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:20.340
So here we're talking about v
plus 1, so if we were to write

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.040
it just for the neutral electron
itself, we would find

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.920
that the electron configuration
is argon, that's

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.940
the filled shell
in front of it.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.380
Then 4 s 2 and 3 d 3.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.980
So this would be for the actual
filled, the completely

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.550
neutral atom.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.370
But remember what we said,
which was when we talked

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.040
about, this is at the end of
class on Friday, we said that

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.970
it turns out that even though
3 d is higher in energy when

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.380
it's not filled, once we fill
it with an electron, these 2

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.620
orbitals actually switch place
in terms of energy.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.850
So if we were to write this in
terms of energy, we would

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.080
actually have to rewrite it
has 3 d 3, and then 4 s 2.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.530
So, which orbital would we take
an electron out of if we

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.550
were ionizing this atom here?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.790
The s.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.930
So, we would actually take an
electron out of the s, which

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.650
gives us 3 d 3 and then 4 s 1.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.110
So, it's a little bit of
a trick when you're

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.950
dealing with ions.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.820
The best suggestion is just to
write it out completely for

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.840
the neutral atom, and then you
want to take an electron out

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.900
of the highest orbital.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.380
It makes sense that it's going
to come out of the highest

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.570
occupied atomic orbital, because
that's going to be the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.430
lowest amount of energy
that's required to

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.330
actually eject an electron.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.373
All right.

00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:39.860
So let's go to today's notes.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.670
And actually before we start
into today's topics, I want to

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.370
remind everyone and hopefully
you all do remember that our

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.140
first exam is coming up and it's
coming up in exactly a

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.260
week, so it'll be a week from
today, next Wednesday.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.470
And on Friday in class, at the
beginning of class, I'll go

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.010
over just in all the detail
you could possibly imagine

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.670
everything you need to know
logistically for the exam --

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.240
where it is, what you do, what
kind of calculators you can

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.400
bring, which by the way
are any calculator.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.340
So you'll get all of that
information on Friday.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.030
So don't worry if you have
some questions right now.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.520
I just want to let
you know that.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.120
The other thing I want to let
you know is that instead of

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.780
having a new problem-set that
you'll be assigned this

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.090
Friday, what we'll do instead
is we'll give you some

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.670
practice problems, and these
will be just more of the same

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.220
type of problems that you saw
before but that's another

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.020
chance to try them out more.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.140
These won't be graded, you don't
have to turn them in,

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.050
it's just to give you some extra
practice if you want

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.910
while you're studying
for the exam.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.810
We'll also post an exam from
a previous year so you can

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.610
actually see exactly what the
format's going to look like.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.900
So when you go into the exam a
week from today, it'll all

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.250
look really familiar, you'll be
comfortable with the format

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.250
and you can just dive
right in and start

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.320
answering the questions.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.200
So you'll have all that
information and we'll get it

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.880
to you on Friday.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.510
The other quick thing I want
to say is that I do have

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.650
office hours today from 3 to 5,
so feel free to stop by if

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.550
you have questions about
problem-set 3 that you're

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:04.750
finishing up.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.920
And also, for those of you that
did sign up for the pizza

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.540
forum tonight, that's going to
be at 5 o'clock, it's in room

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.380
56-502, so we'll see some of you
tonight for that as well.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.690
All right.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.670
So, let's move on to what we're
talking about today.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.560
What we're going to start with
is discussing photoelectron

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.480
spectroscopy, which is a
spectroscopy technique that

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.690
will give us some information
about energy levels in

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:31.510
multielectron atoms. We'll then
take a turn to talking

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.630
about the periodic table,
we'll look at a bunch of

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.200
periodic trends, including
ionization energy, electron

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.750
affinity, electronegativity
and atomic radius.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.770
And then, if we have time at the
end, we'll introduce one

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.460
last topic, which is
isoelectronic atoms and ions.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.370
I also want to note that the end
of the material today, so

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.520
this last topic here, that's the
end of the material that's

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.470
going to be on this
first exam.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:59.260
So whether we finish it today,
or more likely when we finish

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.690
it up on Friday, once we get
passed isoelectronic atoms,

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.160
that's it, that's all you need
to study for this first exam.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:10.120
So from that point on it'll be
exam 2 material, so depending

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.170
on how you like to come
compartmentalize your

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.360
information, you can separate
that in your brain in terms of

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.590
what you're trying to learn
right now versus what you can

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.500
put off until a little
bit later.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.670
So, let's start with talking
about photoelectron

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:27.010
spectroscopy.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.820
This actually relates very
closely to what we discussed

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.510
in class on Friday before the
long weekend, and what we were

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.710
talking about is the energy
levels of multielectron atoms.

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.440
So what we'll start with today
is talking about the technique

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.570
that's primarily used to
actually experimentally figure

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.960
out what these different
energy levels are.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:47.340
And this is called photoelectron
spectroscopy,

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:51.960
and essentially what it is is
very similar conceptually to

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.710
what we were talking about way
back in the first couple

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.120
lectures when we were
talking about the

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.640
photoelectric effect.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.270
Because here what we have is
some atom that we're studying,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.900
in the case, it's going to be
a gas, and we hit it with a

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.550
photon that has some
incident energy.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:11.590
So e sub i, some energy that the
photon comes in with, and

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.620
if it has sufficient energy to
eject an electron, it will do

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.210
that, and our electron will be
ejected with a certain kinetic

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.000
energy, which is going to be
whatever energy is left over

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.200
from the initial energy we put
in minus what was taken up in

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.370
order to actually ionize
or eject the electron.

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:29.670
So, you can see how this can
directly give us different

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:32.050
ionization energies for
any atom that we're

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:33.460
interested in studying.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.880
For example, with neon we can
think about all of the

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.490
different orbital energies
we could be looking at.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.520
In the first case, so
here is the electron

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.390
configuration of neon.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:45.880
So we can think about what
is our most loosely-bound

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.065
electron, what's that highest
energy orbital, and it's going

00:08:49.065 --> 00:08:51.500
to be the 2 p orbital,
that's going to be

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.610
what's highest in energy.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:55.570
So if we're going to eject an
electron using a minimum

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:58.130
amount of energy, that's where
it's going to come from.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:00.470
So, you can imagine, that we'll
actually probably have a

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.890
lot of kinetic energy left over
if we put a lot of energy

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:04.790
in in the first place.

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.340
We're only using up a little
bit to eject the electron,

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.480
then we'll have a
lot left over.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.990
So, one difference between
photoelectron spectroscopy

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.760
and, for example, the
photoelectric effect is that

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.250
in this case, we're not just
looking at one energy level,

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.330
which is what we were looking
at from the surface of a

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:22.530
metal, now we're talking about
this gaseous atom.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:26.470
So we can actually pop an
electron or eject an electron

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.720
from any single orbital that is
occupied within the atom.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.180
So, for example, it's not just
the 2 p that we could actually

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.380
take an electron from, we
could also think about

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.190
ejecting an electron from
the 2 s orbital.

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:40.460
Now this, of course, is going to
take more energy because a

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.610
2 s is lower, it has has a more
negative binding energy

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.670
than the 2 p, but that's OK as
long as we put in enough

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.470
energy, but what we're going to
find is the kinetic energy

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.450
coming out with the electron
is actually going to be a

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.090
little bit less, right, because
we had to use up more

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.280
energy to eject the electron,
so we don't have

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.090
as much left over.

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.540
There's actually one more
orbital that we could talk

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.430
about if we're talking about
this sample case of neon,

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:09.470
which is a 1 s orbital, and if
we're talking about a 1 s

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.030
orbital, now we're going to be
even lower in energy still, so

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.440
that means the minimum energy
required to eject an electron

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.320
is going to be at its highest,
so that means the energy that

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.200
we have left over that turns
into kinetic energy for the

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:26.000
electron, is now going to
be really quite small.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.760
And what happens when you
irradiate one of these atoms

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.290
that you're studying with this
light is in photoelectron

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:36.350
spectroscopy, you want to make
sure that you put in enough

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.180
energy to actually ionize any
single electron that you have

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.000
in the atom.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.270
So the way that we really make
sure this is done is that we

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.710
use x-rays.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.200
So you know that x-rays are
higher frequency than UV

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.020
light, for example, that means
it's also higher energy than

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.880
UV light, and if you think
back to our photoelectric

00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:57.465
effect experiments, do you
remember what type of light we

00:10:57.465 --> 00:10:58.930
were usually using for those?

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.490
Does anyone remember?

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.620
Yeah.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.560
It was UV light that we used.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.850
Well, we can't guarantee with
UV light we'll have enough

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.450
energy to eject every single
electron, so that's why when

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.500
we use x-rays, they're higher
energy, you can pretty much be

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.000
guaranteed we're going
to eject all of

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.160
those electrons there.

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.960
So I said that this technique
was used to experimentally

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.580
determine what the different
binding energies or the

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:25.730
different ionization energies
are for the different states

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.400
in a multielectron atom.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.140
Another way to say
states is to talk

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.650
about different orbitals.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.410
So we can do this directly as
long as we have certain types

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:34.140
of information.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.130
The first that we need to know
the energy of the photon

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:41.030
that's incident on
our gaseous atom.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:43.590
The second piece of information
we need to know is

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:46.320
what actually the kinetic
energy is of the ejected

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.490
electron, and that's something
we can just measure by

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.470
measuring its velocity.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.980
So we can use an equation to
relate the incident energy and

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.570
the kinetic energy to the
ionization energy, or the

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.820
energy that's required
to eject an electron.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.140
This should all sound incredibly
familiar, like I'm

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.780
just repeating myself in terms
of photoelectric effect,

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.010
because essentially that's what
I'm doing, and that's one

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.680
reason we spent so much time
and did so many problem-set

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.760
problems on the photoelectric
effect.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.640
So what we're saying here is
the incident energy, so the

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.230
energy coming in, is just equal
to the minimum energy

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.420
that's required to a
eject an electron.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.580
When we talked about the
photoelectric effect, that was

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.660
called the work function.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.970
In this case, it's called the
ionization energy, plus

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:27.860
whatever kinetic energy we have

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.810
left over in the electron.

00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:32.480
So if we want to solve for
ionization energy, we can just

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.980
rearrange this equation.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.700
Our ionization energy is going
to be equal to the incident

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.010
energy coming in, minus
the kinetic

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.060
energy of the electron.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.810
So, let's take a look at the
different kinetic energies

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.500
that would be observed in a
spectrum for neon where we had

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.330
this incident energy here.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.560
And it turns out that the first
kinetic energy that we

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.030
would see or the highest kinetic
energy, would be 12 32

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.800
electron volts.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.080
So if that's the case doing a
quick little calculation, what

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.800
would the ionization energy be
for a 2 p electron in neon?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.650
Yup, 22.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.560
So, basically all we did was
take 12 54, subtract 12 32,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.250
and we got 22 electron volts.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.050
We can do the same thing
for the other

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.010
observed kinetic energy.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:22.250
So, for example, in the second
case, we say that we see 12 06

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.140
in terms of the kinetic
energy.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.430
Same sort of subtraction
problem, what do we have for

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.100
the ionization energy
of the 2 s electron?

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:30.980
Good, quick math.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.230
All right, so 48
electron volts.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:35.430
And let's look at the final
kinetic energy that we'd

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.720
observe in this spectrum, which
is 384 electron volts,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.110
so what is that third

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:44.810
corresponding ionization energy?

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.260
I couldn't quite hear, but I
have a feeling everyone said

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.460
870 electron volts.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:54.150
So, we can actually kind of
visualize what we would see if

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.640
we were looking at a
photoelectron spectrum.

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.220
And what we would see if we were
graphing, for example,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.600
increasing kinetic energy,
is we would see 1 line

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.570
corresponding to each of these
energies of electrons that we

00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:07.680
see coming out.

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.190
And, of course, each of those
electrons correspond to an

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.300
electron coming out of
a particular orbital.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.180
So in the case of 12 32, that is
our highest kinetic energy,

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.040
that means it's our lowest
ionization energy -- it's the

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:24.140
smallest amount of energy it
takes to pop an electron out

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.100
of that orbital.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:29.770
So that's why we see the 2 p
here, the 2 s is 12 06, and it

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.130
makes sense that what we see
as the greatest ionization

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.350
energy, which is also the
smallest kinetic energy is

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.600
that 1 s orbital.

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.130
Remember, because that 1 s
orbital is all the way down in

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.310
terms of if we're thinking about
an energy diagram, we're

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.210
all the way down here, so we
have a huge amount of energy

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:49.120
we have to put into the system
in order to eject an electron.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.130
So what I want to point out when
you're kind of looking at

00:14:51.130 --> 00:14:53.920
these numbers here, what the
significance is, look at that

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.850
huge difference between what
the ionization energies are

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:00.160
for what we call those valence
electrons, those outer shell

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.460
electrons, versus the ionization
energy for the 1 s

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.390
orbital -- those are core
electrons there.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:08.620
So we can think about something
I mentioned last

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.560
time, which is when we're
thinking about chemistry and

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:13.560
what's really interesting in
terms of chemical reactions,

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.880
it's mostly valence electrons
we're talking about, those are

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:16.750
the ones that tend to be

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.660
involved in chemical reactions.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.000
It makes a lot of sense when we
look at it energetically,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.955
because if we think about a 1 s
core electron, that's going

00:15:24.955 --> 00:15:27.060
to be held really, really
tightly to the nucleus.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.440
We see that we have to put
this huge energy in to

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:33.410
actually get a 1 s electron
ejected, so it makes a lot of

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:35.640
sense that we wouldn't want to
pay that energy cost in a

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.190
normal chemical reaction.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.690
And we don't -- we very rarely
would see these core electrons

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.610
actually being involved in
any type of a reaction.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.600
All right, so one thing that I
want to point out, which I

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.990
said many, many times on Friday,
and this is perhaps

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.990
the last time I'll say it, but
one last time is we can think

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.530
about why we only see a line for
the 2 p orbital, versus we

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:00.750
don't see separate lines for a
2 p x, a 2 p y, and a 2 p z.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.450
Remember, we need those three
quantum numbers to completely

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:04.620
describe the orbital.

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.870
Why do we just see one
for all the p's?

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.650
And the reason is that the
energy of the orbitals, depend

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.520
on two quantum numbers, and
that's quantum number n, and

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:13.740
quantum number l.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.620
M does not actually have an
effect, in this case, on the

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:18.350
energy of the orbital.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.100
So that's why we're not
seeing separate

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:24.370
lines in this spectrum.

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.600
All right.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.300
So let's go ahead and try an
example here in thinking about

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.770
photoelectron spectroscopy.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:33.120
So, let's say we're looking at
an element and we have an

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.950
emission spectra, and we know
that it has five distinct

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:38.860
different kinetic energies
in that spectrum.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.600
We might be asked, for example,
to determine what all

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.740
of the different elements could
be that would produce a

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:47.410
spectrum that gave us
5 different lines.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:49.620
So the first thing that we want
to do, if we're thinking

00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:56.210
about something like this, is
just to determine exactly what

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.990
orbitals are causing the five
different lines that we're

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:00.690
seeing in the spectrum.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.060
So, if we're talking about five
different orbitals and

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.420
we're talking about a ground
state atom, we know that we

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.880
just need to start
at the bottom and

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.220
work our way out up.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.840
So, our first orbital that an
electron must be coming from

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:11.900
is the 1 s.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.583
What comes after that?

00:17:13.583 --> 00:17:15.190
2 s.

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:16.070
All right, then what?

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:20.740
2 p.

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.540
After that?

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:23.990
3 s.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.530
Next?

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:31.890
3 p, and that's 1, 2, 3, 4 --
that gives us five different

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.200
options, five different
orbitals, five different

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.820
energies right there.

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:38.950
So, then all we need to do to
determine which elements that

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.960
corresponds to is take a look
at our periodic table.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.490
So we want to look at any
element that has a 3 p orbital

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:49.470
filled, but that does not then
go on and have a 4 s, because

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.880
if it had the 4 s filled then
we would actually see six

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:53.360
lines in the spectrum.

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:58.230
So that is relevant for all
of these atoms here, so we

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.840
actually have several different
possibilities.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:06.250
It could be aluminum, silicone,
phosphorous, sulfur,

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.530
chlorine or argon.

00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:12.000
Any one of these different
elements could actually

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.410
produce a photoelectron
spectroscopy spectrum that has

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:18.090
five distinct lines.

00:18:18.090 --> 00:18:20.950
If I went on and told you what
the different incident light

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:24.830
was, and what the electrons were
ejected with, and then

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.910
you could look up the ionization
energy for the

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.780
particular different elements,
you should be able to actually

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:32.450
determine exactly which element
it is, but just with

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.830
the information given, we can
only narrow it down to these

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.880
choices here.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.350
So let's actually let you try
another example of solving a

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.540
problem that has to do with
one of the spectrums. So,

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:46.700
let's turn to another clicker
question here.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.610
Remember, your answer holds
great weight in terms of the

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.950
state of the TA bragging
for next week.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:55.640
So, how many distinct, so again,
we're talking about

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.380
distinct kinetic energies, would
be displayed if you're

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:01.990
talking about a spectrum for the
element hafnium, and I'll

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.620
tell you here that it has a z
of 72, so you don't have to

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.570
spend two minutes searching
your periodic table.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:10.980
The period of table's on the
back page of your notes if you

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:46.270
don't see that there.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.490
All right.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.640
It looks like a lot of you are
done, so let's take 10 more

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:53.250
seconds here.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.220
Part of the challenge is speed,
too, how quickly you

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.680
can get these answers in terms
of getting them in on time.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.120
So let's see what we say.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:02.730
All right.

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:06.560
So I think I can safely say that
most people had the right

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:10.390
idea and were counting quickly,
though I have a

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:13.330
feeling that some people who
wrote 13 might have forgotten

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.960
about those 4 f, the
4 f electrons.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.340
So, remember when you're looking
at your periodic

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.180
table, don't forget about the
lanthinides, sometimes they

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.840
come into play.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.270
So it's actually 14, and the
way that we got that answer

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.990
was we just wrote out or just
looked at your period table,

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:32.590
figured out all of the different
orbitals that you

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.720
could have in terms of the
principle quantum number, and

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.110
then the l quantum number, and
then write them all down -- it

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.970
turns out to be 14, so that's
what the answer is.

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:45.040
So, it looks like this is good,
because we'll have some

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.520
separation in terms of not
everyone's going to get 100%

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:52.030
in terms of recitations here,
which is what we're going for.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.870
All right.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.750
So let's turn our attention to a
new topic, which is thinking

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.300
a little bit about the periodic
table, and also

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.000
talking about periodic trends.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.140
And there's a lot we can explain
by talking about what

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:06.220
we see in the periodic table
in terms of what different

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:08.050
trends are in grouping
different elements in

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.860
different spots within
the periodic table.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.840
So, here we have a picture of
Dmitri Mendeleev, who is one

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.220
of the scientists responsible
for first compiling the

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.560
periodic table.

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:21.830
You'll notice I have what's a
very flattering picture of him

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.860
up here, and if you haven't done
the reading yet you might

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:27.130
not think this is particularly
flattering, but if you look at

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.130
the picture of him in the book,
you'll notice I chose a

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.820
very flattering picture of
Dmitri up here, and here he's

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.450
pondering putting these
elements together in a

00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:38.690
periodic table.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:42.790
And he actually did this in the
late 1800's, back before

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.690
even all of the elements that we
know today were discovered,

00:21:45.690 --> 00:21:49.740
really only about 60% or so, 70%
were discovered then that

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:51.040
we now know today.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.230
But still, he was able to put
together a periodic table.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.870
And what he did what he actually
grouped things in

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.080
terms of their chemical
properties.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.550
So the way that we like to
think of things now is in

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.660
terms of electron
configurations, right, but at

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.760
the time that wasn't
really understood.

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.240
So, instead, it was amazing he
was able to group things in

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:11.390
terms of the properties
that he saw.

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.050
So, for example, if he was
talking about the group one

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.040
metals, lithium, sodium,
potassium -- he noticed these

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.140
were all very soft reactive
metals, those

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:21.540
were grouped together.

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:26.000
Versus looking at, for example,
helium or neon or

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.910
argon, these are all inert
gases, inert meaning

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:32.280
essentially do not react, those
were grouped together in

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.850
the periodic table.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:37.070
So basically, at the time he
was just going on size and

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.050
then traits, but what we
actually know today is that we

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.130
can also order things in the
periodic table by electron

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:45.750
configuration.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.130
In fact, that is the most
logical way for us

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:49.300
to look at it now.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:51.700
So, for example, if we're
actually thinking about

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.150
electron configuration and we
look at lithium, sodium and

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:58.060
potassium, these all have
one valence electron.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.420
So basically, that means one
electron in an s orbital in

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.060
their outer-most most shell.

00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.740
So that explains why they're so
reactive, they're all very

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.510
willing to give up that 1 s
orbital and then drop to a

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.280
lower energy level.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.690
In contrast, helium, neon, and
argon all have filled shells.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.140
That also explains why
they're very stable.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:19.480
They're not going to want to
add on another electron,

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.950
because then it'll have to jump
a very large energy level

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.820
and start filling in another
shell -- go from n equals 2,

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.370
to n equals 3, and n equals
4, and so on.

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:31.760
So it turns out that we can
really know a lot just by

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.430
looking at the periodic table.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:37.070
You will never in this class
have to memorize anything

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:38.070
about the periodic table.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:40.150
Depending on what kind of
chemistry you go in to, you

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:43.120
might accidentally memorize
parts of the table, which is

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.710
fine, but what you really want
to know how to do is know how

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.110
to use the periodic table.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.160
But you actually need to keep
a few caveats in mind as you

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.330
do this, which is the fact that
trends predict a lot of

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:57.490
chemical properties, but they
can't predict everything in

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:59.460
terms of biological
properties.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.370
And after the periodic table
was developed in the late

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:04.760
1800's, people didn't understand
this quite as well,

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.170
they took things a little
more literally.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:09.340
They thought, for example, if
you could do something with

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.250
one element, if you looked at
an element very close to it,

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.400
it would be similar enough that
you could maybe replace

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.400
it with that.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.120
Today we know, for example, if
you can put one certain kind

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.030
of element in your mouth
or eat that, it doesn't

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:23.160
necessarily mean you want to put
the element next to it and

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.740
your mouth as well, that
might not be safe.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:29.390
But this is things we've learned
as the years have gone

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.370
past.

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.840
So, let's just take a quick
example to show how not

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.050
completely you can use these
periodic trends, that there

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:36.970
are limits.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.540
So if we consider lithium,
potassium, and sodium, they're

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.690
all together in the same group
on the periodic table, knowing

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.640
what we do about biology we
can immediately think of

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.070
sodium and potassium, or even
just knowing what you know

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.160
about table salt, for example,
that these are two elements

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.250
that we find, and particularly
in the ion form in very high

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.030
concentrations in our body.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:59.910
For example, sodium in our blood
plasma is almost to the

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.130
point sometimes of 100 millimol
or that's very, very

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:04.630
concentrated.

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:07.710
Similarly, we find it in table
salt, we're taking it in all

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.160
the time, the same with
potassium, think of bananas,

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.200
were always eating potassium.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.270
Not so with lithium.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:16.200
I don't think too many
people and here are

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.560
probably taking lithium.

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.490
It turns out there's actually
no natural function known in

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.500
the body for lithium.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.310
So there's nothing naturally
going on unless we were to

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:27.992
introduce it ourselves in our
body that we know of, at

00:25:27.992 --> 00:25:30.630
least, that involves lithium.

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:33.410
But this did not stop people,
for example, in the late

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:39.910
1800's, early 1900's, and, in
fact, in 1927 a new soft drink

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.610
was put on to the market and
they wanted to make a

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.230
lemon-lime soft drink, these
were very popular in the early

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:48.880
1900's, and to get sort of
that lemony flavor, they

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.880
decided to use citric acid, so
that's a good idea, that gives

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.620
that soury taste.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.980
And they wanted to use a soluble
salt of citric acid,

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:58.740
so they could have
used sodium, they

00:25:58.740 --> 00:25:59.310
could have used potassium.

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.760
But, you know why not do
something a little special,

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.240
little different,
and they decided

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.370
instead to use lithium.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.160
So, here we have this soda with
lithium citrate, some of

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:14.580
you might be familiar with this,
soda is called 7-Up.

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:20.020
So, 7-Up no longer has lithium
in it, but from 1927 to 1950

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:24.220
it did, and, in fact, not only
did they not try to hide the

00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:26.970
fact that there's lithium in the
soda, this they used as a

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:30.400
really special marketing
technique, they really pointed

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.670
out this is something that
stands out about our soda,

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:34.420
this is something special.

00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.510
There's a lot of good things
about lithium.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.910
I don't know if you can see,
probably not, what's written

00:26:38.910 --> 00:26:44.170
on here, so let me point out
to you a few things.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:48.000
Lithium, slenderizing, that's
great to see in a soda.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.140
Other nice things about lithium
in your soda, it

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:53.170
dispells hangovers, takes
the ouch out of grouch.

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.520
That's very nice.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.540
So basically, you get a lot of
benefit supposedly from this

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.960
7-Up soda from the
1920's or so.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.480
And this went on and was
unregulated for some time, but

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.910
at some point the Food and Drug
Administration did take a

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.930
step in, so here's a case where
they did do something

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:19.240
important -- that's not what I
mean at all -- where they did

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.380
take the step, they do many
things that are important,

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.400
often not quickly enough.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.810
Here's a -- actually here it
did take 25 years, but they

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:28.260
did, they did eventually
step on before we

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.220
started drinking 7-Up.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.060
And what they said was, look,
you can't put this in, we're

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.470
starting to notice it does
some strange things.

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.920
Because it was in the 1950's or
so, maybe the late 1940's,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.520
that people started to discover
lithium, even though

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.250
it had no natural function,
it did do

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.080
something in our bodies.

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:49.030
Does anyone know what was
lithium's used for?

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:52.040
Yeah, it's an anti-psychotic
drug, so, for example, some

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:55.180
people with bipolar disorder
even today still take it, it

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.260
works really well for some
people, for other people it

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.890
doesn't work so well.

00:27:58.890 --> 00:28:01.360
But anyway, this isn't really
something you want to have in

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.670
your soda, so they did take
it out eventually.

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.580
Another side effect if you
take too much lithium is

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:12.510
death, so that's no good to have
in sodas either, and it

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.260
might not have been as big a
deal back in the 1920's, but

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:17.930
you can imagine with supersizing
today, this might

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:19.470
be a bigger problem.

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.580
So anyway, when we talk about
periodic trends, it doesn't

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:24.630
always match up.

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:28.100
This was eventually taken out,
and actually just for your

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.450
interest, there was no overlap
between the time when cocaine

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:33.910
was in Coca Cola and lithium
was in 7-Up, so there was a

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:36.300
few years difference between
those two times, but it's

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:40.590
amazing to think about what does
go into processed foods.

00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:43.200
And the other thing to point
out, which I don't know if

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.170
this is true or not, but does
anyone know -- well that's

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:48.300
part's true, does anyone know
what the atomic mass of

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.780
lithium is?

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:50.790
Yes, it's 7.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.060
So, I don't know if this is true
or not, but I wonder if

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:55.030
that's where the actual
name 7-Up came from.

00:28:55.030 --> 00:28:57.400
So, even though we don't have
the lithium anymore, we still

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.960
keep that atomic number
7 around.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.190
All right.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.210
So that is an anti-example
of using periodic trends.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:09.000
So let's go to some actual real
examples, which might

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.750
come more in handy
for this class.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.310
So it's going to keep in mind
the limitations, so let's

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:17.190
start off with talking about
ionization energy.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:19.410
Now this is a good place to
start, because we are very

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.560
familiar with ionization energy,
we've been talking

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:24.250
about it in a lot of different
forms for quite a while --

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.220
it's that minimum energy
required to remove an electron

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.310
from an atom.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:32.720
And specifically, when we talk
about ionization energy, it's

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.810
assumed that what we mean
is actually the

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:36.780
first ionization energy.

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.310
So, you can imagine, we could
talk about any of the

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.860
different electrons, or we could
talk about taking out an

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.400
electron and taking out
second electron.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:47.690
Whenever you hear the term
ionization energy, make sure

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.210
you keep in mind that unless
we say otherwise, we're

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:53.040
talking about that first
ionization energy.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:55.490
And we know what that's equal
to, this is something we've

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.880
been over and over, ionization
energy is simply equal to the

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.840
negative of the binding
energy.

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.390
So negative e, which is sub n l,
because it's a function of

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.950
n and l in terms of
quantum numbers.

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.730
So, let's think about kind of
differentiating, however,

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.830
between first ionization energy
or just ionization

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.960
energy, and other types such as
second or third ionization

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.100
energy, and let's take boron
as an example here.

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:24.510
So, if we want to think about
what the first ionization

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.360
energy is of boron, what you
want to do is write out the

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:29.490
electron configuration, because
then you can think

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.070
about where it is that the
electron's coming out of.

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.900
The electron's going to come out
of that highest occupied

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.340
atomic orbital, that one that's
the highest in energy,

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.730
because that's going to be the
at least amount of energy it

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.120
needs to eject something.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.750
So what we'll end up with is
boron plus, 1 s 2, 2 s 2, and

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.450
what we say is the delta energy
or the change in energy

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.570
as the same thing as saying
the energy of the products

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.210
minus the energy of our reactant
here, and we just

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:57.310
call that the ionization energy
-- that's how much

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.660
energy we have to put into the
system to eject an electron.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.560
And again, this is just the
negative, the binding energy,

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:07.920
when we're talking about
the 2 p orbital.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:11.200
So, this is first ionization
energy, let's think about

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.310
second ionization energy.

00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:16.040
So, second ionization energy
simply means you've already

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.110
taken one electron out, now how
much energy does it take

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:21.180
for you to take a second
electron out.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.210
So in the case of boron here,
what we're starting with is

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:29.080
the ion, boron 1 s 2, 2 s 2,
and now we're going to pull

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:30.850
one more electron out.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.570
The highest occupied orbital
is now the 2 s orbital, so

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:39.470
we're going to end up with boron
2 plus 1 s 2, 2 s 1,

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:42.410
plus the electron coming
out of there.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:45.490
And what we say when we talk
about the delta energy is that

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.840
this is going to be equal to i
e 2, or the second ionization

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.510
energy, or we could say the
negative of the binding energy

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:58.400
of a 2 s electron in b plus. so
it's important to note that

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:01.190
it's not in b, now we're talking
about b plus, because

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.130
we've already taken an
electron out here.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:06.340
So, similarly if we start
talking about our third

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:09.930
ionization energy, this is going
to be going from b plus

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:12.690
2, to 1 s 2, 2 s 1.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.320
Now we're going to pull that
second electron out of the 2

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.160
s, so we end up with boron
plus 3, and then the

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.670
configuration is just 1 s 2,
plus our extra electron here.

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:28.040
So, what we call this is the
third ionization energy, or

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:30.770
the negative of the binding
energy, again of the 2 s

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:35.850
orbital, but now it's in boron
plus 2 to we're starting with.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.830
So, this raises kind of an
interesting question in terms

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.800
of what the difference is
between these two cases, and

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.150
we're talking about
numbers of energy.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.930
So let's address this by
considering another example,

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.830
which should clarify what the
difference is between these

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:52.820
ionization energies.

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:55.730
So let's think about the energy
required now to remove

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.920
a 2 s electron, let's say we're
removing it from boron

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.340
plus 1 versus neutral boron.

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:06.050
So, in the case of boron plus
1, what we are starting with

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:10.700
is the ion, so we're starting
with a 2 s electron, and then

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.160
we're going to 2 s 1 here.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.800
And what we call the binding
energy is negative 2 s in b

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:19.670
plus -- this is what we
saw on the last slide.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.695
And the second case here looks
a lot more like what we saw

00:33:22.695 --> 00:33:25.780
when we were talking about
photoelectron spectroscopy,

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:28.610
because here we want to remove
a 2 s electron, but it's

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:32.070
actually not the highest
occupied orbital, so that's

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:34.140
not the one that would naturally
come out first, but

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.160
let's say we're hitting it
with high energy light

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.800
sufficient to knock out all the
different electrons, and

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.810
one that we end up knocking
out is this 2 s here.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:45.160
So if we think about what that
delta energy is, we call that

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.490
the ionization of the 2 s,
that's different from saying

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.290
second ionization energy.

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.580
And that's going to be equal
to the negative the binding

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:57.020
energy of 2 s in b,
in neutral boron.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:01.100
So, my question to you is are
these two energies equal?

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.290
No.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:03.730
All right, good answer.

00:34:03.730 --> 00:34:06.660
So, we can think about why is
it that these are not equal.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.580
In both cases we're
taking an electron

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:11.130
out of the 2 s orbital.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.210
And it turns out that if we're
talking about a 2 s orbital in

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:18.310
an ion, that means it doesn't
have as many electrons in it,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.410
so what we're going to see
is less sheilding.

00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:23.550
There are fewer electrons around
to shield some of that

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.700
nuclear charge.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:27.660
So what we're going to see is
less sheilding, which means

00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:31.680
that it will actually feel
a higher z effective.

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.410
So even though they're both 2 s
electrons, in one case it's

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:38.300
going to think its feeling more
pull from the nucleus,

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.430
and it, in fact, will be, than
in the other case, and if its

00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:44.090
feeling a higher z effective,
then it's actually going to

00:34:44.090 --> 00:34:46.820
require more energy to remove
that electron, right, it's

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:49.480
being pulled in closer and more
tightly to the nucleus,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.310
you have to put in more energy
to rip it away from that very

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:54.730
close interaction.

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:57.380
So, that's the difference in
thinking about different types

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:00.550
of ionization energy, so it can
get a little bit confusing

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.620
with terminology if you're
just looking at something

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:04.670
quickly, so make sure you look
really carefully about what

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:05.460
we're discussing here.

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:08.560
If you see a problem that asks
you, for example, the third

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.710
ionization energy versus taking
a second electron out

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:14.740
of the 2 s in a photoelectron
spectroscopy experiment, those

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:17.480
are two very different things.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.200
So, let's make sure everyone
kind of has this down, let's

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:25.030
do another clicker
question here.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.540
And in this case we're going to
look at silicone, and we'll

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.120
say if you can point out to me
which requires the least

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.310
amount of energy.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.380
So, which has the smallest
energy that you have to put in

00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.290
in order to eject
this electron?

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.970
Will it be if you take a 3
s electron from neutral

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:44.390
silicone, if you take a 3 p
electron from the neutral

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:48.590
atom, or if you take
a 3 p from the ion?

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.070
So this you should be able to
know pretty quickly, so let's

00:35:51.070 --> 00:36:05.280
just take 10 seconds here.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:05.950
All right, great.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:10.580
So most of you see that, in
fact, the energy that's going

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.080
to be the least that we need to
put in is in case 2 here.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.950
Let's compare case 2 and 3,
since this where some people

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.750
seem to have gotten confused.

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:22.390
In case 2, we're taking it out
of -- oh, it's kind of hard to

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:26.010
compare case 2 and 3 when
we can't see it anymore.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:32.140
In case 2, we're taking the 3
p out of the neutral atom,

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.180
whereas in case 3, we're taking
it out of the ion.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.260
Remember in the ion, we're going
to have less electrons

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:42.400
around to counteract the
pull from the nucleus.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:46.100
So we're going to feel a higher
z effective in the case

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.860
of the ion compared to
the neutral atom.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.800
If we have a higher z effective,
it's pulled in

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:53.670
tighter, we have to put in more
energy in order to eject

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.220
an electron, so it turns out
that that's why case 2 is

00:36:56.220 --> 00:36:59.000
actually the lowest energy
that we need to put in.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.600
The z effective is lower, so we
have to put less energy in

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:07.030
to get an ion out.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:10.990
So, let's take a look at this in
terms of periodic trends --

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:14.150
that's our topic here, we're
talking about periodic trends.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:17.100
So as we go across the row,
and this is my beautiful

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.050
picture of a periodic
table here.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:21.850
As we go across the row what
happens is that the ionization

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:25.240
energy actually increases, and
we can think about logically

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.540
why it is that that's
happening.

00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.020
As we go across the row, what we
have happening is that the

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.710
z or the atomic charge --

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:34.300
I'm not talking about z
effective here, I'm just

00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.960
talking about z -- the z is
increasing as we go across a

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.800
row, that's easy to see.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.330
But we're still in the same
shell, so we still have the

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:45.920
same n value as we go all the
way across a row in the

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:47.260
periodic table.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.380
So, in general what we're going
to see is that what

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.660
happens to z effective if we
have z increasing but we're in

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:56.150
the same shell here.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:38:01.220
Would it increase or decrease
z effective?

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:01.570
All right.

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.140
Kind of mixed thoughts here.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.020
So it turns out that it
increases, and the reason is

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.230
because the predominant thing
that's going on here is that z

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.330
is increasing.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.970
So the z is increasing, and
what goes along with it is

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.840
that the z effective is
increasing, because it turns

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.430
out that while we're in the same
n, even though we know

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:22.420
that energy depends on both the
n and the l in terms of

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:25.390
quantum numbers, while we're
in the same n, the distance

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.280
from the nucleus, it's
pretty close,

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.850
it's not hugely different.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:30.850
So the factor that predominates
is that we're

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.300
actually increasing z.

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.680
That's why we see z effective
increase, and that's why we

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:37.160
see ionization energy
increase.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:40.770
As we go down a column, what
happens is that the ionization

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.040
energy decreases.

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.220
We can also think about this
in terms of z effective.

00:38:45.220 --> 00:38:48.450
This is because even though z,
the atomic number is still

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:51.300
increasing, we are also
getting further

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:52.160
away from the nucleus.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.030
So, remember when we talk about
Coulomb force, what's

00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:57.750
holding the nucleus and the
electron together, there's 2

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.890
things we need to think about.

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:02.110
The first is this the z
effective, or how much charge

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:05.130
is actually in the nucleus
that's felt, or the I guess we

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.510
would say the z, how much the
charge is on the nucleus that

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:09.870
holds it close together.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:11.970
But the second factor
is how far away we

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:12.810
are from the nucleus.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:15.500
So, if we're really close to
the nucleus, that's when z

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.410
effective is high, but if we
get really far away, then z

00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:20.590
effective is going to get low,
because even though we have

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.640
the same charge in the
nucleus, the z

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.670
effective gets lower.

00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:26.460
So this is not even thinking
about the other electron

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.540
shielding, just if we think of
the fact, all we need to think

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:33.030
about is that the effect of
going to a further away n

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:36.170
actually dominates as we
go down the table.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.980
We're getting further away from
the nucleus because we're

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.070
jumping, for example, from the
n equals 2 to the n equals 3

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:45.030
shell, or from the n equals
3 to the n equals 4 shell.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.270
And when you're switching n's,
you're actually getting quite

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:48.520
a bit farther away.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.980
That's why in the earlier models
of the atom, they're

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.080
not horrible to sometimes think
about just each n value

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.600
as a little ring around.

00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.530
It's not complete and it's not
accurate, but it's OK to kind

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.840
of think of it in terms of how
far we're getting away from

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.890
the nucleus.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.600
So, as we go down a column, we
see ionization energy's going

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.850
to decrease.

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:09.440
So, this means we have the
general trends down, so we

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.950
should be able to look at actual
atoms in our periodic

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.580
table and graph them
and see that they

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.040
match up with our trends.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.840
So here we have that graphed
here, we have atomic number z

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.720
graphed against ionization
energy, so, let's fill in what

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.080
the actual atoms are here, and
we can see in general, yes,

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.260
we're following the trend.

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:32.350
For row one, we're increasing,
as we should, across the row.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.550
Let's look at row two also.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:36.800
Well, we're generally increasing
here, we'll talk

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:38.180
about that more in a minute.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:41.630
And also in a row three, yeah,
we're generally increasing,

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.190
there's some glitches
here, but the

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.320
general trend holds true.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:48.710
Similarly we see as we go down
the table, so as we're going

00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:52.780
from one row to the next row,
so, for example, between

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.300
helium and lithium, we see a
drop; the same with neon to

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:58.270
sodium, we see a drop here.

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.660
So it looks like we're generally
following our trend,

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.150
that's a good thing.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:05.720
But hopefully, you will not be
satisfied to just make a

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:09.280
general statement here when
we do have these glitches.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:11.930
So you can see, for example, we
have several places where

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:15.220
instead of going up as we go
across the row, we actually go

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.460
down in ionization energy
a little bit.

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.620
So between b e, and b, between
n and o, magesium and

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.170
aluminum, and then phosphorous
and sulfur, what we see here

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:27.700
is that we're kind of going
down, or quite specifically,

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.250
we are going down.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:31.780
So, let's take a look at one of
these rows in more detail

00:41:31.780 --> 00:41:34.810
to think about why this might be
happening, and it turns out

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:38.680
the reason that these glitches
occur are because the sub

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:42.660
shell structure predominates
in certain instances, and

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.930
that's where these glitches
take place.

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:48.600
So I've sort of just spread out
what we have as the second

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:52.800
row here, graphed against
the ionization energy.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.170
So, let's consider specifically
where these

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:55.540
glitches are taking place.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.300
So, let's look at the first
one between beryllium and

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:00.900
boron here.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.600
And the glitch that doesn't
make sense just through

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.500
periodic trends, is that it
turns out that the ionization

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:11.100
energy of boron is actually
less than the ionization

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.680
energy up beryllium.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.060
So I put the electron
configurations and actually

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:18.080
drew it on an energy diagram
here, so we can actually think

00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.880
about why this might
be happening.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.910
So what is this, which element
did I chart here?

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:28.930
Which one is that, the boron
or the beryllium?

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:30.730
I couldn't tell what
you said, sorry.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:34.530
So, I'm going to assume that
was beryllium, and then it

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:36.210
turns out that if that's
beryllium, the

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:37.930
other one must be boron.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:41.360
So, we have beryllium in the
first case here, it has four

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.630
electrons, that's how we
know it's beryllium,

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.500
boron has five electrons.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.370
So, just looking at putting in
the electrons, filling up the

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:53.190
energy diagram here, we should
be able to see a little bit

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.430
why this is happening.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:57.780
And the reason is simply because
the energy that we

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:02.510
gain in terms of moving up in z,
so from going to z equals 4

00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:06.160
to z equals 5, is actually
outweighed by the energy it

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:09.250
takes to go into this new
shell, to go into

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:10.410
this new sub shell.

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.330
So to jump from the 2 s to the 2
p, takes more energy than we

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.580
can actually compensate with
by increasing the pull from

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:18.560
the nucleus.

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:23.020
So, it turns out that in this
case, and any time that we see

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:27.960
we're going from a 2 s to 2 p,
filling in of electrons, we

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.350
actually see that little
bit of glitch

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.030
in ionization energy.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.350
So it's shown here for the
second row, but it's actually

00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:35.280
also going to be true
for the third row.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.080
The same thing when you're going
from filling in the 2 s

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:40.380
to putting that first electron
into the 2 p.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.850
So that explains one of our
glitches here, but we have

00:43:42.850 --> 00:43:46.120
another glitch, and that second
glitch comes between

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.400
nitrogen and oxygen.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.010
So, these sound more different,
so I think I'll be

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:51.000
able to distinguish.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.630
Which element is shown here?

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:57.290
Yeah, nitrogen.

00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.220
So, nitrogen is shown
here, we know that

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:01.950
because it has 7 electrons.

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.460
In this case, we're
talking about 8

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:06.470
electrons, which is oxygen.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:08.690
So if we're comparing the
difference between these 2

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.950
now, what you'll notice is that
in nitrogen we have all

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:16.700
half-filled 2 p orbitals, and
now, once we move into oxygen,

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.340
we actually have to add
1 more electron into

00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.760
1 of the 2 p orbitals.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.050
There's no more 2 p orbitals to
put it into, so we're going

00:44:23.050 --> 00:44:24.540
to actually have to double up.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.570
So now we're putting 2 electrons
into the same p

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.670
orbital, that's not a problem,
we can do it, it's not a huge

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:30.980
energy cost to do that.

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:33.900
But actually there is a little
bit of an energy cost into

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.670
doubling up into a single
orbital, because, of course,

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:40.380
it takes energy when you
create more electron

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.820
repulsion, that's not something
we want to do, but

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.810
we have to do it here, and it
turns out that that effect

00:44:45.810 --> 00:44:48.640
predominates over, again, the
energy that we gain by

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.160
increasing the atomic
number by one.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:54.480
So, our two glitches we see when
we go from the 2 p, or

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.500
from 2 s to start filling the
2 p, and then we also get

00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.380
another glitch when we've
half-filled the 2 p, and now

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.170
we're adding and having
to double up in

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:03.550
one of those p orbitals.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.510
Again, we see the same
effect as we go into

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.410
different rows as well.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:13.440
So let's talk about another
periodic trend, this one is

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.660
called electron affinity.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:19.140
Electron affinity is actually
the ability of an atom, or we

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.880
could also talk about an
ion to gain electrons.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:24.590
So it's the affinity it has for
electrons, it's how much

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.370
it likes to get an electron.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:30.320
We can write out what it is for
any certain atom or ion x,

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.550
so it's just x plus an electron
gives us x minus.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:35.970
We have the minus because we're
adding a negative charge

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:37.550
from the electron.

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.780
So, basically any time we have
a really high positive number

00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.110
of electron affinity, it means
that that atom or ion really

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.620
wants to gain another electron,
and it will be very

00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.690
stable and happy
if it does so.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:51.800
So let's look at an example
of chlorine here.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:54.950
So chlorine, if we talk about
it in terms of electron

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:58.010
affinity, we would be writing
that we're actually gaining an

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:01.230
electron here, and getting
the ion, c l minus.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:04.760
And the change in energy for
this reaction is negative 349

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.490
kilojoules per mole.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.110
So if we have a negative change
in energy for any

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.960
reaction as it's written, what
that actually means is we're

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.990
giving off energy as the
reaction proceeds.

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:19.640
So, in other words, this c l
minus is actually lower in

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.500
energy than the reactants
were.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:23.500
So that's why we're giving
off extra energy.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.940
We saw a similar thing as we
saw electrons move from

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:26.770
different levels.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:29.350
We can think of it in the same
type of way when we're talking

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.720
about actual reactions
happening.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.930
So, if we have energy that's
released, would you say that

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:38.270
the chlorine ion is more
or less stable than

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.830
the chlorine atom?

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:42.300
Who thinks it's more stable,
show of hands?

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.260
All right, who thinks
it's less stable?

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:46.450
Very good.

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:48.660
So it turns out it is,
in fact, more stable.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:51.370
It's more stable because you
actually -- this happens

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.610
spontaneously, you actually get
energy out of the reaction

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:55.410
as this happens.

00:46:55.410 --> 00:46:57.510
And we haven't talked about
reactions at all yet, so you

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:01.400
don't need to worry about the
specifics of that exactly, but

00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.830
just that if you have this
negative change in energy, you

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:07.430
have a more stable product
than you do reactant.

00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:11.150
So, we were talking, however,
about energy in terms of

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:14.040
electron affinity, so we can
actually relate electron

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:17.470
affinity to any reaction by
saying if we have this

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.310
reaction written as here where
we're gaining an electron, we

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:23.110
say that electron affinity is
just equal to the negative of

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.780
that change in energy.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:28.240
So, for example, for the
chlorine case, we would say

00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.090
that the electron affinity for
chlorine is actually positive

00:47:32.090 --> 00:47:35.120
349 kilojoules per mole.

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.980
That's a very large number,
it's all relative, so you

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:39.990
don't necessarily know it's
large without me telling you

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:43.690
or giving you other ions to
compare to, but chlorine does

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.670
have a very large affinity,
meaning it's really likes

00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:50.170
getting an electron and becoming
a chlorine ion.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:53.020
One major difference between
electron affinity and

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.010
ionization energy is that when
we talked about ionization

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:58.230
energy, remember ionization
energy

00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.790
always has to be positive.

00:47:59.790 --> 00:48:01.230
We will never have a case where

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:03.410
ionization energy is negative.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.200
Electron affinity, however, can
be either negative or it

00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:07.540
can be positive.

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:09.160
So let's look at a
case where it's

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.350
actually going to be negative.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:12.610
So, if we took the case of
nitrogen, if we add an

00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:15.750
electron to nitrogen and go to
n minus, we find that the

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.600
change in energy is 7
kilojoules per mole.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.310
This means in order to do that
we actually have to put 7

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:24.320
kilojoules per mole
of energy into the

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.000
reaction to make it happen.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.450
So this is not going to be a
favorable process, we're going

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:31.620
to find that the electron
affinity is actually a

00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:34.590
negative 7 kilojoules per
mole for nitrogen.

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:38.240
So this means nitrogen has low
electron affinity, it doesn't

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.710
actually want to gain
an electron.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:45.440
So, that also tells us that the
n minus ion is less stable

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.950
than the neutral atom itself.

00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:50.930
So, we can think about trends in
electron affinity just like

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.180
we did for ionization energy,
and what we see

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.510
is a similar trend.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:57.760
Electron affinity increases as
we go across a row in the

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.500
periodic table, and
it decreases as

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.320
we go down a column.

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.090
I left out the noble gases here
because they do something

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.240
a little bit special, and
actually, I'm going to give

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:10.320
you one last clicker question
today to see if you can tell

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:12.480
me what you think
noble gases do.

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.300
To answer this question you
just really want to think

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.020
about what does electron
affinity means.

00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:18.600
It means how much a certain
atom actually

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.370
wants to get an electron.

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:23.880
So do you think noble gases
would have a high positive

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.910
electron affinity, a
low positive, or

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:26.700
negative electron affinity?

00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:40.160
So, let's take 10
seconds on that.

00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:40.480
All right.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:40.850
Great.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:43.800
So most of you recognize, if we
switch back to the notes,

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.150
that they do have a negative
electron affinity.

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:48.430
This should make sense to you,
because they don't, in fact,

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:51.450
want to gain another electron,
because that would mean that

00:49:51.450 --> 00:49:54.750
electron would have to go into a
new value of n, a new shell,

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.350
and that's really going
to increase the

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:58.220
energy of the system.

00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:00.910
So they'd much rather just stay
the way they are and not

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:04.400
have another electron come on,
and it turns out that halogens

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.570
have the highest electron
affinities.

CASEY RODRIGUEZ:
OK, so last time, we

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.380 align:middle line:84%
were talking about sequences,
and I introduced the notion

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.540 align:middle line:90%
of a limit of a sequence.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.580 align:middle line:84%
So we say that x n converges to
x if for all epsilon positive

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.260 align:middle line:84%
there exists an M,
a natural number,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.960 align:middle line:84%
such that for all little n
bigger than or equal to capital

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.720 align:middle line:84%
M we have x sub n minus
x is less than epsilon.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.550 align:middle line:84%
So what this definition
says is that given

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.580 align:middle line:84%
any little bit of tolerance,
as long as I go far enough

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.160 align:middle line:84%
out in the sequence,
the entries are getting

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.620 align:middle line:90%
within that tolerance to x.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.680 align:middle line:84%
And when x then
converges to x, we'll

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.310 align:middle line:84%
write x is equal to the limit as
n goes to infinity of x sub n,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.560 align:middle line:84%
or using this notation,
x sub n arrow x.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.530 align:middle line:84%
And so I've said
before that if you ever

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.630 align:middle line:84%
have a reasonably complicated
or interesting definition,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.270 align:middle line:84%
you should try to come up
with examples and negate it.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So the end of last time,
we saw a few examples of--

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.130 align:middle line:84%
at least one example of--
a convergent sequence.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.830 align:middle line:84%
Let's negate this definition
because then we'll

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.960 align:middle line:84%
also come up with an
example of a sequence which

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.320 align:middle line:90%
does not converge.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.560 align:middle line:84%
And so the negation
of this definition

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:49.040 align:middle line:84%
is that x n does
not converge to x.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.980 align:middle line:90%
What does this mean?

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
actual negation part.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.980 align:middle line:84%
If there exists an
epsilon positive-- so

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.430 align:middle line:84%
whenever we negate a "for all,"
it becomes "there exists,"

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.350 align:middle line:84%
and whenever we negate
a "there exists,"

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.880 align:middle line:90%
it becomes a "for all."

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.520 align:middle line:84%
So there exists some bad
epsilon 0 positive such

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.740 align:middle line:84%
that for all natural numbers
N, there exists an n bigger

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:25.280 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to M
such that x n minus

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.420 align:middle line:84%
x is bigger than or equal to
this bad epsilon 0 in distance.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.030 align:middle line:84%
So we have a picture that
goes along with convergence.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We can have a picture that
goes along with a sequence not

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.140 align:middle line:90%
converging to x.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So this means if I go out
within this bad epsilon 0,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.780 align:middle line:84%
and if I go arbitrarily
out in the sequence,

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.990 align:middle line:84%
I can always find an
element x sub n which

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.595 align:middle line:90%
is not in that interval.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.330 align:middle line:90%


00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.030 align:middle line:84%
And we use this negation
to prove a certain sequence

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.120 align:middle line:90%
does not converge to x.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.880 align:middle line:84%
But let's go back
do another example

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.465 align:middle line:84%
of a sequence which
does converge, so--

00:03:13.465 --> 00:03:25.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.910 align:middle line:90%
equals 0.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.910 align:middle line:90%
So again, how does the proof go?

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You have to verify the
definition of the limit.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.770 align:middle line:84%
I mean, there's nothing else
that we have to use right now.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.262 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:43.720 align:middle line:84%
And now, off to
the side over here,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.100 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do a
little bit of work

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
to show you how
exactly in practice one

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.180 align:middle line:84%
would find such a capital M
or choose a capital M to get

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.470 align:middle line:84%
that 1 over n squared plus
30n plus 1 would be less

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.380 align:middle line:84%
than epsilon for n bigger
than or equal to capital M.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.640 align:middle line:84%
So typically how this works
is, unlike in calculus

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.030 align:middle line:84%
where you have some inequality
that you want to get

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.649 align:middle line:84%
and then you solve for
n, in analysis what's

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.500 align:middle line:84%
great is that you can
replace that thing

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.050 align:middle line:84%
you want to make small
by something simpler,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.490 align:middle line:90%
and then solve that inequality.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.020 align:middle line:90%
What do I mean?

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:33.450 align:middle line:84%
So what I want to do,
I want to find M so

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:84%
that if n it is bigger
than or equal to M, then--

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:43.750 align:middle line:84%
so I'm saying the limit is
0, so I want to show 1 over n

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.690 align:middle line:84%
squared plus 30n plus
1 is less than epsilon.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.990 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could try to solve
this inequality for n,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:05:00.020 align:middle line:84%
but this is a quadratic function
and imagine I put 20 there,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.940 align:middle line:84%
so I can't exactly solve
exactly for n to guarantee this.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:09.670 align:middle line:84%
But what's great about
analysis is that I

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:13.630 align:middle line:90%
don't have to work that hard.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.760 align:middle line:84%
I could start with
this thing which

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:20.380 align:middle line:84%
I want to bound by epsilon,
replace it by something bigger,

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
and then find capital
M so that that bigger

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.560 align:middle line:90%
thing is less than epsilon.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.460 align:middle line:90%
So what do I mean?

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.130 align:middle line:90%
So let's start with this thing--

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:33.600 align:middle line:84%
1 over n squared
plus 30n plus 1.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.020 align:middle line:84%
So this one is only
making things bigger.

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.395 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do
this very slowly.

00:05:37.395 --> 00:05:42.520 align:middle line:90%


00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.600 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than
or equal to this

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.880 align:middle line:84%
because for this, I've just
added 1 to the denominator.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.462 align:middle line:90%
And 1 over n squared plus 30n--

00:05:54.462 --> 00:05:56.170 align:middle line:84%
this certainly looks
a little bit simpler

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.280 align:middle line:84%
to solve for n
less than epsilon.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.060 align:middle line:84%
But I can make it even simpler
by dropping the n squared,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.740 align:middle line:84%
because n squared is
positive, so that's

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.990 align:middle line:90%
only making the bottom bigger.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.460 align:middle line:90%


00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.700 align:middle line:84%
So I've 1 over 30n,
and this is certainly

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.240 align:middle line:90%
less than or equal to 1 over n.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So what does this
computation show?

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.680 align:middle line:84%
This shows that if 1 over
n is less than epsilon,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:30.500 align:middle line:84%
then this implies that 1 over
n squared plus 30n plus 1 is

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.250 align:middle line:90%
less than epsilon.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.380 align:middle line:90%


00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.940 align:middle line:84%
If this thing is
less than epsilon,

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.830 align:middle line:84%
then by this string
of inequalities,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.430 align:middle line:84%
this thing will be
less than epsilon.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.917 align:middle line:84%
So we choose capital
M so that we get this.

00:06:45.917 --> 00:06:47.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we actually
write the proof,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.792 align:middle line:90%
it'll look something like this.

00:06:48.792 --> 00:06:51.460 align:middle line:84%
But the actual
style of the proof

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.522 align:middle line:90%
is a little bit different.

00:06:54.522 --> 00:06:56.230 align:middle line:84%
And if you didn't see
this, it would just

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.575 align:middle line:84%
seem like I pulled this
capital M out of nowhere,

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:02.450 align:middle line:84%
but this is the thinking
that goes behind it.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.340 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.730 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll tell you how to
choose capital M. Choose

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.410 align:middle line:84%
M a natural number so
that-- so we want it

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.960 align:middle line:84%
for all n bigger than or
equal to capital M, 1 over n

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.410 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.400 align:middle line:84%
So this will
certainly be true if n

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.740 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to capital M

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.810 align:middle line:84%
so that 1 over capital
M is less than epsilon.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.985 align:middle line:90%


00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:31.485 align:middle line:84%
And the reason we
can choose capital

00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:33.910 align:middle line:84%
M like this-- again,
where is this coming from?

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.515 align:middle line:84%
It's coming from the Archimedean
property of the real numbers.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:40.710 align:middle line:90%


00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.260 align:middle line:84%
So we've chosen
capital M. Now we

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.925 align:middle line:84%
need to show that
this capital M works.

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:48.030 align:middle line:90%


00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:53.190 align:middle line:84%
Then for all n bigger than
or equal to capital M,

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:59.190 align:middle line:84%
if I look at 1 over n
squared plus 30n plus 1

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.090 align:middle line:84%
minus 0, my proposed
limit, this is equal to 1

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.890 align:middle line:90%
over n squared plus 1.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:09.390 align:middle line:84%
And this is less
than or equal to,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.990 align:middle line:84%
if I drop n squared
and 1, 30n, which

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.110 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to 1
over n, which is less than

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.840 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 1 over capital M,
which is less than epsilon.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:37.030 align:middle line:90%


00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:42.970 align:middle line:90%
So something of a non-example--

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:49.960 align:middle line:84%
let's show that the sequence
minus 1 to the n DNC

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.310 align:middle line:90%
does not converge--

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.170 align:middle line:84%
not Democratic
National Committee--

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.130 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.570 align:middle line:90%
does not converge.

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.000 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a
sequence minus 1,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.870 align:middle line:84%
1, minus 1, 1,
minus 1, and so on.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.180 align:middle line:84%
So we have to show
it does not converge,

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
meaning for every
x in R, we'll show

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.180 align:middle line:84%
that x n does not converge
to x using the negation

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.310 align:middle line:90%
of the definition--

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:20.595 align:middle line:90%
so proof.

00:09:20.595 --> 00:09:34.640 align:middle line:90%


00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.545 align:middle line:84%
Let x be in R. And what
do we want to show?

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:41.200 align:middle line:90%


00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:53.020 align:middle line:84%
Minus 1 to the n-th
does not converge to x.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.700 align:middle line:90%


00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.120 align:middle line:90%
And we'll use this definition.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.660 align:middle line:84%
So this definition means we
need to find a bad epsilon 0.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.780 align:middle line:90%


00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.470 align:middle line:84%
And here's the kind of thinking
that goes along with this--

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.930 align:middle line:90%
there's 1, there's minus 1.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.650 align:middle line:84%
This sequence just keeps
alternating, so intuitively

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.280 align:middle line:84%
there's no way that every
element of the sequence

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.210 align:middle line:90%
can be getting--

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:24.190 align:middle line:84%
or every entry in the
sequence can be getting--

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:26.020 align:middle line:90%
close to some single x.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.380 align:middle line:90%
So what's the idea?

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.780 align:middle line:84%
The idea is that the distance
between these two guys

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:32.620 align:middle line:90%
is always 2.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:35.210 align:middle line:90%


00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:44.220 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, the distance
between every entry,

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.330 align:middle line:84%
or basically, some entry
has to be within distance--

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:52.830 align:middle line:84%
if this is within distance
1, say, to a given x,

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:58.200 align:middle line:84%
then this will be greater than
or equal to 1 in distance to x.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.090 align:middle line:84%
So you can imagine
x is over here.

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:03.060 align:middle line:84%
Minus 1 is within
distance 1 to x,

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:09.120 align:middle line:84%
but then 1 would be greater
than distance 1 to x.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.290 align:middle line:84%
So our bad epsilon 0 was
going to be 1, as we'll see.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.010 align:middle line:90%


00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.300 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon 0 equals 1.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:19.630 align:middle line:90%
That's our bad epsilon.

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.300 align:middle line:84%
So now we have to
show for all capital

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
M in the natural numbers,
there exists a little n

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:24.565 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or
equal to capital M

00:11:24.565 --> 00:11:28.210 align:middle line:90%
so that we have that inequality.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.575 align:middle line:90%
So let M be a natural number.

00:11:31.575 --> 00:11:42.020 align:middle line:90%


00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:43.445 align:middle line:90%
Then what do we see?

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:46.330 align:middle line:90%


00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So then it says, they're
exists an n greater than

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:54.180 align:middle line:84%
or equal to capital
M. And I will

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.330 align:middle line:84%
show that n is, in fact,
either capital M or capital

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:08.730 align:middle line:84%
M plus 1, then 2, which is
the distance between minus 1

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:14.770 align:middle line:84%
to the M and minus
1 to the M plus 1 is

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:17.440 align:middle line:84%
less than or equal to-- now
using the triangle inequality,

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.010 align:middle line:84%
I add and subtract x and then
use the triangle inequality.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:90%


00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:37.220 align:middle line:84%
So I have the sum of two numbers
is bigger than or equal to 2.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:39.800 align:middle line:84%
And the only way that can happen
is if one of these numbers

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.270 align:middle line:90%
is bigger than or equal to 1.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.400 align:middle line:84%
If both of these
numbers are less than 1,

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:46.580 align:middle line:84%
then the sum is less than 2, and
I would have 2 is less than 2.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:47.790 align:middle line:90%
That's not possible.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:50.780 align:middle line:84%
So one of these numbers has to
be bigger than or equal to 1.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:13:09.140 align:middle line:90%


00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:12.140 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, I could
take n equal to capital M

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:13.940 align:middle line:84%
if this is bigger
than or equal to 1,

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:16.280 align:middle line:84%
or if this is bigger
than or equal to 1,

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.590 align:middle line:84%
I take little n to
be capital M plus 1.

00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:21.030 align:middle line:90%
So that's the end of that.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:28.080 align:middle line:90%


00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's good for
examples for now.

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.560 align:middle line:84%
Let's prove a general theorem
about convergent sequences--

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.230 align:middle line:84%
namely, that if I have a
convergent sequence, then

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.860 align:middle line:90%
it's bounded.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:57.690 align:middle line:90%


00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And let me just give
you a quick reminder

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:10.890 align:middle line:84%
about what being bounded
means for a sequence, i.e.,

00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:16.590 align:middle line:84%
there exists some number
such that for all n,

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:22.430 align:middle line:84%
x n is less than or
equal to capital B. Now,

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:30.510 align:middle line:84%
as beginning students of
math, what types of questions

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.130 align:middle line:84%
should we start
asking ourselves?

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:37.220 align:middle line:90%


00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.510 align:middle line:84%
So one of the types,
or a type of question

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.050 align:middle line:84%
that we should ask when we
come across the theorem that

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:47.830 align:middle line:84%
is a one-way street,
meaning if something

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:50.560 align:middle line:84%
happens then something
else happens,

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.940 align:middle line:90%
is does the converse hold?

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:55.450 align:middle line:84%
Namely, if I assume x sub
n is a bounded sequence,

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:58.390 align:middle line:84%
does this imply that
x n is convergent?

00:14:58.390 --> 00:15:01.090 align:middle line:90%


00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you ever hear the words,
"does the converse hold,"

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:05.500 align:middle line:90%
that's what they mean.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.980 align:middle line:84%
Now, for this statement,
this is false.

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:10.900 align:middle line:84%
If x n is bounded implies
x n is convergent,

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.990 align:middle line:84%
that's false because we
have an example right

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.700 align:middle line:90%
there of a bounded sequence.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:16.560 align:middle line:84%
This sequence here,
minus 1 to the n,

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.590 align:middle line:84%
is bounded since the
sequence in absolute value

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.100 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 for all n, so
we could take B equals 1.

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.050 align:middle line:84%
So minus 1 to the n
is a bounded sequence,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.110 align:middle line:90%
which is not convergent.

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:31.790 align:middle line:90%
So the converse does not hold.

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:35.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove the theorem.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And let me draw a little
picture to go along

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.360 align:middle line:90%
with it of what's going on.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.440 align:middle line:90%
So here is 0, let's imagine.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.660 align:middle line:84%
Let me make this picture
a little bit bigger

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:53.950 align:middle line:90%
before I go into the proof.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:59.910 align:middle line:90%


00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:01.635 align:middle line:90%
So let x be the limit.

00:16:01.635 --> 00:16:04.690 align:middle line:90%


00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:06.000 align:middle line:90%
So this is not the proof yet.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.200 align:middle line:90%
This is just more discussion.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.610 align:middle line:84%
So if this x sub n
is converging to x,

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:21.780 align:middle line:84%
then let's say I go
out distance 1 to x.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Then all of the x
sub n's eventually

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:27.210 align:middle line:90%
have to land in this strip here.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.880 align:middle line:90%


00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:39.340 align:middle line:84%
So x sub n, n bigger than
or equal to some capital M.

00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:41.830 align:middle line:84%
So I know that they're all
within distance 1 to x.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.730 align:middle line:84%
So in absolute value,
they'd be bounded by,

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.860 align:middle line:84%
let's say for this
picture, it'd be x plus 1.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.520 align:middle line:84%
But if this was
over there, capital,

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.820 align:middle line:84%
it would be the absolute
value of x plus 1.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.610 align:middle line:84%
So that takes care of all x
sub n's with n bigger than

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:03.930 align:middle line:84%
or equal to M. And then
there's only finitely many guys

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.280 align:middle line:90%
to deal with.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:10.079 align:middle line:84%
Maybe there's a bigger one
out here, x sub n minus 1

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:14.099 align:middle line:84%
to deal with, and that's
how we define our number,

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:18.569 align:middle line:84%
is by the absolute
value of x plus 1

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.835 align:middle line:84%
plus the absolute value
of these finitely many.

00:17:21.835 --> 00:17:23.460 align:middle line:84%
And then that would
be something that's

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.710 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to every
element in the sequence.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:28.298 align:middle line:90%


00:17:28.298 --> 00:17:29.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the picture
that goes with it.

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.830 align:middle line:90%


00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.630 align:middle line:84%
How do we take that
picture to proof?

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So suppose x n converges to
x-- that's our assumption,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:55.030 align:middle line:84%
and there exists a
natural number M such

00:17:55.030 --> 00:18:02.980 align:middle line:84%
that for all n bigger than
or equal to capital m, x sub

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.770 align:middle line:84%
n minus x is within distance 1,
or x sub n is within distance 1

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:14.410 align:middle line:84%
to x, then for all n bigger
than or equal to capital M,

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:20.160 align:middle line:84%
if we look at the
absolute value of x sub n,

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.970 align:middle line:84%
add and subtract x, and now
use the triangle inequality,

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.790 align:middle line:84%
this is less than or equal
to absolute value of x sub

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:33.060 align:middle line:84%
n minus x plus the absolute
value of x equals 1 plus x.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So for all entries in the
sequence past this point

00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:42.230 align:middle line:84%
capital M, they're bounded in
absolute value by 1 plus x.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.105 align:middle line:90%
That's just a number.

00:18:43.105 --> 00:18:46.300 align:middle line:90%


00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:52.660 align:middle line:84%
So then, we just have
to take care of the 1

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.760 align:middle line:90%
up to capital M minus 1 guys.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.260 align:middle line:84%
We just have to
find a number bigger

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.440 align:middle line:84%
than those guys and
this number, and we'll

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:02.410 align:middle line:84%
have found a B.
So then let's take

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:11.670 align:middle line:84%
B to be x sub 1 plus x
sub 2 plus x sub capital

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:90%
M minus 1 plus this.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:29.530 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:38.190 align:middle line:84%
Then for all n a natural number,
the absolute value of x of n

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.590 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal
to B. Because if n

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:44.460 align:middle line:84%
is less than capital M,
then its absolute value

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.820 align:middle line:90%
is bounded by one of these.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.910 align:middle line:84%
Its absolute value is
equal to 1 over these,

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.910 align:middle line:84%
and therefore, less than
or equal to one of these

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.020 align:middle line:90%
plus some non-negative numbers.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:56.840 align:middle line:84%
And if n is bigger than
or equal to capital M,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.230 align:middle line:84%
then we have this
bound that we use.

00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:01.970 align:middle line:84%
And this number is
certainly less than

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:04.670 align:middle line:84%
or equal to capital
B, again, because it's

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:06.800 align:middle line:84%
this number plus a sum
of non-negative numbers.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:24.230 align:middle line:90%


00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:29.870 align:middle line:84%
Now in general, there's no
easily checkable criterion

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.720 align:middle line:90%
for a sequence to converge.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.940 align:middle line:84%
All we can do is
verify the definition.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.690 align:middle line:90%


00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.500 align:middle line:84%
But there are some sequences
which you can easily

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:45.040 align:middle line:84%
check or figure out
if they converge just

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.190 align:middle line:90%
by telling if they're bounded.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.400 align:middle line:84%
Those are what are called
"monotone sequences."

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.710 align:middle line:90%


00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is, in some
sense, the class

00:20:57.750 --> 00:21:00.030 align:middle line:84%
of sequences that
does kind of satisfy

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:04.440 align:middle line:84%
the converse of that theorem
I stated a minute ago.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:22.730 align:middle line:84%
So sequence x sub n
is monotone increasing

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:32.520 align:middle line:84%
if for all natural numbers
little n, x sub n is less than

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.350 align:middle line:90%
or equal to x sub n plus 1.

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.880 align:middle line:84%
So this means that
x sub 1 is less

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.020 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to x sub 2 is
less than or equal to x to 3,

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:43.740 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:54.580 align:middle line:90%


00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:03.050 align:middle line:84%
Sequence is monotone
decreasing if we

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:04.500 align:middle line:90%
have the other inequality.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.080 align:middle line:84%
So things are getting
smaller, so x sub n

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.285 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal
to x sub n plus 1.

00:22:11.285 --> 00:22:32.240 align:middle line:90%


00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:39.830 align:middle line:84%
And if we have a sequence
which is monotone increasing

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:41.510 align:middle line:90%
or monotone decreasing--

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.190 align:middle line:90%
so it's one or the other--

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:55.440 align:middle line:84%
we say x n is
monotone or monotonic.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.140 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
So it's simple enough to come
up with examples of sequences

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.620 align:middle line:84%
which are monotone
increasing, monotone

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.490 align:middle line:90%
decreasing, or neither.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:16.940 align:middle line:90%
So 1 over n--

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:22.760 align:middle line:90%
this is just 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4--

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:27.770 align:middle line:90%
this is monotone decreasing.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:32.780 align:middle line:84%
And if I take
minus the sequence,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:36.260 align:middle line:84%
then that reverses basically
all of the inequalities,

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.130 align:middle line:84%
and I get a monotone
increasing one.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So then this is minus
1, minus 1/2, minus 1/3,

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:46.790 align:middle line:90%
minus 1/4, monotone increasing.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.470 align:middle line:84%
And then something
that's not is-- we've

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:57.310 align:middle line:84%
already come across that--
minus 1 to the n, and so on.

00:23:57.310 --> 00:24:04.060 align:middle line:90%


00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And so the theorem
about monotone sequences

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.820 align:middle line:84%
is that there is a simpler
criterion than the definition

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.400 align:middle line:84%
for determining when
they're convergent,

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.000 align:middle line:84%
or if you like, they satisfy
the converse of this theorem up

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.180 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:38.660 align:middle line:84%
So a monotonic sequence
is convergent if and only

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.850 align:middle line:90%
if it is bounded.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.420 align:middle line:84%
So we proved a minute ago
that convergent sequences

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.975 align:middle line:84%
are bounded, so for monotonic
sequences, the converse holds.

00:24:50.975 --> 00:24:54.510 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.760 align:middle line:90%
So let's do the proof of this.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:25:00.200 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to do the proof for
monotone increasing sequences,

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.720 align:middle line:84%
and as an exercise,
I'll leave it to you

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:08.090 align:middle line:84%
to do the proof for monotone
decreasing sequences.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:19.160 align:middle line:84%
So suppose x sub n is a
monotone increasing sequence.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.080 align:middle line:90%


00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.350 align:middle line:84%
So there's two directions to
prove convergence if and only

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.560 align:middle line:90%
if bounded.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:33.270 align:middle line:84%
So we have one
direction, meaning

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:35.160 align:middle line:90%
convergence implies bounded.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.570 align:middle line:84%
This is just the
previous theorem,

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:43.150 align:middle line:84%
where we proved that every
convergent sequence is bounded,

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.220 align:middle line:90%
not just monotonic sequences.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.020 align:middle line:84%
So the meat is in proving
the converse direction.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:53.050 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we'll be
able to pick out what

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.685 align:middle line:90%
the limit is of this sequence.

00:25:54.685 --> 00:25:57.200 align:middle line:90%


00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:08.610 align:middle line:90%
So suppose x sub n is bounded.

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:14.060 align:middle line:90%


00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:16.470 align:middle line:84%
Then if I look at
the set of entries--

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:22.130 align:middle line:84%
so not the sequence but if
I look at the set of values

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:27.110 align:middle line:84%
that this sequence takes-- so x
sub n is just a natural number,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.725 align:middle line:84%
this is now a subset
of the real numbers.

00:26:30.725 --> 00:26:34.880 align:middle line:90%


00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:51.060 align:middle line:84%
This is a bounded set, meaning
it's bounded above and below

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.760 align:middle line:84%
because there exists some
capital B so that x sub

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.390 align:middle line:84%
n is, in absolute
value, less than

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:58.920 align:middle line:90%
or equal to capital B for all n.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So that means x sub n is
between B and minus B.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.360 align:middle line:84%
All right, so what's the picture
again that goes with this?

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.000 align:middle line:84%
So we have these x sub n's,
x sub 1, x sub 2, x sub 3.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.100 align:middle line:84%
We know that they cannot
go past a certain B,

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:28.990 align:middle line:84%
and they're steadily increasing,
but they can't keep strictly--

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:31.060 align:middle line:84%
they can't increase
without bound.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:34.160 align:middle line:90%


00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:42.160 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, they're
bounded by some number

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.630 align:middle line:84%
x, which I'll define to be
the supremum of this set.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:49.510 align:middle line:84%
And these guys are just
getting, in essence--

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.570 align:middle line:84%
so this is a picture,
just me trying

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.250 align:middle line:84%
to explain to you
what's going on.

00:27:54.250 --> 00:28:02.620 align:middle line:84%
If x is the sup of this
set of entries, then

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.550 align:middle line:90%
what do I know about x sub n?

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:84%
I mean x is that if I go a
little bit to the left of x--

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:13.190 align:middle line:90%
so let me draw this again.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.900 align:middle line:90%
So let me back up a minute here.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:33.790 align:middle line:84%
So since this set is bounded
in R, it has a supremum in R.

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.710 align:middle line:84%
And what I claim is that
this supremum is, in fact,

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.590 align:middle line:90%
the limit of this sequence.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.170 align:middle line:90%
This is a supremum of a set.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:43.720 align:middle line:84%
I'm saying it's the
limit of the sequence.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.210 align:middle line:90%
So what's the thinking here?

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.200 align:middle line:84%
So x is the supremum of
all the entries in x sub n,

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.700 align:middle line:84%
so nothing's ever
going to be bigger

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.300 align:middle line:84%
than some tolerance
x plus epsilon.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.960 align:middle line:84%
So we just need to worry about
what's to the left of it.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.460 align:middle line:84%
And we need to find
a capital number

00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
M so that all the x sub
n's are in this interval

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:23.735 align:middle line:84%
here, because we're trying
to show that the x sub

00:29:23.735 --> 00:29:26.680 align:middle line:84%
n's converge to x, the
supremum of this guy.

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.030 align:middle line:84%
So let's walk through
this by this picture.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.370 align:middle line:90%
So x is the supremum.

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.000 align:middle line:84%
Nothing's bigger than x,
so all of the x sub n's

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.140 align:middle line:84%
are to the left
of x plus epsilon.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.080 align:middle line:84%
So now we just need to
worry about x minus epsilon.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Now, since x is the supremum
of this set, x minus epsilon

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:50.440 align:middle line:84%
can't be an upper bound for
the set of entries of x sub n.

00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:56.830 align:middle line:84%
So that means there has to
exist some x sub M so that it's

00:29:56.830 --> 00:30:00.130 align:middle line:90%
bigger than x minus epsilon.

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:02.770 align:middle line:84%
But now, this is where we
use the fact that this is

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.100 align:middle line:90%
a monotone increasing sequence.

00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.130 align:middle line:84%
Because then, if n is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:13.360 align:middle line:84%
then x sub n is strictly
to the right of x sub M,

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:20.060 align:middle line:84%
or it's equal to x sub M
and still less than or equal

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.370 align:middle line:84%
to x because x is the
supremum of all the entries.

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.820 align:middle line:84%
So then, for n bigger than
or equal to capital M,

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.830 align:middle line:84%
they all have to lie
in this interval.

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And that's why the
sequence converges

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.210 align:middle line:90%
to the supremum of this set.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.840 align:middle line:84%
So we're using,
in a crucial way,

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:41.570 align:middle line:84%
the fact that this sequence
is monotonic increasing.

00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:42.750 align:middle line:90%
I'll prove this claim.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.840 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:57.110 align:middle line:84%
Then since x minus
epsilon is not

00:30:57.110 --> 00:31:04.700 align:middle line:84%
an upper bound for
this set, x sub n,

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.870 align:middle line:84%
there exists an
M0, natural number,

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:13.970 align:middle line:84%
so that x sub n minus
epsilon is less than x

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.825 align:middle line:84%
sub M0 is less
than or equal to x.

00:31:17.825 --> 00:31:20.380 align:middle line:90%


00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:24.640 align:middle line:84%
And we'll choose
M to be this M0.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.760 align:middle line:90%


00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.260 align:middle line:84%
Then for all n bigger
than or equal to M,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:38.290 align:middle line:84%
we have x sub n minus epsilon,
which is less than x sub M0.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.810 align:middle line:84%
And because n is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:43.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is a monotone
increasing sequence,

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.420 align:middle line:84%
x sub M0 is less than
or equal to x sub n.

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And because x is a
supremum of the set

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.220 align:middle line:84%
of all entries of
this sequence, this

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.570 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to
x, which is less than x

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.520 align:middle line:90%
plus epsilon.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:02.110 align:middle line:84%
Or to summarize--
so this should not

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.720 align:middle line:84%
be x sub n, that should
be x minus epsilon.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.240 align:middle line:84%
Or x minus epsilon is less
than x sub n is less than x

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.960 align:middle line:90%
plus epsilon.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.720 align:middle line:84%
And that's the same as showing
the absolute value of x sub

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.400 align:middle line:90%
n minus x is less than epsilon.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:22.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, what's the change
for monotone decreasing

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.960 align:middle line:84%
is that we'll be
able to identify

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.140 align:middle line:84%
the limit of the
sequence as being

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:32.990 align:middle line:84%
the imf, the
infimum of this set.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:34.930 align:middle line:84%
But I'll leave that
to you as an exercise.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:57.860 align:middle line:90%


00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's use this real quick to
prove the limit of a little bit

00:33:02.410 --> 00:33:07.030 align:middle line:84%
more interesting sequence
than 1 over this one,

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:11.110 align:middle line:84%
which is reasonably
interesting, I guess.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:26.490 align:middle line:84%
But typically in math, we
just don't prove theorems

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:28.710 align:middle line:84%
for the sake of
proving theorems.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Typically, there's some
concrete reason we do things.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.720 align:middle line:84%
There's some concrete
sequence we're

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:40.890 align:middle line:84%
trying to prove converges,
or has a certain property,

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.450 align:middle line:84%
or doesn't have a
certain property.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:53.200 align:middle line:84%
And so the basic one is if
you like a geometric sequence.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:04.290 align:middle line:84%
So if c is a positive
number between 0 and 1,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:11.639 align:middle line:84%
then we'll prove that
this sequence c to the n

00:34:11.639 --> 00:34:13.530 align:middle line:84%
is convergent and
it converges to 0.

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.969 align:middle line:90%


00:34:17.969 --> 00:34:26.090 align:middle line:84%
And we'll prove if
c is bigger than 1,

00:34:26.090 --> 00:34:31.974 align:middle line:84%
then the sequence c
to the n is unbounded.

00:34:31.974 --> 00:34:33.349 align:middle line:84%
In particular, it
can't converge.

00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:40.650 align:middle line:90%


00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.280 align:middle line:90%
So let's go in reverse order.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:84%
Let's prove that if
c is bigger than 1,

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:49.239 align:middle line:90%
then this thing is unbounded.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.690 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't require 1,
but it's shorter than 1,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.560 align:middle line:90%
and we can go ahead and do it.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.100 align:middle line:84%
And we'll use this
fact that we proved,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:35:02.920 align:middle line:84%
I think, in the first or
second lecture using induction.

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.660 align:middle line:84%
So what does it mean to
show something is unbounded?

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.420 align:middle line:84%
Again, we get to use
our negation skills.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:11.835 align:middle line:84%
It means that-- what
do we want to show--

00:35:11.835 --> 00:35:15.290 align:middle line:90%


00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:20.300 align:middle line:84%
for all B bigger
than or equal to 0,

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:26.120 align:middle line:84%
there exists an n, a natural
number, so that c to the n

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:43.980 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than B. Now, how
are we going to find this n?

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.585 align:middle line:84%
This seems like a
complicated thing.

00:35:45.585 --> 00:35:49.410 align:middle line:90%


00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:52.790 align:middle line:84%
So let's replace it
by something simpler.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:58.130 align:middle line:84%
Again, this is analysis, which
means we get to use our wits,

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:00.520 align:middle line:84%
and try to replace complicated
things by simpler things,

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:01.895 align:middle line:84%
and work with the
simpler things.

00:36:01.895 --> 00:36:04.460 align:middle line:90%


00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:06.040 align:middle line:90%
So let me do a little bit of--

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
again, this is off
to the side, how

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.650 align:middle line:90%
would one think through this.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:13.360 align:middle line:84%
If you look at c to
the n, remember we

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.570 align:middle line:84%
have this inequality
from infinite time

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:24.760 align:middle line:84%
ago that as long as x is bigger
than or equal to minus 1,

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.850 align:middle line:84%
then I get 1 plus x to
the n is bigger than 1

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:32.850 align:middle line:84%
plus n times x for
all natural numbers n.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:38.450 align:middle line:90%


00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:47.050 align:middle line:84%
So that means c to the n, which
is equal to 1 plus c minus 1

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.850 align:middle line:90%
to the n-- so this is my x--

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:52.870 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to 1 plus n times

00:36:52.870 --> 00:37:00.440 align:middle line:84%
c minus 1, which is bigger than
or equal to n times c minus 1.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.070 align:middle line:90%
You see?

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:08.530 align:middle line:84%
So if I want to make this big,
it suffices to make this big.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:10.780 align:middle line:90%
So that's what I'll do.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So let n be a natural
number such that n is

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.120 align:middle line:90%
bigger than B over c minus 1.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:35.920 align:middle line:90%


00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.650 align:middle line:84%
Then now this we did off
to the side we'll just

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:39.970 align:middle line:90%
put in the proof now.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:42.510 align:middle line:90%


00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:47.850 align:middle line:84%
And c to the n equals 1
plus 1 minus c to the n

00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:51.060 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to 1 plus n times

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:54.530 align:middle line:84%
c minus 1, which is bigger
than or equal to n times

00:37:54.530 --> 00:38:00.570 align:middle line:84%
c minus 1, which is bigger
than B over c minus 1 times c

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:10.930 align:middle line:84%
minus 1 equals B. So now
let's prove the first claim,

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:13.870 align:middle line:84%
that if c is between 0
and 1, then the limit as n

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:17.710 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of
c to the n equals 0.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:20.470 align:middle line:84%
So first, I want to prove
the following claim--

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:24.040 align:middle line:84%
that we, in fact, have a
decreasing sequence, which

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.600 align:middle line:90%
is bounded below by 0.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:39.210 align:middle line:84%
So claim for all n, 0
is less than c to the n

00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:45.510 align:middle line:84%
is less than, I should say, c
to the n plus 1 is less than c

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.020 align:middle line:90%
to the n.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:53.720 align:middle line:90%


00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:57.990 align:middle line:84%
So the proof of this claim is a
very simple induction argument,

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:59.910 align:middle line:90%
so we'll do this by induction.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:06.020 align:middle line:84%
So we have the base
case n equals 1.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:17.410 align:middle line:84%
So we are assuming that
c is between 0 and 1.

00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:19.690 align:middle line:84%
And if I multiply
through by c, I

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:24.210 align:middle line:84%
conclude that 0 is less than
c squared is less than c.

00:39:24.210 --> 00:39:26.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's the n equals 1 case.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:32.785 align:middle line:84%
And the inductive step is
essentially the same proof.

00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:35.500 align:middle line:90%


00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:42.450 align:middle line:84%
Suppose 0 is less than c to
the m plus 1 is less than c

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:43.090 align:middle line:90%
to the m.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
Then multiplying through by c,
we get that 0 is less than c

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.020 align:middle line:84%
to the m plus 2 is
less than c to the m

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.880 align:middle line:84%
plus 1, which is
n equals m plus 1.

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.790 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're using
this fact here--

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:05.400 align:middle line:84%
that c is positive so it
doesn't flip the inequalities,

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:10.010 align:middle line:84%
so I can multiply it through
and preserve the inequalities.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:20.740 align:middle line:84%
So this shows that this
sequence is monotone decreasing

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.540 align:middle line:84%
and it's bounded below by
0, and in fact bounded,

00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:40.530 align:middle line:84%
because c to the n and absolute
value, these are all positive,

00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.120 align:middle line:90%
is equal to c to the n.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:46.800 align:middle line:84%
And c to the n is less
than c to the n minus 1,

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:50.640 align:middle line:84%
which is less than c to the
n minus 2, so on, and so on,

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.800 align:middle line:90%
which is less than c.

00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:56.340 align:middle line:90%
So it's bounded.

00:40:56.340 --> 00:41:02.340 align:middle line:84%
I guess I could have built
that into this inequality

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:06.620 align:middle line:84%
and proved that as
well, but that's OK.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So it has a limit.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:25.090 align:middle line:84%
So by the previous theorem, has
a limit, and I'll call it L.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:27.235 align:middle line:84%
And now what I want to
show is that L is 0.

00:41:27.235 --> 00:41:34.350 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:39.900 align:middle line:84%
And how we'll do that is one of
these analysis tricks, where--

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:42.750 align:middle line:84%
not really tricks-- but
rather than show with L

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.970 align:middle line:84%
is directly equal
to 0, we'll show

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.760 align:middle line:84%
that the absolute value
of L is less than epsilon

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.500 align:middle line:84%
for every epsilon
positive, and therefore

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.500 align:middle line:84%
it has to be 0 because
it's just a fixed number.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:58.010 align:middle line:90%


00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.170 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:01.753 align:middle line:84%
Again, we're going to show that
the absolute value of L, which

00:42:01.753 --> 00:42:04.790 align:middle line:84%
is just a fixed number,
is less than epsilon.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.300 align:middle line:84%
And therefore,
capital L has to be 0.

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:12.430 align:middle line:90%


00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:18.490 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists, since this
sequence converges, an M,

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:23.680 align:middle line:84%
a natural number, such
that for all n bigger

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.790 align:middle line:84%
than or equal to capital
M, c to the n minus L

00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:35.870 align:middle line:84%
is less than 1 minus c
times epsilon over 2.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:42.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe you're wondering why
didn't I just use epsilon here?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, in the end,
it's just going

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:49.378 align:middle line:84%
to come out to this being less
than epsilon in absolute value.

00:42:49.378 --> 00:42:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, I would have come
out with less than epsilon times

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.110 align:middle line:84%
some number, and I did
away with that number

00:42:54.110 --> 00:42:57.210 align:middle line:84%
by choosing a
different number here.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:04.820 align:middle line:84%
So now we compute that
if I look at 1 minus c

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.100 align:middle line:84%
times the absolute
value of L, this

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:12.520 align:middle line:84%
is equal to L minus
c times L. And this

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:21.500 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to L
minus c to the capital M plus--

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.890 align:middle line:90%


00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.990 align:middle line:84%
let's put a plus 1, plus c to
the M plus 1 minus c to the L.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.420 align:middle line:84%
And by the triangle
inequality, this

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:37.880 align:middle line:84%
is less than or equal to L
minus c to the M plus 1 plus--

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.730 align:middle line:84%
now c to the M plus
1 minus c to the L,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:47.860 align:middle line:84%
so I can pull out a c which
is positive, so I can get L.

00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, M plus 1 is
bigger than M. So it

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:57.820 align:middle line:84%
satisfies this inequality,
and so does this one.

00:43:57.820 --> 00:44:01.570 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this is less
than epsilon over 2 times

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:08.200 align:middle line:84%
1 minus c plus c times epsilon
over 2 times 1 minus c.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.140 align:middle line:84%
And C is less than 1,
so this whole thing

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.970 align:middle line:84%
is less than
epsilon over 2 times

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.610 align:middle line:84%
1 minus c plus another
epsilon over 2.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So I get epsilon over
2 times 1 minus c.

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:26.660 align:middle line:90%


00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:34.960 align:middle line:84%
And thus, the absolute value
of L is less than epsilon.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.350 align:middle line:84%
And since epsilon was
arbitrary, that implies

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:42.270 align:middle line:84%
the absolute value of L is equal
to 0, i.e., L is equal to 0.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:51.560 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.000 align:middle line:84%
So that's a very
concrete application

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.980 align:middle line:84%
of some of these theorems we've
been proving, which is really--

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.050 align:middle line:84%
I think the only real
reason one proves

00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:10.213 align:middle line:84%
theorems is you typically have
a concrete example of something

00:45:10.213 --> 00:45:11.505 align:middle line:90%
in mind that you want to study.

00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:14.300 align:middle line:90%


00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.360 align:middle line:84%
But in order to
study it, it often

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:22.935 align:middle line:84%
requires some general
machinery, i.e., theorems.

00:45:22.935 --> 00:45:35.680 align:middle line:90%


00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.830 align:middle line:84%
So now we'll talk a
little bit about sequences

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.550 align:middle line:90%
obtained from other sequences.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:48.940 align:middle line:84%
So these are called
subsequences,

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:56.117 align:middle line:84%
or sequences obtained
from a single sequence.

00:45:56.117 --> 00:45:57.200 align:middle line:90%
So what do I mean by this?

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Let me give you the
precise definition.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:16.380 align:middle line:84%
So we started off with a
sequence and an increasing

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:23.250 align:middle line:90%
sequence of integers, n sub k.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:31.910 align:middle line:90%


00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:35.820 align:middle line:84%
So let me just say what this
means rather than write out

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.110 align:middle line:84%
the word and then
say what it means.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:51.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is the sequence
of natural numbers, which

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:54.330 align:middle line:84%
are strictly increasing.
n sub 1 is less

00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:58.140 align:middle line:84%
than n sub 2 is less
than n sub 3, and so on.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:05.620 align:middle line:90%


00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:14.130 align:middle line:84%
The new sequence, x sub n sub
k-- so now the index is not n,

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:15.350 align:middle line:90%
but the index is k--

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:20.600 align:middle line:90%


00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:33.470 align:middle line:84%
is called a subsequence of
the original sequence x sub n.

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.400 align:middle line:90%


00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:42.320 align:middle line:84%
So how should you view
subsequences of a sequence?

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:47.780 align:middle line:84%
You should think that I line
up all the entries of x,

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.830 align:middle line:84%
of my original sequence
x sub n, and then

00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:57.770 align:middle line:84%
I just start picking
entries out of the sequence.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:01.250 align:middle line:84%
But every time I make a choice,
I have to move to the right

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.410 align:middle line:90%
and make another choice.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:06.980 align:middle line:84%
That's what I was just saying
there, expresses this condition

00:48:06.980 --> 00:48:10.740 align:middle line:84%
that this sequence of natural
numbers is increasing.

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.430 align:middle line:84%
So I pick an entry
in the sequence.

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:16.700 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be my first
guy, the first element

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.200 align:middle line:90%
of my new subsequence.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:22.640 align:middle line:84%
And then I move to the right,
and maybe I pick the next one,

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.320 align:middle line:90%
maybe I pick one three down.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:25.500 align:middle line:90%
I pick that one.

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:30.400 align:middle line:84%
And then I move to the right
of that one and pick a new one.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.310 align:middle line:84%
And then I move to the right of
that one and pick another one.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So if you want to
generate a subsequence

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.480 align:middle line:84%
from an original sequence,
how do you think about this?

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.065 align:middle line:84%
Again, line them all up,
start picking entries,

00:48:43.065 --> 00:48:44.440 align:middle line:84%
but every time
you pick an entry,

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:47.875 align:middle line:84%
you have to move to the right in
order to pick your next entry.

00:48:47.875 --> 00:48:52.600 align:middle line:90%


00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:56.180 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you some
examples and non-examples.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:06.730 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if our original
sequence is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:12.880 align:middle line:84%
and so on, what would be
examples of some subsequences?

00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:19.160 align:middle line:84%
The odd numbers 1,
3, 5, 7, 9 and so on.

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:21.560 align:middle line:84%
You see how I'm taking
the original sequence,

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.563 align:middle line:90%
so this is x sub n.

00:49:25.563 --> 00:49:27.730 align:middle line:84%
I'm just picking entries
from the original sequence,

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:29.938 align:middle line:84%
but every time I pick an
entry, I move to the right

00:49:29.938 --> 00:49:30.730 align:middle line:90%
and pick a new one.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.070 align:middle line:84%
So I picked 1, now I
get to choose anything

00:49:33.070 --> 00:49:34.310 align:middle line:90%
to the right of that.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:38.060 align:middle line:84%
I pick 3, now I can choose
anything to the right of that.

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:40.480 align:middle line:84%
So in the language
of this definition,

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:44.380 align:middle line:84%
the increasing
sequence of integers

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:48.250 align:middle line:84%
is just the odd
integers, so 2k minus 1.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:52.090 align:middle line:84%
So here, x sub n
is equal to just n.

00:49:52.090 --> 00:49:57.420 align:middle line:90%


00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:00.810 align:middle line:84%
I could pick another
subsequence would be

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:02.880 align:middle line:90%
the sequence of even numbers--

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.620 align:middle line:90%
2, 4, 6, 8, 10.

00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.050 align:middle line:84%
This is a subsequence of
this original sequence.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:13.590 align:middle line:84%
Here, the increasing
sequence of integers is 2k.

00:50:13.590 --> 00:50:20.160 align:middle line:90%


00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.250 align:middle line:84%
I could pick the
subsequence could be

00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:26.040 align:middle line:90%
the sequence of prime numbers--

00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.540 align:middle line:90%
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13.

00:50:30.540 --> 00:50:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.510 align:middle line:84%
And the increasing--
so I don't have

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:40.730 align:middle line:90%
a general formula for that.

00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:43.220 align:middle line:84%
Good luck finding
one, but we'll just

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:49.125 align:middle line:90%
write this as k-th prime number.

00:50:49.125 --> 00:50:57.790 align:middle line:90%


00:50:57.790 --> 00:51:00.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, what would
not be an example?

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:02.890 align:middle line:84%
So these are examples
of subsequences.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.650 align:middle line:90%


00:51:05.650 --> 00:51:07.780 align:middle line:84%
Not examples of
subsequences would

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:12.280 align:middle line:84%
be, for example, the
sequence 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.120 align:middle line:84%
This is not a subsequence
of this original sequence.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.530 align:middle line:84%
Remember, I have a
sequence of natural numbers

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:20.020 align:middle line:90%
which is increasing.

00:51:20.020 --> 00:51:27.070 align:middle line:84%
And x sub n sub k means
that this new sequence is

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.160 align:middle line:84%
obtained from the old
one by picking entries--

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:32.227 align:middle line:84%
by picking an entry,
moving to the right,

00:51:32.227 --> 00:51:34.060 align:middle line:84%
picking the next entry,
moving to the right,

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.710 align:middle line:90%
and picking the next entry.

00:51:35.710 --> 00:51:39.055 align:middle line:84%
Here, in order to get this
sequence from this one,

00:51:39.055 --> 00:51:42.640 align:middle line:84%
I just stay on the first
entry and keep picking it.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.585 align:middle line:84%
But that's not how a
subsequence is defined.

00:51:46.585 --> 00:51:49.430 align:middle line:90%


00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:56.500 align:middle line:84%
So here, if you like, this would
mean n sub k is equal to 1.

00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.663 align:middle line:84%
And this is not a strictly
increasing sequence

00:51:58.663 --> 00:51:59.455 align:middle line:90%
of natural numbers.

00:51:59.455 --> 00:52:03.040 align:middle line:90%


00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:09.830 align:middle line:84%
Or 1, 1 3, 3, 5, 5, and
so on-- that's also not.

00:52:09.830 --> 00:52:20.050 align:middle line:84%
So these are not subsequences
of the original sequence

00:52:20.050 --> 00:52:20.800 align:middle line:90%
given here.

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:27.527 align:middle line:90%


00:52:27.527 --> 00:52:28.485 align:middle line:90%
So I hope that's clear.

00:52:28.485 --> 00:52:34.000 align:middle line:90%


00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.040 align:middle line:90%
Now, I want to emphasize this--

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:46.430 align:middle line:84%
I'm not saying that the
number you pick each time

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.910 align:middle line:84%
has to be different from the
number you picked before,

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:52.220 align:middle line:90%
meaning the value.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:56.750 align:middle line:84%
You couldn't have 1, 1, 1, 1
as a subsequence of this guy

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:59.240 align:middle line:84%
because 1 is only
in the first entry.

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:01.400 align:middle line:84%
You can't keep
picking one entry.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:03.110 align:middle line:84%
You have to pick
an entry and move

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:06.080 align:middle line:84%
to the next entry or
the one after that

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and pick that entry to
obtain your sequence.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.570 align:middle line:84%
But that doesn't
necessarily mean

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:16.130 align:middle line:84%
that those actual
numbers in those entries

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:17.250 align:middle line:90%
have to be different.

00:53:17.250 --> 00:53:24.110 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if I look
at the sequence minus 1,

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:31.270 align:middle line:84%
1, 1, minus 1, 1, one meaning
x sub n is equal to minus 1

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:36.850 align:middle line:84%
to the n-th then a perfectly
good subsequence is given

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:42.070 align:middle line:84%
by minus 1, minus
1, minus 1, minus 1,

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:45.130 align:middle line:84%
where it looks like I'm just
picking one of the entries,

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:46.120 align:middle line:90%
but really I'm not.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, the increasing
sequence-- so

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:51.460 align:middle line:84%
what I'm doing here to
get this new sequence,

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I picked the first entry,
then I picked the third,

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.410 align:middle line:84%
then I picked the fifth,
then I picked the seventh.

00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:01.510 align:middle line:90%
So n sub k equals 2k minus 1.

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:04.600 align:middle line:84%
So all the actual numbers
appearing in the sequence

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.970 align:middle line:84%
are the same, but I'm actually
picking different entries

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:14.220 align:middle line:84%
from the original sequence,
where they appear.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:15.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is also fine.

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:18.425 align:middle line:90%
So is 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

00:54:18.425 --> 00:54:22.080 align:middle line:90%


00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.430 align:middle line:90%
This is n k equals 2 times k.

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.430 align:middle line:84%
So these are all
good subsequences.

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:34.190 align:middle line:84%
So these were subsequences
of the original sequence.

00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:37.070 align:middle line:84%
These are subsequences
of this sequence.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:55:09.120 align:middle line:90%


00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:14.700 align:middle line:84%
So from a given sequence,
we can obtain new sequences

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:19.610 align:middle line:84%
from this original
sequence in this way.

00:55:19.610 --> 00:55:22.060 align:middle line:84%
So a natural question
is to ask, how

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:33.350 align:middle line:84%
does going from a
sequence to a subsequence

00:55:33.350 --> 00:55:35.570 align:middle line:90%
behave with respect to limits?

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:38.330 align:middle line:84%
If the original sequence
converges to a limit,

00:55:38.330 --> 00:55:41.060 align:middle line:84%
does a subsequence or
does every subsequence

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.440 align:middle line:90%
converge to that limit as well?

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And this shouldn't come as
a surprise that it does.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:50.648 align:middle line:84%
Because all of the elements of
the sequence are getting close,

00:55:50.648 --> 00:55:52.440 align:middle line:84%
all the entries of the
sequence are getting

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.940 align:middle line:90%
close to a given number.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.510 align:middle line:84%
And a subsequence is just, if
you like, picking certain ones

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:58.630 align:middle line:90%
along the way.

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.620 align:middle line:84%
So certainly if I'm
in a subsequence,

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:04.470 align:middle line:84%
then as long as I'm far
enough out in the subsequence,

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.540 align:middle line:84%
I'll be close to
that limit as well.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.540 align:middle line:84%
So if you didn't get
all that rambling,

00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:13.410 align:middle line:84%
I'll go ahead and state
the theorem and prove it.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:29.270 align:middle line:90%


00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:33.575 align:middle line:84%
x n is a sequence
which converges to x.

00:56:33.575 --> 00:56:43.150 align:middle line:90%


00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:58.520 align:middle line:84%
And x sub n sub k is a
subsequence of x sub n.

00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:02.850 align:middle line:84%
Then the subsequence
converges to x, as well.

00:57:02.850 --> 00:57:07.200 align:middle line:90%


00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:12.510 align:middle line:84%
Limit as k goes to infinity
of x sub n sub k equals x.

00:57:12.510 --> 00:57:34.250 align:middle line:90%


00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So let me just start off by
making a simple observation

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:41.990 align:middle line:84%
based on the fact that
this increasing sequence--

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:43.718 align:middle line:84%
that the n sub k's
are an increasing

00:57:43.718 --> 00:57:44.885 align:middle line:90%
sequence of natural numbers.

00:57:44.885 --> 00:57:47.420 align:middle line:90%


00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:55.440 align:middle line:84%
Since n sub 1 is bigger than
or equal to 1 is less than n

00:57:55.440 --> 00:58:00.000 align:middle line:84%
sub 2 is less than
n sub 3 and so on,

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.370 align:middle line:84%
this implies that for
all k, a natural number,

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:08.190 align:middle line:84%
n sub k is bigger
than or equal to k.

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:13.920 align:middle line:90%


00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is not so hard to
believe because n sub 1 has

00:58:16.590 --> 00:58:18.150 align:middle line:90%
to be at least bigger than 1.

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:20.880 align:middle line:84%
And n sub 2 has to be at
least bigger than n sub 1,

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.270 align:middle line:84%
so it's either n sub
1 plus 1 or bigger.

00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:28.057 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by a
simple induction argument,

00:58:28.057 --> 00:58:29.640 align:middle line:84%
which I'll leave to
you, you can prove

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.125 align:middle line:84%
that for all k,
a natural number,

00:58:31.125 --> 00:58:35.705 align:middle line:84%
n sub k is bigger than or
equal to k, induct on k.

00:58:35.705 --> 00:58:41.340 align:middle line:90%


00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:44.940 align:middle line:84%
So we want to prove that
this sequence converges to x.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.490 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do that
using the only means we have.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So this is just some arbitrary
subsequence of x sub n.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.475 align:middle line:84%
All we have is the
definition to use.

00:58:53.475 --> 00:58:56.220 align:middle line:90%


00:58:56.220 --> 00:58:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to
now prove this.

00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:59.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have to show
for all epsilon

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.450 align:middle line:84%
positive, blah, blah, blah, so
the first thing we have to do

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.590 align:middle line:90%
is let epsilon be positive.

00:59:04.590 --> 00:59:07.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll use the fact that
x sub n converges to x.

00:59:07.130 --> 00:59:10.655 align:middle line:90%


00:59:10.655 --> 00:59:14.510 align:middle line:90%
So x sub n converges to x.

00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:19.790 align:middle line:84%
There exists a natural
number M0 such that

00:59:19.790 --> 00:59:30.360 align:middle line:84%
for all n bigger than
or equal to M0, x

00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:35.720 align:middle line:84%
sub n minus x absolute
value is less than epsilon.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.411 align:middle line:84%
This M sub 0 we'll choose
for our subsequence.

00:59:38.411 --> 00:59:41.060 align:middle line:90%


00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:45.700 align:middle line:84%
Choose M to equal
M sub 0, so now we

00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:48.250 align:middle line:84%
need to show that this capital
M works for our subsequence,

00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:51.070 align:middle line:84%
meaning if k is bigger
than or equal to capital M,

00:59:51.070 --> 00:59:56.350 align:middle line:84%
then x sub n sub k minus x
is an absolute value less

00:59:56.350 --> 00:59:57.170 align:middle line:90%
than epsilon.

00:59:57.170 --> 01:00:01.840 align:middle line:84%
But this just follows
from this fact.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.790 align:middle line:84%
And if k is bigger than or
equal to M, this implies,

01:00:06.790 --> 01:00:11.860 align:middle line:84%
by this inequality, n
sub k is bigger than

01:00:11.860 --> 01:00:15.190 align:middle line:84%
or equal to M, which
remember, is equal to M sub 0.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.370 align:middle line:84%
So n sub k is some
integer, so natural number

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:21.490 align:middle line:90%
bigger than or equal to M sub 0.

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:23.710 align:middle line:84%
So that implies
by this inequality

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:28.090 align:middle line:84%
that x sub n sub k minus
x in absolute value

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:30.105 align:middle line:90%
is less than epsilon.

01:00:30.105 --> 01:00:38.451 align:middle line:90%

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.670
PROFESSOR: Let's talk
about the V-Model, here.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.450
We are-- interesting, we have
a little bit of a lag here.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:38.240
So the lifecycle management
is our last topic for today

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.210
and that sort of
completes the V. And then

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.840
next [AUDIO OUT] manufacturing.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.800
So what I'd like to cover
today is essentially

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.900
a definition of
[INAUDIBLE] mean by that,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.945
and then focus on the lifecycle
[INAUDIBLE] also known

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.020
as the [? ilities. ?]
Discuss a little bit

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.050
where they come from, how
much we know about them.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.580
The bulk of the
discussion is going

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.980
to be a case study
called Reconfiguration

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.890
of Communication
Satellite Constellations.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.460
And this sort of explains
the idea that system,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.440
once you brought a system
into operation, that's

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.010
not the end of the story.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.530
The system is going to continue
to live and change and be

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.754
modified over its life.

00:01:23.754 --> 00:01:25.670
I'll try to summarize
some of the key concepts

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.140
over the whole semester.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.230
And then I have one
slide on career and study

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.350
recommendations, if
you want to go further

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.280
into systems engineering.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.720
So lifecycle management.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.260
So this is my definition of
what lifecycle management is.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.790
It's essentially the active
engagement of-- it's the active

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.000
engagement of all the
stakeholders with the system,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.490
between the time when
it starts to operate--

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.020
so you've done
the commissioning,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.910
you've done the operations--

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.040
until you decide to decommission
and retire the system.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.700
So it's during the
whole operation life.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.200
And what you want
to do, is you want

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.320
to maximize the
value that you gain

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139
from the system's existence.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.740
And so life cycle
management starts

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.170
from the very, very, very start.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.140
And so I listed
here some activities

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.980
that are included in
lifecycle management.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.770
So obviously daily operations,
you know monitoring,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.510
is the system
working as expected?

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.750
Training and certification
of the operators.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.860
Sometimes, you know,
in long live systems,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.960
the people who were the early
operators, generation one,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.300
are not necessarily the
people who are going

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.770
to operate for the whole life.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.130
So you have to have
new people operate.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.260
Maybe one of the most
extreme examples of that

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.532
is an airplane
known as the b-52.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:47.490
Have you heard of this?

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.530
This airplane might be the
first plane that actually has

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.990
a 100 year operational life.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.240
And there are apparently Navy--

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.330
Air Force guys at MIT,
you can confirm this,

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.040
that there's actually like--

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.580
the grandfather was
the first generation

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.190
and there's like third
generation pilots now flying

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.690
on the b-52.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.270
That's what I've been told.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.554
Did you hear this as well?

00:03:12.554 --> 00:03:15.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah, That's correct.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.150
PROFESSOR: Do some
of these people?

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.080
AUDIENCE: No, I've
never actually worked

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.440
on that airframe.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.250
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.960
But anyway, so
that's what I mean

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.590
by [INAUDIBLE] not just
the initial operators,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.200
but over multiple generations.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.040
Then the third thing
here is servicing.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.500
And servicing comes
in two flavors,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.210
of preventive
maintenance, you know

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.390
regular maintenance, and
then corrective maintenance,

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.820
which we also call repair.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.920
Dealing with small and large
failures, recalls, anomalies.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.030
This is a big deal in
the automotive industry,

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.440
as we know.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.540
Increasingly
protecting the system

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.480
from either random
or targeted attacks.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.380
Cyber, physical, right,
physical security but also cyber

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.430
security is becoming
a huge topic.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.470
Sharing and archiving
the data that's

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.820
being produced by the system.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.762
More and more systems produce
larger amounts of data.

00:04:12.762 --> 00:04:13.970
Well, what do you do with it?

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.850
How do you store that data?

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:18.670
Upgrading and retrofitting
the system as needed.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.670
So retrofitting means
we're physically

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.710
changing the configuration
of the system--

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.370
right?-- over its life
to add new capabilities.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.480
And upgrading; upgrading
can be done sometimes

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.640
without having to
change the hardware.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.910
So you're doing a software
upgrade, or software update,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.380
software patching.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.255
All of this would
go under upgrades.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.770
Cross strapping the
system with other system

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.680
in a federation of systems.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.960
So what I mean by
this is a system

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.410
may have been designed
just to operate on its own,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.540
but now you're connecting
it with another system.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.351
This happened, for example,
the electrical grid.

00:04:58.351 --> 00:04:58.850
Right?

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.160
The early electrical grids were
local, regional power grids.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.610
And now we've connected
them, in the US

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.340
we have three major grids, the
eastern, the western, and then

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.900
Texas has its own grid.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.030
Texas does a lot
of its own stuff.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.220
It's called ERCCOT.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.090
And then here in
Europe, you know

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.960
the European electrical grid
is now continental-wide.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.010
It didn't used to be.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:25.720
And of course, that has big
implications for operations.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.355
Reducing the
resource consumption

00:05:27.355 --> 00:05:31.060
and environmental burden
of the system over time,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.800
and then finally,
decommissioning

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.420
the system when
it's time to do so.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:38.670
And in many systems,
this is a big challenge

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:41.020
as to finding when
is the right time

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.060
to decommission the system.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.100
And that's often the
case when, you know,

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.910
the operating costs exceed the
value that the system delivers.

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.920
So this is a pretty
long list here.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:57.410
And a lot of tasks, a lot
of decisions to be made.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.010
Any questions about this list?

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.180
I don't think it's
complete, but this

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.510
is a lot of things you need to
take care of during operations.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.200
Here's a more
graphical view of this.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.930
So this is my sketch of the
systems engineering lifecycle.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.150
So this is part one, right?

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.290
Conceptual design-- conception,
design, and implementation.

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.440
You start the lifecycle, you
do something like a system

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.740
requirements review, understand
the mission, the requirements,

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.090
the constraints.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.510
You do conceptual design,
that's where you do creativity,

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.430
architecting, trade studies.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.127
As a PDR, you choose--

00:06:35.127 --> 00:06:36.710
so in this case, you
know, we're going

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.760
to go through this
triangle concept

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.970
and then you design all
the details within it.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.570
That's where we do modeling,
simulation, experiments, MDO.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.000
And we iterate--
sometimes you have

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to iterate this
[? dashed ?] duration means

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.210
abandoning the concept you chose
and go for a different concept.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:59.940
That's usually undesirable.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:02.820
After the CDR, we
implement the system,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.670
we turn information to
matter, and this all

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.310
happens in a technological,
economic, social context.

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:14.220
So then, the second part of
it, which in many systems--

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.560
if this is 10 years, this
could be 30 years or more--

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.940
is the actual operational space.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.300
So the system has now been
tested, validated, verified,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.530
and deployed.

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.830
And now, you know, we
operate the system.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.340
Things break, we need to service
it, and then I have this--

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.230
you see, there's two
versions of the system.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.220
One is solid, and the
other one is kind of faint.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.270
That's the virtual
version of the system.

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.740
So one of the big concepts
that's being pushed now,

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.700
certainly in the US by the
DOD, but also other places.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.280
Is the idea of a digital twin.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.500
The idea of a digital
twin is that there's

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.850
a physical system--

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.650
right?-- that exists,
and then there's

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:58.530
a digital version, a
digital twin of that system,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.890
somewhere on a computer
that mirrors exactly

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.820
what the real system is doing.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.300
So if something breaks
on the physical system,

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.810
well that same component
fails in the digital twin.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:13.230
And then, before you actually
do a repair or any actions,

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:15.970
you execute those actions
on the digital twin

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.970
to see whether the system
will operate properly.

00:08:20.686 --> 00:08:24.840
And so this is kind of
the latest thinking,

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.130
is that for any system we
should have a digital twin doing

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:30.390
operations.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:31.630
Upgrading the system.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.440
So in this case, we're
adding things to it,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.820
we're connecting it.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.940
You know, and then at some
point, the system does degrade.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.520
Because, for example,
you know, materials, age,

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.289
they get brittle.

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.050
Technology becomes obsolete.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:49.710
You know, it gets harder and
harder to maintain spare parts

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:52.740
or the suppliers of the
original spare parts

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.060
went out of business.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.220
So these really
old legacy systems

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.350
can be very
expensive to operate.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.490
And then at some
point you liquidate

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.810
and it's the end
of the life cycle.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.790
So I've already told you
about one example of this,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.910
which is the space shuttle.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.920
And so I'm not going
to belabor this again,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.530
but I think it's a great
opportunity to learn.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:19.650
The space shuttle had a 10 year
design life, roughly from 1971

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.750
until '81, first flight.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:25.020
And then we operated
the shuttle for 30 years

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.710
and we had a total of 135
launches during that time.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.390
We spent $192 billion dollars
on the shuttle program.

00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.600
And if you average
that, it's $1.5 billion

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.890
per flight, which is a
lot more than was planned.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:43.530
But just yesterday
here at the EPFL,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:47.910
we had the annual meeting
of the Swiss Space Center.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.380
And one of the astronauts
here, Claude Niccolier

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.290
and his colleague,
Professor [? Mehron ?]

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.630
gave a great talk
about the Hubble

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.900
and the servicing of the Hubble
and the amazing things we've

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.160
learned through it.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.490
And you guys at
MIT, Jeff Hoffman,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.040
was part of at least the first
servicing mission as well.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:14.290
So there's incredible things
that were done by the shuttle.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.860
And so I think we need to
acknowledge that, not just

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.330
the fact that it
was very expensive.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.300
It accomplished great
things during its life.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.300
But you know, if we had a chance
to do it again, would we--

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.490
would we come up with
the exact same system,

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.890
would we make all the
same design decisions?

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.240
You know, we lost two of them.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.820
Probably not, we could probably
do something-- something

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.810
different.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.940
So here's what we wanted,
and then finally, we

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:41.770
got a much more complex
system in the end.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.720
And particularly my sense is
that a lot of the things that

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.410
made the shuttle expensive
to operate during its life

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.731
were things related
to maintainability.

00:10:51.731 --> 00:10:52.230
Right?

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.220
Reliability and so forth.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:56.160
So the lifecycle
properties, which I

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.310
want to talk about next.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.470
So I'm just going to
repeat the questions,

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:01.240
so you guys can hear as well.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.870
So the question was
about reusability.

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.580
So the shuttle was--

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.460
the orbiter was fully reusable.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:11.020
The external fuel
tank was not reusable.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:11.520
Right?

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.200
And then the solid
rocket boosters

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.180
were partially
reusable because they

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.000
had to be stripped
down, you know,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.520
and rebuilt, essentially,
for every launch.

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.750
The idea of Blue Origin
and then Space-X Stage One,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.390
flying it back to
the launch site,

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:31.320
is absolutely the fact that
if you can make it reusable,

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.490
then you can amortize
the capex in that element

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.820
over multiple flights.

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.500
And it should drop,
you know, the cost

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.780
by a factor of
five or 10 or more.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:44.380
Now, the devil's in
the details, right?

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.130
So if you start and restart
an engine multiple times,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.960
you can have a big
transient every time.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.350
So was this system,
in fact, designed

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.360
to withstand these transients?

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.420
Can it handle multiple starts?

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:00.040
What does it do
to the materials?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.530
And so forth.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.200
And so to really model
this ahead of time,

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.290
and then test it over
the cycles is the key.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:11.800
So in the shuttle, the
big problems-- the two

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.260
major subsystems in the
shuttle, in the orbiter,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.760
in particular that
made it expensive

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.740
and the difference
between the top picture

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:24.130
and the bottom picture was a,
the TPS, the thermal protection

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.120
system.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:29.290
You know, every tile has
hit a different curvature

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:33.310
in geometry, so really
inspecting every tile,

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.460
replacing tiles, making
sure that the TPS--

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.100
because just one
weakness in the TPS

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.710
could basically be
fatal on re-entry.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:45.422
And so, TPS was
very difficult and--

00:12:45.422 --> 00:12:47.380
you know, as opposed to
an ablative heat shield

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.334
that you just sacrifice
the heat shield completely.

00:12:50.334 --> 00:12:52.000
And then the other
was the main engine--

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.560
the shuttle main engine.

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.890
Originally, the idea was to
only do very deep inspections

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.440
and disassemble-- the
disassembly of the shuttle

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.170
main engine after the
first few test flights,

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:05.040
and then fly multiple times
without having to really

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.990
re-inspect or
disassemble the engine.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:10.422
So they did the
disassembly of the engines

00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.130
after the test flights
and then they just

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.210
kept doing it for every flight,
where the original intent was

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.190
to only do it for
the test flights.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.210
And so the shuttle main engines
were the second big cost driver

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:23.570
in operations.

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:28.180
So re-usability is a great
idea, but to the degree

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.220
to which re-usability
actually happens

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:34.660
in reality, that's really
about detailed design decisions

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.490
you make.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.430
OK.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:39.860
So let me move on then.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.470
When it comes to really
understanding lifecycle,

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:54.900
I do want to point you to
the 15288 standard, which

00:13:54.900 --> 00:14:01.380
is the ISO 15288 standard,
which has a fairly complete list

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.520
of system lifecycle processes.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.660
So this is, essentially
the system and software

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:09.630
engineering, system
lifecycle process standard,

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:13.770
that has a whole range of
processes that are described

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:14.970
in quite some detail.

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.670
And they're not just the
technical processes shown here

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:21.270
on the right side, we focused
a lot on those technical

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.717
processes in this class, the
stakeholders, the requirements,

00:14:24.717 --> 00:14:27.300
the architectural design-- which
is essentially the conceptual

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:27.960
design--

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.420
but there's also the
project processes, right?

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:33.540
Executing the project
agreement processes.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:36.490
So this would be
negotiating contracts,

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.780
you know supply contracts,
acquisition contracts, and then

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.340
all the organizational
things you

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.340
need to do to create the
right organization to execute

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.730
these projects.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.350
So what's nice about
the 15288 standard

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.691
is that it's a pretty
broad standard.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:53.190
OK.

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:56.520
So let me talk about the ilities
of the lifecycle properties

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:57.970
in particular.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.160
What they are and how we
can describe them and how,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.960
especially how they
relate to each other.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.250
And so the paper
that underlie this

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.310
lecture that you need
to get some more detail.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.390
And this is one of them.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.600
So this paper is called
Investigating the Relationships

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.840
and Semantic Sets Among
Lifecycle Properties.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.590
And we published this about
three years ago in Delft

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:25.180
at the CESUN Conference.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.410
So the background on
here is the following,

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:33.600
is that as you've seen,
complex engineering systems

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.900
live for decades--

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.660
some of them even
for centuries--

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.330
and the ilities--
by ilities, we mean

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.380
properties of systems that
are not the primary functional

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.209
properties.

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:45.750
In software engineering
they're often

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.880
called nonfunctional properties.

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:50.700
And the thing that's
tricky about the ilities

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.660
is that you often only can
observe them during operations.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.360
So you know, you can test
systems in the short term,

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.560
you can see does it work?

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.930
Does it fulfill its function?

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.660
But whether certain
ilities are present,

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:07.800
it often only shows
itself over time.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.450
And so most of the
research that's been done

00:16:12.450 --> 00:16:14.850
and sort of quantifying
the ilities,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.610
has been looking at these
properties one at a time.

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.340
So the questions we
wanted to go here,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:25.260
wanted to answer is, which
of these lifecycle properties

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.210
are more prevalent than others?

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:28.680
You know, the top 20.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.630
And then especially,
what's the relationship

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.010
among lifecycle properties?

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:34.650
Do they form what we
call semantic sets?

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.680
And then how could you
use this information?

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.840
And so here, we're
going to do this

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.650
using two different methods.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:45.060
The first method is what I
call prevalence analysis.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:47.910
We're going to look in the
literature and on the internet,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:51.390
how frequently these
lifecycle properties show up,

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.890
are mentioned, how much
we know about them.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.610
And then the second method
is a cognitive method.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.450
Where we ask people to
give their understanding

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:04.589
of the lifecycle properties
and put them into a hierarchy,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.240
and then we'll
compare the results.

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.500
So here are
essentially the results

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.329
from the prevalence analysis.

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:17.490
And this is ranked according to
the number of journal articles.

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.520
This is scientific
papers written,

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.480
where this particular key word,
by quality or reliability,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.470
shows up in the title or in
the abstract of the paper.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.800
And you can see this is
in units of thousands.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:31.530
OK?

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:34.590
So quality is number one.

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:35.310
Right?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.720
Quality is number one.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:40.110
The most scientific papers
are written about quality.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:43.380
And you can see, it's almost
a million journal articles.

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.480
This is-- I'll show
this to you over time,

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.170
but since 1884 is
the first year.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:52.710
And the databases that we
use for this are called it's

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.961
Compendex and Inspect.

00:17:54.961 --> 00:17:56.460
These are actually
combined-- if you

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.550
go to a website called
engineeringvillage.com,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:04.680
this is sort of a master
database for scientific papers

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.320
and engineering.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.460
That was the basis for this.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.650
Number two, reliability.

00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:12.270
Number three, safety.

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.730
Then flexibility,
robustness, and so forth.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:21.120
And the other bar, the gray bar,
is if you Google essentially

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:25.530
for this particular keyword
and-- you know, keep in mind,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.750
this was done about
five years ago--

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.150
this is the number--
the millions of hits

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:31.380
that you will get.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:34.830
And, so you know,
there's a factor

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.890
of 1,000 difference here
between journal articles

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.420
and hits on internet.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.650
But still, you can sort
of compare the two.

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:46.710
And so, in some
sense, the black bar

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:49.890
is the totality of
scientific knowledge

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.900
about this lifecycle property.

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:56.390
And then the gray bar would
be the amount of information

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.090
or uses--

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:59.130
usage of that knowledge,
at least as far

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:01.410
as it's represented
on the internet.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.030
And what's interesting
is, in some cases

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:10.260
the black bar is smaller
than the gray bar, which

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.600
means that common
usage is [? leading. ?]

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.210
So sustainability
would be an example.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.340
Everybody talks
about sustainability,

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.900
companies have--

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.660
they say, our system is
sustainable because, you know,

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.200
it uses less resources, it
produces less emissions.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.800
But the actual amount
of scientific knowledge,

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.530
the actual amount of
research as to what

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.650
really is sustainability and
how do you design for it,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.642
is actually smaller
than the usage.

00:19:37.642 --> 00:19:39.600
And then there's areas
where it's the opposite.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.260
Like for example, modularity.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:41.760
Right?

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.040
You see that in modularity.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.650
So in the relative sense,
academic interest is leading.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.280
We see there's quite a lot
of literature on modularity.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:53.040
In mathematics, you know,
modularity and software,

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.770
modularity and design,
but most people--

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:59.010
you know, modularity per
se is not so interesting

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:01.990
and so exciting to
the general public.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.890
So keep in mind that
for some ilities,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:06.510
there's an imbalance
essentially,

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:09.189
between our understanding of--

00:20:09.189 --> 00:20:10.980
the scientific knowledge,
our understanding

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.040
to be design, how to design
for it, and you know,

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.440
how frequently at least
a keyword is used.

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:21.720
Now here, this is
a little bit more--

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.700
this is a little
bit harder to see.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:27.850
This is essentially looking
at these lifecycle properties

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:29.980
over time.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:32.220
So what this graph
those you know

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:37.980
is starting here in 1884,
cumulatively the number

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:42.690
of journal articles published
about each lifecycle property.

00:20:42.690 --> 00:20:45.780
And roughly what way
you can think about this

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:49.710
is that there's some lifecycle
property, the top four--

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:53.490
five that we've been actually
working on for a long time.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:56.940
Even safety, you know, there's
some interesting articles

00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:01.680
in the 1890s about safety
for example, in mines.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:03.870
You know, coal mines.

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:05.790
There's an article
about how does

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.360
the impact of lighting--
better lighting-- on safety

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.660
and productivity in 1890.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.420
And so they show that just
providing better lighting,

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.280
actually has a dual
benefit; fewer accidents,

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.340
fewer fatalities, and
better production output.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.170
And so that's-- and this was a
scientific study that was done

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:29.040
by comparing data in different
mines and actually performing

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.890
some experiments.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:35.070
Then you have a group
of life cycle properties

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.310
that we only started really
thinking about and publishing

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:41.010
about I would say,
around World War Two.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:44.400
Such as usability,
maintainability,

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.330
and my interpretation of
this is that especially

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:53.180
during World War Two, a big
difference made logistics.

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.360
How easy was it was it
to use different weapons?

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.180
How easy was it to
maintain equipment?

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:02.730
It became a huge
determining factor

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.050
in the outcome of the war.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.780
You know, for example, in North
Africa in the North African

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:13.560
theater, you know tanks, trucks
being exposed to the sand

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.320
and so forth.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.290
So people really
started thinking

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:18.330
about the military,
started thinking heavily

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.300
about the importance
of maintainability

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:23.310
in the design of these systems.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:28.020
And after the war then, a lot
of these concepts like usability

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.600
and maintainability
started spreading

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.410
into general civilian life
and products and so forth.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:41.310
The third type of ilities
are the newer ones

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.580
that we've done research
on just since the 70s,

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.240
in the last 30 years.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.210
So here in this category
I would put things

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:52.920
like sustainability,
recyclability, evolvability,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.010
even interoperability-- which
means the ability of systems

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:59.790
to connect together and work
across system boundaries.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:02.820
Those are pretty recent
lifecycle properties

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:06.350
and we're still actively
researching them.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:11.610
So another way to show this is
by essentially making a network

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.800
of these lifecycle properties.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.690
And so the way-- this is still
all using this prevalence data.

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.390
Essentially what you see
here is a network diagram

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.030
that has these lifecycle
properties in a network

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.360
relationship.

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.370
Let me just explain, so
the size of the nodes

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.580
relates to how much
knowledge we have.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.730
Essentially the height of
the bars that we saw earlier.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:38.700
And then the strength
the thickness of the line

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.890
relates to the
strength of-- really

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:43.890
how closely are these
two ilities related.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.570
And the way this
is calculated it

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.750
is using the so-called
2-tuple correlation.

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:51.900
So you take, essentially,
articles that have--

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.050
you look at articles that
have, for example reliability

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:58.440
and maintainability
in the same article.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.070
Right?

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.960
And then you divide
that by the total number

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:05.250
of articles on reliability
and or maintainability.

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.410
And that's a ratio
between 0 and 1.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.815
And then this graph was produced
with a cutoff strength of so.

00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:12.030
1, right?

00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:15.600
So if there's more
than 10% of articles

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.670
list these two
properties together,

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:20.760
then there will be a line here.

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.160
And the stronger the line,
the thicker the line is,

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.280
the more closely, the
more often these concepts

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.890
are mentioned in
the same article

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.100
or the same piece of work.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:33.780
So that reflects the
strength of relationship.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.160
Now, what's interesting is
when you first look at this,

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.566
you don't see much.

00:24:39.566 --> 00:24:41.190
But after you look
at this for a while,

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.330
you start to realize
a few things.

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.960
First of all, in the
center of the graph

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:48.690
we have the classic
ilities of engineering.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:53.250
Quality, safety, reliability,
and I would argue flexibility

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:53.920
as well.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.410
Those are the top four
that we saw before.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.560
And then around the
periphery of the graph,

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.980
we have lifecycle properties
that are more recent.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:05.550
We haven't really thought
about them too much,

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.120
we don't fully know how
to design for them yet.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.930
And if you look
at them in groups,

00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.630
I will argue that there are
three major groups here.

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:15.990
So the first group
in the upper left

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:21.280
is things like maintainability,
durability, reliability,

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.230
quality, and so forth.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.870
So this is all about,
is the system made well,

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.780
with high quality,
particularly early in its life.

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.420
Right?

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:36.670
Then we have a group here on
the right, and this is about,

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.000
is the system easy to change.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.850
Is it easy to change the system
configuration-- flexibility,

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:49.930
extensibility, modularity and
scalability, interoperability.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.410
Those are all different
sub-flavors, if you want,

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.490
of being able to modify
the system over its life.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:01.180
And so that's a group of
ilities that that goes together.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:05.260
And then the third one is
resilience, robustness,

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.920
quality, safety.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.950
And so this is really
related to performance

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.800
of the system under different
types of uncertainty.

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.410
You know, either
environmental variability

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:21.640
or failures in the system,
and the ability of the system

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.330
to withstand, or
at least perform--

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.260
you know, have good
residual performance

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.600
even in the face of failures.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.740
So that's, I think, an
important way to think about it.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:35.080
And when you're writing
requirements for systems--

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.180
like the system
should be resilient.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.010
Then this helps
understand well, what

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:41.560
are the other properties
that are linked to it

00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.780
and that maybe support that?

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:47.860
OK, any questions
here or at MIT about--

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.500
this is sort of method
one, is get data

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:53.470
about the lifecycle property
and put them in relation

00:26:53.470 --> 00:26:54.670
to each other.

00:26:54.670 --> 00:26:56.180
Any questions?

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:04.824
Johanna, any question there?

00:27:04.824 --> 00:27:05.990
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.620
So is this chart that you
have now actually used

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:12.130
in the initial design and
like conception [? con-ops ?]

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:16.160
to like try to tease out
the interdependencies,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.760
or is it too abstract and just
more of an educational tool.

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.640
PROFESSOR: It's
really at this point--

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:25.150
you know this is fairly recent.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.740
And this was just done
in the last few years.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:31.110
So I don't think this has fully
penetrated system engineering

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.110
practice yet.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:35.970
But the point-- the point that
I want to make here is that

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:36.840
there's a huge--

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:40.230
there's a huge gap right
now between when people

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:44.310
in briefings you know,
either at the Pentagon

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.190
or at a corporate
headquarters say,

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.620
you know we want a
sustainable product

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.590
or we want-- we're
a software company,

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.680
we do optical
networking and we want

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.810
we want to have the
most resilient design

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.070
of the industry.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:01.890
You know, they'll put that
as a goal for the project.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.140
The question then is,
well OK, that's fine.

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.760
But what does that really mean?

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.500
What does it really
mean, resilient?

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.320
You have to operationalize
that definition such

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.316
that you can derive from
it lower level requirements

00:28:13.316 --> 00:28:14.940
that you can actually
go and design to,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:16.590
that you can test for.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:20.820
So what this helps you
to do is understand

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.240
what may be supporting--

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.960
what are supporting
elements that

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.120
will be related to resilience.

00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.260
You know, what are supporting
concepts, supporting

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:37.800
lifecycle properties that
this property that you're

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.970
looking for is linked to?

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:40.470
Right?

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:44.400
So it's an evolution-- you
know, we know how to design now

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.780
for speed and energy
efficiency, and you know,

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:51.070
the sort of things that
were really hard to do 20,

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.630
30, 50 years ago.

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.600
It's pretty standard
practice now.

00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.480
You know, how do you design
for optimal interoperability?

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.630
We don't quite know yet,
but we're finding our way.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:05.760
And so what I believe
is that especially

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:09.840
the lifecycle properties on the
outer periphery of this chart,

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.660
those are the ones that
need more work and those are

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.122
the ones that we're really
learning how to operationalize.

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.952
Does that make sense?

00:29:21.952 --> 00:29:22.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.630
That makes sense.

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.630
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:30.760
Let me talk about the
[? message ?] too.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:35.590
So this was basically trying
to get to-- how do people,

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.790
how do humans--

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.471
there's semantics, semantics
means the meaning of words,

00:29:39.471 --> 00:29:39.970
right?

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:44.000
Semantics is the science
of the meaning of words.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.060
How do they interpret
these lifecycle properties?

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.580
And so humans have a
deep and possibly varied

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.180
understanding of the semantics
of these lifecycle properties.

00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:59.050
So what was done here was
that a list of 15 life cycle

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:02.230
properties, many of them are
overlapping with the ones you

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:08.750
saw earlier, were presented
and then the challenge was to--

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.650
the question that
these four groups--

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:15.050
12 participants, four groups--

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:17.810
had to say, is there
a hierarchy here?

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:21.590
Are some higher level lifecycle
properties are some of them

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:23.690
lower level properties
that support these.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.410
So there was a round one, find
the parent-child relationships,

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:28.670
describe these.

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.260
Interviews, and then
the second round.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:38.390
So here's essentially what was
the results of the first round.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.120
So four different
groups, so each of them

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.530
basically came up with its
own version of a hierarchy.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.030
They didn't talk
to each other, they

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.980
were firewalled from each other.

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.700
And in all cases this
notion of value robustness

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.540
came out on top.

00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:57.470
So value robustness means the
system should deliver value,

00:30:57.470 --> 00:30:59.300
right, to the stakeholders.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.490
Despite failures you know,
environmental changes,

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:07.190
so value delivery of the system
is the top, the most important

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.860
thing.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.240
Then what's different here
is how do you achieve that?

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.750
So for example, you
see group one had

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:17.870
robustness and changeability.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.060
So robustness
typically means even

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:23.230
if you don't make any changes to
the system, it should continue,

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:24.900
you know, it should
be survivable.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:26.960
It should be versatile.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.000
Changeable means
you actually modify

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.860
the system over its life.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:33.530
And then we have lower level
properties like modularity

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.880
or reconfigurability.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.760
And you know, there were
differences between the groups

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:42.270
but not as big as
you might think.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:46.070
So in the second round, as a
result of the second round,

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:51.020
then this so-called means to
end hierarchy was constructed.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.440
So means means, you know, these
are the enabling lifecycle

00:31:54.440 --> 00:31:57.470
properties and ends means this
is the final, sort of this

00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:59.730
is really what you
want to achieve.

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.010
And so this was
the result of that.

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.190
So again, at the top
we have this notion

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.020
of value robustness.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.030
And this is achieved
by a combination

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:11.900
of survivability robustness
and changeability.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:15.020
And then these, in turn,
are achieved by lower level

00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:16.610
lifecycle properties.

00:32:16.610 --> 00:32:18.830
And then at the
lowest level we have

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:22.340
things like
interoperability, modularity,

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:25.410
reconfigurability, and so forth.

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:28.070
And the difference
between the solid lines

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:32.420
and the dashed lines here
is that if it's a solid line

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:35.490
and these are
directed arrows, that

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:40.930
means that three or four
out of four groups, right?

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.230
So the majority
of groups had this

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.110
is a particular
parent-child relationship.

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:49.120
And if it's a dashed line it
means only two out of four.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.850
And if it's only one out
of 4, it's not shown here.

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:52.350
OK?

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:57.660
So this is kind of a combined
result across the four groups.

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:01.290
So you know, what can
we take from this?

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:03.420
So first of all,
lifecycle properties

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.460
are absolutely critical.

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.760
You'll find us in
mission statements,

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.050
you know, you'll find it
in even in advertising.

00:33:11.050 --> 00:33:11.550
Right?

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:14.640
A lot of companies say we have
we have a robust solution,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.420
we have a sustainable system,
we have resilient networks.

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:21.870
So it really is a huge,
huge selling point.

00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:23.580
It's very critical.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:25.740
What I encourage you to
do as system engineers is

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.520
take a critical look at this
and say, well how resilient

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.240
is resilient?

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:34.440
You know, how many subsequent
failures of the system

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.000
can you tolerate?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.590
Sustainability;
what does that mean

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:42.130
in terms of kilowatt
hours per hour of usage?

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.860
You have to get
down to the details

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.710
to start quantifying what
these lifecycle properties mean

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:50.410
and compare them among systems.

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:54.120
Despite differences, the two
methods that we just looked

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:57.210
at-- so one is the prevalence
analysis and the other one is

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:01.410
the human semantic exercise--

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.170
despite differences, the high
level conclusions were similar.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.489
So some ilities are closely
related to each other and form

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:11.989
semantic sets, meaning
they're tied together by both

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:15.050
[? synonymie ?] or
polysemi relationships.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.736
[? Synonymie ?] means they
essentially mean the same--

00:34:17.736 --> 00:34:19.860
they're synonymous-- they
essentially mean the same

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.820
thing.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.969
polysemi means-- it
is one word, but it

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.790
means you can have
possible sub meanings.

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.480
Right?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.320
So the idea of groups
of semantic sets.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:37.800
And those groups
essentially are robustness--

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.989
so this is the
ability of the system

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:44.670
to perform its job despite
either internal or exogenous

00:34:44.670 --> 00:34:45.429
disturbances.

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:45.929
Right?

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.489
That's robustness.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:52.110
Flexible or changeable,
which means that you

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:54.330
can modify the system easily.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:56.370
You know, if you operate
the system for a while

00:34:56.370 --> 00:34:59.070
and then you realize,
Ah, I need the system

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.110
to do something else.

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.270
Or I need to adapt it, or make
it bigger, or make it smaller,

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.890
or add some function.

00:35:04.890 --> 00:35:06.930
So you would modify
the system and that's

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:09.420
flexibility or changeability.

00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.750
And then resilient
and survivable

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:16.080
is very specifically the
ability of this system

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.400
to continue performing
despite failures or attacks.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:20.910
Right?

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.220
That's what resilience
really means.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.420
And so those seem to be the big
three semantic clusters that we

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.620
see in life cycle properties.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.530
And then the third
point here is there

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:35.160
appears to be a hierarchy of
life cycle properties with two

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.510
or three levels.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.150
Where we have the lower
level properties of systems

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.290
like modularity, for example.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.350
Really your customer
probably does not

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.480
care about modularity, right?

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.200
If you advertise the
modularity of the product, some

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:52.620
of the more educated, some
of the more technically

00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.830
savvy customers, they may
understand what that means.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.210
But most of your
customers really

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.430
won't appreciate
modularity because it's

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.400
kind of a low level
form-oriented technical

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.300
property of the system.

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.110
But what they will appreciate
is the ability of the system

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:11.670
to be reconfigured or
adaptive for different pieces,

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.460
so interoperability,
modularity, et cetera

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.910
are low level
lifecycle properties

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.500
that act as enablers of a higher
level lifecycle properties.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.480
And so future work--

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.970
future work in this
area is to both just

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.570
to apply these methods
to a broader set

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:34.410
abilities, larger group of
test subjects and more data,

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:36.900
but also from a
practical standpoint

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.060
to operationalize better.

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.600
How do we write requirements?

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:44.460
How do we actually design
for the lifecycle properties

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.910
like resilience,
flexibility, changeability.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.080
How do you really design it?

00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:53.540
So go from the keyword
to real engineering

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.870
by operationalizing the
sub-attributes or factors

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.360
in the system.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.130
OK?

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.430
So that's a quick
summary of life--

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:05.910
you know, I could go on
for hours about this.

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:08.130
I'm very passionate
about this topic

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:12.450
and I will say that
people who have

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:15.090
dealt with large complex
systems you know, whether you're

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:18.600
operating the transportation
system of a city

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.110
or in airline
operations, or you're

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:26.010
running the IP infrastructure
of a major corporation.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:29.440
These words, these
words are real.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.510
These words are you know,
real dollars, real challenges.

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.560
This is really
where the action is

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.515
in a lot of these
large complex systems.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.860
OK.

00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.340
Any comments or questions
about lifecycle properties?

00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:47.770
What they are, how they
relate to each other,

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:48.710
why they're important.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:51.820
Voelker, did you want
to maybe say something?

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:52.450
OK.

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:53.570
All right.

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.480
So let me talk about--

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:57.970
try to make this a
little more real.

00:37:57.970 --> 00:38:00.730
Let me talk about a case
study, a very specific case

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:05.230
study about communications
satellite constellations.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.910
And this is the second paper
that underlies today's lecture.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:14.110
And so let me give you a
little context for this first.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:18.760
So this work here was originally
published about a decade ago,

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.650
in March 2004.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:25.500
And that was a few years after
the Iridium and Globalstar--

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.660
these the two well known
communication satellite

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.890
constellations--

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:30.820
had been launched.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:33.340
And I have to give you a
little context, when I first

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.630
came to MIT in the
mid 1990s, there

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:40.660
was a huge interest in this area
of satellite constellations.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:45.790
You know commercially,
scientifically, in fact,

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:49.360
the impression was there were so
many applications for satellite

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.927
compilations filed,
that we're going

00:38:51.927 --> 00:38:54.010
to have so many satellites
up there you won't even

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.370
see the sun anymore.

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:59.050
It was just like thousands
and thousands of satellites.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:01.750
And the Iridium and
Globalstar were really

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.330
the first two constellations
that were fully

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:07.660
developed, launched,
and both of them

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.810
failed commercially
within a very short time,

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.190
a couple of years.

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.450
And so after this happened
the whole market and interest

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:20.530
in satellite constellations
collapsed for a long time,

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:24.000
until about two years ago,
two or three years ago.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.250
Now people talk about
these constellations again.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:32.890
You know, constellations of
[INAUDIBLE],, Iridium Next.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.530
You know, there's sort
of new enthusiasm ,

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:39.730
new wave of enthusiasm
for constellations.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.640
So this paper, and this case
that I want to tell you about

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.540
is really about the first wave.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.570
And in terms of the
ilities, the one

00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:53.590
that that I'd like to
explain to you about here

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.630
is flexibility and scalability.

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:58.300
Rather than thinking about
a system as something

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.230
that you design and
build all at once,

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:04.300
how do you design a system
such that you can gradually

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.200
deploy it?

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.510
We call that staged
deployment approach.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:09.890
And what's the benefit of that?

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:14.360
So here's some pictures
you see on the right side,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:17.680
this is what the original
iridium satellites look like.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.202
They actually use
phased array antennas--

00:40:21.202 --> 00:40:23.035
and actually both use
phased array antennas.

00:40:23.035 --> 00:40:25.510
So you have individual
elements here.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.590
And by differentially
phasing the signal,

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.610
you can actually steer the beam.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.480
This was a very new
technology at time.

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:36.970
And then the
Globalstar satellite

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:40.690
shown at the lower picture.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.050
Here is a little
bit of that data.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:46.490
So both of these were
launched in the late 1990s.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:50.920
Iridium has 66
satellites, Globalstar 48.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.930
Iridium is a polar
constellation,

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:57.230
so the satellites go almost
directly over the poles.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:00.520
Globalstar is a walker
constellation, so inclined.

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.590
Doesn't quite give you
full global coverage,

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:05.170
it's about plus or
minus [? 78 ?] degrees,

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.470
so you can't use
Globalstar at the poles.

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:10.960
The altitudes are a
bit different too.

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:16.240
Iridium is at 780 kilometers,
while Globalstar is at 1,400.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:20.650
Which-- I know at least one
or two of you are working

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.060
on the Van Allen--

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.070
the Van Allen Belt Commission.

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:27.490
Right? [? The cube stats ?] to
measure the Van Allen Belts.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:30.110
Somebody mentioned that
today, who was that?

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:30.610
No?

00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:32.870
Did I hear that wrong?

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:34.870
It was mentioned, right?

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:35.800
So who was that?

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:41.460
Arnold, and he's not here.

00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:42.190
Ah, see.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:46.950
So 1,400 kilometers, are
you actually pushing,

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:50.140
you're starting to push the
lower edges of the Van Allen

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:53.360
Belt. So one of the big,
you know, in some sense,

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.440
it's easier to be higher because
you need fewer satellites

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.840
to cover the whole earth.

00:41:57.840 --> 00:41:59.740
But the higher you
go, the more exposed

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.780
you are to the
radiation environment.

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.460
You get closer to
the Van Allen Belt,

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:05.890
so that's the big
trade-off there.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:07.590
You know, the mass
of the satellites,

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:12.820
they're between 450 and 700
kilograms, transmitter power,

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:14.417
around 400 watts.

00:42:14.417 --> 00:42:16.750
You know, which is not that
much, if you think about it,

00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:17.250
right?

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:21.120
That's four very strong
light bulbs, the old style

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:21.695
light bulbs.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.710
And then what's very
different, again,

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:28.860
is the multi-access schemes.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:34.780
So Iridium used time division
multiplexing and Globalstar,

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.620
which was supported by
Qualcomm, used essentially CDMA.

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.530
So you don't chop your frequency
band into separate channels,

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:44.780
you use the whole
frequency band and then

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:47.660
you use a pseudo
random access code

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:54.280
that essentially de-convolves
the signal for each channel.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:57.040
The number of
channels, about 72,000,

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.330
about 120,000 duplex channels so
that you can actually-- duplex

00:43:01.330 --> 00:43:04.360
mean you can carry on a two
way conversation as opposed

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.100
to just be asynchronous.

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:09.180
And then you can see the
data rates, quite low,

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.090
like per channel.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:16.510
4.8 or kilobits per second,
2.4, 4.8, 9.6 for Globalstar

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:19.870
it's enough for
having a conversation.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:25.330
And total system cost, Iridium
was about $5.7 billion dollars

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:27.910
and Globalstar
about $3.3 million.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.910
Not including the cost
of the ground stations.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:35.560
Both went bankrupt relatively
quickly after they launched.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.350
However, they've been operating
really since then, right?

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:39.460
Since this time.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.890
Iridium Next is currently
under development

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:45.550
and is scheduled
to launch in 2017.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:49.030
Globalstar is publicly
traded and actually valued

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:52.210
as a company at $1.9
billion dollars.

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.280
So they're actually both--

00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.400
you could almost
argue that they were

00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:00.590
a decade ahead of their time.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.090
And

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.900
I want to tell you a little bit
about the story of, especially

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.870
Iridium.

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.280
So here's a couple of press
releases, so things that

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.170
have been written in the press.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:15.170
So look at this one,
26th of June, 1990.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.350
Motorola unveiled
a new concept for

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:19.480
global personal
communication. [? Bases ?]

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:24.550
a constellation of low earth
orbit cellular satellites.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:30.460
August 18th 1999, nine years
later, last week Iridium LLC

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.790
filed bankruptcy court
protection last investments

00:44:33.790 --> 00:44:36.610
are estimated at $5 billion.

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:39.800
So the question is
why did it happen?

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.250
The technology actually
worked quite well, it

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:46.360
was not a technological failure,
it was a business failure--

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.700
but I would argue
a system's failure.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.000
To think about the
problem differently,

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.810
so the fundamental challenge
is to properly size

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.625
the capacity of a large system.

00:44:57.625 --> 00:44:59.000
So if you're
designing, you know,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:03.325
a car factory, a
new power system

00:45:03.325 --> 00:45:06.310
and for a future
uncertain demand,

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.610
it's very difficult to do this
because demand is uncertain.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:13.330
So is it better to oversized the
system or are you conservative

00:45:13.330 --> 00:45:15.100
and you make it smaller?

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:17.560
Market assumptions
can change, right?

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.430
In a seven to eight years.

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.080
So essentially the v, right?

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.720
Like getting back to the v.
Each of those two systems,

00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:30.070
Iridium and Globalstar, it
took them essentially a decade,

00:45:30.070 --> 00:45:32.860
almost 10 years-- right?--
to go across the whole v.

00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.970
And when you make
your requirements,

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.540
your stakeholders, all the
stuff in the upper left portion

00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:42.430
of the v, there's so many years
that elapse between when you

00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:44.770
make those assumptions, you
write those requirements,

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:47.350
and when you actually go to
market a lot of things can

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:48.500
change.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.870
And that's fundamentally
the challenge here.

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:57.670
Just to illustrate this
for you, showing some data,

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:00.790
this is cellular this
is not space space,

00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:02.170
this is on the ground.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:06.070
Cellular subscribers
for mobile phones.

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:08.170
I know this is hard
for your generation

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:10.330
to sort of understand
this, but we actually

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.450
didn't have mobile phones or
there were these clunky bricks

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:14.740
in your car.

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:18.460
You know, it's really
remarkable what happened.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.880
So look at this
data, in 1991 which

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.810
is when the system was
just being developed,

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:30.310
there were less than 10 million
mobile phone users in the US.

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:32.200
It just wasn't-- it
was very expensive,

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.110
it was just not widely--

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.090
that technology hadn't been,
the networks weren't there.

00:46:37.090 --> 00:46:43.000
You know, so the green bars
where the forecasts that was

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.430
done in 1991, as to how
quickly the mobile user

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.530
market would evolve in the US.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:54.340
So their prediction was that
by 2000, a decade later,

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.530
there'd be just shy
of 40 million users.

00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:58.390
OK?

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:03.790
Now the dark blue bar
is the actual evolution.

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:10.240
So actually by 2000 you know
the US now has 310 or so million

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.580
inhabitants.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:17.020
So by 2000 there were
120 million users.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:19.450
So the forecast that was
done 10 years earlier

00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:21.660
was off by a factor of three.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:26.710
That grounds, the
terrestrial mobile networks,

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:29.920
developed three times faster
than had been predicted.

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:33.700
Now that's great for the
terrestrial people, right?

00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:38.240
AT&T and Comcast-- not
Comcast, Qualcomm, et cetera.

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.310
But the problem is, of course,
that because you know ground

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:44.870
based communications
was so much easier,

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:47.050
a lot of the market that
had been anticipated

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:50.110
for the satellite
based communications

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:56.140
was essentially eaten
away by this competitor,

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.440
by the ground based competitor.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.070
VOELKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:01.070 --> 00:48:03.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:06.480
Can you still hear it,
MIT, are you still with us?

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:07.211
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:48:07.211 --> 00:48:08.210
PROFESSOR: Yes, you are.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:08.709
OK.

00:48:08.709 --> 00:48:12.710
Voelker wants to say something.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:17.150
VOELKER: Actually, the figures
that you showed [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:21.290
and for once, Americans
did not look over the pond.

00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:24.200
Because at that time in
Europe, the GSM systems

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.570
came really strong
and very quickly.

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:29.420
In the early 90s, you could
have already had your Sim card

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:32.430
in your cell phone [INAUDIBLE]
and in fact in America

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:35.390
then, you could only buy the
telephone with all the Sim card

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.532
in-- you had to buy
the whole system.

00:48:37.532 --> 00:48:38.990
And so as the system
was controlled

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.400
by the large companies
and not by the users,

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.310
the large companies,
Motorola, thought

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.010
that they could
impose their satellite

00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:47.510
system on the markets.

00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:51.650
And in this case,
the country to the--

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:56.180
video recorders, hi fi
systems earlier, Europe

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.770
went much faster than America.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:48:59.960
And actually
European GSM market--

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:01.730
cell phones, as you know them--

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:02.840
went much quicker.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:05.080
And then Nokia, which
is actually European,

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:08.540
overtook and it took probably
the next decade for Americans

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:09.800
to catch up.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.490
So finally here this was,
a combination of people

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:15.320
had the product and they
just couldn't get in the US.

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.540
So they were limited
to their own markets,

00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:20.210
and not to sell their products
to the rest of the world

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.420
as they had done in the past.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah, good point.

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:28.700
And in fact, you know
one of the things that--

00:49:28.700 --> 00:49:31.820
I think both Globalstar
and Iridium had to do--

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.310
and this was a very
late decision, just

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:36.390
in the last couple of
years here before launch,

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:41.740
97, 98, is to make
their handsets dual use.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.080
Like that if you
were in an area where

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.540
there was a cellular
network, the phone

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.780
would switch to that because
that would be cheaper,

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:51.560
and if you didn't
have cellular network

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.720
access it would automatically
try to communicate

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.740
to the satellite.

00:49:54.740 --> 00:49:56.420
So there was a lot of--

00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.580
there were a lot of
issues that came up

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:03.520
by essentially the markets, I
think in Europe, your point,

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:06.770
well for-- about the
GSM, and in the US just

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:10.040
developing quite differently
than had been anticipated.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.310
OK so I want to give you
a little bit about sort

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.900
of economics.

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:19.700
In the end a lot of this is
driven by money, by economics.

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:24.260
And so this is
satellite economics 101.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.030
The key question here
is how expensive is it--

00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:30.710
what's the cost,
and then what is

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.560
the price that you can charge
for one minute of service,

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:34.060
right?

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:37.030
One minute, one unit of service.

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.780
And so look at
this equation here.

00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:43.800
This is CPF, stands
for cost per function.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.690
And so in the numerator we
have the lifecycle cost, which

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.490
is your initial investment.

00:50:50.490 --> 00:50:52.820
And then we will
essentially capitalize

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.160
that with some interest rate k.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:57.410
Plus then, for each
year of operation,

00:50:57.410 --> 00:51:00.590
you have the operational costs
for that year you have to add.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:01.700
So that's your initial--

00:51:01.700 --> 00:51:04.790
that's your development costs,
your manufacturing costs

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:08.540
for the satellite,
including the launch costs.

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.750
And then the ops costs would be
operating your ground stations,

00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:14.380
your networks, any
replenishment costs,

00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:16.550
they would be in your ops costs.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:18.380
And then you divide
this by what's

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.219
called here the number
of billable minutes.

00:51:21.219 --> 00:51:23.510
That doesn't mean you're
actually going to bill people,

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:27.150
it means just they are
potentially billable minutes.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.910
So that's the capacity
of the system,

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:32.930
[? see ?] the best times
you know, 365 days,

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.330
times 24 hours,
times 60 minutes,

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:37.780
times what's the load factor.

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.320
So the load factor
is essentially

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:44.090
the capacity utilization of
the system that you anticipate.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:44.930
OK.

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:48.560
So that's the basic
equation for calculating

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.210
CPF, cost per function.

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.500
Plug-in some numbers here.

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:54.590
These are the numbers
that have been assumed,

00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:57.410
you know a $3 billion
investment, 5%

00:51:57.410 --> 00:52:02.350
interest rate, $300 million per
year of ops cost, 15 year life

00:52:02.350 --> 00:52:03.120
cycle--

00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.840
this is the capital
T, over 15 years.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.860
100,000 channels--
that's your capacity.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:14.210
Number of users in this
case, so the load factor

00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:18.740
is simply the number of users
times the average activity

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:19.520
per user.

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:24.230
In this case, it seems to
be 1,200 minutes per year,

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:25.760
about 100 minutes per month.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.140
OK?

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:28.850
So that gets you--

00:52:28.850 --> 00:52:32.300
that gets you a CPF
of $0.20 per minute.

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:35.780
And based on that you
can-- the business case

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.220
was made based on
these kind of numbers.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.690
And so 3 million users, just
3 million subscribers, right?

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.790
Not 3 million users
at the same time,

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:50.330
that number would
be much smaller.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.460
That number can't be
bigger than 100,000

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:54.200
because that's your capacity.

00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.390
So for example, if you run--

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:59.450
if you run a
fitness club, right?

00:52:59.450 --> 00:53:01.490
At any given time
in your fitness club

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.625
you can have 50 or 100
people actually working out,

00:53:05.625 --> 00:53:09.520
but your number of
customers, your subscribers,

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.474
should be 1,000 or 2,000.

00:53:12.474 --> 00:53:14.140
And if they all show
up at the same time

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:15.610
you're in big trouble, right?

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:19.240
So that's the difference
between number of users

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.280
or the number of
subscribers and number

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.280
of active users
at any given time.

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.730
That's a big part of managing
these kind of systems.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:32.520
However, what actually happened
is the number of actual users

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.250
grew much slower.

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.700
So if you plug-in some
different numbers,

00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.890
let's keep all the
numbers the same,

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:43.000
except for the subscriber
base-- the number of users.

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.030
In this case we're going to
assume 50,000 users instead of

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.010
the three million.

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:51.010
This is closer to what
they had after about

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:52.240
a year of operation.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.400
Now your CPF goes
to $12 per minute,

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.490
which is noncompetitive.

00:53:57.490 --> 00:53:58.030
Right?

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:04.030
Except for some extremely, like,
military applications or making

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:07.420
some emergency phone
calls on an oil rig,

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:08.800
you know, on the ocean.

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:11.320
Most people at the time--

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.700
now and at that time--

00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.920
would never pay that for
one minute of service.

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.980
And so that was the
fundamental problem,

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:25.240
is that the user base did not
materialize as fast as planned.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:28.210
Therefore this cost per
function was way higher

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:31.510
and they did charge,
you know, $3 to $5

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:34.930
per minute of usage
of the system, which

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.920
as you try to squeeze
your existing users more,

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.190
you're not going to get the ramp
up and scale up in the system

00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.970
that you need.

00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:46.450
That was the fundamental
problem with the economics

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:49.490
of the system.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.790
So let me talk a little bit
about the design decisions

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:56.740
the conceptual design of what
this design space looks like.

00:54:56.740 --> 00:55:00.160
So fundamental-- oh, the other
thing I should mention to you,

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:04.570
what was interesting is after
the bankruptcy, both of Iridium

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:08.020
and Globalstar, both of the
chief engineers for both

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:12.460
of these systems
took refuge at MIT.

00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:14.050
Essentially, they came to like--

00:55:14.050 --> 00:55:17.400
Joel Schindall, who was the
chief engineer for Globalstar,

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.250
great guy, both very competent
people, came to MIT--

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.560
still there, still
a professor there.

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:26.490
And then Ray Leopold was
one of the three architects

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.980
for Iridium, also came
to MIT during the time.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:33.070
So I had extensive
discussions with them,

00:55:33.070 --> 00:55:35.890
and what you see
here on slide 25

00:55:35.890 --> 00:55:38.170
is one result of
those discussions.

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:40.840
Which is, the key
design decisions

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.800
that they have to make,
fundamentally, there is--

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.050
you won't be
surprised to see this,

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:49.930
this is the magic
number seven, right?

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:52.030
Seven key design decisions.

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:55.360
When you design a satellite
consultation for communication

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.970
purposes, constellation type--

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:01.330
polar or walker,
orbital altitude,

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:03.710
minimum elevation angle
above the horizon--

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:06.580
that you can communicate--

00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:09.820
satellite transmitting
power, the size

00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.100
of your primary antenna,
your multi-access scheme.

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:17.080
So this is time division or
code division multiplexing.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:19.840
And then the last one is about
the network architecture--

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.600
do you have inter-satellite
links, yes or no?

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:24.640
Inter-satellite links
means satellites

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.250
can talk to each other.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:31.210
And Iridium chose that,
Globalstar did not.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:34.870
So in Globalstar, the Globalstar
satellites cannot talk to each

00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:36.370
other directly in space.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:37.450
They can only talk--

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:41.560
it's a bent pipe system
to a ground station.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:42.060
OK?

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:45.360
So if you this is like
the morphological matrix

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:49.350
that you learned about, you
just pick design decisions

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:52.015
in this morphological
matrix and you come up

00:56:52.015 --> 00:56:52.890
with an architecture.

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:56.550
In fact, a full factorial
search of the space

00:56:56.550 --> 00:57:02.370
would reveal 1,440 different
satellite architectures.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:05.960
So that's on the input side,
what's the output vector?

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:09.720
What do you care about in
terms of output of the system?

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.600
Well first of all, performance.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.500
So the performance-- this
is for voice communications.

00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:20.310
In a sense it applies to
data communications as well.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:23.070
It is your data rate
per channel, right?

00:57:23.070 --> 00:57:27.750
4.8 Kbps, your bit
error rate, like

00:57:27.750 --> 00:57:30.990
what is the average number
of bits that are wrong?

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:32.400
10 to the minus 3.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.360
That's actually
pretty-- not a very--

00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.350
that's not a very
stringent requirement.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:40.560
And the reason is this is
for voice communication,

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.280
this is not for sending, you
know, commands to a spacecraft

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.200
going to Mars.

00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:49.170
If you send commands, it would
have to be 10 to the minus 10,

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:51.060
or 10 to the minus 9.

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.050
Much, much better
bit error rate.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:55.650
But this is OK for voice.

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:59.220
And then the link
fading margin, 16 DB.

00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:01.570
This is the strength
of the signal, which

00:58:01.570 --> 00:58:03.420
which will dictate
whether or not

00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:07.300
you can use the phone under
trees or in buildings.

00:58:07.300 --> 00:58:09.900
So you want this number to be
higher, but the higher it is,

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.490
you know given
the power you have

00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:13.860
on the satellite, the
fewer channels you have.

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:15.270
So there's trade-offs.

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:19.520
So what was done here is to
keep the performance foxed,

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.200
and so that you can
compare architectures,

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:24.900
compare apples to apples.

00:58:24.900 --> 00:58:26.790
Then we have capacity,
which is the number

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:29.490
of simultaneous duplex channels.

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.290
And then finally,
the lifecycle cost

00:58:31.290 --> 00:58:34.560
of the system, which includes
research development, test,

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:38.760
and evaluation, satellite
construction and test, launch

00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.540
and orbital insertion,
and then the operations

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.060
and replenishment.

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:45.000
So if the satellite
fails in orbit,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.820
either you have to already
have prepositioned to spare,

00:58:47.820 --> 00:58:50.310
or you're going to
launch a replacement.

00:58:50.310 --> 00:58:53.220
And this actually
happened in both cases,

00:58:53.220 --> 00:58:56.290
both constellations.

00:58:56.290 --> 00:59:00.270
So in order to then, connect
the input to the output,

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.620
you need to build a simulator
or a model of this system.

00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:07.920
And this is a high-level view
of what that model looks like.

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:11.010
So we take our input,
our design decisions,

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:14.850
and certain constants that we
assume-- a constant vector.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:19.470
And cascade this information
from the constellation module,

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:22.560
takes the altitude and the
minimum elevation angle,

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:23.940
and produces--

00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:26.250
t is the number of
satellites and p

00:59:26.250 --> 00:59:28.710
is the number of
orbital planes, so this

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:30.510
is sort of orbital dynamics.

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:35.580
The spacecraft module
calculates the satellite mass,

00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:40.500
the satellite network builds
essentially the communication

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:41.730
pathways.

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:46.200
The link budget will calculate
the capacity of the system.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.930
You know, given those
performance constraints.

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:52.530
The launch module will
determine how many launches

00:59:52.530 --> 00:59:54.330
do you need, from where.

00:59:54.330 --> 00:59:56.790
And then the cost module
basically calculates

00:59:56.790 --> 00:59:59.680
the total cost of the
system, the lifecycle cost,

00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.390
and finally you get essentially
a trade-off of lifecycle cost

01:00:03.390 --> 01:00:05.265
versus capacity of the system.

01:00:07.996 --> 01:00:09.870
Let me just show you
some, you know, you say,

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:12.940
well that's tying together
a lot of information

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.520
into a multi-disciplinary model.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:17.380
So what kind of
information do you have?

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.540
You have a mix, really
of physics based models--

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:22.800
so this is a very well known
equation, the eB/N0, that this

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.380
is the energy bit
over noise ratio.

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:28.890
This is a closed form
physics-based equation that

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.600
tells you how much
energy is there per bit--

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:35.010
what's the signal to noise
ratio on a per bit basis.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:38.580
And this is a function of
transmitter power, receiver

01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:42.000
and transmission gains,
various losses in the system.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.740
And then some of the equations--

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:45.390
some of the information
is empirical.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:48.300
For example, the relationship
between spacecraft

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:50.910
[? wet ?] mass
and payload power.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.300
You know, if wanted to have
a closed form or you wanted

01:00:54.300 --> 01:00:56.700
to have more detail, you
would have to almost build

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.380
a CAD model, right?

01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.700
A separate model.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.090
You'd have to-- for each
of the 1,440 architectures,

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:07.740
you'd have to manually construct
an individual detailed design.

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.440
And that's not feasible,
so what you do instead

01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:14.280
is you use some prior
data-- and you can see here

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.650
a scaling relationship.

01:01:16.650 --> 01:01:21.180
It's not perfect, but
we have error bars,

01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:22.660
we know how good it is.

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.080
Satellite mass,
satellite wet mass

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:28.770
is a function of transmitter
power and, in this case,

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:31.080
propellant mass.

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.890
So two kinds of equations.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:38.110
Benchmarking.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:41.020
So once you have this model,
you need to ask the question,

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.950
how can I trust this model?

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:45.850
Does it give me a
reasonable answers?

01:01:45.850 --> 01:01:48.340
And in this case,
benchmarking the process

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.620
of validating
simulation by comparing

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.230
the predictive response
against reality.

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:57.080
So just quickly here, showing
you four kinds of data.

01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.860
So one is the simultaneous
channels of the constellation,

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.340
this is the prediction
of capacity.

01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:05.140
You can see it's pretty good.

01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:08.080
In this case, the model is
actually a little conservative.

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.530
So the blue bars are the
actual planned capacities.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:14.560
The red ones or
magenta is simulated,

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.990
and you can see that the
simulation under-predicts,

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:20.450
slightly, the true
capacity of the system.

01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:24.010
Life cycle costs, you saw that
Iridium was just a bit more

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:25.570
than $5 billion.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:28.870
Globalstar was between $3
million and $4 million.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:32.080
And so here we're in
the right ballpark.

01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.630
And then in terms
of satellite mass

01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:38.350
and the number of satellites
in the constellation required,

01:02:38.350 --> 01:02:40.310
we matched that very closely.

01:02:40.310 --> 01:02:42.340
And the reason for
this is, fundamentally

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.960
this is just geometry.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.860
Right?

01:02:44.860 --> 01:02:48.040
If I can tell you the altitude
and the minimum elevation

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.280
angle, and I'm telling you I
need I need global coverage

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.500
and I want dual redundancy,
so you can always

01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.410
see at least two
satellites, it's

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.290
just geometry to be able to
figure out how many satellites

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:01.240
and how many orbital
planes you need.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:03.670
And that's why the
model, or the simulation,

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:06.280
and reality match
very, very closely.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.730
So this gives you
some confidence

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.960
that this model is reasonable.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:15.070
So what you can
do with it is now

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:17.020
what we call Trade
Space exploration.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.470
Which is, in a sense, what
you did for the [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:21.740
competition.

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:25.960
So this picture here, this
graph shows you the life cycle

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.990
costs over those
15 years, versus

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:31.060
global capacity of a system.

01:03:31.060 --> 01:03:33.880
Each of these blue
dots represents one

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.880
of those 1,440 architectures.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.080
And you can even see on
this, where Iridium actual

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.920
versus simulated falls and
where Globalstar actual

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.020
versus simulated falls.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:49.210
So both of them were actually
off the Pareto frontier,

01:03:49.210 --> 01:03:52.540
which was interesting and
led to quite some discussion.

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:55.790
And you can-- the
Pareto frontier itself

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.240
was, of course, very useful.

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.470
One of the reasons that Iridium
is not on the Pareto frontier

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:07.126
is that fundamentally, polar
constellations are inefficient.

01:04:07.126 --> 01:04:09.250
And, if you think about
it, when the satellites are

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:13.190
crossing over the poles, they're
very close to each other.

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:14.670
And they're actually
not crossing

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:17.660
exactly over the poles, or you
could actually collide, right?

01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:21.350
So you offset them slightly
to avoid collisions.

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:25.320
But some of the
satellites actually

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.170
get turned off when
they cross the poles.

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:31.740
So you're not utilizing your
assets super efficiently

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.490
in the polar constellation.

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.270
Which is one of the
reasons why they are not

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.130
on Pareto frontier.

01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:41.670
Now, the way you would use
this in a traditional system

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:44.700
engineering approach, which is
traditional system engineering

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:47.180
approach means give
me the requirement,

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.595
write down the requirements,
and then find the minimum cost

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:52.110
design for that requirement.

01:04:52.110 --> 01:04:57.750
So a requirement could be we
need a capacity of 50,000,

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.780
for example, and then you
find this intersection

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:03.690
with the Pareto
front, and that's

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.440
the minimum lifecycle
cost design that

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.580
gives you that capacity.

01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.120
Right?

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.400
And that's the system
you pick, and that's

01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.630
what you go and build.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.430
And that's essentially
what they did.

01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:17.460
The problem with this if
there is high uncertainty

01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:21.090
is, the true requirement
is kind of unknown.

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:24.150
The market will tell
us in the future what

01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:26.130
the true capacity should be.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:28.270
So how do you deal with this?

01:05:28.270 --> 01:05:30.180
Well, you could be--

01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.180
we're going to be on
the safe side, right?

01:05:35.730 --> 01:05:38.760
We're going to oversize--
so if the true demand,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.610
the true capacity
that you would need,

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:42.840
is higher than
what you just had,

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.810
your system is going to
be under capacity, right?

01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:47.430
Your system is going
to be undersized

01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:48.700
for what it should be.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:52.140
And so what happens in practice?

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.493
What do you think happens in
an under capacity situation?

01:05:59.357 --> 01:06:00.323
What would you say?

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.821
The system is too small relative
to the market that you're in.

01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:15.090
You're not capturing
as much as you can,

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:17.210
meaning a competitor
will probably capture.

01:06:17.210 --> 01:06:19.970
I mean, I guess you can
change your price policy,

01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:22.370
but fundamentally,
you're missing out

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:24.540
on market opportunity.

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:27.230
The other situation, which
is actually what happened,

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:31.220
is that the demand is much
less than we anticipated.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.830
Your system is
oversized and remember,

01:06:33.830 --> 01:06:36.440
once you launch a
satellite constellation,

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:38.420
it's not like a fleet
of taxis, right?

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:43.250
Where you just park
them in a parking lot.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:47.210
You've already-- the
fixed cost is very high.

01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:52.980
So if demand is below capacity,
you have all this investment

01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:55.530
here, lifecycle cost has
been wasted because you

01:06:55.530 --> 01:06:56.990
oversized the system.

01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:59.630
And the challenge is
that the true requirement

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:02.810
is kind of like this-- there's
this probability, density

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:03.950
function.

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:04.720
Right?

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.600
It's a probabilistic
requirement, essentially.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:11.120
And there's no set of
experiments because of all

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.100
the [INAUDIBLE] uncertainty.

01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.170
It's not a systemic uncertainty.

01:07:15.170 --> 01:07:17.090
There's no set of
experiments you

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:21.480
could do today that will help
you refine the requirements.

01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:25.670
Now they did do market studies,
but again those market studies

01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:28.990
were years ahead of when the
actual system was launched.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:31.310
So they were unreliable,
fundamentally.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:35.900
So what I'm arguing here
is in this kind of system

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:37.316
where you have
large uncertainties

01:07:37.316 --> 01:07:40.520
as to the true requirements,
you shouldn't just

01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:43.670
guess and then put billions
of dollars on a guess.

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:46.010
This is like playing
in the casino, right?

01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.970
Essentially.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:50.400
What you should do is think
about the problem differently.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.540
And in this case, the
answer is staged deployment,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.050
or one of the answers
is staged deployments.

01:07:56.050 --> 01:07:59.690
So you build a system such
that it can adapt itself

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:01.130
to the uncertain demand.

01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:04.280
So you build, initially,
a smaller, more affordable

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:04.990
system.

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:06.890
But-- and then the
system has already

01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:10.160
built into it the
flexibility or scalability

01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:11.510
to expand if needed.

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:13.730
But only if needed.

01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:16.979
And there are two major
economic advantages to that.

01:08:16.979 --> 01:08:20.060
One is that you don't need to
spend all the capital up front.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.729
As so you're deferring
capital investment.

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:27.050
And you retain the decision
freedom to reconfigure or not,

01:08:27.050 --> 01:08:30.170
and that's typically what
we call the real option.

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:34.490
You've created a real
option for the future.

01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:38.460
So the question, then, is
well how valuable is that?

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:42.830
It is worthwhile doing this
staged deployment approach?

01:08:42.830 --> 01:08:46.130
So there's probably
different ways of doing this,

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:47.660
and I just want to
share with you--

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:50.010
and this is from the
paper-- how this was done.

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:53.450
So step one is you partition
your design vector.

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:56.600
So you basically decide
which part of the system

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.790
is flexible-- because
you can't make everything

01:08:58.790 --> 01:09:01.310
flexible typically--
what part is flexible

01:09:01.310 --> 01:09:05.390
and what part is fixed, is
the base, you can't change it?

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.330
So in this case
usually the idea is

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:11.210
that the satellites
themselves, the design

01:09:11.210 --> 01:09:13.700
of the satellite, the
transmitter power,

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:18.470
that their protocol, and
the network architecture

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:20.330
should be fixed, right?

01:09:20.330 --> 01:09:23.370
Those things are
difficult to change.

01:09:23.370 --> 01:09:26.810
We're going to allow the
astrodynamics, the actual shape

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:29.090
of the constellation,
to be flexible.

01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:30.920
So keep the satellites
the same, only

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.020
change the arrangement in space.

01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:35.450
So what you do is you
partition the design vector

01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:40.180
into the flexible
and inflexible parts.

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:43.779
And when you do this,
in step two, what's

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:47.790
nice about this is you can
then actually find families

01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:49.569
of designs, right?

01:09:49.569 --> 01:09:53.569
You can find families
of designs where the--

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:55.240
we have a little lag here--

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.130
that you can find
families of design

01:09:57.130 --> 01:09:58.750
that share the constant parts.

01:09:58.750 --> 01:10:00.590
That have the common--

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.550
So what's shown in this
graph here-- this is again,

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:06.940
our design space, kind of
zoomed in a little bit more--

01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:10.600
every one of these points that
are connected with these lines

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:14.580
uses the same types of
satellite [INAUDIBLE]..

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:17.890
Same transmitter power,
same antenna diameter,

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:20.350
and all of them have
inter-satellite links.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:23.780
So effectively,
you're partitioning

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:27.580
the design say into subsets
that share common features,

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:31.180
and then we call this
a family of designs.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.710
And the idea is to start
small, so on the left side,

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:38.410
and then you grow the
system over time right?

01:10:38.410 --> 01:10:40.400
But only if needed.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:48.820
So when you do this, you 1440-
strong design space turns out

01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:52.330
to be decomposable into
40 different paths.

01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:54.940
Now, which path would
you choose here?

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:58.630
Well you want to be as close
to the Pareto front possible.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:02.670
So this is an example
of all of a path.

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:05.710
In this path, if we
started on the lower

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:08.530
we would start
with 24 satellites

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:13.090
and then we would actually
move them to a lower altitude.

01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:17.320
And add 30 more in
step two, and then you

01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.180
would gradually grow the
constellation over time.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:20.850
You see that?

01:11:20.850 --> 01:11:23.190
This is actually not
too different from how

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:24.460
GPS was done, right?

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:28.580
The GPS constellation
was deployed in phases,

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.610
but it was not market
driven, it was just

01:11:30.610 --> 01:11:34.360
sort of phasing the
development for risk reduction,

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:37.084
and spreading off the capital.

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:38.500
The other thing
that's interesting

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.650
here is that as you
grow the constellation,

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:43.752
it moves further away.

01:11:43.752 --> 01:11:46.650
It moves further
away from the front.

01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:49.360
So when it's small, this
particular [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:52.060
is close to being optimal,
and as you scale it

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.230
up it becomes more sub-optimal.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:57.550
And there's other paths that
have the opposite behavior;

01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:00.520
where when small it's
kind of suboptimal,

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.880
and as you make it bigger, it
gets closer to the optimality.

01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.150
Pretty interesting.

01:12:05.150 --> 01:12:09.130
So that's step two,
find the paths.

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:13.210
Step three, you now have to
model the actual uncertainty.

01:12:13.210 --> 01:12:15.400
And in this case there
are different ways

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.020
to model uncertainty.

01:12:17.020 --> 01:12:19.850
In this case, what we
used was a GBM model--

01:12:19.850 --> 01:12:21.900
geometric Brownian motion.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:24.670
This is well-known in
physics and applied

01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:27.530
to statistics, physics,
this has been applied

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:29.690
to the stock market, right?

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:32.890
And the idea here is
that in this case,

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.810
the man behaves like
a particle in a fluid.

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:36.310
Right?

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:40.020
That's kind of moving in
an unpredictable fashion.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:43.210
So this is the basic
equation for-- this

01:12:43.210 --> 01:12:47.200
is a discrete version of
geometric Brownian motion,

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:52.040
you have some trends
nu, nu times delta-t,

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:56.350
so this is the delta and
demand, or the change in demand,

01:12:56.350 --> 01:13:00.850
divided by demand, so this is
normalized change in demand,

01:13:00.850 --> 01:13:04.450
is nu times delta-t,
so your trend times

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:09.940
delta-t plus sigma times epsilon
times square root of delta-t.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:11.980
Epsilon is a standard,
normally distributed

01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:17.830
random variable between 0
and 1, and epsilon and sigma

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:20.800
is your volatility, essentially.

01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:22.900
So here's some
examples, if you start

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.660
with an initial
demand of 50,000,

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.280
which is what they actually
saw as an initial demand early

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:34.430
on, you have a growth
of about 8% per year.

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:36.310
This is your trend.

01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:40.030
Plus in this case,
a volatility of 40%

01:13:40.030 --> 01:13:43.390
per year, which seems high
but in this kind of very

01:13:43.390 --> 01:13:46.930
new technology, new system, is
actually not that far fetched.

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:50.440
You get three different-- these
are just three examples of how

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:51.730
demand might evolve.

01:13:51.730 --> 01:13:53.350
These are just three scenarios.

01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:57.190
So demand can go up,
it can go down, and--

01:13:57.190 --> 01:14:00.610
GBM is very nice, but one
of the downsides of GBM

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:04.660
is there's infinitely many
scenarios that you can generate

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.090
because it's fundamentally--
even though it's

01:14:07.090 --> 01:14:11.290
discretized in time, it's not
discretized and in demand.

01:14:11.290 --> 01:14:15.520
So a simpler version of this,
a more discrete version,

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:18.860
is a so-called
binomial lattice model.

01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:20.980
So the way this
works is again, you

01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:23.660
start with some initial
demand here on the left

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:28.970
and then you discretize this
such that moving through time,

01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:31.720
you can look at
different scenarios.

01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:32.220
Right?

01:14:32.220 --> 01:14:36.180
These scenarios could
be-- the best scenario

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.571
is things just keep growing.

01:14:38.571 --> 01:14:39.070
Right?

01:14:39.070 --> 01:14:40.900
Grow, grow, grow.

01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.870
Here, time, the 15 years,
have been sub-divided

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:47.390
into five three-year periods.

01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.800
So here's a sample scenario,
demand goes up, goes up,

01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.480
and then it goes
down twice, and then

01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:54.530
it goes up again in the period.

01:14:54.530 --> 01:14:57.490
And so this is a
discretized random walk.

01:14:57.490 --> 01:15:01.960
And you can choose the numbers,
so the sigma, the volatility,

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.560
the amount of the up and down
movement, and the probability,

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.230
p, of going up, and then
the probability of 1

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:10.960
minus p of going
down, are chosen such

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:14.870
that they're consistent
with the GBM model.

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:18.520
So this model is the
equivalent of the GBM model,

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.960
it's just discretized.

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.390
So the beauty of this
is that you can now

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:25.270
simplify this to 32
different scenarios

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:27.280
instead of infinitely many.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:32.390
And each of those scenarios
is not equally probable.

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.410
There is actually probability
weighted scenarios,

01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:39.700
depending on what nu and
sigma are that are underlined.

01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.430
So now we have 40 paths, right?

01:15:42.430 --> 01:15:44.800
We have 40 evolution
paths of the system

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.570
and we have 32 different
future scenarios.

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:50.290
So what we do now in
the next step, four,

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:53.470
is to put the two
together and calculate

01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:55.780
the cost of each path.

01:15:55.780 --> 01:15:58.060
Calculate the cost of
each path with respect

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:00.160
to each of the demand
scenarios, look

01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:04.840
at the weighted average of all
the possible paths, and the one

01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:05.530
thing--

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:07.180
the one tricky
thing about this is

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.510
you need to build
in a decision rule.

01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:11.320
Such that, if the system--

01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.330
if demand exceeds
capacity the system,

01:16:14.330 --> 01:16:16.660
you're going to expand and
move to the next stage,

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:19.810
you're going to stage
deploy the next phase.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.780
And there's many different ways
of doing this decision rule.

01:16:22.780 --> 01:16:25.270
So the simplest one
was chosen here,

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:27.590
and of course costs
are discounted.

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:30.790
So let me explain to
you how this works.

01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:37.070
So we start the simulation, so
the first initial deployment.

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:39.400
This is our initial stage one--

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:41.200
right-- for the constellation.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:45.700
And then we start
operating for two years,

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:47.380
and demand in this
period goes up.

01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:50.230
You see the ops cost in this
case goes slightly down,

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:51.790
this is due to the discounting.

01:16:51.790 --> 01:16:53.290
This is a discounting effect.

01:16:53.290 --> 01:16:56.200
We arrive at the end of
our first three year period

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:59.890
and then the question is here
is our capacity of the system.

01:16:59.890 --> 01:17:01.692
What would you do
in this situation?

01:17:01.692 --> 01:17:03.400
Let me ask somebody
at MIT, make sure you

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.920
guys are still with me.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:10.580
So what would you do
in this situation?

01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.796
You're now at the
end of year three.

01:17:16.732 --> 01:17:18.450
Anybody?

01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:20.200
AUDIENCE: We lost you
for a second halfway

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.680
through your statement,
could you repeat?

01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:27.330
PROFESSOR: Yes, so you've
done your initial three years,

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.940
you've deployed your
initial constellation.

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.640
And you now have the
situation shown on this chart.

01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:35.970
What's the right decision,
according to the decision rule?

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.750
What's the right decision?

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.900
AUDIENCE: OK, I'd
keep it the same.

01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:55.400
Because--

01:17:55.400 --> 01:17:56.400
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly.

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.750
AUDIENCE: --it has not
exceeded demand yet.

01:17:58.750 --> 01:18:00.090
But prepare to change--

01:18:00.090 --> 01:18:01.590
PROFESSOR: Exactly,
you wait, right?

01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:04.609
AUDIENCE: Because you have
to lower your capacity.

01:18:04.609 --> 01:18:06.900
PROFESSOR: You keep it the
same, you don't do anything.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.370
You just keep operating.

01:18:08.370 --> 01:18:09.520
Exactly, right.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.550
So you have another
three years, right?

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:17.550
During these three years,
demand keeps growing.

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:21.190
And you now, at year six,
arrive at this point here.

01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:23.040
So what's the
right decision now?

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.248
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a
question about the decision

01:18:25.248 --> 01:18:28.920
to stay the same?

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:31.920
PROFESSOR: Would
you say the same?

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.684
What's happening
to the demand line?

01:18:35.684 --> 01:18:37.600
Veronica, what's happening
to the demand line?

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.391
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a
quick question first,

01:18:39.391 --> 01:18:42.226
about the decision
to stay the same?

01:18:42.226 --> 01:18:42.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:18:42.850 --> 01:18:46.060
AUDIENCE: I feel like by waiting
until we've exceeded demand

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:47.890
to choose to expand
the constellation,

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:51.310
we're introducing a lag
between demand and capability

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.890
that creates an inefficiency
that may actually drive users

01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:54.890
away from the system.

01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:56.890
And I see this kind of
oscillatory effect, where

01:18:56.890 --> 01:18:59.530
you would expand, and
then people would meet,

01:18:59.530 --> 01:19:01.750
and then the system
would be insufficient

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:03.820
and then people would move
to a different system.

01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.940
And you kind of have a yo-yo
around the maximum carrying

01:19:06.940 --> 01:19:07.787
capacity.

01:19:07.787 --> 01:19:09.370
And that doesn't
seem efficient to me,

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:12.654
so I'm wondering if you
could speak to that.

01:19:12.654 --> 01:19:13.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.910
AUDIENCE: So what
you're essentially

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:20.170
looking for is what I would
[INAUDIBLE] decision rule.

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:21.570
So you would actually--

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:24.030
so the decision here
is to deploy, right?

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:26.760
You've got to deploy your
second stage because you've

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.980
saturated the system.

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:33.520
What you're arguing for
is before this occurs,

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:36.540
you know like at 80%
saturation, that's

01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.790
when you trigger the
next stage, right?

01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:42.810
In order to anticipate
the saturation.

01:19:42.810 --> 01:19:45.120
And so, absolutely,
you could do this.

01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.550
There are many
different decision rules

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:52.470
that you can try when you
design a flexible, deployable,

01:19:52.470 --> 01:19:53.410
scalable system.

01:19:53.410 --> 01:19:55.320
And that's part of
the decision space.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.830
So in this particular
example, we just

01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:01.460
implemented the simplest
possible decision rule,

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:05.460
which was when saturation
has occurred you do deploy

01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:08.050
the next stage, but not before.

01:20:08.050 --> 01:20:09.646
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:15.160
PROFESSOR: Is that clear?

01:20:15.160 --> 01:20:17.370
AUDIENCE: Yes, thank you.

01:20:17.370 --> 01:20:20.650
PROFESSOR: OK, so we deploy
the second stage now,

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:24.240
and you can see there's another
spike here-- right-- of capital

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.290
that's needed.

01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:27.960
It's not as high as the
first initial stage,

01:20:27.960 --> 01:20:30.210
but it is substantial.

01:20:30.210 --> 01:20:35.400
So now as we deploy
the next stage,

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.190
our capacity went
to the higher limit.

01:20:38.190 --> 01:20:40.920
So we're now at
capacity level two.

01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:42.640
We're now operating the system.

01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:45.510
Demand keeps
growing, that's good.

01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:47.800
Now we have year
nine, you can see.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:50.410
But we haven't yet
saturated our new capacity.

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:52.860
So again, the
optimal decision is--

01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:54.570
or I shouldn't say
the optimal decision,

01:20:54.570 --> 01:20:56.340
but the decision
according to the rule

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.900
is you just wait, right?

01:20:57.900 --> 01:20:59.850
You keep operating.

01:20:59.850 --> 01:21:05.020
Ah, now from year nine to year
12, demand starts to go down.

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:05.520
Right?

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.400
And this happens in
some systems, right?

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.260
They are growing and they
peak, and then things go down.

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:12.900
So in this case, we wait.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.690
And then in this scenario
it goes down again.

01:21:15.690 --> 01:21:17.200
You see how that works?

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:21.180
So what's nice about
this is you can now--

01:21:21.180 --> 01:21:26.320
in this sense, all the 32
scenarios of possible futures,

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:29.010
you can run them against
the 40 different families

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.590
of designs or evolution paths.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:34.650
And out of that you can
find the best path, right?

01:21:34.650 --> 01:21:38.040
This is the path, the
path that on average--

01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:41.580
I should point out on average--
will satisfy your demand

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:45.270
at minimum lifecycle costs,
given the uncertainty models

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:46.588
that you have composed.

01:21:46.588 --> 01:21:47.254
Yes, [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:47.254 --> 01:21:55.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:56.423
PROFESSOR: Why did it go down?

01:21:56.423 --> 01:21:59.345
AUDIENCE: Like, [INAUDIBLE]

01:21:59.345 --> 01:22:00.220
PROFESSOR: This here?

01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:03.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.880
PROFESSOR: No, the
capacity stays the same.

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.830
You don't go down in capacity.

01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:11.590
The reason is-- this
is a good question--

01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:14.910
this particular system,
a satellite constellation

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:17.130
is dominated by
fixed costs, right?

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:20.686
So if you wouldn't retire
half your satellite,

01:22:20.686 --> 01:22:23.580
because then you would lose
coverage also, potentially.

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.910
Because you've moved
them through orbits

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:27.870
that give you the
right coverage,

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:29.790
you just increased
your capacity.

01:22:29.790 --> 01:22:32.010
This is different
from a system that

01:22:32.010 --> 01:22:34.170
is dominated by variable costs.

01:22:34.170 --> 01:22:37.820
Like for example, if you
operate a fleet of taxis

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.490
and and for whatever reason,
demand goes way down,

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:43.410
you can go and park
half your taxis

01:22:43.410 --> 01:22:45.240
and just not operate them.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.670
You may still have to
pay a lease on them,

01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:51.070
but essentially you
can downward that

01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:52.920
the capacity of the system.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.750
You can't do that here,
it doesn't make sense.

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:57.480
Right?

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.700
So that's the big
difference between systems

01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.580
that are fundamentally
fixed cost dominated

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:04.370
versus variable cost.

01:23:04.370 --> 01:23:07.830
So in this case, we just
don't use it as efficiently

01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:08.910
in the last six years.

01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:16.410
The answer here is that there's
an optimal path, and that's

01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:22.210
shown here, that will, for
a given targeted capacity,

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:25.230
you can compare
essentially this blue path

01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:27.370
against the traditional
fixed design.

01:23:27.370 --> 01:23:30.915
And in this case, the
traditional architecture--

01:23:30.915 --> 01:23:35.100
fixed architecture-- would
cost about $2 billion dollars

01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:39.510
to build, both and on
average the red point is

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:44.800
the average lifecycle cost of
the evolvable system, is 1.36.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:45.300
Right?

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:49.260
Lifecycle cost of the rigid
design versus the expected

01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:53.580
lifecycle cost of
the best deployment

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:57.900
strategy or staged deployment
strategy, which is--

01:23:57.900 --> 01:23:59.780
essentially the way
that's calculated

01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:02.430
is the probability
weighted lifecycle

01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:04.890
cost of each of the
scenarios, right?

01:24:04.890 --> 01:24:06.330
Against this path.

01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:10.520
And the difference between those
two numbers is about a third,

01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:12.870
$650 million.

01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:15.450
And that is the value
of the real option.

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:20.070
That's the value of designing
the system with scalability,

01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:22.980
with flexibility.

01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:23.726
OK?

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:24.226
Yeah?

01:24:24.226 --> 01:24:37.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.010
That's true.

01:24:39.010 --> 01:24:40.540
So the lifetime--
the question was,

01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:42.670
is the life expectancy similar?

01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:46.390
Of course-- so the 15 year
life of the whole system

01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:48.130
is the same for both.

01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:51.770
Of course, in the staged
deployment strategy,

01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:54.400
some of the satellites
are going to be younger

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.840
at the end of the 15 years.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.580
And so they may have
longer residual life left,

01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.770
which is actually not included.

01:25:00.770 --> 01:25:04.609
That's not even included
in this real option value.

01:25:04.609 --> 01:25:21.242
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:25:21.242 --> 01:25:21.950
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:28.189
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:25:28.189 --> 01:25:29.480
PROFESSOR: That-- that's right.

01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:33.800
So you could sort of refine
this model to include a more--

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:36.260
a staged decommissions, right?

01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.630
Or staged transition to
a next generation system.

01:25:39.630 --> 01:25:43.040
So in this case, in this
model, after 15 years--

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.940
boom-- you know everything,
you just finish.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:48.410
No more revenues, you
just decommission.

01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:51.560
A hard end, a hard
stop after 15 years.

01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:55.010
But you could actually build
transition and decommissioning

01:25:55.010 --> 01:25:56.210
models as well.

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:58.070
Good point.

01:25:58.070 --> 01:26:00.890
So that's essentially
the case study

01:26:00.890 --> 01:26:02.810
that I wanted to show you.

01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:08.000
And, you know, you say
that's kind of like in the US

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.414
we talk about Monday morning
quarterbacking, you know?

01:26:11.414 --> 01:26:13.580
You come in and all the
football games that happened

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.830
and the mistakes that
the coaches made,

01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:18.230
and I would have done this
or I would have done that.

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:20.810
So yes, you know, this
is sort of like looking

01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:23.420
at this problem in
hindsight, but the reality

01:26:23.420 --> 01:26:29.960
is that this really has had a
big impact and a big dampening

01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:32.570
effect and that the new
generation of systems--

01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.670
I think-- are built
much more intelligently

01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:37.340
with this kind of
evolution in mind.

01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:42.230
I will also mention to you that
Iridium is actually the system

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.210
that went bankrupt first.

01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:46.700
And the reason for
the bankruptcy-- well,

01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:49.130
one of the immediate
reasons for the bankruptcy--

01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:52.340
is because of the way that
the project was financed.

01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.820
So about one third of the
funds-- the $5 billion--

01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:58.340
one third of the
funds for Iridium

01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:02.990
came from equity from Motorola.

01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:05.150
So that was their own
money that they lost.

01:27:05.150 --> 01:27:09.640
About one third was an IPO,
initial public offering,

01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.830
you know, shares
sold to the public.

01:27:11.830 --> 01:27:15.170
And about one third
was bank loans.

01:27:15.170 --> 01:27:18.050
And these bank loans
were relatively expensive

01:27:18.050 --> 01:27:20.270
and the banks
expect that they get

01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:24.230
paid back at a certain speed,
depending on the market

01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:25.270
evolution.

01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:27.800
And it's essentially
the inability

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:30.695
to pay for and service
their loans, that

01:27:30.695 --> 01:27:32.810
caused the Iridium bankruptcy.

01:27:32.810 --> 01:27:35.810
And it turns out that the
loans were about one third

01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:38.640
of the total capitalization
of the project.

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:40.670
So what I would argue--

01:27:40.670 --> 01:27:45.340
I would argue that if they
had done this more flexible,

01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:48.110
staged approach, they
could have saved one

01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:50.540
third, which is about
the value of this option

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:53.840
and capitalization, and
just build the system only

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:57.260
with equity and with
the money from the IPO.

01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:59.465
And that would have given
them a lot more time,

01:27:59.465 --> 01:28:01.740
you know they wouldn't have
had to service those loans

01:28:01.740 --> 01:28:03.890
and it would have given
them a lot more time

01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:05.670
to wait for the
market to develop,

01:28:05.670 --> 01:28:07.340
which it eventually did.

01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:10.070
So the whole
financial architecture

01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:11.770
was poorly done as well.

01:28:11.770 --> 01:28:13.570
It's a whole other--

01:28:13.570 --> 01:28:15.430
that's a whole other question.

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:16.930
AUDIENCE: Professor,
quick question?

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:17.596
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:28:17.596 --> 01:28:36.280
AUDIENCE: Are there
situations where [INAUDIBLE]

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:37.170
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:28:37.170 --> 01:28:39.003
So the question, I'm
just going to repeat it

01:28:39.003 --> 01:28:40.720
for you guys at MIT,
the question was

01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.540
are there cases where the
flexible approach is not

01:28:43.540 --> 01:28:44.500
the best?

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:45.620
And the answer is yes.

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.260
So for example, if you're in--

01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.950
I know that you're studying
the energy market--

01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:54.250
if you're in a situation
where you have guarantees,

01:28:54.250 --> 01:28:57.520
a guaranteed customer,
so the government

01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.040
or one of the big
utilities is entering

01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:02.290
into a long-term
agreement with you,

01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:04.150
that they will buy
the power that you

01:29:04.150 --> 01:29:09.430
produce at a certain price
for the next 20 years.

01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:12.390
And so you're not subject
to that market volatility,

01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:16.570
but you have a long term
agreement, including clauses

01:29:16.570 --> 01:29:19.900
that say well if the
government doesn't do this then

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.630
they'll compensate
you for any losses,

01:29:22.630 --> 01:29:24.560
this is a financial contraction.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:28.720
If you basically have eliminated
demand uncertainty, because

01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.042
of the particular
contractual arrangements,

01:29:31.042 --> 01:29:33.250
then there's no reason you
shouldn't build the system

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:35.560
for a fixed capacity.

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:41.440
And then you can build something
right on the pareto front,

01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:43.150
because that
particular uncertainty

01:29:43.150 --> 01:29:47.500
has been eliminated for
policy or contractual reasons.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:49.880
So, good question.

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:52.730
OK, so we're almost there.

01:29:52.730 --> 01:29:54.770
Let me just try to
summarize some--

01:29:54.770 --> 01:29:57.940
AUDIENCE: Can I ask you
question on that last slide?

01:29:57.940 --> 01:29:59.950
PROFESSOR: Please, go ahead.

01:29:59.950 --> 01:30:02.290
AUDIENCE: On the
slide before, 37.

01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:07.120
It seemed like the
probability weighting

01:30:07.120 --> 01:30:10.570
was for a general capacity.

01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:14.380
Like something that could be
adapted over the life cycle

01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:18.220
but here we're pinning
down a specific capacity.

01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:20.170
So why is it the sum
of probabilities, then?

01:30:20.170 --> 01:30:21.836
Haven't, kind of, the
probabilities been

01:30:21.836 --> 01:30:25.500
realized, don't you know
exactly what your capacity is

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:28.170
that you're operating at?

01:30:28.170 --> 01:30:30.910
PROFESSOR: Yes, so just
to be clear on this.

01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:34.430
So the probability,
those p's of i's,

01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:37.410
they come from
the lattice model.

01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:39.650
They are determined
by the lattice model.

01:30:39.650 --> 01:30:43.960
So what you do is for those
32 scenarios of the future,

01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:45.400
this is the pi, right?

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.270
The i is the index, is the--

01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:51.490
for this particular
future scenario,

01:30:51.490 --> 01:30:55.570
for each future
scenario, you always

01:30:55.570 --> 01:30:58.720
start with a1, which is
your initial configuration

01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:00.160
of the constellation.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.700
You always start with a1.

01:31:02.700 --> 01:31:05.290
And for each of those
future scenarios,

01:31:05.290 --> 01:31:11.770
you then simulate that
future and for those futures,

01:31:11.770 --> 01:31:14.630
where the demand doesn't
ever really take off

01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:16.300
and materializes,
you never actually

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:18.500
trigger that next
expansion stage.

01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:21.640
And it's actually that asymmetry
that gives you the advantage.

01:31:21.640 --> 01:31:25.180
And it's essentially
not deploying capacity

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:26.660
when you really don't need it.

01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:30.100
And so you do this
for all of this n

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:34.630
scenarios for the future,
and the pi, the probability,

01:31:34.630 --> 01:31:36.400
weighting of each
future scenario

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:38.830
comes directly out
of the lattice model.

01:31:38.830 --> 01:31:41.755
That's not something that you
have to manually determine.

01:31:41.755 --> 01:31:43.380
AUDIENCE: Right, no,
I understand that.

01:31:43.380 --> 01:31:46.720
But here, since we've kind of
pinned down a capacity already,

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:48.670
we know what endpoint we're at.

01:31:48.670 --> 01:31:51.490
I'm just wondering how the
probabilities come into that,

01:31:51.490 --> 01:31:54.100
or is it kind of working
backwards now, of all the paths

01:31:54.100 --> 01:31:56.920
that go there on
this specific plot?

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:58.420
PROFESSOR: I see
what you're saying.

01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.020
OK.

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:03.490
So the last point, the
a1 point, so the a1 point

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:06.490
is driven by-- you need
to make some assumptions

01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:12.130
about initial capacity and
then the endpoint, the a4,

01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:17.010
is driven by how large
you made the trade space.

01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:19.080
So you could make
the trade space,

01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:21.540
you could make the design
space even larger, right?

01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:26.130
This is a discretized full
factorial design space,

01:32:26.130 --> 01:32:28.020
you could make it even larger.

01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.060
And then a4 would
not be the end form.

01:32:30.060 --> 01:32:32.330
This is just sort of
a finite size effect,

01:32:32.330 --> 01:32:34.994
given to the size
of the trade space.

01:32:34.994 --> 01:32:36.160
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:47.210
PROFESSOR: All right, so the way
I want to do the summary here

01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:49.280
is just go back to the
learning objectives.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:51.590
You know, I always do this
in every class, you know,

01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:53.150
let's close the loop.

01:32:53.150 --> 01:32:56.570
What did I promise
you in lecture one

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:58.250
that you would
learn in this class?

01:32:58.250 --> 01:33:01.150
And, you know,
each of you, you're

01:33:01.150 --> 01:33:03.370
going to have to decide
for yourself, you know,

01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:05.510
did I actually learn this?

01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:06.510
Did we actually do this?

01:33:06.510 --> 01:33:10.270
So this is sort of due diligence
on the learning objectives.

01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:11.940
And I have one slide
on each of them.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:14.010
So the first objective was to--

01:33:14.010 --> 01:33:15.860
for you to really
understand the system

01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:18.210
engineering standards
and best practices,

01:33:18.210 --> 01:33:20.870
as well as more approaches.

01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:24.350
Number two is understand the key
steps in the system engineering

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:25.640
process.

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:28.460
Number three was
analyze and understand

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:32.060
the role of humans in the
system as beneficiaries,

01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:34.790
designers, operators,
and so forth.

01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:38.150
Number four was being
honest and characterizing

01:33:38.150 --> 01:33:41.480
the limitations of system
engineering as we practice it

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:42.620
today.

01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:46.310
And then objectified
learning and objectifiable

01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:49.550
was applying these methods
and tools to a real--

01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:54.830
even if not so complex-- cyber
electromechanical system.

01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:59.720
So I see one,
essentially, hopefully--

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:02.000
no, we didn't check
the readings but I'm

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.310
hoping that you did your
readings, that you really

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:08.240
feel like you understand
the NASA System Engineering

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:11.930
Handbook, which is our
quasi-textbook for this class.

01:34:11.930 --> 01:34:14.580
But there's other
standards as well,

01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.270
such as the
[INAUDIBLE] handbook,

01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:19.970
which is actually the
basis for certification.

01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:21.210
So several of you--

01:34:21.210 --> 01:34:23.000
your [? EPS ?] fellow
mentioned to me

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.160
that you're interested
in certification,

01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:27.230
so I encourage that.

01:34:27.230 --> 01:34:30.710
Most of that is based
on the number two.

01:34:30.710 --> 01:34:33.980
I did mention the
ISO standard 15288.

01:34:33.980 --> 01:34:37.680
That's probably the best known
standard; ISO is a very--

01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.750
they're located
right here in Geneva.

01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:42.980
ISO is a very important
organization, you know?

01:34:42.980 --> 01:34:46.790
I know ISO standards are not the
most exciting things to read,

01:34:46.790 --> 01:34:51.190
but they have huge
impact and so 15288

01:34:51.190 --> 01:34:57.440
is something that
worldwide-known and across all

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.850
industries really.

01:34:58.850 --> 01:35:02.340
And then I want to mention
also the European Systems

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.650
Engineering Standard.

01:35:03.650 --> 01:35:05.420
And Foster Voelker
and I had a discussion

01:35:05.420 --> 01:35:07.200
about this earlier today.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.000
This is issued by the
European Space Agency.

01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.390
And it is a little-- there
are some subtle differences

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:17.570
between ISO approach
and the NASA approach.

01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:21.140
And so for those of you on
this side of the Atlantic,

01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:23.640
I do encourage you to take
a look at that [? ESES ?]

01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.410
standard as well.

01:35:25.410 --> 01:35:29.420
And then we augmented this with
different papers, and readings,

01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:30.900
and so forth.

01:35:30.900 --> 01:35:33.950
So I want to do a very quick--

01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:37.260
this is our last concert
question for the class.

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:47.530
So here's the link,
[INAUDIBLE] and it's

01:35:47.530 --> 01:35:50.560
essentially I want to
get some feedback what

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.880
you think about the standard.

01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:55.540
All outdated and surpassed
by the digital revolution,

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.790
one of you thinks that's true.

01:35:58.790 --> 01:36:05.250
90% of you think they're useful
codification and best practice.

01:36:05.250 --> 01:36:08.260
14% think they can
be dangerous if you

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:11.920
adhere to them too closely.

01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.650
About 60% of you think
they're essential reading

01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:16.700
for any serious system engineer.

01:36:16.700 --> 01:36:20.710
And 10% said that you
would never use them

01:36:20.710 --> 01:36:22.150
as a daily reference book.

01:36:22.150 --> 01:36:24.010
VOELKER: OK, so that's good.

01:36:24.010 --> 01:36:26.050
I think that's-- what
do you think, Voelker,

01:36:26.050 --> 01:36:28.040
pretty reasonable outcomes?

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.500
OK.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:32.290
But what is true is
that they're going

01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:34.120
to be referenced, in contracts.

01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:37.540
You know if-- if you're doing--

01:36:37.540 --> 01:36:41.560
you know, it depends, again,
on the industry that you're in.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:43.120
But you're going
to adhere to some

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:45.940
of these things in contracts,
and if things don't go well,

01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:48.760
people will actually check
whether, did you do this step,

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.330
did you do that step.

01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:52.626
So it does have
real consequences.

01:36:52.626 --> 01:36:53.500
PROFESSOR: OK, great.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.500
Thank you very much.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:57.170
That was that was good.

01:36:57.170 --> 01:37:00.790
Step two, you know the
key steps, v model,

01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:03.280
I think I'm not going
to explain it again.

01:37:03.280 --> 01:37:05.260
You know, hopefully
this is something

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.610
that you will not forget.

01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:09.070
And just one point
about the v model

01:37:09.070 --> 01:37:13.380
is it does not imply that
system engineering is always

01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.260
sequential.

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:17.980
You know, it's possible
to iterate between steps

01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:21.490
and across the whole v as well.

01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:24.830
SE3, stakeholders
and value of network.

01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:27.760
So this is the role of humans.

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.820
We talked about this very
early on, several of you

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.880
talked about it during
the oral exam here today.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.270
You know, the hub and spoke
versus the stakeholder value

01:37:37.270 --> 01:37:38.290
network.

01:37:38.290 --> 01:37:41.650
The method underlying
this is critical, but I do

01:37:41.650 --> 01:37:43.970
want to mention, very quickly--

01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:46.570
and this is something we
didn't spend a lot of time on--

01:37:46.570 --> 01:37:47.690
is human factors.

01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:48.200
Right?

01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:51.400
How do you design systems so
that humans can effectively

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.750
and safely use them?

01:37:52.750 --> 01:37:56.890
You know, interfaces,
procedures, and so this

01:37:56.890 --> 01:37:59.460
is a couple of slides from
one of my colleagues, Missy

01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.430
Cummings.

01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:01.900
This is actually some--

01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:03.030
in a nuclear plant--

01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:04.900
Katya, you're going
to like this--

01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:07.450
lots of these dials,
and this is actually

01:38:07.450 --> 01:38:08.720
a Russian nuclear plant.

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.280
So it has it has a
very specific layout.

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.710
And so the important
questions in human factors

01:38:14.710 --> 01:38:17.290
are, how do you best
display status information?

01:38:17.290 --> 01:38:19.880
What tasks do humans do?

01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:21.280
What level of automation?

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.230
What are the training
requirements?

01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:26.110
And these are also very
important questions.

01:38:26.110 --> 01:38:29.650
And so you can apply the
human systems engineering

01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:32.860
process, very much
analogous to what

01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:34.630
we covered in class so far.

01:38:34.630 --> 01:38:39.010
So you do mission and scenario
analysis, function allocation.

01:38:39.010 --> 01:38:42.970
And then in human factors, you
talk more about task analysis.

01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:46.720
But essentially, eventually,
leads to system design.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:49.090
Like what are the
buttons that you

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:52.390
push, what does the layout
look like, or the user

01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:53.780
interface, and so forth.

01:38:53.780 --> 01:38:56.770
So, you know, I'm not I'm
not presenting human factors

01:38:56.770 --> 01:38:59.980
as a separate topic, but the
human factors requirements

01:38:59.980 --> 01:39:03.460
should be built in
right from the start.

01:39:03.460 --> 01:39:06.730
And essentially the
functional allocation

01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:08.770
is sort of a key question here.

01:39:08.770 --> 01:39:11.950
How much is done by automation,
how much is done by humans,

01:39:11.950 --> 01:39:13.910
and how do you split
between the two?

01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:16.240
And one of the most important
things to consider here

01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:18.600
is this human performance curve.

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.440
And we know this
pretty well now,

01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:23.440
that when humans are
extremely highly loaded--

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:26.920
you know, when you
have a huge workload--

01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.870
your performance goes down.

01:39:28.870 --> 01:39:32.110
But interestingly, if
you're under challenge

01:39:32.110 --> 01:39:34.240
your performance
goes down as well.

01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:36.190
And you know, so
for example, people

01:39:36.190 --> 01:39:40.180
who are in power stations
or mission control

01:39:40.180 --> 01:39:44.110
centers where nothing is
happening for days and weeks,

01:39:44.110 --> 01:39:46.240
you know their
attention goes down,

01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:48.130
and they don't perform
at a very high level.

01:39:48.130 --> 01:39:50.850
Humans perform best at
a moderate workload,

01:39:50.850 --> 01:39:52.450
and this is well-known.

01:39:52.450 --> 01:39:54.460
And it should influence
how you define

01:39:54.460 --> 01:39:57.520
the human interface and
the split among automation

01:39:57.520 --> 01:39:58.670
and humans.

01:39:58.670 --> 01:40:01.660
SE4, system complexity.

01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.730
Last time I will
mention the magic number

01:40:03.730 --> 01:40:06.100
seven, plus or minus two.

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:09.940
The real limitations come in
and when we operate at levels,

01:40:09.940 --> 01:40:12.340
you know, three,
four, five, and six.

01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:15.520
And the main reason for this
is because now a single human

01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:17.890
cannot understand,
cannot remember,

01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:20.530
cannot deal with all
the detailed components.

01:40:20.530 --> 01:40:22.840
And you need to split
the work among teams,

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:26.350
among organizations, and
creates extra interfaces

01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:28.280
and complexities.

01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:29.500
OK?

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:33.580
And just to show you, Iridium,
we talked about Iridium.

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:37.120
This is a very recent news
story this is from October 29th.

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:40.240
The new Iridium Next has
again been pushed back

01:40:40.240 --> 01:40:41.710
by four months.

01:40:41.710 --> 01:40:47.770
This gentleman here is the CEO
of Iridium, chief executive

01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:50.950
for Iridium Next, Mr. Desh.

01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:55.300
And he's talking here about
a particular [INAUDIBLE]

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.870
and then Viasat is one
of the contractors.

01:40:58.870 --> 01:41:02.470
There's a particular component
that's been giving trouble,

01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:05.860
and that's sort of in level
three or four in the hierarchy,

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.200
and that's essentially
delaying the whole system.

01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.560
So there's an example of how the
large complexity of the system

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.522
is causing issues.

01:41:16.522 --> 01:41:21.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:41:21.680 --> 01:41:23.990
PROFESSOR: But they're
actually a supplier

01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:29.020
to [INAUDIBLE] through
the whole chain, right?

01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:32.540
Oh you're saying there's more
going on than meets the eye.

01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:34.580
Yeah, who knows?

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.010
Who knows?

01:41:36.010 --> 01:41:39.920
OK, and then finally here I
want to mention application

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.150
to a case study.

01:41:41.150 --> 01:41:44.390
You know, we used the
CanSat 2016 competition

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:47.780
as a quote, unquote
safe case study.

01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:50.960
And I have to say I'm
really pleased with how

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:52.130
this worked out.

01:41:52.130 --> 01:41:55.490
You had the 47
requirements as a starter,

01:41:55.490 --> 01:41:58.130
you approved, them
you group them,

01:41:58.130 --> 01:42:01.520
and my comments about the
PDR that we had a week ago

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:05.570
are all teams passed
successfully, the PDR.

01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:07.310
You know, if this
was a real PDR,

01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:09.630
we would have issued a couple
of [? ridds, ?] I think.

01:42:09.630 --> 01:42:12.560
There was some-- a couple
of teams were over budget,

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:16.370
or needed to work out their
aerodynamics in more detail.

01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:19.370
But by and large I thought this
was an excellent application

01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:21.170
of system engineering concepts.

01:42:21.170 --> 01:42:23.745
Went beyond my expectations.

01:42:23.745 --> 01:42:25.370
Several of you
mentioned the importance

01:42:25.370 --> 01:42:27.680
of concept generation,
you know hybrid use

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.370
of structured and unstructured
creativity techniques.

01:42:31.370 --> 01:42:34.010
I know at least one team
applied to actually go

01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:35.520
to the competition.

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.410
And this shows you
a couple examples.

01:42:37.410 --> 01:42:39.290
So we have one team
here at the EPSL

01:42:39.290 --> 01:42:41.420
using a bio-inspired design.

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:46.070
This is an actual seed airfoil
that actually occurs in nature.

01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:51.230
And then here's an example from
MIT, the Rogallo Wing Team 7.

01:42:51.230 --> 01:42:54.680
So, I'm sorry I didn't
mention all the teams here,

01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.940
but it was really great to
see the application of this

01:42:58.940 --> 01:43:02.600
in the CanSat competition case.

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:05.510
So the last thing I want to
do-- and I only have one minute

01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:08.180
left, actually I'm already
slightly over time--

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:11.090
but I just want to give
you some career and study

01:43:11.090 --> 01:43:12.020
recommendations.

01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:15.760
So first of all, you know, I
want to make sure that you--

01:43:15.760 --> 01:43:18.440
and I said this in
the first lecture--

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.100
there's a lot more to the
system engineering and systems

01:43:22.100 --> 01:43:24.650
research than we were able
to cover in this class.

01:43:24.650 --> 01:43:27.830
So this class is really what I
call a door opener to the world

01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:28.850
of system engineering.

01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:32.630
If you want to go deeper,
there are deeper subjects.

01:43:32.630 --> 01:43:36.790
You know, model based system
engineering is the big trend.

01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:38.132
System safety.

01:43:38.132 --> 01:43:39.590
And then in the
spring I'm teaching

01:43:39.590 --> 01:43:42.350
a class called
Multi-Disciplinary System

01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:43.630
Optimization.

01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:47.340
And there is actually a
WebEx access to it as well.

01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:49.240
So it's not going to
be officially offered

01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:52.070
as a [INAUDIBLE] class, but if
individual students here are

01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:54.050
interested, please contact me.

01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:56.445
Self-study, you know the
System Engineering Journal,

01:43:56.445 --> 01:43:59.390
there's IEEE journals,
there's also--

01:43:59.390 --> 01:44:02.300
you know, for some of you this
is maybe a little too soon--

01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:06.530
but there's professional
degrees in system engineering.

01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:09.680
For example at MIT we have
the SDN program, System Design

01:44:09.680 --> 01:44:10.460
and Management.

01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:15.530
The average age of the
students in that program is 33,

01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:17.120
but it is--

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:20.660
they're sort of coming back
to get their masters in system

01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:22.970
design and management.

01:44:22.970 --> 01:44:25.470
And there's quite a bit
of SLOAN content as well.

01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:27.860
So finance, you know,
understanding the financial--

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.800
how to build a business
case around systems as well.

01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:32.030
Professional experience.

01:44:32.030 --> 01:44:34.370
You know, getting experience
in actual projects.

01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:36.740
Like at MIT, for example Rexus.

01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:38.870
You know, you've got the
Clean Space One project,

01:44:38.870 --> 01:44:41.810
we heard about [? Optaneous ?]
One, Solar Impulse,

01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:43.430
there are a lot
of opportunities.

01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:46.490
Or-- we also had
a couple of people

01:44:46.490 --> 01:44:49.210
here mention that you're
starting your own company,

01:44:49.210 --> 01:44:50.060
your own venture.

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:52.220
And you know, when
you're doing, that you

01:44:52.220 --> 01:44:53.750
have to be the system engineer.

01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:56.570
You have to understand all
of these things, interfaces,

01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:59.510
suppliers, requirements,
markets, all

01:44:59.510 --> 01:45:01.400
that has to be integrated.

01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:03.940
Finally, you did
hear about INCOSE.

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:07.280
We had a quick dial-in
with at an earlier session.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:09.440
So if you're interested,
you can join either

01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:11.570
as a student or a
professional member.

01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:13.460
And also certification.

01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:22.460
This class was not
[INAUDIBLE] for that,

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.460
but if you're interested
in this site, [INAUDIBLE]

01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:28.440
number of years of experience
at the [? CCF ?] level.

01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:30.980
And then finally,
please keep in touch.

01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.110
And last but not
least, I want to thank

01:45:33.110 --> 01:45:40.330
all of you, the students at MIT,
at EPFL, our TAs, [INAUDIBLE]

01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:44.570
here at EPFL, Johana at
MIT, the technical staff

01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:50.780
has been helping run the
technology, Voelker, thank you.

01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:52.860
And-- and that's it.

01:45:52.860 --> 01:45:54.560
So I want to thank all of you.

01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.840
Next week we do have
a voluntary seminar

01:45:56.840 --> 01:45:59.750
on sort of future
trends in manufacturing,

01:45:59.750 --> 01:46:01.890
but again, it's not mandatory.

01:46:01.890 --> 01:46:04.670
It's going to be in the
same place, but like I said,

01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:06.870
it's not part of
the official class.

01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:11.330
So with that, sorry for running
a little bit over time but

01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:14.150
it's been a joy to
teach this class

01:46:14.150 --> 01:46:16.510
in this kind of new format.

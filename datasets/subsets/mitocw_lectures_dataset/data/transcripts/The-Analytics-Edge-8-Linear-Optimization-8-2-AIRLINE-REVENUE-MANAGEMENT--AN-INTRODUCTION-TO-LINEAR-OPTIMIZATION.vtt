00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.060
In this lecture, we'll
introduce linear optimization

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.720
and apply it to airline
revenue management.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.230
Air transportation became a
reality in the United States

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.650
in the 20th century.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.250
From 1938 to 1978, the
Civil Aeronautics Board

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.420
set fares, routes, and
schedules for all interstate air

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.570
transport.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.680
Most airlines were very
positive on this system,

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.520
as it guaranteed their profits.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.470
However, this system led to
higher costs for a traveling

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.210
public as well as to
various inefficiencies.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.600
For example, applications
for new routes and fares

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
were often delayed or dismissed.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.060
In response to these
inefficiencies,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.650
the administration
of President Carter

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.310
passed the Airline
Deregulation Act in 1978.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.070
The act encouraged
more competition.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.140
As a result, 52
new airlines were

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.489
formed between 1980 and 2000.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.200
Also, new air routes appeared.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.270
Correspondingly,
it saved passengers

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.810
an estimated $10.3 billion
each year in travel time.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.110
Lower fares was another outcome.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.690
Ticket prices are now 40%
lower than they were in 1978.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.960
This led to more passengers.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.190
The number of air passengers
increased from over 200 million

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:43.490
in 1974 to over 720
million in 2010.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.820
More competition
led to lower fares,

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.700
as we discussed, while
meeting operating costs.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.210
This further led to heavy
losses by air carriers.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.690
Nine major carriers and more
than a hundred smaller airlines

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.700
went bankrupt between
1978 and 2002.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.170
So it is natural to ask
how did airlines compete?

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.000
In their attempt
to sell more seats,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.320
airlines started to
offer deep discounts.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.240
For example, on
January 17, 1985,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.820
American Airlines launched
its Ultimate Super Saver fares

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.450
to compete with PeopleExpress.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.540
The key strategy involved
selling enough seats

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.600
to cover fixed operating
costs while selling remaining

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.200
seats at higher rates
to maximize revenues.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.010
This led to the science
of revenue management

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.790
that we'll study
in this lecture.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.810
The key question in
revenue management

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.190
is how many seats
to sell on discount.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.320
The key consideration
is that passengers

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.950
have different valuations.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.700
For example, business
people value flexibility,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.300
whereas people seeking a
vacation value good deals.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.900
So if we sell too
many discounted seats,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.440
then there would
not be enough seats

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.200
for high-paying passengers.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.470
At the same time, if we sell
too few discounted seats,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.170
then we will have empty seats,
which lead to lost revenue.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.530
So the key question is
how airlines like American

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.460
can allocate their seats
among customers in order

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.030
to maximize their revenue.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:22.800
PROFESSOR: OK, guys.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.428
Welcome back.

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:25.470
As you can see, we're not
using the screen today.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.845
This is going to be one of
those fill-the-board lectures.

00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:30.373
But I am going to work you
through every single step.

00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:32.040
We're going to go
through the Q equation

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.673
and derive its most
general form together,

00:00:34.673 --> 00:00:36.090
which, for the
rest of this class,

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.950
we'll be using
simplified or reduced

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.440
forms to explain
a lot of the ion

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.050
or electron-nuclear
interactions as well

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.902
as things like
neutron scattering

00:00:44.902 --> 00:00:46.110
and all sorts of other stuff.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.280
We'll do one example.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.610
For any of you that have
looked at neutrons slowing down

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.410
before, how much
energy can a neutron

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.072
lose when it hits something?

00:00:54.072 --> 00:00:56.280
We'll be answering that
question today in a generally

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.270
mathematical form.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.320
And then a few
lectures later, we'll

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320
be going over some of the
more intuitive aspects

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.130
to help explain
it for everybody.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.060
So I'm going to show you the
same situation that we've

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.480
been describing sort
of intuitively so far,

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.910
but we're going to hit
it mathematically today.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.410
Let's say there's
a small nucleus,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:20.250
1, that's firing at a large
nucleus, 2, and afterwards,

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.870
a different small nucleus, 3,
and a different large nucleus,

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.940
4, come flying out.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.340
And so we're going to keep
this as general as possible.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.410
So let's say if we draw angles
from their original paths,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.840
particle 3 went
off at angle theta

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.570
and particle 4 went
off at angle phi.

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.780
So hopefully those are
differentiable enough.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.640
And if we were to write the
overall Q equation showing

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.560
the balance between
mass and energy here,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.280
we would simply have
the mass 1 c squared

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.043
plus kinetic energy of 1.

00:01:58.043 --> 00:01:59.460
So in this case,
we're just saying

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.230
that the mass and
the kinetic energy

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.810
of all particles on the
left side and the right side

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.790
has to be conserved.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:12.750
So let's add mass 2 c squared
plus T2 has to equal mass 3 c

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:21.570
squared plus T3 plus mass
4 c squared plus T4, where,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.800
just for symbols,
M refers to a mass,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.630
T refers to a kinetic energy.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.790
And so this conservation of
total mass or total energy

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.860
has got to be conserved.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.820
And we'll use it again.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.220
Because, again, we can describe
the Q, or the energy consumed

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.180
or released by the reaction,
as either the change in masses

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.972
or the change in energies.

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:50.555
So in this case, we
can write that Q--

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.870
let's just group all of
the c squareds together

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.910
for easier writing.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:07.560
If we take the initial masses
minus the final masses,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.870
then we get a picture of
how much mass was converted

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.910
to energy, therefore,
how much energy

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.190
is available for
the reaction, or Q,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.000
to turn it into kinetic energy.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.150
So in this case, we can
put the kinetic energy

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.480
of the final products minus
the kinetic energies--

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.770
I'm going to keep with 1--

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.770
of the initial products.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.480
And so we'll use this
a little later on.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.340
One simplification
that we'll make now

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.670
is we'll assume that if we're
firing particles at anything,

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.070
that anything
starts off at rest.

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.880
So we can start by
saying there's no T2.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.940
That's just a simplification
that we'll make right now.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.880
And so then the
question is, what

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.480
quantities of this situation
are we likely to know,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.070
which ones are we
not likely to know,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.470
and which ones are left
to relate together?

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.630
So let's just go
through one by one.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.930
Would we typically know the mass
of the initial particle coming

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.012
in?

00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:05.220
We probably know what we're
shooting at stuff, right?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.140
So we'd know M1.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.960
What about T1, the
initial kinetic energy?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:11.460
Sure.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.100
Let's say we have a reactor
whose energy we know,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.990
or an accelerator, or
something that we're

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.540
controlling the energy,
like in problem set one.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.339
We'd probably know that.

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:24.130
We'd probably know what
things we're firing at.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.510
And we would probably
know what the masses

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.880
of the final products are,
because you guys have been

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.780
doing nuclear reaction
analysis and calculating

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.990
binding energies and everything
for the last couple of weeks.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.030
But we might not know
the kinetic energies

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.940
of what's coming out.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.270
Let's say we didn't actually
even know the masses yet.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.040
We'd have to figure out a way to
get both the kinetic energies.

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.210
And what about
these angles here?

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.730
This is the new variable
that we're introducing,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.310
is the kinetic energy
of particles 3 and 4

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.160
is going to depend on what
angles they fire off at.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.010
Let me give you a limiting case.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.110
Let's say theta was 0.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.550
What would that
mean, physically?

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.770
What would be happening
to particles 1, 2, 3,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.220
and 4 if theta and phi were
0, if they kept on moving

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.293
in the exact same path?

00:05:19.293 --> 00:05:19.793
Yeah?

00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:22.150
AUDIENCE: Is it a fusion
event, or [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.192
PROFESSOR: We don't know.

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:23.950
Well, let's see.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.450
Yeah.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:27.490
If it was a fusion event-- let's
say there was one here and one

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.668
standing still--

00:05:28.668 --> 00:05:30.460
then the whole center
of mass of the system

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.627
would have to move that way.

00:05:31.627 --> 00:05:33.820
So one example could
be a fusion event.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.800
A second example could
be absolutely nothing.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.220
It's perfectly valid to say if,
let's say, particle 1 scatters

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.130
off particle 2 at an
angle of 0 degrees,

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:54.200
that's what's known as
forward scattering, which

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.120
is to say that theta equals 0.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.190
So this is another quantity
that we might not know.

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.910
We might not know what
theta and phi are.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.160
And the problem here is we've
got, like, three or four

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.980
unknowns and only one
equation to relate them.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.990
So what other-- yeah?

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.515
Question?

00:06:11.515 --> 00:06:12.890
AUDIENCE: For
forward scattering,

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:16.280
when you say theta equals 0, do
you mean they just sort of move

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.260
together forward, kind of
like an inelastic collision,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.260
and they just keep moving
in the same direction?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.218
PROFESSOR: An inelastic
collision would be one.

00:06:23.218 --> 00:06:26.240
And since we haven't gone
through what inelastic means,

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.300
that would mean some
sort of collision where--

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.020
let's see.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.776
How would I explain this?

00:06:31.776 --> 00:06:34.040
I'd say an inelastic
collision would be like

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.300
if particles 1 and 2 were to
fuse, like a capture event,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.570
for example, or a capture and
then a re-emission, let's say,

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.390
of a neutron.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.890
Yeah.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.660
If it was re-emitted in
the forward direction,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.743
then that could be an
inelastic scattering event--

00:06:46.743 --> 00:06:47.490
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.365
PROFESSOR: --but still
in the same direction.

00:06:49.365 --> 00:06:51.740
Or an elastic scatter
at an angle of theta

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.010
equals 0 could be like there
wasn't any scattering at all.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.650
Because really in
the end, can matter--

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.100
let's say if you have a
neutron firing at a nucleus,

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.930
depends on what angle
it bounces off of,

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.240
in the billiard ball sense.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.210
If it bounces off at an angle
of 0, that means it missed.

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.490
We would consider
that theta equals 0.

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.110
But the point here
is that we now

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:14.120
have more quantities
unknown than we

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.460
have equations to define them.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.200
So how else can
we start relating

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.280
some of these quantities?

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.500
What else can we
conserve, since we've

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.420
already got mass and energy?

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.410
What's that third quantity
I always yell out?

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:27.210
AUDIENCE: Momentum.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:28.140
PROFESSOR: Momentum.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.750
Right.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.980
So let's start writing some
of the momentum conservation

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.730
equations so we can try
and nail these things down.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:37.860
So I'm going to write
each step one at a time.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:39.510
We'll start by
conserving momentum.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.680
That's what we'll do right here.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.650
And we can write the x and
the y equations separately.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.590
So what's the momentum
of particle 1?

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.590
How do we express that?

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.840
AUDIENCE: Mass times velocity.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.480
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.290
So it would be like M1 V1.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:02.490
So we'll have a little box
right here for momentum.

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.920
We could say mass
times velocity--

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.290
or, how do we express that
in terms of the variables

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.540
that we have here,
like we did last week?

00:08:15.083 --> 00:08:16.750
What about in terms
of kinetic energies?

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.620
Well, another way of
writing mass times velocity

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.610
would be root 2MT.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:32.669
Because in this case, we
would have root 2 times

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:39.000
M1 times 1/2 M1 V1 squared.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.100
The 2s here cancel.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.175
Let's see.

00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:43.500
You have M1 squared.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.120
You have a V squared.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:51.370
And the square root of M
squared V squared is just MV.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:54.330
So this is an equivalent
way of writing the momentum

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.543
in the variables that
we're working in already.

00:08:56.543 --> 00:08:58.710
And so since that doesn't
introduce another variable

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.540
like velocity--
which we do know,

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.790
but it's kind of confusing
to add more symbols-- let's

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:04.560
keep as few as possible.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.900
So what's the x
momentum of particle 1?

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:13.510
Just what I've got up there.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.360
2 M1 T1.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:20.680
What's the x momentum in
this frame of particle 2?

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.440
0.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.340
We're assuming
that it's at rest.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.140
And now, what's the x
momentum of particle 3?

00:09:31.044 --> 00:09:33.447
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:35.030
PROFESSOR: I heard
a couple of things.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.080
Can you say them louder?

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.635
AUDIENCE: Square
root of 2 M3 T3?

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:39.260
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.340
Root 2 M3 T3.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.560
But in this case,
if we're defining,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.100
let's say, our
x-axis here, it also

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.820
matters what this angle is.

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:56.780
So you've got to multiply by
cosine theta in this case.

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.200
And that's the x
momentum of particle 3.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.050
And we've also got to
account for particle 4.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:10.410
So we'll say add 2 cosine phi.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.170
Now let's do the same
thing for the y momentum.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.990
What's the y momentum
of particles 1 and 2?

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:20.000
0.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.220
They're not moving in
the y direction to start.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.480
And how about particle 3?

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.760
I hear whispers, but
nothing vocalized.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:33.495
AUDIENCE: Sine?

00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:34.120
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:42.190
Same thing, but root
2 M3 T3 sine theta.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:45.310
And M4-- I almost
wrote the wrong sign

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:47.470
there-- has got to be a minus.

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:50.380
If the momentum of the initial
particle system in the y

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:54.550
direction is 0, so
must the final momentum

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.440
in the y direction.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.300
So these two momenta have
to be equal and opposite.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.600
And that's times sine phi.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:09.690
So now we actually have sets
of equations that relate

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.970
all of our unknown quantities.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.400
We have the mass
conservation equation,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.150
we have the Q equation,
we have the x momentum,

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.780
and we have the y momentum.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.970
And from this point on,
it's a matter of algebra

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.490
to express some of
these quantities

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.240
in terms of some of the others.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:29.780
So let's get started with that.

00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:32.150
Because angles
are kind of messy,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:36.320
and theta should
uniquely define phi,

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.360
let's try and get things
in terms of just one angle.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.900
So I'm going to
start by separating

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:45.740
the thetas and the phis on
either side of the equals sign,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.470
so that hopefully later
on we can eliminate one

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.240
in a system of equations.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.090
So all I'm going to do is
I'm going to subtract or add

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.060
the theta terms to the
other side of the equation.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.585
So let's say we'll
separate angles.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:14.850
So we'll have root 2 M1 T1
and minus root 2 M3 T3 cosine

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:15.930
theta.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:18.335
I'll be depending on you
guys to check for sign errors

00:12:18.335 --> 00:12:19.710
here because those
will be messy.

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:21.450
I do have notes in
case, but I'm hoping

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.190
I won't have to look at them.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.780
And all we have
left on this side

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:33.390
is root 2 M4 T4 cosine phi.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.280
So that's the x
momentum equation.

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.970
Let's do the same thing with
the y momentum equation.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.360
So all we'll do is
take the theta term

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.820
and stick it to the
left of the equals sign.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:54.960
So that would give us minus
root 2 M3 T3 sine theta equals

00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:02.540
minus root 2 M4 T4 sine phi.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:06.020
Right away, we can see that
the minus signs can cancel out,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.120
just for simplicity.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.810
And what else is common to
these that we can get rid of?

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:13.310
Yep?

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.435
AUDIENCE: Square root of 2.

00:13:14.435 --> 00:13:17.410
PROFESSOR: Everything here
has a square root of 2.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.140
So we'll just get rid of
all of the square root of 2s

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.920
to simplify as much as possible.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.060
And now we look a little stuck.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.930
But now is the time to remember
those trigonometric identities

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.680
back from high school
that I don't think--

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.310
has anyone used these since?

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:37.820
In 1801 or 1802, anyone
used a trig identity?

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.620
A little bit?

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:39.590
OK.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.390
I would hope so.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.798
But I don't know what other
people are teaching nowadays.

00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:46.340
At least this way I'll make sure
you remember the high school

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:47.390
stuff.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.020
We're going to rely on
the fact that we already

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.070
have got a cosine and a sine.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.260
We have a set of
simultaneous equations.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:57.440
If we can add them together
and destroy the angles somehow,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640
that will make
things a lot easier.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.420
So for the thetas, we
have a cosine, a sine,

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.930
and an unangled term
that looks kind of messy.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.500
Here we have a
cosine and a sine.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.030
Anyone have any
idea where we could

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.875
go next to destroy
one of these angles?

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:19.110
Anyone remember any handy
cosine or sine trig identities?

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.610
AUDIENCE: If you
squared both terms,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:23.010
you could get square root of
cosine squared, square root

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:23.510
of-- sorry.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:24.800
You get cosine squared
and sine squared

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.050
and then you factor out
the square root of M4T4

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:29.618
and then cosine squared
plus sine squared equals 1.

00:14:29.618 --> 00:14:30.410
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.270
So we can rely on
the fact that if we

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:36.860
can square both sides of both
equations and add them up,

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:40.310
we would have a
cosine squared of phi

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:46.930
plus a sine squared of
phi, which also equals 1.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:51.180
So we can destroy this phi angle
and make things a lot simpler.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:54.150
So we'll start by
squaring both sides.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:03.020
Let's start with the
x momentum equation.

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:05.170
So if we have--

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.520
let's see-- root M1T1.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.000
So we're going to take
that stuff squared.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.490
And that squared
is not too hard.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:19.350
Neither are those.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.360
So we'll have root M1 T1
squared, which just gives us

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:31.690
M1 T1, minus root M1 T1 times
root M3 T3 cosine theta.

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:38.470
Let's just lump those terms
together as root M1 M3 T1 T3

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:41.170
cosine theta.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.670
Also, anyone, raise
your hand or let

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.180
me know if I'm going too fast.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.060
I'm trying to hit
every single step.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.550
But in case I skip one,
please slow me down.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:50.940
That's what class is for.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.080
OK.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.740
And then we've got another one.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.480
Let's just stick a
2 in front of there

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.470
and plus that term squared.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:06.120
So we'll have M3 T3.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.670
Let's see.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.590
Yeah.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.960
Looks like cosine
squared of theta.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.010
Yep.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.990
Equals-- this one's easier--

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:29.740
M4 T4 cosine squared of phi.

00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.110
OK.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.200
Now we'll do the same thing
for the y momentum equation.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.405
Much easier because there's
no addition anywhere.

00:16:36.405 --> 00:16:43.796
And we have M3 sine
squared theta--

00:16:43.796 --> 00:16:51.880
over here-- equals M4
T4 sine squared phi.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.060
So this is quite nice.

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.040
Now if we add these
equations together,

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.820
we get rid of all of the
cosine and sine squared terms.

00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.310
So let's add them up.

00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:05.510
Let's see.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.950
We'll add the two equations.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:15.762
Add equations.

00:17:15.762 --> 00:17:17.720
And let's try and group
all the terms together.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:29.215
So we have M1 T1
minus 2 root M1 M3--

00:17:29.215 --> 00:17:32.270
it's getting hard to write
over the lip of the chalkboard

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.770
here--

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.200
cosine theta.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.910
And we have M3 T3 cosine
squared theta plus M3 T3

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.860
sine squared theta.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:06.340
Equals M4 T4 cosine squared
theta plus sine squared theta--

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:06.960
or phi.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.460
I'm sorry.

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:12.810
Cosine squared phi
plus sine squared phi.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:13.310
OK.

00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:16.250
Hopefully that's as low
as I'll have to write.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:18.350
And like we saw
before, cosine squared

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.150
plus sine squared equals 1.

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:24.150
So that goes away.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.820
That goes away.

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:28.440
And let's keep going over
on this side of the board.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.290
I told you this would
be a fill-the-board day.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:32.790
Let's see if we
actually get all six

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:34.170
instead of just
the four visible.

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:38.190
But I think we'll finish this
derivation in four boards.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.130
So let's write what
we've got left.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.030
Let's see.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:41.720
Remaining.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:53.730
So we have M1 T1
minus 2 root M1 M3--

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.680
so much easier to
write standing up--

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:05.070
cosine theta equals M4 T4.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.210
Quite a bit simpler.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.192
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:07.192 --> 00:19:08.400
PROFESSOR: Did I miss a term?

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.092
AUDIENCE: The M3 T3.

00:19:09.092 --> 00:19:09.720
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.150
Thank you.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:10.500
You're right.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.042
You're right.

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.650
And we had a plus M3 T3.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:18.900
Yeah, that would be important.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.090
Thank you.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.570
Equals M4 T4.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:26.900
So we now have a relation
between the masses,

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.410
the energies, and one angle,
which is getting a lot better.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:35.210
We still have one more
variable than we can deal with.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:36.830
So let's say if we're--

00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:38.568
let's see.

00:19:38.568 --> 00:19:40.110
Which of these
variables do you think

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.027
we can eliminate using any
of the equations you see,

00:19:43.027 --> 00:19:44.860
let's go with, on that
top board over there?

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.610
Well, what other
quantities are we

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:59.195
likely to know about
this nuclear reaction?

00:19:59.195 --> 00:20:00.320
Let's bring this back down.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.618
Are we likely to
know the Q value?

00:20:05.618 --> 00:20:06.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.138
PROFESSOR: Probably.

00:20:08.138 --> 00:20:09.680
Because like you
guys have been doing

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.380
on problem sets one and
two, if you know, let's say,

00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:15.500
the binding energies, or the
masses, or the excess masses,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.320
or the kinetic energies
of all your products,

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.540
any combination of
those can get you

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.150
the Q value of that reaction.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:25.840
And if you just look up those
reactions like, let's say,

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.660
radioactive decay reactions,
on the table of nuclides,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.370
it just gives you the Q value.

00:20:30.370 --> 00:20:34.240
So chances are we can express
some of these kinetic energies

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.230
in terms of Q.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.680
And all we've got left
is T1, T3, and T4.

00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:42.530
So which of these are
we most likely to be

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.720
able to know or measure?

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.530
T1, we probably fixed it
by cranking up our particle

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.280
accelerator to a certain energy.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.590
T3 or T4, what do
you guys think?

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.450
Let's say we had a
very small nucleus

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.520
firing at a very big one.

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.020
Which one do you
think would be more

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.850
likely to escape
this system and get

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:06.934
detected by us standing a couple
feet away with a detector?

00:21:06.934 --> 00:21:07.900
Yep?

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:08.890
AUDIENCE: T3.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:11.320
PROFESSOR: Probably T3,
the smaller particle.

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.570
We've just arbitrarily
chosen that.

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:15.250
But for intuitive
sake, let's say, yeah.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:21.100
Why don't we try and get
T4 in terms of Q T1 and T3?

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.300
That's not too hard,
since it's addition.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.040
So our next step
will be substitute.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.450
And we'll say that Q equals--

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:38.070
I'm just going to copy
it up from there--

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:43.052
T3 plus T4 minus T1.

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:54.280
So we can isolate T4 and say
T4 equals Q plus T1 minus T3.

00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:59.190
And continue substituting.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.800
I usually don't like to have
my back to the class this much.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.860
But when you're writing this
much, it can be a little hard.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:16.310
So let's stick this T4 in right
here and rewrite the equation

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.270
as we've got it.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:31.350
M1 T1 minus 2 root M1 M3 T1 T3
cosine theta plus M3 T3 equals

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:37.050
M4 times Q plus T1 minus T3.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:41.080
I anticipate us needing to see
this side of the board soon.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:43.020
I also apologize for
the amount of time

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:44.410
it takes to write these things.

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:46.110
There's another
strategy one can use

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.960
at the board which is
defining intermediate symbols.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.970
And here's why I'm
not doing that.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.245
When I was a freshman, back in--

00:22:53.245 --> 00:22:55.650
whoa-- 2001.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.150
Who here was born after 2001?

00:22:58.150 --> 00:22:58.650
Nobody.

00:22:58.650 --> 00:22:59.150
OK.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.450
Thank god.

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.750
I don't feel so old.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:06.000
I was in 18023, which was
math with applications,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.940
which was better known as
math with extra theory.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:11.920
And in one class, not only
did we fill nine boards,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.250
but we ran out of
English letters--

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.040
symbols-- and we ran out
of Greek letter symbols,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:19.020
and we moved on to Hebrew.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.420
Because they were distinct
enough from English and Greek.

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:24.200
And being, I think, the only
Hebrew speaker in the class,

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.242
I was the only one that
could follow the symbols,

00:23:26.242 --> 00:23:27.990
but I couldn't follow
the math anymore.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:30.780
So I am not going to define
intermediate symbols for this

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.970
and just keep it
understandable, even

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.050
if it takes longer to write.

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:37.140
OK.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.110
So let's start off
by dividing by M4.

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:47.200
Our goal now is to
try to isolate Q.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.900
Because this is something
that we would know or measure.

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.690
And it will relate all of the
other quantities, only one

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.150
of which we won't
really know yet.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:57.490
So let's divide
everything by M4.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:07.900
So we have T1 times M1 over
M4 minus 2 over M4 times root

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:20.250
of all that stuff plus
T3 times M3 over M4

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:24.970
equals Q plus T1 minus T3.

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.870
And we've almost isolated
Q. I'll call this step just

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.990
add and subtract.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.740
And I'm going to group
the terms together.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.650
So let's, for example,
group all the T1s together

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.610
and group all the T3s together.

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:46.240
So if I subtract T1, I get
T1 times M1 over M4 minus 1,

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:57.550
minus 2 over M4 root M1 M3
T1 T3 cosine theta, plus--

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:09.140
and if I add T3, then I would
get M3 over M4 plus 1 equals Q.

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.710
So this is a good place to stop,
turn around, and see you guys,

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:15.230
and now ask you, which of
the remaining quantities

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:16.880
do we probably not know?

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.628
So let's just go
through them one by one,

00:25:21.628 --> 00:25:22.670
just to remind ourselves.

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:25.960
Are we likely to
know what T1 is?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.380
Probably.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:31.075
How about the masses M1 and M4?

00:25:31.075 --> 00:25:32.700
If we know what
particles are reacting,

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.660
we can just look those up,
or measure them, or whatever.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:36.600
We know M4.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.650
We know our masses.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.240
We know T1.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:39.850
What about T3?

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:45.510
We don't necessarily know yet.

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:47.550
So T3 is a question mark.

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.710
How about cosine theta or theta?

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.170
We haven't said yet.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:56.760
And T3 we don't know.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.930
And the masses we know.

00:25:57.930 --> 00:25:59.940
And the Q we know.

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:02.410
So finally, to solve for--

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:06.280
well, we only have two
variables left, T3 and theta.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.830
So this here-- this is actually
called the Q equation in its

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.060
most complete form--

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.780
describes the relationship
between the kinetic energy

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.650
of the outgoing particle and
the angle at which it comes off.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:24.710
How do we solve this?

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.377
How do we get one in
terms of the other?

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.820
Anyone recognize what kind
of equation we have here?

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.320
It's a little obscure.

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.290
Well, it's not obscure.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:40.538
But it's a little bit hiding.

00:26:40.538 --> 00:26:42.080
But it should be a
very familiar one.

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.890
Think back to high school again.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:44.390
Yes.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:50.990
AUDIENCE: Is it the cosine angle
for the triangle [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:53.580
PROFESSOR: Let's see.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.160
Certainly, there's probably
some trig involved in here,

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.050
in terms of, yeah, if
you know the cosine,

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.240
then you know, let's
say, the x or the y

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.710
component of the momentum.

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:04.630
But there's something
simpler, something that

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:05.838
doesn't require trigonometry.

00:27:05.838 --> 00:27:06.338
Yep.

00:27:06.338 --> 00:27:07.450
AUDIENCE: Is it quadratic?

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:08.158
PROFESSOR: It is.

00:27:08.158 --> 00:27:10.090
It's a quadratic--
so who saw that?

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:15.110
It's actually a quadratic
equation, where the variable

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:18.960
is the square root of T3.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.040
That's the trick here, is you
have something without T3,

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.267
you have something
with square root T3,

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:26.850
and you have something
with T3, better

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:31.000
known as root T3 squared.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.830
And there.

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:34.760
So this is actually
a quadratic equation.

00:27:41.098 --> 00:27:42.640
Despite the fact
that it may not have

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.210
looked that way in the
first place, there we go.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.210
So now, someone who
remembers from high school,

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:54.890
tell me, what are the roots
of a quadratic equation?

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:59.170
Let's say if we have the form
y equals ax squared plus bx

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:03.842
plus c, what does x equal?

00:28:03.842 --> 00:28:04.550
Just call it out.

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:05.960
AUDIENCE: Negative b--

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.962
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:06.962 --> 00:28:09.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
square root--

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:10.040
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.292
AUDIENCE: --b
squared minus 4ac--

00:28:13.292 --> 00:28:14.000
PROFESSOR: Over--

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:14.840
AUDIENCE: 2a.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.040
PROFESSOR: 2a.

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.170
And in this case,
a is that stuff.

00:28:21.170 --> 00:28:24.500
b is that stuff without the T3.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.600
And c is that stuff.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.833
Because we have,
like, 15 minutes

00:28:28.833 --> 00:28:30.500
before I want to open
it up to questions

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.380
and I don't think we have to
repeat the quadratic formula

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.020
stuff, I will skip ahead.

00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.160
Skip ahead.

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.760
This is when I'd normally say
it's an exercise to the reader.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.443
But no.

00:28:43.443 --> 00:28:44.860
It's not the phrase
I like to use.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:45.670
It's boring.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.420
And I can just tell you
guys what it ends up as.

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:53.890
It ends up with root T3 equals--
and this is the one time I am

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:56.470
going to define new symbols
because it's just easier

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.000
to parse--

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.130
ends up being, we'll call
it s, plus or minus root

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:08.500
s squared plus t, where s--

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.720
let's see if I can remember
this without looking it up.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.220
No.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.270
I have to look at my notes.

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:17.380
I don't want to get it wrong
and have you all write it down

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.300
incorrectly because of me.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:21.730
There we go.

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:26.660
The remaining stuff
in the square root, E1

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:31.520
cosine theta over M3 plus M4.

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:36.850
And t equals M4 Q--

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:38.030
is it a minus?

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.645
It is a plus.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:49.290
Over M3 plus M4.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:51.660
So these are the roots
of this equation.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.970
This is how you
can actually relate

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:55.800
the kinetic energy of
the outgoing particle

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.520
directly to the angle.

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.620
So I want to let that
sink in just for a minute,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.330
stop here, and check
to see if there's

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.580
any questions on the
derivation before we

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:08.340
start to use it to do something
a little more concrete.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.041
Yep.

00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:10.885
AUDIENCE: Where did
the E come from?

00:30:10.885 --> 00:30:12.240
PROFESSOR: The E. Oh, I'm sorry.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.760
That's a T. Thank you.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.810
Kinetic energy.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:17.790
Again, we should be
consistent with symbols.

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:19.740
And I think--

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:21.670
I don't see any
other hanging Es.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:22.170
Good.

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:24.043
Thank you.

00:30:24.043 --> 00:30:26.460
So any other questions on the
derivation as we've done it?

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.430
We managed to do it in
less than four boards.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.190
There we go.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.690
OK.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:33.820
Since I don't see
any questions, let's

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.820
get into a couple of the
implications of this.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:44.410
So let's now look at what
defines an exothermic reaction

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:47.620
where we say if Q
is greater than 0--

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:52.510
which is to say that some of the
mass becomes kinetic energy--

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:56.770
if an exothermic reaction is
energetically possible, then

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:59.600
what is the minimum T1?

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.400
Ah.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.540
That's why I brought it.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.510
What's the minimum T1 up here
to make that exothermic reaction

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:05.010
happen?

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.430
We'll put a condition on T1.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:17.260
So if the reaction's
exothermic, which

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.790
means it will happen
spontaneously,

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:22.063
how much extra kinetic energy do
you have to give to the system

00:31:22.063 --> 00:31:23.230
to make the reaction happen?

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:32.030
Let's think of it in
the chemical sense.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:35.150
If you have an exothermic
chemical reaction,

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:38.220
is it spontaneous or is it not?

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.480
It is spontaneous.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.340
Same thing in the nuclear world.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:44.310
If you have an exothermic
nuclear reaction,

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.530
do you need any kinetic
energy to start with

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.340
to make it happen?

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:48.840
No.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.080
OK.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.630
There we go.

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:51.240
So that's kind of the analogy.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.870
So T1 has to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.660
It's pretty much not
a condition, right?

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.650
It happens all the time.

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:03.420
So if we were to say
T1 were to equal 0--

00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:07.410
let me get my crossing
out color again.

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:10.950
If T1 were to equal 0,
then s could equals 0.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:17.000
And T1 is 0 here.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.635
And then you just get--

00:32:18.635 --> 00:32:27.530
that's an s-- t equals
M4 Q over M3 plus M4.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.660
And this just kind of
gives you a relation

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.800
between the relative kinetic
energies of the two particles.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.900
Another way of
writing this relation

00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:43.120
would just be that
E3 plus E4 has to be

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.530
greater than or equal to E1.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.030
AUDIENCE: T?

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.113
PROFESSOR: All this-- hmm?

00:32:48.113 --> 00:32:48.854
AUDIENCE: T?

00:32:48.854 --> 00:32:49.710
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:50.210
Thank you.

00:32:52.958 --> 00:32:55.830
Because Es will be used in a
different point of this class.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.060
So we'll stick with
T for kinetic energy.

00:32:58.060 --> 00:32:59.560
Thank you.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.140
So all that this
condition says is

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.362
that if mass has been
converted to energy,

00:33:05.362 --> 00:33:06.820
then that kinetic
energy at the end

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:09.940
has to be greater
than at the beginning.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:10.917
And that's all it is.

00:33:10.917 --> 00:33:12.750
So it makes this equation
quite a lot easier

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:15.810
to solve for an
exothermic reaction.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.240
You can also start to look
to say, well, what happens

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.510
as we vary this angle theta?

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.980
What does the kinetic energy do?

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.362
Let's take the case of
an endothermic reaction.

00:33:29.362 --> 00:33:30.695
Now we are running out of space.

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:42.120
For an endothermic reaction
where Q is less than 0,

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:45.160
you would have to have
T1 to be greater than 0.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:51.470
Otherwise the
reaction can't occur.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:54.500
So you have to impart additional
energy into the system

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.910
to get it going.

00:33:55.910 --> 00:34:01.218
And it also means that not every
angle of emission is possible.

00:34:01.218 --> 00:34:03.260
You might wonder, why do
we care about the angle,

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.010
because the reaction
still happens anyway?

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:07.130
Well, it doesn't
happen at every angle.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.320
And reactions have
different probabilities

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:12.920
of occurring depending on the
angle at which the things come

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.320
out.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.980
So you could see here
that as you vary T1

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.780
and as you vary cosine
theta, you still

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.840
have to make sure that this
quantity on the inside here--

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.690
so, s squared plus t--

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:33.100
always has to be greater
than or equal to zero or else

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:36.370
the roots of this are imaginary
and you don't have a solution.

00:34:40.017 --> 00:34:42.100
So it's kind of nice that
this came out quadratic.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:44.725
Because it lets you take some of
the knowledge you already know

00:34:44.725 --> 00:34:48.100
and now apply it to say, when or
when are nuclear reactions not

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:48.949
or are they allowed?

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:49.449
Wait.

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:50.679
Let me rephrase that.

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:53.560
When are nuclear reactions
allowed or not allowed?

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.760
You can now tell, depending
on the angle of emission

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.640
and the incoming energy and the
masses, which are all things

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.546
that you would tend to know.

00:35:03.546 --> 00:35:05.810
So is everyone clear on
the implications here?

00:35:08.357 --> 00:35:09.190
If not, let me know.

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.714
Because that's what
this class is for.

00:35:10.714 --> 00:35:11.158
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:11.158 --> 00:35:12.741
Can you just go over
it one more time?

00:35:12.741 --> 00:35:13.600
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:17.560
So, for exothermic reactions
where Q is greater than 0,

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.590
all that says from our initial
part of the Q equation,

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.010
if Q is greater than 0, then
we have this thing right here,

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.190
where the final kinetic
energies have to be larger

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.690
than the initial one.

00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:30.940
Which is to say that
some mass has turned

00:35:30.940 --> 00:35:33.350
into extra kinetic energy.

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:36.260
And the solution to
these is pretty easy

00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.170
because you don't need
any kinetic energy to make

00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:41.330
an exothermic reaction happen.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.530
So you can just set T1 equal
to 0, which makes s equal to 0,

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.300
because they're all
multiplied here.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.750
And then it
simplifies lowercase t

00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:55.110
as just a ratio of those
masses times the Q equation,

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:58.590
which will tell you pretty
much how much kinetic energy is

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:04.480
going to be sent off to
particle 3 right here.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.200
Up there.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.310
Particle 3.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:12.560
Because then we have this
condition, if root T3 equals s

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.610
plus square root of
s squared plus t,

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:21.550
and we've decided
that s equals 0,

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:30.420
that just means that T3 equals
lowercase t, which equals that.

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.170
So then you've uniquely
defined the kinetic energy

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.550
for an exothermic
reaction, as long

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:39.010
as you have no incoming
kinetic energy.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:42.260
For the case of an endothermic
reaction, first of all,

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.170
we know that the
incoming kinetic energy

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.750
has to be greater than 0.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.370
It's like the excess
energy that you

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.430
need to get a chemical
reaction going.

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.330
Has anyone here
ever played with--

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.715
what's the one, a
striking one here?

00:36:55.715 --> 00:36:57.340
Well, has anyone ever
lit anything on--

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.080
no, that's-- yeah.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:36:59.890
Of course you have.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:02.164
And that's not a
good explanation.

00:37:02.164 --> 00:37:03.120
Hmm.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.552
What's a good, striking
endothermic chemical reaction?

00:37:07.552 --> 00:37:09.090
Can anyone think of one?

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:09.590
Yeah?

00:37:09.590 --> 00:37:12.410
AUDIENCE: When you put tin
foil in Liquid-Plumr and it

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.910
releases--

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:15.207
PROFESSOR: And it's
a hydrogen generator?

00:37:15.207 --> 00:37:16.040
AUDIENCE: Let's see.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.060
I guess that's an explosion.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.080
PROFESSOR: I think
that happen-- yeah.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:19.330
That's more like an explosion.

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.540
That's, like, the intuitive
definition of exothermic.

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.040
Yeah.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.730
Actually, there's a fun
one you can do, too.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:26.120
This is great that
it's on video.

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:29.990
You do that plus put manganese
dioxide in hydrogen peroxide

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.090
and you have an
oxygen generator.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.178
And then you have the purest,
beyond glacially pure,

00:37:35.178 --> 00:37:35.720
spring water.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.850
You just mix H and O directly.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:39.020
Just don't get near it.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.390
Because it tends
to be pretty loud.

00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:44.150
We do this for our RTC
or reactor technology

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:48.063
course, where I've got to
teach a bunch of CEOs enough

00:37:48.063 --> 00:37:50.480
basic high school chemistry
so they can understand reactor

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.630
water chemistry.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.140
And the way I make sure that
they're paying attention

00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:56.530
is with a tremendous explosion.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:38:00.550
So folks come here, pay
about $25 grand apiece for me

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.140
to fire water-powered
bottle rockets at them.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.750
It's a pretty sweet job.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.787
So if you guys are
interested in academia,

00:38:06.787 --> 00:38:08.370
you know, these
things happen in life.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.100
It's pretty cool.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:10.600
Yeah.

00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:10.780
All right.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.330
Since I can't think of any
endothermic chemical reactions

00:38:13.330 --> 00:38:14.705
off the top of my
head, I'll have

00:38:14.705 --> 00:38:16.450
to keep it general
and abstract and say,

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.070
if you have an
endothermic reaction,

00:38:18.070 --> 00:38:20.770
you have to add energy
in the form of heat

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.690
to get the reaction going.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.910
In an endothermic
nuclear reaction,

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:26.950
heating up the material
does not impart

00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:28.600
very much kinetic energy.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.030
You might raise it from
a fraction of an electron

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:33.495
volt to maybe a couple
of electron volts

00:38:33.495 --> 00:38:34.870
if things are so
hot that they're

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:36.670
glowing in the ultraviolet.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.620
That doesn't cut it for nuclear.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.970
So you have to impart kinetic
energy to the incoming particle

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.540
such that the kinetic
energy plus the rest masses

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:50.920
is enough to create the rest
masses of the final particles.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.020
And that's the general
explanation I'd give.

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:57.580
I forget who had
asked the question.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.830
But does that help
explain it a bit?

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:00.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:01.477
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:39:01.477 --> 00:39:02.380
OK.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:04.190
I'll take five minutes.

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:06.970
And let's do a
severely reduced case

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:09.940
of this, the case of
elastic neutron scattering.

00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.790
It's kind of a flash
forward to what we'll be

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:14.470
doing in the next month or so.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.953
Does everyone have what's
behind this board here?

00:39:16.953 --> 00:39:18.620
I know that was, like,
three boards ago.

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.010
So I hope so.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:23.073
So let's take the case of
elastic neutron scattering.

00:39:30.468 --> 00:39:33.760
Remember I told you that
after we developed this highly

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.412
general solution
to the Q equation,

00:39:35.412 --> 00:39:37.120
everything else that
we're going to study

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.040
is just a reduction of that.

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.560
And this is about as
reduced as it gets.

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:44.080
So in elastic
neutron scattering,

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.010
we can say that M1--

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:50.670
well, what's the mass
of a neutron in AMU?

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:55.050
And let's forgive our six
decimal points' precision

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:55.763
for now.

00:39:55.763 --> 00:39:56.430
What's it about?

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.190
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:58.160
PROFESSOR: 1.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.621
So we can say that M1 equals 1.

00:40:00.621 --> 00:40:03.270
And in the case of
elastic scattering,

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.670
the particles bounce
into each other

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.790
and leave with their
original identities.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:10.290
So that also equals M3.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:18.180
If we're shooting neutrons at
an arbitrary nucleus, what's M2?

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.220
Yep?

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:23.850
AUDIENCE: A?

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:26.860
PROFESSOR: Just A,
the mass number.

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.100
Same as M4.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.470
Now, we don't have
M2 in this equation.

00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:34.910
Whatever.

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.590
But the point is, yeah.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.740
We're going to use these two.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:40.650
We're going to use these two.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.000
So let's substitute that in.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.790
Oh, and one last other
thing I mentioned.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:49.506
What is the Q value
for elastic scattering?

00:40:49.506 --> 00:40:50.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:50.622 --> 00:40:51.330
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:52.390
0.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:55.060
Because the Q value is
the difference in the rest

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.000
masses of the ingoing
and outgoing particles.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.540
If the ingoing and outgoing
particles are the same,

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:06.010
M1 equals M3, M2 equals
M4, that sum equals 0.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.300
Therefore, Q equals 0.

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:11.610
So let's use these
three things right here

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:15.930
and rewrite the general Q
equation in those terms.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:18.200
Which board is it on?

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.690
Right there.

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:22.010
So let's copy that down.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:31.900
So let's say we have T1 times
M1 is 1 over M4 is A minus 1

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:37.560
minus 2 over M4 is A. This is
where it gets nice and easy.

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.640
M1 and M3 are just 1.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:46.228
So 1 times 1 times T1.

00:41:46.228 --> 00:41:47.520
We don't know what that is yet.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:52.650
So let's call it the Tn, T
of the neutron coming in.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:56.160
How about this?

00:41:56.160 --> 00:42:04.550
We'll call it T in and T out
for ease of understanding.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.750
Cosine theta.

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.040
What do we have left?

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.160
Plus T out.

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:16.740
And let's make T1 into
an in right there.

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.680
Times M3 over M4.

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.955
M3 was 1.

00:42:20.955 --> 00:42:27.150
M4 is A. Plus 1
equals Q, equals 0.

00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:29.920
This is quite a simpler
equation to solve.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.392
So let's group
this all together.

00:42:33.392 --> 00:42:34.850
There's a couple
of tricks that I'm

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.392
going to apply right
now to make sure

00:42:36.392 --> 00:42:38.590
that everything has
A in the denominator

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:40.180
to make stuff easier.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:44.780
We can call 1 A over A here.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.740
We can call 1 A over A there.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.830
That lets us combine
our denominators

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:55.370
and stick the sine right there.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:58.430
That becomes an A.
Same thing here.

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.930
I'll just connect the dashes
and stick the minus sign there,

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.380
leaving an A right there.

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.150
Now we can just
multiply everything

00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:11.050
by A, both sides
of the equation.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:15.010
So the As go away there.

00:43:15.010 --> 00:43:16.835
We have a much simpler equation.

00:43:16.835 --> 00:43:20.440
0 equals T in of--

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:27.240
let's see-- 1 minus A over 1.

00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:27.740
OK.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:36.850
We'll just call it 1 minus
A. Minus 2 root T in T

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:47.240
out cosine theta
plus T out A plus 1.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.300
And, OK, it's 10 minutes
of, or it's five minutes

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:51.800
of five minutes of.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.420
So I'm going to
stop this right here

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.092
at a fairly simple equation.

00:43:55.092 --> 00:43:56.300
We'll pick it up on Thursday.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.430
And I want to open the last
five minutes to any questions

00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:59.180
you guys may have.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.370
Since that request came
in on the anonymous rant

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.700
forum, which hopefully
you all know now exists.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:07.435
Yep.

00:44:07.435 --> 00:44:10.405
AUDIENCE: So what exactly
is forward scattering?

00:44:10.405 --> 00:44:12.890
I didn't really get that before.

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:14.900
PROFESSOR: So let's look
at elastic scattering

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:15.720
as an example.

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:18.290
So in elastic
scattering, two particles

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:20.450
bounce off each other
like billiard balls.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.390
In forward elastic
scattering, the neutron,

00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:27.560
after interacting
somehow with particle 2,

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:30.840
keeps moving forward unscathed.

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:32.460
So in the elastic
scattering sense,

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:36.422
forward scattering is
also known as missing.

00:44:36.422 --> 00:44:37.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.940
PROFESSOR: You can
have other reactions,

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.815
let's say, where you
have a particle at rest,

00:44:40.815 --> 00:44:45.320
another particle slams into it,
and the whole center of mass

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:46.185
moves together.

00:44:46.185 --> 00:44:47.810
I don't know if you'd
call that forward

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.310
scattering as much
as, let's say,

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:52.410
capture or fusion or something.

00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:55.700
But in this case, scattering
means that two particles go in,

00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.710
two particles leave.

00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:59.330
Whether it's
elastically, which means

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:01.730
with no transfer of
energy into rest mass,

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:03.770
or inelastically,
where, let's say,

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:07.280
a neutron is absorbed
and then re-emitted

00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.690
from a different energy level.

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:11.260
And that's something we'll
get into in, like, a month.

00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:13.780
So you can have forward elastic
or inelastic scattering.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.810
In this case, I'm talking
about elastic scattering, which

00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:20.470
is the simple case of, like, the
billiard balls miss each other.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.080
Which is technically a case
that can be treated by this.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.930
Because all you have to do
is plug in theta equals 0

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.600
and you have the case
for how much energy

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:32.483
do you think the neutron would
lose if it misses particle 2.

00:45:32.483 --> 00:45:33.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:33.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:34.770
It wouldn't lose any energy.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:34.970
Right?

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.510
It would have the same energy.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:38.380
So that's the case for
forward scattering.

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:42.080
A neutron, when it interacts
somehow with another particle,

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:45.320
can lose as little as
none of its energy.

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.990
If it misses, no one said
it had to lose any energy.

00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:49.830
And by solving
this equation here,

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.650
which we'll do on
Thursday, we'll

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.500
see what the maximum amount of
energy that neutron can lose

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:58.830
is, which is the basis
for neutrons slowing down

00:45:58.830 --> 00:46:02.350
or moderation in reactors.

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:03.330
Yeah.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:07.130
AUDIENCE: Are T in and T out
equal there, in which case

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.012
that equation is used
to solve for theta?

00:46:10.012 --> 00:46:13.660
PROFESSOR: T in and T
out are not always equal.

00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:17.590
But in the case of forward
elastic scattering,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.990
they would be.

00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:21.540
Because the neutron
comes in with energy T in

00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.390
and it leaves with energy T in.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:27.780
For any other case in
which the neutron comes off

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:30.060
of particle 2 at
a different angle,

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:34.290
it will have bounced off of
particle 2, moving particle 2

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:36.180
at some other angle
phi, and giving it

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.540
some of its energy elastically.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.180
The total amount of that kinetic
energy will be conserved.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.000
So let's say-- what
did we call it?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:46.500
What is it?

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.000
Yeah.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.320
So T1 would have to be
the same as T3 and T4

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:53.520
together for this
Q equation where

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.090
Q equals 0 to be satisfied.

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:58.500
So what you said can happen.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:02.097
But it's only the case
for forward scattering.

00:47:02.097 --> 00:47:02.930
Any other questions?

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.780
Yep.

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.650
AUDIENCE: In the case of
an exothermic reaction,

00:47:07.650 --> 00:47:10.258
we assume that T1 equals 0.

00:47:10.258 --> 00:47:13.103
Can you re-explain why
we made that assumption?

00:47:13.103 --> 00:47:15.520
PROFESSOR: So the question
was, in an exothermic reaction,

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.710
why did we say T1 equals 0?

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:19.270
It's not always the case.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.300
But it provides the simplest
case for us to analyze.

00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:26.560
So an exothermic reaction
can happen when T1 equals 0.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.790
It can also happen when
T1 is greater than 0.

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:31.970
So we're not putting any
restrictions on that.

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.650
But in the case that T1
equals 0, s is destroyed

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.470
and the harder part
of T is destroyed,

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:42.200
making the solution
to this equation very

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.970
simple and intuitive.

00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:47.120
Which is to say that if you
just have two particles that

00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.320
are kind of at rest and
they just merge and fire off

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:53.930
two different pieces
in opposite directions,

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.180
their energies are
proportional to the ratio

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.583
of their single mass
to the total mass.

00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:01.250
So that's like a
center of mass problem.

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:04.810
You'll notice also I'm not using
center of mass coordinates.

00:48:04.810 --> 00:48:08.626
Center of mass coor-- who here
has used those in 801 or 802?

00:48:08.626 --> 00:48:10.920
And who here enjoyed
the experience?

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:11.460
Oh.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:11.960
Wow.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.860
No hands whatsoever.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:17.540
So center of mass coordinates
and laboratory coordinates

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.330
are different ways of
expressing the same thing.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:22.460
Usually you can write
simpler equations

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.243
in center of mass coordinates.

00:48:24.243 --> 00:48:26.660
But for most people-- and I'm
going to go with all of you,

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:29.465
since none of you raised your
hand-- it's not that intuitive.

00:48:29.465 --> 00:48:30.590
That's the same way for me.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:32.360
So that's why I've
made a decision

00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.910
to show things in
laboratory coordinates,

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:37.250
so you have a fixed
frame of reference

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:39.650
and not a moving frame of
reference of the center of mass

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.240
of the two particles.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.480
But the center of mass idea
does kind of make sense here.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:47.210
If you have two particles
that are almost touching

00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:50.900
and then they touch and they
break into pieces and fly off,

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.650
the total amount of momentum
of that center of mass was 0.

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:56.540
And it has to remain 0.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.840
And so each of these particles
will take a differing ratio

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.700
of their masses away.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.720
We already looked at this
for the case of alpha decay,

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.450
where if you have one nucleus
just sitting here-- let's

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.190
say there was no T1.

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:12.290
There was just some unstable
T2 that was about to explode

00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:13.375
and then it did.

00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:15.130
Remember how we
talked about how the Q

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.400
value of an alpha reaction is
not the same energy that you

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.660
see the alpha decay at?

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.010
Same thing right here.

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:25.700
So this Q equation describes
that same situation.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.290
Notice there's no hint of M1.

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.720
There was really
no M1 in the end.

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.590
We don't care what the initial
mass of the particle that

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:35.640
made alpha decay is.

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:39.990
All we care about is what are
the mass ratios and energy

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:44.470
ratios of the alpha particle
and its recoil nucleus.

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:46.590
So it all does tie together.

00:49:46.590 --> 00:49:48.340
That's the neat thing,
is this universal Q

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.910
equation can be used to
describe almost everything we're

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:54.550
going to talk about.

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:57.040
So this is as
complex as it gets.

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:59.530
And from now on, we'll be
looking at simpler reductions

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.850
and specific cases of each one.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:02.760
So it's five of.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.177
I want to actually make sure
to get you to your next class

00:50:05.177 --> 00:50:05.695
on time.

00:50:05.695 --> 00:50:08.790
And I'll see you
guys on Thursday.

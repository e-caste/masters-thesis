00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:08.650
PROFESSOR: Hello, I'm Linan.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.690
Welcome to the recitation
of Linear Algebra.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.650
It's my great
pleasure to guide you

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.930
through the first recitation.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.940
In the first lecture, we
learned some important concepts.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.220
We discussed how to view a
linear system of equations

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.230
from different points.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.720
And we discussed the concepts
such as row picture, column

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.030
picture, and the form in matrix.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.800
Some of them may be new to you.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.540
So today, we're going to
use this simple example

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.630
to review those concepts.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.430
We're going to work with
this simple system of two

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.340
equations with two unknowns.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.000
So I would like you
to first solve it,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.800
and then to find out the
associated row picture

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240
and column picture
with this system.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.709
After you're done,
we're also going

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.890
to discuss the matrix form
of this linear system.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.700
Why don't you pause
the video now and try

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240
to work them out on your own.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.270
A good suggestion
would be, you can

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.350
try to sketch your answer in
an xy coordinate like this.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.070
OK, I'll see you in a while.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.210
I hope you have just
had some fun with it.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.340
Let's work on it together.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.250
Well, we're going to
solve these equations.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.910
As you can see, we have
two unknowns, x and y.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.360
And they have to satisfy these
two equations at the same time.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.780
How would you solve it?

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.470
A very simple way would
be you substitute x by y,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.700
in terms of y.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.440
So let's do it this way.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.280
So we use the second equation
to rewrite x as 2y minus 1.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.090
So 2y minus 1.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.325
Then you plug this into
the first equation.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:31.840
This implies twice-- x would
be replaced by this-- 2 times

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.886
2y minus 1 plus y is equal to 3.

00:02:38.886 --> 00:02:43.850
When you simplify
this equation here,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:53.180
you will arrive at that
5y minus 2 is equal to 3.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.110
That simply tells
you y is equal to 1.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.360
If y is equal to 1, then
we go back to this formula.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.690
We see that x is
also equal to 1.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.550
That's it.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.830
This is the answer to
this linear system.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.400
And it's easy enough.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.650
Both x and y are 1.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.130
Now, let's try to find out its
row picture and column picture.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.200
So I'm going to work on
this xy coordinate here.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.215
First, let's look
at row picture.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.180
Please review what
a row picture is.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.560
So by row picture,
I mean you have

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.650
to look at this linear
system according to each row.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.890
So what is the first row?

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.710
Well, the first row is an
equation with two unknowns.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.630
So 2 times x plus
y is equal to 3.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.000
What is this equation, exactly?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.620
As you may remember,
this equation

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.610
actually gives you a
straight line in xy-plane.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.520
So now let's put the line here.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:19.779
I want a line that
satisfies 2x plus y is 3.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:23.640
Let's first set x to be 0.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.510
If x is 0, by the
first equation,

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.220
y should be 3, which is here.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.980
Now, let's set x to be 1.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.800
If x is 1, then y is also 1.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.600
So what I have now are
two points on the line.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.920
And this is enough,
because on the xy-plane,

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.020
two points will uniquely
determine a straight line.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.110
And that's the line
we're looking for.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.410
So all we need to do is to
connect these two points.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.245
Let me try to draw
this line straight.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.900
So this is the
line that is given

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.660
by 2x plus y is equal to 3.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.300
This is the easiest way
to determine a line.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.590
You just need to pick two
points that are on the line.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.640
Then you connect them, and here
you have the straight line.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.660
So that's the first row.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.310
Now let's look at
the second row.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.390
The second row is x
minus 2y is equal to -1.

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.120
Same thing.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.870
We're going to locate two
points on the second line.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.500
So again, let's set
x to be 0 first.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.550
If x is 0, then y
should be 1/2, right?

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.710
So this line has to
cross this point.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.150
That's x, 0; y, 1/2.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.930
Then let's put x to be 1 again.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.710
So if x is 1, then y is also 1.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.960
So we're going to use
the same point here.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.770
Now we have two points in the
second line to connect them.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.510
So by connecting them, I will
have my second straight line.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.820
So this is the line
corresponding to x minus 2y

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.180
is -1.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.980
This is the row
picture, because we

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.190
have separated
the two equations,

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.450
and we look at
them respectively.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.590
The first equation
gives me this line,

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.000
and the second equation
gives me this line.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.150
Then what do I mean by
solving this linear system?

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.220
Well, we are putting
these two lines together,

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:05.660
and we are looking
at a point which

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:09.050
is on the first line and
second line at the same time.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:14.670
Then clearly, that's the point
where they intersect, right?

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.550
We can see from the
answer over there,

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.100
the coordinate of this
point should be (1, 1).

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.110
This is also clear from the
construction of the two lines.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.750
We have noticed
that this point is

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.210
on the first line and the
second line at the same time.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:39.340
Two lines meeting
at the point (1, 1).

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.460
That's the row picture
of this linear system.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:48.330
Now, let's move on to
the column picture.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.320
Again, I will need
an xy coordinate.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:04.060
So, where can I find my columns?

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.035
If you look at
the two equations,

00:08:08.035 --> 00:08:14.240
then you focus on the
coefficient in front

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.900
of x in both equations.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.340
What would that be?

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:25.060
Well, in the first equation,
I have a 2 in front of x.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:29.940
In the second equation,
I have a 1 in front of x.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:36.010
I want to put them together
as a column vector.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.390
Let me call it v_1.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.520
And I'm going to do the same
thing to the coefficients

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.180
in front of y.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.640
In the first equation, I
have a 1 in front of y.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.970
In the second equation, I
have a -2 in front of y.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.840
Put them together.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.640
Call it a column vector v_2.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.360
These are the columns
I'm looking for.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.590
Then what does that
linear system say?

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.300
Well, I have extracted the
coefficients in front of x.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:25.940
Now I can consider x to be the
coefficient of this vector.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:29.720
And same thing,
I'm going to view y

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.190
as the coefficient
of this vector.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:40.260
Then what that linear system is
doing is just to sum them up.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.710
That gives you the left-hand
side of the linear system.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.060
What is the right-hand side?

00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:49.800
Again, you put the two
constants as a column

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.770
vector, which is [3, -1].

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.460
That is the right-hand side.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:04.840
So what I'm doing here is I'm
taking the linear combination

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.010
of v_1 and v_2.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:13.720
And the coefficients are given
by x and y, respectively.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.430
And I want the result of this
combination to be [3, -1].

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:25.670
Now let's incorporate
this into this picture.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:30.480
I have a v_1, so I'm going
to draw a vector v_1.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.590
x is 2, y is 1, so v_1 is here.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:42.780
That's v_1.

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:44.620
And I need a v_2.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.740
x is 1.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.030
y is -2.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.560
So that's my v_2.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:01.930
I want to take the sum
of x multiple of v_1

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.350
and y multiple of v_2.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:09.970
And I want the result
to be [3,  -1].

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:14.770
Well, taking a hint from
the previous consideration,

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:21.660
we know that both x
and y should be 1.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:30.690
So I'm actually summing one
copy of v_1 and one copy of v_2.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:35.430
So how do you indicate the
sum of these two vectors?

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.495
You complete the parallelogram
spanned by these two vectors.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:50.680
Then the vector
given by the diagonal

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:54.380
is the sum of v_1 and v_2.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:58.190
Is this vector going
to be [3,  -1]?

00:11:58.190 --> 00:11:59.800
Well, we can check.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:04.860
The x-coordinate will
be 2 plus 1, which is 3.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.750
That's 2 plus 1, 3.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:13.000
And the y-coordinate
will be 1 minus 2.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.410
So 1 minus 2,
which should be -1.

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.080
That's it.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.840
That's one multiple of v_1
and one multiple of v_2.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.460
The sum will be [3, -1].

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.720
And that's the row picture.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.210
Where does that that "x is equal
to y is equal to 1" come from?

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.820
It comes from solving
the linear system.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.260
It comes from the row picture.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.430
So here, we have found out
the row picture and the column

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.990
picture of this linear system.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:53.290
What I would like to
mention is the matrix form

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.450
of this linear system.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.900
So what is the matrix form?

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:10.840
What if I put these two
column vectors together?

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:18.900
So I want to put them
back to back, v_1 and v_2.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:25.240
And I call this matrix to be
A. So if you write it out,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:30.675
A should be given
by 2, 1; 1, -2.

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.530
Matrix A has v_1 and v_2
as its column vectors,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.360
and it's a 2-by-2 matrix.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.240
If I consider-- if I take
this into account, then

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:51.260
what will be the left-hand
side of the linear system?

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.280
In other words, what would
be the left-hand side

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.130
of this equation?

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:01.690
This is actually matrix
A multiplying a vector

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.310
given by x, y.

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:12.750
So that's [2, 1; 1, -2]
multiplying x and y.

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:17.970
So you put both unknowns
together as a column vector.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:21.530
That's the left-hand
side of the equation.

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.610
And again, the
right-hand side is given

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.544
by this column vector, [3; -1].

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:34.260
This is the matrix form
of this linear system.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.700
We can actually
solve this directly.

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:42.642
In other words, we can get
this unknown vector at once,

00:14:42.642 --> 00:14:44.100
both x-coordinate
and y-coordinate.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:51.670
Let's recall, if you have a
scalar equation like this--

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.990
let's say a is some
constant times x is unknown

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.560
is equal to b.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.060
If a is non-zero,
what would be x?

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.770
So clearly, x
should be b over a.

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:12.160
I can also write it
as a inverse times b.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:14.940
That's what we do
when we have numbers.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:17.640
So here, what we
want to apply is

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.590
a similar idea but to matrix.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.930
What you want to
find is a matrix

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:31.800
A inverse such that
A inverse times A

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:38.975
is equal to an identity
matrix, which is [1, 0; 0, 1].

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:45.580
This may be new to you,
but as you go further

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:50.730
into this course, this idea will
become more and more natural.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.080
If such an inverse
matrix exists, then

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.860
what would be this vector here?

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:12.920
Then [x; y] will simply be
A inverse times [3; -1].

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.650
That will give you the answer.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.410
Here, I'm not going
to go into detail,

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.920
but we will return to
this later in this course.

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.210
I hope this simple
example is helpful to you

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.330
in reviewing what you've
learned in the lecture.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:32.580
Thank you for watching,
and I'm looking forward

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.810
to seeing you again.

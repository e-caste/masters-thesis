[CLICKING]

00:00:10.923 --> 00:00:12.840
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, why
don't we get started?

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.590
Since I had some problems
with the end of last lecture,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.810
I'm going to pick up
right where things

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.590
got a little dicey
in the last lecture,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.840
and we're going to start over.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.070
So we're looking back at figure
7-3, which, if you remember,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.955
was the cost curves for our cost
function 10 plus 5q squared.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:30.620
And you remember
where it came from.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.410
This cost function
we derived ourselves

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.080
from the production function
and wages and rental rates.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.950
We derived this cost function.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.950
We're now graphing the
cost curves that come out

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.140
of this cost function,
and we're talking

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.570
about profit maximization.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.330
And we're talking
about measuring profit.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.620
So we're talking about
perfect competition.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.420
And remember, we
said that profits

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.650
are revenues minus costs.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.160
That means the profits
per unit are revenues

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.550
per unit minus costs per unit.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.780
Revenues per unit are price, and
cost per unit is average cost.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.082
So profits per unit is price
minus the average cost.

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.290
So we just go to the diagram.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.800
You see the height of
the profit rectangle

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.290
is price minus the average cost.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.040
So what do you do?

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.080
You start by finding the point.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.550
So what are your steps here?

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.260
Step one is you
find the point where

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.258
price equals marginal cost.

00:01:28.258 --> 00:01:29.800
That gives you your
production level.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.810
That gives your optimal q star--

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.670
we derived that last time--

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.900
of 3.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.110
We derived that last time that
you want to optimize the price

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.770
equals marginal cost.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.590
That gives our q star of 3.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.400
Then at that level, we
compute the average cost.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.420
Average cost at q
of 3 is simply going

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.060
to be this cost
function divided by 3--

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:02.470
so 10 over 3 plus 5q
squared over 3, or just 5q,

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.840
plus 15, OK?

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.900
So the average cost at
three is going to be $18.33.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.410
That's going to be the average
cost at production of three.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.710
That means that
the profits we're

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.610
making for that third unit,
the profits on our third unit,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.830
is the price--

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:35.620
profits per unit are the price,
which is a fixed level of 30,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.370
minus the average
cost, which is $18.33.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.300
So profits per
unit equals $11.67.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.390
So that's the profits.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.430
That's the height
of the rectangle.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.750
The profits per unit is $11.67.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.190
The price minus the
average cost is $11.67.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.250
We're selling three units, so
that means our total profit

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.720
rectangle is 35, OK?

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.180
So our total profits
are 35, which

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.440
is three units at a
profit of $11.67 each.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.540
And that's how we
get that rectangle.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.900
Questions about that?

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.660
OK.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.730
So now, let's return to
what we did last time.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:25.615
Let's imagine there's
a tax of $10 per unit.

00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:30.730
That would shift the
cost curve to C equals 10

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.920
plus 5q squared plus 10q.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.930
Remember, it's a tax
per unit, plus 10q.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.560
That would mean-- so that is
illustrated in figure 7-4.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.850
That means that the marginal
cost curve and the average cost

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.160
curve both shift up.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.830
Marginal cost is now
equal to 10q plus 10.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.720
We want to set that equal to
the price to get the optimal q,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.490
and you solve this and you
get a new q star equals 2.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.740
So now your optimal
production level is two.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.200
You set your new marginal
cost equal to the price.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.089
Marginal cost equals price.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:21.120
Marginal cost equals price at
a new optimal quantity of two.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.890
What's the profits there?

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.570
Well, once again,
profits per unit

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.870
are just price, which is
$30, minus average cost.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.240
Well, what's the
average cost at two?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.760
The average cost at two
is going to be 10 over q--

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.170
so 5.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.290
10 over 2 is 5, OK?

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:47.280
Plus 5q because we're dividing
this by q, 5q, which is 10, OK?

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.080
Plus 10, OK?

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.590
30 minus 25, which equals 5.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.250
So your profits per unit,
the height of that rectangle,

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.300
has fallen from $11.67 to $5.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.910
So you're now making
less profit per unit

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.950
and you're selling fewer units.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.630
The height of the
rectangle has shrunk.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.213
The width of the
rectangle has shrunk.

00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:17.116
So the total profits have
fallen from $30 to $10.

00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:21.110
You used to make profits of
$11.67 on each of three units.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.960
Now you make profits of
$5 on each of two units.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.940
So that tax has lowered your
profits from $30 to $10, OK?

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.150
Question about that?

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.650
Yeah.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.720
AUDIENCE: Is that by changing
the cost [INAUDIBLE]??

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.970
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes, exactly.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.690
Because you have a higher cost--

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.870
now, it's not just
that your costs change.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.635
Your costs changing fed through
to your production as well.

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.010
So because your
costs change, you

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.718
produce at a different
level and you made

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:48.170
different profit per unit, OK?

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.763
All right.

00:05:48.763 --> 00:05:50.180
Now, let's go to
the other point I

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.670
tried to cover last time that
I want to get straight on,

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.770
which is the shutdown decision.

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:00.210
Now remember, we are, in
the short run, shut down.

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.750
We're in the short run.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.930
In the short run, there's
no entry and exit.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.520
The firm can't literally leave,
but it can just produce zero.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.840
That we call the short-run
shutdown decision.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.500
A short-run shutdown decision,
you're still in the market.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.300
You still paid your fixed costs.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.163
You just produce zero.

00:06:17.163 --> 00:06:19.330
That's what we mean by
shutdown, as opposed to exit,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.360
which is literally you
take your toys and leave.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.350
This is you're
still in the market.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.080
You've paid your fixed costs.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:24.690
You can't go
anywhere-- remember,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.370
those costs are fixed
in the short run--

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.700
but you just produce zero.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.520
So now let's ask,
for example, what

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.810
happens if the price
suddenly dropped to $10.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.520
Let's say the price
dropped from $30 to $10.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.640
Well, the fundamental
profit-maximization rule

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.745
never changes.

00:06:43.745 --> 00:06:45.120
We're not having
the tax anymore.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.610
We're back to the
original cost function.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:53.720
So original cost function is C
equals 10 plus 5q squared, OK?

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.950
So the marginal
cost equals 10q, and

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.440
our profit-maximization
rule does not change.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.050
Our profit-maximization
rule is that price

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.800
equals marginal cost.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.090
So we set 10q to 10,
marginal cost equal to price.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.300
$10 is the price.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.480
And we get that the optimal
quantity is now one.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.070
We now want to produce one unit.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.430
That's the optimal quantity.

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.480
Well, what is our profits
if we produce one unit?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:27.600
Well, profits equals
revenues, $10, minus costs.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:30.320
Well, what's our cost
if we produce one unit?

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.390
10 plus 5, 15.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.980
So profits are negative 5.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.680
I'm going fast, so jump in if
I get the math wrong here, OK?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.470
Profits are negative 5.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.470
So you might think that's
terrible, using money.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.500
You should get out
of there, shut down.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.390
But the answer is, as
we discussed last time,

00:07:51.390 --> 00:07:54.870
you should not shut down
because shutting down still

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.650
means paying your fixed costs.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.240
No matter what you do, you
have to pay those fixed costs.

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.110
So shutting down means
production of zero.

00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:05.390
What are your profits
at a production of zero?

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:07.220
Your profits at a
production of zero

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:12.520
are zero revenues minus
the fixed cost of $10.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.500
If you produce zero,
what's your cost?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.880
Plug 0 in here.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.130
Your costs are still 10.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.470
So if you produce zero,
your profits are minus 10.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:23.560
So you should
continue to sell even

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.810
though you're losing money.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.310
Even though you're
losing money, you

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.230
continue to sell that one unit.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.270
You don't go to zero.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:35.240
Because at zero,
you're even worse off.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.720
This is the key thing about
short-run shutdown decision.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.090
Yeah?

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.715
AUDIENCE: What happens if you're
in a position where, like, you

00:08:41.715 --> 00:08:43.507
are afraid you're going
to keep selling one

00:08:43.507 --> 00:08:45.354
unit the next couple of months?

00:08:45.354 --> 00:08:47.410
JONATHAN GRUBER: Ah, but
that's the key thing.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.410
Once you move to the long run,
you can reoptimize your capital

00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:51.542
and you can exit.

00:08:51.542 --> 00:08:53.500
But in the short run,
you've already paid that.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.350
You've already laid down your
blanket, which cost you $10.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.450
You might as well
sell at a loss.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.980
If you just sell
zero, then you've

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.550
laid down your blanket for $10
and gotten nothing out of it,

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:03.070
OK?

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.653
That's the transition
to the long run.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.607
And so basically, that's how
you think about the short run

00:09:11.607 --> 00:09:12.440
versus the long run.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.780
So what do we think
about how this works?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.855
So basically, the
shutdown rule, the way

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:19.210
you think of the math
of the shutdown rule

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.420
is that basically you
only want to shut down

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.720
if your revenues are less
than your variable costs

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.970
because you got to pay your
fixed cost no matter what.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.490
That's done.

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.490
You're in the short run.

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.000
That's gone.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.510
Forget it.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.310
You laid your blanket
down in the bazaar.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.390
That's done.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:38.840
So you only want to shut
down if your revenues are

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:41.510
less than your variable costs.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:43.250
You don't care about
your fixed costs.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.385
That's done.

00:09:44.385 --> 00:09:46.010
You only shut down
if your revenues are

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.450
less than your variable costs.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.030
Well, that's the same
as saying you only want

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.610
to shut down if your price--

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:54.860
variable costs are pq--

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.390
I'm sorry, your variable cost.

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.130
You only shut down
if your price are

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.410
less than your average
variable cost--

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:02.930
so divide by q.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.000
You only shut down
if your price is

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.430
less than your average
variable costs.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.660
That's the shutdown rule.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.470
Shut down if the
price you get is less

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.390
than, on average, what
you'll get unit for the units

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:17.540
you sell.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.313
So in our example,
you never shut down.

00:10:21.313 --> 00:10:21.980
And why is that?

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.680
Let's look at the
math of our example.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.960
Well, in our example,
what are variable costs?

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.302
The variable cost is 5q squared.

00:10:29.302 --> 00:10:31.510
I'm going to put these down
here so I don't have to--

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:35.710
the variable costs in our
example, variable costs

00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:39.120
are 5q squared.

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.295
So what are average
variable costs?

00:10:41.295 --> 00:10:41.795
5q.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.140
Those are average
variable costs.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:55.960
Now, remember that you want to
shut down if variable costs are

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.460
greater than the price.

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:00.550
We can express the
price in terms of q.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.690
Because remember, marginal
cost equals price.

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.540
So 10q equals p.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:14.290
So at the optimum, it is always
true that p equals q over 10.

00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:17.560
That's a profit-maximizing
condition,

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.510
that p equals q over 10.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:21.940
We can just substitute
that in, and we

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:26.710
have that average variable
costs equals 5 times q.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:35.010
So average variable costs equals
0.5 times p at the optimum.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.555
Because we know that the optimum
marginal cost equals price,

00:11:37.555 --> 00:11:39.930
we can plug that in and say,
at the optimum, average cost

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.156
is 0.5 times p.

00:11:42.156 --> 00:11:43.092
Yeah?

00:11:43.092 --> 00:11:45.432
AUDIENCE: Do you mean
q equals p over 10?

00:11:45.432 --> 00:11:49.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: q-- let
me see if I got that wrong.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.320
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.178
q equals p over 10.

00:11:51.178 --> 00:11:51.720
You're right.

00:11:55.328 --> 00:11:57.220
q equals p over 10, my bad.

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:57.970
Sorry.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.950
So the average variable
cost is 0.5 times p.

00:12:02.950 --> 00:12:04.870
What's the shutdown rule?

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.030
The shutdown rule is
that price is less

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:11.500
than average variable cost or
price is less than 0.5 price,

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.580
which can never be true.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:16.280
So you'd never shut down
with this cost function.

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.610
To say it again,
you only shut down

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.718
if price is less than
average variable cost.

00:12:21.718 --> 00:12:24.010
We've computed average variable
cost in terms of price,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.780
and it's 0.5 times price.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.630
Therefore, you never shut down.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.790
And you could see this
when we actually go to--

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:36.420
so you can actually
see this in figure 7-5

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.130
when we look at the
firm's supply decision.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:42.280
So what figure 7-5
does is show you,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.890
at every price,
what the firm wants

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:47.160
to produce in the short run.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.920
At a price of $10, it
wants to produce one.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.680
We showed you that.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.780
At a price of $20, it
wants to produce two.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.690
At a price of $30, it wants
to produce three, and so on.

00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:00.702
That dash-- that line that runs
from 0, 0 all the way up to 4,

00:13:00.702 --> 00:13:04.980
40, that's the
marginal cost line.

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.290
At each point, price
equals marginal cost,

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:10.660
the optimal production decision.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.200
And you never shut down.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.630
As long as price is
positive, you produce.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.130
Yeah?

00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:21.660
AUDIENCE: So in this case, we
don't set price to 10 minus p?

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.550
Because if it's 10,
then [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.770
will be higher than 10.

00:13:27.945 --> 00:13:29.070
JONATHAN GRUBER: I'm sorry.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.510
I don't understand.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:31.748
AUDIENCE: So--

00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:34.290
JONATHAN GRUBER: Price is always
above average variable cost,

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:37.470
so you'd never shut down, right?

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.920
That's the shutdown rule.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.670
This can never be true
with this function.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:42.545
Price is forever above
average variable cost.

00:13:42.545 --> 00:13:44.950
You can see that in
this graph, right?

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.100
The price equals
the marginal cost,

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.610
and that is always above the
average variable cost, OK?

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:53.117
So the bottom line is
you'd never shut down.

00:13:53.117 --> 00:13:54.450
But here's the other cool thing.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.060
After all this confusing
math, guess what this line

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.540
is, this marginal cost line.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.837
What else do we call that?

00:14:00.837 --> 00:14:02.170
That's the supply curve, people.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.220
We just derived
the supply curve.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.450
What's the supply curve?

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:08.440
The supply curve
is the relationship

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.690
between the price in the
market and the amount

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.460
the producer desires to produce.

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.710
Well, that's what this
marginal cost curve is.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.280
So we've just shown you that the
firm's supply curve is simply

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.660
its marginal cost curve.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.600
So all you need to know to
derive what a firm's supply

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.140
curve looks like is what its
marginal cost curve looks like,

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.200
and you're done.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.540
So literally, you take
production plus input prices,

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.900
and that gives you
the supply curve.

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:36.450
Why?

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:37.950
Because production
plus input prices

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:40.652
gives you the cost function.

00:14:40.652 --> 00:14:42.860
Take the derivative of the
cost function with respect

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.340
to quantity.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.090
That gives you the
marginal cost function.

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:46.920
That's the supply curve.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.750
So just like I could give you
a utility function and a budget

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.080
constraint and you got
the demand curve, here, I

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.450
can give you a production
function and input prices

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.490
and it gets the supply curve--

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:02.710
however, only under
perfect competition, OK?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:04.770
This is only for the case
of perfect competition.

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.353
That's different
from consumer theory.

00:15:06.353 --> 00:15:07.880
That was an everywhere rule.

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:10.400
Because I've given you an
extra constraint, which

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.020
is a constraint on
the market, I've

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.670
allowed you to derive the
supply curve just like we easily

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:17.000
derived the demand curve.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.830
So we have now derived
a firm's supply curve.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.420
Questions about that?

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.880
So let's go back one more time.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:30.100
Just like if I give you on,
say, a problem set or an exam

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.060
a utility function and
a budget constraint,

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.670
you should be able to
draw a demand curve.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:39.200
If I give you a production
function and input prices

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.903
and I tell you you're
in perfect competition,

00:15:41.903 --> 00:15:43.820
then you should be able
to draw a supply curve

00:15:43.820 --> 00:15:47.490
because it's just the
marginal cost curve, OK?

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:50.922
Now, that's the
firm's supply curve.

00:15:50.922 --> 00:15:52.630
What we care about,
actually, in the end,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.820
is the market
supply curve, right?

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.038
I've been doing little q.

00:15:56.038 --> 00:15:58.330
We care about big Q. That's
what I drew in the lecture,

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:00.040
was a big Q diagram.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:01.640
So how do we get there?

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:04.840
Well, all you do to
get the market supply

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:09.010
is to horizontally sum
each firm's supply.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.430
So we can see that
in figure 7-7, OK?

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.480
What figure 7-7 does is take
multiple identical firms

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.050
and put them in the market.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.480
So for example, if there's
one firm in the market,

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.440
the supply curve is
what we just drew.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.360
At a price of $10, you get 10.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.310
At a price of $10, you get one.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:31.370
At a price of $30,
you get three.

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:34.340
Now let's add a
second identical firm.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.980
Well, that firm
behaves the same way.

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.240
At a price of $10,
it produces one.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.630
And at a price of $30,
it produces three.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.960
So the market now suddenly
has twice as much.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.680
At a price of $10, it has two.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.650
At a price of $30, it has six.

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.090
Now let's add a third firm.

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.612
It behaves the same way.

00:16:51.612 --> 00:16:53.070
At a price of $10,
it produces one.

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:54.800
At a price of $3,
it produces three.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.360
So each additional firm
you add just literally

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.950
shifts the supply curve down.

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:06.980
So in other words, the point
is that a market supply curve,

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.130
as you add more and more
firms, the market supply curve

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:13.310
is always more elastic
than the firm's supply

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:17.089
curve because any
given increase in price

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:20.270
calls for, from each firm,
an increase in quantity.

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.723
As long as there's
multiple firms,

00:17:21.723 --> 00:17:23.390
that means a flatter
market supply curve

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.515
than a firm's supply curve.

00:17:26.785 --> 00:17:28.660
So that's how we get
the market supply curve.

00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:30.520
We solve for the
firm's supply curve.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.650
We then just horizontally
sum it over the number

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:34.690
of firms in the market.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:37.330
Get the firm supply curve,
horizontally sum, OK?

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.800
Questions about that?

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.500
Now, now we have
everything we need

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.740
to go back to the first
lecture, back to the future,

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.210
back to the first lecture.

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:52.200
And we can actually get
to market equilibrium.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.330
In the first lecture,
we started with a supply

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:56.280
curve and a demand curve
and got equilibrium.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.488
Well, we derived the demand
curve a few lectures ago.

00:17:58.488 --> 00:18:00.100
We've just derived
the supply curve.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.187
So let's do short-run
equilibrium.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:08.760
Let's do short-run
equilibrium, OK?

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:12.910
Now, the key thing is that--

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.180
so how do we do
short-run equilibrium?

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.630
Let's go through the steps.

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:20.310
Step one, each firm picks
a fixed amount of capital

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:23.120
it's going to have
in the short run.

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.840
So each firm has a K bar.

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:30.430
And based on that, it has
a production function.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.690
Each firm has a
production function,

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:42.140
q equals f of k, K bar, L.
And we have some input prices.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:45.060
We have some w and some r.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.940
Taken together, we can use
those to create a cost function,

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.820
which, in our example,
was C equals 10

00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:54.740
plus 5q squared, step one.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.390
Step two.

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:04.650
Step two, based on this, we can
get optimal production levels

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.900
from the fundamental
profit-maximization rule,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:10.360
MC equals p.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:17.090
So this yields-- so here,
we say 10q equals p.

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:19.980
And this yields
a supply function

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:25.858
which is q equals p over 10,
and that's our supply curve.

00:19:25.858 --> 00:19:27.650
That's what I drew
here. q equals p over 10

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:28.840
is the firm's supply curve.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.055
That's step two.

00:19:33.055 --> 00:19:36.590
Step three is to create
a market supply curve.

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.590
Well, let's say there's
six firms in the market.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.880
I'm just pulling
this out of thin air.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.005
In a minute, we'll get to
how many firms there are.

00:19:42.005 --> 00:19:44.665
But for now, in the short run,
there's no entry and exit.

00:19:44.665 --> 00:19:47.165
So whatever number of firms I
tell you, that's what's there.

00:19:47.165 --> 00:19:48.970
It's just given.

00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.470
So let's say n equals 6.

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:52.767
Let's say there's six firms.

00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:54.850
And I'll come in a minute
to where six comes from.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.400
But for now, let's
just assume it.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.570
That means that the total
market supply, big Q,

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:09.090
is just equal to 6 little
q, 6 little q, which

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:15.720
equals 3/5 p or 6/10 p.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.580
That is our market supply curve.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:18.220
Yeah?

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.490
AUDIENCE: Would
firms that change

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.610
[INAUDIBLE] who are out there?

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:24.960
Would that change the overall--

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.340
JONATHAN GRUBER: The number
of firms that are out there?

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.860
Yeah, but once again, once
they're in, they're done.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.780
They know there's six firms.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:31.530
So they're done.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:32.613
I'm going to come to this.

00:20:32.613 --> 00:20:34.200
You're talking about
the long run, OK?

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.260
Other questions?

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.510
Yeah-- OK.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.270
So that gives you
your market supply.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:44.220
Finally, we go back to lecture
one and the first recitation

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:46.560
where you solved
mathematically for equilibrium.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.668
We have a demand curve.

00:20:47.668 --> 00:20:48.960
I'm just going to make this up.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.790
Let's say the demand curve
is Q equals 40 minus p.

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:55.867
I just made that up
to make the math easy.

00:20:55.867 --> 00:20:56.950
Where does this come from?

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:57.900
Well, you know where
that comes from.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.275
You solved where
that comes from.

00:20:59.275 --> 00:21:03.210
That comes from consumer
maximization, 48 minus p.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:04.680
So to get equilibrium,
we just set

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:12.510
48 minus p equal to 3/5
p, demand equal to supply.

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:20.100
And we end up with p equals 30,
conveniently familiar number,

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:24.900
which means that the
total demand, big Q,

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:32.630
is 48 minus 30 equals 18,
also convenient number.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.810
And I'll show you why.

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.250
The fifth step, each firm
says, given this price,

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.020
what do I want to produce?

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:45.360
Well, we know that
given a price of 30,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:50.440
each firm's little
q star is 3, right?

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.700
That's what we solved.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.990
Each firm's little q star
is 3 given a price of 30.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:58.030
So each firm
produces three units.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.439
How many firms are there?

00:21:59.439 --> 00:22:00.022
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:22:00.022 --> 00:22:00.605
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:22:00.605 --> 00:22:02.610
JONATHAN GRUBER:
What's 6 times 3?

00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:03.810
Supply equals demand.

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:11.210
Six firms produce three
each at a price of 30.

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:12.380
That's 18.

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:18.390
At a price of 30, people
want 18, equilibrium.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.880
That's how it all works.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.200
So leaving aside where
the six came from,

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.620
everything else you see here
is just taking what we did

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.390
and working out the math.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:32.835
And we get six
firms in the market.

00:22:32.835 --> 00:22:34.570
They each want to produce three.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.970
That's the 18 that people want.

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.620
So to get equilibrium,
you just need--

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.390
to get equilibrium, you
need a demand curve,

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:47.640
you need a cost function,
and you need the number

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.350
of firms in the market.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:50.492
You need a demand curve.

00:22:50.492 --> 00:22:52.200
You need the cost
function and the number

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:53.340
of firms in the market.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:56.490
Given that, you can solve
for the equilibrium.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:57.750
Questions about that?

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:58.620
Yeah.

00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.833
AUDIENCE: So thinking
about this in terms

00:23:00.833 --> 00:23:02.250
of the intersection
of the graphs,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.540
would intersecting the demand
curve with the whole market's

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:06.130
supply curve--

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.080
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, because
it's the whole market demand

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:07.820
curve.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.473
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:23:08.473 --> 00:23:09.390
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah?

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.035
AUDIENCE: Q equals 48 minus
p is the demand curve.

00:23:12.035 --> 00:23:14.410
JONATHAN GRUBER: Q equals 48
minus p is the demand curve.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.145
Other questions?

00:23:19.145 --> 00:23:19.770
Good questions.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.312
Those are good,
clarifying questions.

00:23:21.312 --> 00:23:24.810
OK, so now let's ask where
the hell six comes from.

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:30.110
And where six comes
from is the fact--

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:36.700
where six comes from
is from the long run.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:46.552
So now we get to
long-run competition,

00:23:46.552 --> 00:23:48.010
which is, in the
short run, there's

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:49.750
a certain number of
firms in the market.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:51.218
But where those firms come from?

00:23:51.218 --> 00:23:53.260
Well, they come from the
fact that each short run

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.140
is a repeated exercise
that makes up the long run.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:01.090
So in the long run, perfect
competition in the long run

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:03.370
looks just like perfect
competition in the short run--

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.780
full information, no
transaction cost, lots of firms,

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.160
with one difference.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.100
We're now going to
allow entry and exit.

00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.500
Nothing else is going to
change in the short run

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.170
except we're now going
to allow entry and exit.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.950
So now, what-- and
one other thing.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.450
I'm sorry.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:25.070
One other thing changes.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:29.440
Since all costs are variable,
there's no shutdown decision.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.660
There's no issue of
this shutdown rule.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.440
There's no more fixed costs.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.850
So if you lose money, in
the long run, you shut down.

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.600
So all you have to
worry about is profits.

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.490
You don't have to worry
about this extra shut--

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:41.680
so in the short run, we had
an extra shutdown condition.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.730
You don't worry about
that in the long run.

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:44.770
You just worry about if you're
making money or losing money.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:46.895
In the long run, if you're
making money, you're in.

00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:49.230
If you're losing
money, you're out.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.670
So now let's ask
how that pins down

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.680
the number of firms
in the market.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:58.157
This is complicated, so the
best way to do it, I think,

00:24:58.157 --> 00:24:58.740
is an example.

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.435
And think about our--

00:25:04.435 --> 00:25:06.060
the fundamental rule
I want you to keep

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:07.977
in mind-- and the example
gives you this rule.

00:25:07.977 --> 00:25:12.180
The simple rule is if there's
profits to be made, you enter.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.080
If there's losses, you exit.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.280
And these two things together
imply the fundamental rule

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.340
of competitive equilibrium--
that in the long run,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.480
profits are zero.

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:32.830
Because if there's ever
profit in the market,

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.247
firms will come in.

00:25:34.247 --> 00:25:36.580
And if there's ever loss in
the market, firms will exit.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.090
And that process will continue
until profits are zero.

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:43.150
So our fundamental conclusion
is the long-run competitive

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:46.040
equilibrium features
zero profits.

00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.650
Now let's see why.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.750
Let's go to figure 8-1.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.480
I want to talk about the
market for personal computers.

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:54.980
Let's see.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:56.210
You guys were born what year?

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.030
So you're now, like, 18.

00:25:58.030 --> 00:25:59.610
So you're born, like, 1990.

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:02.060
This is about when
you guys are born, OK?

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:05.570
1990 was a very interesting
time for PC market.

00:26:05.570 --> 00:26:10.610
You all grew up in a PC world,
a personal computer world.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.180
But basically, in 1990, we're
in a very different world.

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:16.490
We're in a world that was
dominated by giant mainframe

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:18.970
computers.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.250
My graduation speaker
from MIT in 1987

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:25.020
was Ken Olsen, the
chairman of DEC,

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.900
which was one of the
premier manufacturer

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.550
of giant computers.

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.470
He gave the worst
fucking graduation speech

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.528
you've ever seen.

00:26:32.528 --> 00:26:34.820
If you ever become famous
and give a graduation speech,

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.945
the number one rule is
don't spend the whole speech

00:26:36.945 --> 00:26:38.060
talking about yourself.

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.393
He spent the whole speech
talking about how wonderful he

00:26:40.393 --> 00:26:41.840
was, how DEC was everything.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.120
And five years later,
he was bankrupt.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.710
So take that, Ken Olsen.

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.460
That's why you don't
give a speech talking

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.830
about how wonderful you are.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.520
What happened?

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:51.590
Well, let's talk
about what happened.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:53.970
Let's talk about
the PC market, OK?

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:55.840
I hope Ken Olsen
doesn't watch this.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:58.376 --> 00:27:01.040
Let's talk about the PC market.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.332
Let's talk about Dell, who
was an early PC manufacturer.

00:27:05.332 --> 00:27:07.040
And what we're going
to do in figure 8-1,

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.970
there's going to be two
side-by-side graphs.

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:10.978
I'm going to go back
and forth between them.

00:27:10.978 --> 00:27:13.520
If you're ever not clear about
which graph I'm talking about,

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.242
stop me.

00:27:14.242 --> 00:27:15.950
But I'll try to be
very clear because you

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.650
have to think about both
these graphs in tandem.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:21.530
On the right-hand
side is the market

00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:24.320
for PCs, the market graph.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:28.090
On the left-hand side
is Dell's cost curves.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.030
So the left-hand side graph is
firm-specific Dell information.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.870
The right-hand side
graph is the market.

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:39.130
In the short run, we
were at a position

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.590
where people wanted
PCs, and there weren't

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.390
many people making them.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:45.310
You guys, PCs were super cool.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:47.620
I mean, I guess, you're on
laptops and everything now.

00:27:47.620 --> 00:27:50.495
But a desktop PC was an
amazing thing at this point.

00:27:50.495 --> 00:27:52.120
Everyone wanted them,
and there weren't

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.340
that many people making them.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:57.880
So at that point, Dell could--

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:05.400
the short-run market
cost curve was SR1,

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.970
and the demand was D.
That was the short--

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.910
so we're starting on the right.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.120
We're going to go from
the right to the left.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:12.912
Start in the right.

00:28:12.912 --> 00:28:16.590
The initial market in 1990
was the short-run cost curve

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.210
SR1 and the demand curve of D.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:23.010
At that intersection,
the price was p1.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.500
Meanwhile, Dell,
in the short run,

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.450
had a marginal cost curve such--

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.820
now shift to the
left-hand diagram.

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:35.350
At a price of p1, Dell wants
to produce little q1 PCs--

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.940
marginal cost
equals price, right?

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.482
So find the intersection of that
price with its marginal cost

00:28:39.482 --> 00:28:40.060
curve.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:41.518
Once again, this
is very important.

00:28:41.518 --> 00:28:42.938
So stop me if I'm
going too fast.

00:28:42.938 --> 00:28:44.980
Find where the price
intersects the marginal cost

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.120
curve on the left.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.580
Dell wants to produce little q1.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:50.300
Well, what's its profits?

00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:53.030
Profits are price
minus average cost.

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:56.220
Well, its average cost
was way below that.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.180
So Dell made this huge profit
of the lightly shaded rectangle.

00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:04.660
That was its profit because
it produced little q1.

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:07.120
At little q1, average
cost was way below price.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:10.410
So it made this lighted
dot rectangle on profits.

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:11.840
Now what happens?

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:15.240
Other companies see this
and say, hey, we want in.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.100
What happens as more
companies enter a market?

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.180
The supply curve flattens.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.500
You're horizontally
summing firm supply curve.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:24.240
Supply curve flattens.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.170
As it flattens, you
move from SR1 to SR2.

00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:30.360
So now we're back on the right.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.007
In the market, as
more firms enter--

00:29:33.007 --> 00:29:35.340
and let's assume there are
more firms identical to Dell.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:37.120
That's our perfect
competition assumption,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:39.420
that each firm that enters
is sort of identical.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.130
So more firms just
like Dell enter.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:44.490
Gateway and all these
guys start entering.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.690
And you shift to
SR2, a flatter curve.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:53.530
That intersects the demand
curve at the new price p2.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:56.110
Now shift to the
left-hand diagram.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:58.810
The price facing
Dell falls to p2,

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:01.090
but their cost function
hasn't changed.

00:30:01.090 --> 00:30:02.040
They're still Dell.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.120
They're still the same
underlying technology,

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:08.220
paying the same wages
and rental rates.

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.030
So now, their marginal
cost curve is the same.

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:13.350
So at this new lower
price, their production

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:16.960
drops to little q2.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.540
Their production
drops to little q2

00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:25.430
and their profits fall to the
darkly shaded rectangle, pi 2.

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:28.200
They make less money
as firms enter.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:33.950
And this process will continue
until profits go to zero.

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:36.400
Even at pi 2, another firm--

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.090
I forget what the
third PC firm was.

00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:39.650
Some other firm will come
in and say, wait a second.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:40.942
There's still money to be made.

00:30:40.942 --> 00:30:41.780
I want to come in.

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.270
And it'll keep going
till profits go to zero.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.160
These are repeated short runs.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.420
So SR1 was a short run.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.430
Dell made a ton of money.

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.140
Then we get to the
next short run.

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:53.890
Gateway enters.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:55.390
SR2's the new short run.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:57.040
Gateway and Dell
still make money.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.335
So the third period, another
firm's going to enter.

00:30:59.335 --> 00:31:01.210
And it's going to go
till profits equal zero.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.470
Yeah?

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:06.010
AUDIENCE: Does this assume
that the manufacturers or all

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:09.247
the different companies produce
the same amount of quantity

00:31:09.247 --> 00:31:11.110
and that they're the
same quality, right?

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.960
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Yes, absolutely.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.360
I'm going to come to those--

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.277
there's a large set of
assumptions under this.

00:31:15.277 --> 00:31:18.370
But once again, think
of Dell and Gateway

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.580
selling their computers on rugs
in front of the Eiffel Tower.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.330
It's all the same.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:22.730
You just go.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:23.760
You can compare equally.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.950
They're all the same thing.

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:27.700
So it's that kind of market, OK?

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:30.700
Now let's think
about poor, old IBM.

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.050
Flip the page.

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.500
IBM dominated-- despite
Ken Olsen's claims,

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.610
IBM dominated the
big computer market.

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:43.840
And so they were initially,
on the right-hand side,

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.970
in equilibrium with
supply curve SR1.

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.560
That intersected demand-- now
we're on the mainframe market.

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:55.870
So in figure 8-1,
we're in the PC market.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:58.130
Figure 8-1 is the PC market.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.600
Figure 8-2 is the
mainframe market.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.880
The mainframe market,
they're initially

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.970
at supply curve one, which is
very flat because there's lots

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.590
of firms making mainframes.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:14.140
It intersects demand
at a price p1, OK?

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.460
Now we go to the left.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.070
Well, remember, IBM
has to produce where

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.980
its marginal cost equals price.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.586
That occurs at
production level q1.

00:32:24.586 --> 00:32:28.340
At production level of
q1, it is losing money.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:29.990
IBM is losing money.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:33.300
It is losing that
entire rectangle,

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:36.270
the entire large rectangle.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.060
Now, does IBM exit?

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.140
It can't in the short
run, but in the long run,

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.643
the next period,
some firms will exit.

00:32:44.643 --> 00:32:47.060
Some firms will say, yeah, we
lost money in the short run.

00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:47.460
We're stuck.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.470
But in the long
run, we just don't

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.700
think this is a winning game.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.703
In particular, firms with
high fixed costs will exit.

00:32:52.703 --> 00:32:54.620
They don't want to pay
those fixed costs again

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:55.680
in the second period.

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.080
They know they have to
build a new factory.

00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.205
They're not going to do it.

00:32:58.205 --> 00:32:58.900
They exit.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:32:59.558
Yeah?

00:32:59.558 --> 00:33:00.902
AUDIENCE: What
constitutes as a period?

00:33:00.902 --> 00:33:02.250
I know we said the
long run is when--

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.333
JONATHAN GRUBER: I told
you I can't tell you that.

00:33:04.333 --> 00:33:06.340
It's just some period of
time more than a month,

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.170
less than 10 years, OK?

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.270
It's the period over
which capital is variable.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.380
Think of it as a period
of time over which you can

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.210
build a new plant to make PCs.

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:14.140
Think of it that way.

00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:17.150
So it's years, OK?

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:20.660
So what happens, then, somebody
exits, says, I'm out of this.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.150
I'm shutting down the plant
and moving somewhere else.

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:26.680
That's steepens the market
supply curve because now fewer

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.660
firms are in the market.

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:30.940
As that steepens
the supply curve,

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:33.100
the new intersection
of supply and demand

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.930
is at the higher price p2.

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:38.750
IBM stayed in the market.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.450
They just built a new plant.

00:33:41.450 --> 00:33:47.720
At p2, they now
produce an amount q2.

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:52.710
And at that combination, they
are literally zero profit.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:56.480
That's the point where marginal
cost equals average cost, which

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.460
is a zero-profit point.

00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:00.500
Why is that zero profits?

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.000
It's zero profits
because, remember,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.670
profits are price
minus average cost.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:05.780
What's price?

00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:07.350
Marginal cost.

00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:11.000
So when marginal cost equals
average cost, profits are zero.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.260
You should be able to see that
from the math we did before.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.670
So what that means
is that basically,

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:20.280
when firms are losing
money, they will leave

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.883
and drive profits from
below zero toward zero.

00:34:22.883 --> 00:34:24.300
So when they're
making money, they

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.810
enter and drive profits from
above zero towards zero.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:30.750
When they're losing money,
they leave and drive

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:34.920
profits from below
zero towards zero.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.460
What does that mean?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:39.120
That means that our long-run
perfectly competitive supply

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.730
curve is in figure 8-3.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:43.820
It's flat.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.570
Long-run perfectly
competitive market supply

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:52.130
is flat at the price level.

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.980
The market long-run
supply is the point

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.989
where marginal cost
equals average cost

00:34:56.989 --> 00:35:02.230
or where supply equals
average cost, OK?

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:03.790
And why is this?

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:08.380
This is true because at
any price above that point,

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.620
if any firm tries to
charge more than $10,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.560
they'll be driven
out of business.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.230
If any firm tries
to charge below $10,

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.060
they won't make any money.

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.590
Remember before,
I said earlier--

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.300
you said, well, gee why
don't firms just-- somebody

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.883
asked, why don't firms just come
in and take the whole market?

00:35:24.883 --> 00:35:25.990
This is why.

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:27.700
Because cost is upward sloping.

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.742
You don't want to come
and take the whole market.

00:35:29.742 --> 00:35:30.855
You'll lose money.

00:35:30.855 --> 00:35:32.730
That's why firms don't
want the whole market.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.280
If marginal cost was flat, then
you would then be undefined.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.220
You would want the whole market.

00:35:36.220 --> 00:35:36.803
But you don't.

00:35:36.803 --> 00:35:38.790
Marginal cost is rising.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.850
So you never want to
produce at a price above $10

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.890
because no one
will buy from you.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.150
You never want to
set a price below $10

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:47.610
because you'll lose money.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:51.700
Therefore, supply is perfectly
elastic at a price of $10.

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.412
Yeah?

00:35:52.412 --> 00:35:54.340
AUDIENCE: Thinking about
this long-run logic

00:35:54.340 --> 00:35:56.268
then, wouldn't [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:01.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, no, no.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.900
Once again, there's a lot
of assumptions under this.

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:06.287
But under these
assumptions, you never

00:36:06.287 --> 00:36:08.370
make money in the long run
because they shut down.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.537
There are short-run periods.

00:36:09.537 --> 00:36:11.580
So let's say what happened was--

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.867
let's go back to figure 8-2.

00:36:13.867 --> 00:36:16.200
Let's say that another firm
shut down in the next period

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.420
and suddenly IBM
started making money.

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.970
What would happen?

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.930
Someone would enter and
drive profits back to zero.

00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:25.960
So under the assumptions
we've laid out here,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:27.070
profits are zero.

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:32.350
Because in the long run, we've
achieved cost minimization.

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:36.010
Firms minimize their
costs where marginal cost

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.540
equals average cost.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.700
Look at the average cost curve.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.020
Firms are producing
at the minimum.

00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.380
The minimum of average
cost is where average cost

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:47.910
equals marginal cost.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:51.483
That is, competition has
forced cost minimization.

00:36:51.483 --> 00:36:53.400
I'm just doing all sorts
of mind-blowing stuff

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:54.150
here for you guys.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:57.210
It can take hours to
recover from this.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:37:00.570
Competition forces
cost minimization.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:01.260
Why?

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.050
Because competition
forces each firm

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:06.990
to produce where price
equals marginal cost,

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:09.960
and it forces entry and
exit until marginal cost

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.950
equals average cost.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.280
Therefore, it forces
each firm to produce

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.230
at the most efficient
point, which

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:18.353
is where marginal cost
equals average cost,

00:37:18.353 --> 00:37:19.770
because that is
the point at where

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:22.260
average cost is minimized.

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.830
So under competition,
in the long run,

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:27.080
every firm is cost-minimizing.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.370
They're producing the minimum
of their average costs.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:34.550
And therefore, the
supply curve is elastic,

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:38.150
and it's defined purely by
the minimum of average costs.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:39.950
That is, if you know--

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:41.370
here's a cheat.

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.630
If you know you're in a
perfectly competitive market

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:49.442
and I give you a cost
function, then you know--

00:37:49.442 --> 00:37:51.400
I guess you still need
the demand function too.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.693
If I give a cost function
and a demand function,

00:37:54.693 --> 00:37:56.610
you know you don't need
to know how many firms

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:57.420
are going to be in the market.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.070
You don't need to know little n.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:01.685
You know, in the long run,
profits are going to be zero.

00:38:01.685 --> 00:38:03.060
So long run, firms
are just going

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.460
to produce at the
minimum of average cost.

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.460
You find that, use the
demand to find the price,

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.010
and you're done, OK?

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:16.620
So competition leads
to cost minimization.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.360
Questions about that?

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:20.390
OK.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:24.580
Now, you're all thinking,
well, wait a second.

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.220
We've got rich
parents, many of us who

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.688
make money in these businesses.

00:38:28.688 --> 00:38:29.730
I don't see zero profits.

00:38:29.730 --> 00:38:32.310
There's a stock market
that's been booming.

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.990
Where's the zero profits, buddy?

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:36.580
I don't see zero profits.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.640
Well, the answer is twofold.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.330
First of all, remember,
firms can make money

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:44.690
in the short run in this model.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.440
But that doesn't explain
the stock market.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.732
The stock market's supposed
to be forward-looking-- not

00:38:48.732 --> 00:38:50.590
months, but years and decades.

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:53.190
So firms-- really,
long run profit's zero.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:55.650
Why would stocks be expensive?

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:57.840
Why would people want to
invest in these companies?

00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:01.190
And the answer is because these
assumptions are unrealistic--

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:04.160
that this is an extreme
version of the model that

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.530
delivers some nice
intuition, but doesn't

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:07.677
apply to the real world.

00:39:07.677 --> 00:39:09.260
So I want to take
the last few minutes

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.510
to talk about the
assumptions that we've

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:13.660
made that don't really
work in the real world

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.660
to make this model work.

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:16.180
It doesn't mean the
model's invalid.

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.880
We learn a huge amount.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.430
And the key lesson
from this model

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.420
is competition pushes you
towards cost minimization.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.230
Always think about these models
as not delivering a level

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.810
truth, but a directional truth.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.870
The directional lesson is this
is why competition forces firms

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:37.400
towards cost minimization,
but firms won't actually

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.740
necessarily get to zero profits.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:43.070
And there's at least
three complications.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:45.290
The first one is limited entry.

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:54.530
I assumed that firms could
costlessly enter and exit

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:57.460
in this market.

00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:02.080
But in fact, that might be
hard because, in reality, we

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.920
have sunk costs, which I
talked about last time.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.340
We have sunk costs--
or two times ago--

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:12.780
costs which, once paid,
can never be recovered.

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:14.400
And therefore, firms
might say, look,

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.900
I don't want to get
into this market

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.983
because it's not like I
can get my fixed cost back

00:40:17.983 --> 00:40:19.540
out next period.

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.510
So if my fixed costs
are building a building,

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:24.000
next period, I can just sell
that building to someone else.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.920
But my fixed costs are
going to med school.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.990
I can't sell that
med school degree.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.150
Therefore, if doctors aren't
going to be profitable

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.608
in the long run-- there'll be
zero profit in the long run--

00:40:33.608 --> 00:40:35.200
I'm going to go be
a lawyer instead.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.270
There are sunk costs,
and those sunk costs

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.970
create what we call
barriers to entry.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.180
There are barriers to
entry that come from costs

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.570
that are sunk in the long run--

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.530
med schools.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:55.160
But there are other sorts
of barriers to entry.

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.600
Take our vendor market.

00:40:57.600 --> 00:40:59.850
Even in vendor markets,
they're not perfectly elastic.

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:00.800
One barrier to
entry could be they

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.217
could come in the middle of
the night and steal your stuff

00:41:03.217 --> 00:41:05.810
and beat you up if you
tried to enter the market.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.560
There's lots of reasons
why entry and exit is not

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:11.840
costless and easy.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.670
There's lots of
barriers to entry.

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:17.840
Once there's a barrier to
entry, this graph goes away.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.270
Because go back to figure 8-1.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:23.870
In the second
short-run equilibrium,

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:26.750
we've got these small
profits, this small, dark gray

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.270
rectangle, right?

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.880
I then told you another firm
would enter and squeeze those

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:35.637
away, but another firm
will enter only if what?

00:41:35.637 --> 00:41:37.970
Only under what-- somebody
raise their hand and tell me.

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.993
Under what condition would
that third firm enter?

00:41:41.993 --> 00:41:42.955
Yeah?

00:41:42.955 --> 00:41:44.880
AUDIENCE: Profits are
greater than zero.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.430
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, not
profits are greater than zero.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:48.630
In the model, that was true.

00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:50.658
But in reality,
what has to be true?

00:41:50.658 --> 00:41:52.200
Profits have to be
greater than what?

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.613
AUDIENCE: Sunk cost.

00:41:53.613 --> 00:41:54.780
JONATHAN GRUBER: Sunk costs.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.000
Raise your hand, people.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:56.940
I'm going to give you
credit because you

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.315
raised your hand regardless
of who yelled out the answer.

00:41:59.315 --> 00:42:00.590
I'll assume you were right.

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.560
Sunk costs.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.370
Profits have to be greater
than the barriers to entry.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:07.090
So in the short run,
you enter if profits

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.007
are greater than zero.

00:42:08.007 --> 00:42:10.530
In the long run, you
only enter if profits

00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:14.930
are greater than the barriers to
entry, which might not be true.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:18.220
There's always some
cost to starting a firm.

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.440
So profits will never
really go to zero.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.980
They'll only go down to
the barriers to entry.

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.090
So that's problem one.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:30.450
Problem two with this
model, problem two

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:32.970
is firms may differ.

00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:36.000
I've assumed-- and this
was raised in one question.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.500
I've assumed
identical firms here.

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:40.440
But in fact, firms differ.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.750
And in particular,
different firms

00:42:42.750 --> 00:42:45.740
have different cost functions.

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:47.780
And with different
cost functions,

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:52.330
you can get some firms
making long-run profits.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:58.320
So for example, let's
consider, in figure 8-4,

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.870
the long-run market
supply for cotton.

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:04.410
This is from a textbook example.

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.440
And this is from
estimates that people

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.240
have made of the minimum
average cost of producing cotton

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:14.280
by country.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.278
So in other words, this is old
now, but it doesn't matter.

00:43:17.278 --> 00:43:18.570
The country names don't matter.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:19.920
The example's what matters.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.750
In the period of time
this study was done,

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.330
the cheapest place to
produce cotton was Pakistan.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:29.230
You produce cotton in
Pakistan for $0.71 per--

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:34.200
I don't know-- kilogram,
$0.71 per kilogram, OK?

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:37.480
However, that was only
for a certain amount.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.717
At some point, Pakistan
ran out of cheap cotton

00:43:40.717 --> 00:43:42.550
and they had to start
producing cotton using

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:43.727
more expensive methods.

00:43:43.727 --> 00:43:46.060
Remember, marginal cost, at
some point, has to slope up.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.890
So the point is
marginal cost was flat

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:51.160
for a while in Pakistan,
then has to slope up.

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:55.000
And suddenly, it becomes cheaper
to produce cotton in Argentina

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.728
at $1.08.

00:43:57.728 --> 00:44:00.145
And then it becomes cheaper
to produce cotton in Australia

00:44:00.145 --> 00:44:01.070
at $1.15.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:03.408
And eventually, if the
price gets to $1.56,

00:44:03.408 --> 00:44:05.200
it's finally cheap
enough to produce cotton

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:07.410
in the United States.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:09.870
The point is these
flat segments represent

00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:12.060
the minimum average
cost in each country.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.920
It's just, instead
of making it a point,

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.712
there's an amount of
production they can do

00:44:15.712 --> 00:44:18.130
with that minimum average cost.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.270
Now, let's say world
demand for cotton

00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:24.540
was 1 billion
kilograms per year.

00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.900
Then what would happen
would be what I taught.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.970
You would have Pakistan--

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:34.230
competitors in Pakistan would
compete, driving profits down

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.610
to zero.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:39.940
And price would be
$0.71 per kilogram.

00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:42.720
Now let's say, however,
demand for cotton

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.710
is 5 billion kilograms per year.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:48.700
Well, now, that intersects
this supply curve.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.030
This is the world supply curve.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:54.570
There's the supply
curve at $1.71.

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:59.160
So now, US producers
are making zero profits

00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.690
because their
marginal cost's $1.71.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:02.250
The price is $1.71.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:05.230
But what about
producers in Pakistan?

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:07.190
They still make cotton.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:10.410
They make the first
almost 2 billion kilos.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:15.420
But they're selling at $1.71,
and it's costing them $0.71.

00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.400
So they just made profits.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.830
The point is that if there are
firms which have rising costs

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:26.150
and demand is high enough
that the high-cost firms are

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:28.090
actually producing,
that higher price means

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.010
profits for the low-cost firm.

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:30.610
Yeah?

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.503
AUDIENCE: Would this increase
the price variable in Pakistan?

00:45:34.503 --> 00:45:35.920
JONATHAN GRUBER:
You could imagine

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.410
those profits could
then have a feedback

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.300
effect in asset markets.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.850
And you could imagine the long
run, in the very, very, very

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:45.373
long run, as people
buy land, that

00:45:45.373 --> 00:45:46.540
could dissipate the profits.

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.373
That's a good point.

00:45:47.373 --> 00:45:48.730
We'll come back to that.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.400
But no, that's
very long run, OK?

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:54.298
But for now, people have
their land in Pakistan,

00:45:54.298 --> 00:45:55.840
and they're making
their money on it.

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:58.120
And so that becomes
long-run profits.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:02.380
So long-run profits can come
from heterogeneous costs.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.230
If some firms are
particularly efficient

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:09.870
in a multimarket firm,
those firms can make money.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:14.250
That's a second feature.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.800
Now, the third feature
is, in some sense,

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:23.840
the most interesting, which is
input prices may not be fixed.

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:29.230
And in fact, input
prices, input prices--

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:29.730
ah.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:42.410
Input may have an
upward-sloping supply.

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:45.277
There could be an upward-sloping
supply for inputs.

00:46:45.277 --> 00:46:47.360
We've assumed input prices
are, everywhere, fixed,

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.780
but that's not true.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.540
And in a few lectures, we'll
come and teach you about that.

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:53.900
But for now, let's
recognize that inputs may

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.770
have an upward-sloping supply.

00:46:55.770 --> 00:46:58.963
So let's go through that for a
couple minutes before we stop.

00:46:58.963 --> 00:47:00.380
Let's take a market
in figure 8-5.

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.847
This is the market for labor.

00:47:06.847 --> 00:47:08.680
Now, we've only been
doing markets for goods

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.805
so far in this course, and
I'm sort of shortcutting

00:47:10.805 --> 00:47:11.680
by jumping to here.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.540
We'll spend a lot more
time on this graph.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.770
But the bottom line is this is
a graph of the amount of labor

00:47:17.770 --> 00:47:19.300
supply to the market.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.227
In this graph, people
are now the suppliers

00:47:22.227 --> 00:47:23.560
because they're supplying labor.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.300
Firms are the demanders.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.190
They're demanding labor.

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:29.320
So what happens is you
have supply curve of labor,

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:30.862
and let's assume
it's upward sloping.

00:47:30.862 --> 00:47:33.400
What I mean by that is
as the wage goes up,

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.557
people want to work harder.

00:47:35.557 --> 00:47:37.390
You want to work harder
as the wage goes up.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.770
So it's an
upward-sloping supply.

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:41.260
It makes sense, right?

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.240
Upward-sloping supply of labor.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.560
Now let's imagine a firm
suddenly wants to produce more.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.960
They used to produce little q1.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.430
Now they want to
produce little q2.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.280
To do so, they
need more workers.

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.460
That represents a shift out
in the demand for workers.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.680
With upward-sloping
supply, what does that do?

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.720
Raises the wage.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.428
If you want more workers,
you've got to pay them more.

00:48:07.428 --> 00:48:08.470
We didn't do that before.

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.940
We assumed W was a constant.

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:13.940
But imagine if, to produce
more, you have to pay more.

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.080
What does that do?

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.900
Well, you see that
in figure 8-6.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:21.560
Now, I used to produce--
the market equilibrium used

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:28.240
to be at point E1 with n1
firms producing little q1.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.110
So that point big E1--

00:48:30.110 --> 00:48:33.020
biggie, big comma E1--

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.090
is little n1.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:40.220
There was n firms producing
little q1 units per firm.

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.120
And they were making
these profits.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.780
Their profits were where
price equaled marginal cost 1,

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:49.520
now shifting to the left.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.310
p equals marginal
cost one at little e1.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:55.110
So they were producing
where marginal cost equaled

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.730
average cost.

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.620
So little q1 at price
p1 meant that firms

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.090
producing at little e1, which
was the zero-profit point, OK?

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:07.220
Now what happens?

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.840
Now the firm wants
to produce more.

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:09.500
Demand goes up.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.790
Firm wants to produce more.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.772
It wants to produce q2.

00:49:12.772 --> 00:49:15.560
You have a new long-run
equilibrium with n2 firms

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.960
producing q2.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:21.520
Well, in that case, now
if you want to produce q2,

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.830
you're going to have
to pay a higher wage.

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.540
A higher wage means a higher
marginal average cost.

00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.370
Higher marginal
average cost means

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:34.410
that you're now producing
at a higher price

00:49:34.410 --> 00:49:36.450
and, therefore, the supply
curve slopes upward.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:40.607
Now, this is very different.

00:49:40.607 --> 00:49:41.690
One thing to think about--

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.357
I'll let you go.

00:49:42.357 --> 00:49:44.600
One last thing to think,
think about the difference

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.160
between this third case
and the other two cases.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.720
In the other two cases,
firms made profits.

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.310
In this case, firms
still don't make profits.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:55.860
So notice that
profit's still zero,

00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:58.225
but the supply curve's
upward sloping.

00:49:58.225 --> 00:49:59.850
So you don't need
positive profits have

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.630
an upward-sloping supply curve.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:02.580
So let's stop there.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.530
I've given you a
lot to think about.

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:06.330
And we will come
back and talk more

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:09.230
about this stuff on Wednesday.

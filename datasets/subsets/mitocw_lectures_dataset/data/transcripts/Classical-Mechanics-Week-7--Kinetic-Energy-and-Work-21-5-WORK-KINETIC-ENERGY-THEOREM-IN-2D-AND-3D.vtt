00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.660
We will now like to generalize
the work energy theorem

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.490
to more than one dimension.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.850
Remember that we defined
our work as an integral

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.130
from a to b of a force dot ds.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.370
And graphically
let's look at that.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.450
If we start at A and
we go to a point B, ,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.310
and if at some point on
this path we have a force F,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.640
and the displacement is
always tangent to the force

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.740
for an object M, we would like
to now figure out how this

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.100
integral is related to the
change in kinetic energy.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.610
So first off, it's
always important

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.430
when analyzing a new
result to understand where

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.230
Newton's second law comes in.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.870
And for our point particle
Newton's second law

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.750
is that the force
is equal to ma,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.930
which we can write as mass times
the derivative of the velocity.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
And so our first step is to
rewrite the work integral

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.320
and now to incorporate Newton's
second law into this integral.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.690
So this is no longer
simply a concept of physics

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.110
but it's combining the second
law and our definition of work.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.530
Now what I'd like to
do here is to note

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.460
that the displacement
of a particle

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.160
is always equal to
the velocity times dt.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:40.500
So if we put that result in
here, AB of M dv dt dot v dt,

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.539
you can see that we can cancel
dt's, which is essentially

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.450
taking the time out
of this integral

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.479
and writing the work
entirely in terms

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.910
of the small change in
velocity, dv, scalar product

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.500
with the velocity.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.220
And this is the quantity we
would now like to calculate.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.120
So one way, when we ever want
to calculate these dot products,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.050
we choose a coordinate system.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.470
So let's choose a Cartesian
coordinate system,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:17.320
plus x plus y, with our unit
vectors i-hat and j-hat.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.329
Now our task is to write
down these various vectors.

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.410
So for instance,
dv can be written

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.100
as dv x i-hat plus dv y j-hat.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.470
Now if we were to go
into three dimensions

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.780
we would have dv z
k-hat but I'm just

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.090
going to do this
in two dimensions.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:46.250
Similarly, the velocity
is vx i-hat plus vy j-hat.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.050
And now when we take
the dot product,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.490
as we've learned in
Cartesian coordinates,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.710
it's just the
components dv x vx,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.750
and I'll just do a
little parentheses there,

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.580
plus dv y vy.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.320
And so now, our
work integral, AB,

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:24.450
is equal to the mass times dv x
vx plus the mass times dv y vy.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.320
Now what we have here is to
a sum in the [? integrant. ?]

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.750
But by the rules
of integration we

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.250
can rewrite this integral as
two separate integrals from A

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:50.370
to B of M dv x vx and
from A to B of M dv y vy.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.850
And now we can integrate
each of these separately.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.530
And if you recall,
in one dimension

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.820
we used our integral formula,
this is just vx squared.

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.330
And when we integrate them
what we have to look at

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.300
is the end points
of our integral.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.590
What we're integrating
is a velocity,

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.290
and we're going from
some initial value

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.910
to some final value.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:18.980
So our first integral simply
becomes M vx final squared.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:27.570
I'll pull out the factor 2 minus
vx initial squared, where A vx

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.990
initial is the initial x
component velocity of A

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.840
in vx final is the
final component of B.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.330
And I have a similar
term here, which

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.490
is vy final squared minus
the vy initial squared.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.100
And when I combine
our terms, vx final

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.960
squared plus vy final
squared minus one-half M

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:00.280
vx initial squared plus
vy initial squared.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.016
We've already shown that
our kinetic energy, 1/2 M v

00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:13.660
dot v is 1/2 M vx
squared plus vy squared.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.110
And so we see that this is
just the final kinetic energy

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.040
minus the initial
kinetic energy.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.450
And so we can call that delta k.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.050
And what we have now is
the work energy theorem.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.600
And I'll come back to
my original statement

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:40.810
that the work is equal to
the change in kinetic energy.

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.590
And this is a combination
of our definition of work

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.171
and Newton's second law.

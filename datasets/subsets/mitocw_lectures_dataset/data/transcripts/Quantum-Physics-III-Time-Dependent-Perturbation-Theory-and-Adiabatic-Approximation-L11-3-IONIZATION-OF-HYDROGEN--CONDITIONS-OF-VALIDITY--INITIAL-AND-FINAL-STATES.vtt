WEBVTT

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.200
PROFESSOR: OK, time
for us to do one

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.660
example, a non-trivial
example, which

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.560
is the ionization of
hydrogen. It's a fun example,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.450
and let's see how it goes.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:48.310
So ionization of
hydrogen. Ionization

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.440
of hydrogen. Very good.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.110
So we're going to think
of a hydrogen atom

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.220
on its ground state
sitting there,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:09.650
and then you shine an
electromagnetic field,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.260
and if the electromagnetic
field is sufficiently strong,

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.430
the electron is going
to be kicked out

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:22.710
by interacting, typically with
the electric field of the wave.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.420
So the wave comes
in and interacts.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.470
So we usually think of
this in terms of photons.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:38.260
So we'll have a hydrogen
atom in its ground state.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:51.030
And then you have
a harmonic e field,

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.600
and the electron
could get ejected.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:05.360
So typically, you have a
photon in this incident.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.800
We think of this in terms
of electromagnetism,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.380
although our treatment
of electromagnetism

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.960
was not going to include
photons in our description.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.200
But we physically
think of a photon

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.680
that this incident on
this-- here's a proton.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.980
Here is the electron
going in circles,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.660
and the photon comes
in, a photon gamma,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.640
and it kicks the electron out.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.090
So the photon has energy e
of the photon is h bar omega.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.920
So when we think of
putting a light beam,

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.680
and we're going to
send many photos,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.930
we have to think of each
photon, what it's doing--

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.870
whether the energy is very
big, whether the energy is

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.550
very small, and how does it
affect our approximation.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.010
So half of the story of
doing such a calculation

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.610
is understanding when
it could be valid,

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.320
because we're going to
assume a series of things

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.540
in doing the calculation.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.210
And the validity
still won't turn out

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.530
to be for a rather
wide range of values.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.260
But we have to think about it.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:38.180
So a couple of quantities
you'll want to consider

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.280
is that the energy of
the electron, energy

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.480
of the electron
that is ejected is

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.890
h bar squared k of the
electron that is ejected,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.350
k squared over 2m
of the electron.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.100
And it's going to be equal
to the energy of the photon

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.470
minus the ground state energy
of the electron in the hydrogen

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.160
atom.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:18.399
So the hydrogen atom
here is energy equal 0.

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:22.450
Ground state is below 0.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.720
So if you supply some energy,
the first part of the energy

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.450
has to be to get it
to energy 0, and then

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.590
to supply kinetic energy.

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.390
So the kinetic energy is the
energy of the photon minus

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.320
what this called
the Rydberg, or Ry.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:45.640
The Rydberg is 13.6
eV with a plus sign.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.040
And that's the magnitude
of the depth of the well.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:08.780
The Rydberg is e squared over
2a0 or 2 times the Rydberg is e

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:09.800
squared over a0.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.310
That's what was calculated,
and this is actually

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:30.140
equal to h bar c the constant
alpha times h bar c over a0.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:36.080
remember, the constant alpha
was e squared over h bar c.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.620
So those are some quantities.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.120
OK.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.520
So we need the electron
to be able to go out.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.921
The energy of the photon must
be bigger than a Rydberg.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.810
OK, so conditions for
our approximation.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.120
One.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.230
We're going to be using
our harmonic variation.

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.630
We said in our
harmonic variation,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:12.170
Hamiltonian delta h was 2h
prime cosine of omega t,

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:17.630
and we want this h prime
to be simple enough.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.240
We want to think of this photon
that is coming into the atom

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.660
as a plane wave,
something that doesn't

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.110
have big spatial
dependence in the atom.

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:37.550
It hits the whole atom as
with a uniform electric field.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.860
The electric field
is changing in time.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.400
It's going up and down, but
it's the same everywhere

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.180
in the atom.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.380
So for that, we need that--

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.450
if you have a wave,
it has a wavelength,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:07.000
if you have an atom
that is this big,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.040
you would have the
different parts

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.130
of the atom are experiencing
different values

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.890
of the electric field
at the same time.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.470
On the other hand, if the
wavelength is very big,

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:25.250
the atom is experiencing the
same spatially independent

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.300
electric field at
every instant of time.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.200
It's just varying up and down,
but everywhere in the atom

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.560
is all the same.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:39.950
So what we want for this is
that lambda of the photon

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.530
be much greater than a0.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.690
So that-- 1.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.640
So this means that the photon
has to have sufficiently long

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.150
wave, and you cannot
be too energetic.

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.130
If you're too energetic,
the photon wave length

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.170
is too little.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.260
By the time it becomes
smaller than a0,

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.150
your approximation is not
going to be good enough.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.540
You're going to have to
include the spatial dependence

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:14.430
of the wave everywhere.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.110
It's going to make
it much harder.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.420
So we want to see
what that means,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.150
and in the interest of
time, I will tell you

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:29.710
with a little bit
of manipulation,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:33.760
this shows that h
omega over a Rydberg

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.809
must be much smaller than
4 pi over alpha, which

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:46.380
is about 1,772.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:50.710
So that that's a
condition for the energy.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:54.390
The energy of the photon
cannot exceed that much.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:03.950
And let's write it here.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:07.760
So that's a good exercise
for you to do it.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.220
You can see it also
in the notes just

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.230
manipulating the quantities.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:25.720
And this actually says h omega
is much less than 23 keV.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:36.650
OK, 23 keV is roughly
the energy of a photon

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.420
whose wavelength is a0.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.780
That's a nice thing to know.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:44.640
OK.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:50.670
While this photon
cannot be too energetic,

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.990
it has to be somewhat
energetic as well,

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.070
because it has to
kick out the electron.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.760
So at least, must be more
energy than a Rydberg.

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:07.410
But if it just has
a Rydberg energy,

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:11.550
it's just basically going
to take the electron out

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.650
to 0 energy, and then you're
going to have a problem.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.100
People in the hydrogen atom
compute the bound state

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.490
spectrum, and they computer
the continuous spectrum

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.440
in the hydrogen
atom, in which you

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:31.230
calculate the plane waves of the
hydrogen atom, how they look.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.690
They're not all that
simple, because they're

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:35.460
affected by the hydrogen atom.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:39.060
They're very interesting
complicated solutions

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:44.040
for approximate plane waves in
the presence of the hydrogen

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.600
atom.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.520
And we don't want
to get into that.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.440
That's complicated.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.860
We want to consider
cases where the electron,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:58.920
once it escapes the proton,
it's basically a plane wave.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:06.070
So that requires that
the energy of the photon

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.570
is not just a little bit
bigger than a Rydberg,

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.420
but it's much bigger a Rydberg.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:27.160
And saw the electron,
the free electron

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:39.350
does not feel the Coulomb
field of the proton.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:48.090
And it's really a plane wave.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:53.090
So here, it's a point
where you decide,

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.440
and let's be
conventional and say

00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.140
that 1 is much less than 10.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.600
That's what we mean
by much less 1/10.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.810
So with this
approximation, h omega

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:15.040
must be much bigger than 13.6.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:20.980
So it should be
bigger than 140 eV.

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.450
That's 10 times that.

00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:29.540
And it should be smaller,
much smaller and 23 keV,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.940
so that's 2.3 keV.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.560
So this is a range, and
we can expect our answer

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.205
to make sense.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.500
If you want to do better,
you have to work harder.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.630
You can do better.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.780
People have done this
calculation better and better.

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.450
But you have to
work much harder.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.080
I want to emphasize one
more thing that is maybe I

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.770
can leave you this an exercise.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:07.130
So whenever you have a
photon in this range,

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:12.740
you can calculate the
k of the electrode,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.210
and you can calculate how does
the k of the electron behave.

00:13:17.210 --> 00:13:21.920
And you find that k of
the electron times a0

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:31.030
is in between 13 and
3 for these numbers.

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:34.210
When the energy of the photon
is between those values,

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:38.530
you can calculate the
momentum of the electron, k

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.520
of the electron.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.120
I sometimes put an e to
remind us of the electron.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.650
But I'll erase it.

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:46.300
I think it's not necessary.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.121
And that's the range.

00:13:53.121 --> 00:13:53.620
OK.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.390
So we're preparing the grounds.

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.990
You see, this is our
typical additive.

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.870
We're given a problem,
a complicated problem,

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.120
and we take our
time to get started.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:08.290
We just think when will it
be valid, what can we do.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.980
And don't rush too much.

00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:14.590
That's not the
attitude in an exam,

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.430
but when you're thinking about
the problem in general, yes,

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.190
it is the best attitude.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.980
So let's describe what the
electric field is going to do.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.590
That's the place
where we connect now

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:37.840
to an electric
field that is going

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.520
to produce the ionization.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.540
So remember the perturbation
of the Hamiltonian,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.610
now, it's going to be the
coupling of the system

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.120
to an electric field.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.060
And this system
is our electrons.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:59.240
So it's minus the electron
times the potential, electric

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:02.120
potential, scalar potential.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:19.890
Now, needless to say,
actually, the electron

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.720
that is going to
be kicked out it's

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.450
going to be non-relativistic.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.360
That's also kind
of obvious here.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.020
You see h omega is 2.3 keV.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:33.750
You subtract 13.6 eV.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:35.590
Doesn't make any difference.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:40.560
So that's the energy of the
emitted electron roughly,

00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:48.120
and for that energy, that's much
smaller than 511 keV, which is

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.830
the rest mass of an electron.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:53.170
So that electron is going
to be non-relativistic,

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.610
which is important, too,
because we're not trying

00:15:56.610 --> 00:15:59.490
to do Dirac equation now.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:03.780
So here is our
potential, and then we'll

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:07.300
write the electric field.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:07.800
Let's see.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.440
The electric field.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.940
We will align it to the
z-axis to begin with.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:23.190
2e0 cosine omega t times z hat.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.610
These are conventions.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.540
You see, we align
it along the z-axis,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.690
and we say it has a
harmonic dependence.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.190
That's the frequency.

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:35.310
That's the frequency of the
photons that we've been talking

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:41.800
about, and the intensity, again,
for these convention preference

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.660
will put 2e0 times
cosine omega t.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:56.040
So some people say ep, which
is the peak e field is 2e0.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.230
That's our convention.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:06.220
Well, when you have an
electric field like that,

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:11.910
the electric field is
minus the gradient of phi,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:16.500
and therefore, we
can take phi to be

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:22.089
equal to minus the electric
field as a function of time,

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:23.520
times z.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:33.540
So if you take the gradient
minus the gradient,

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.500
you get the electric field.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.910
And therefore, we have
to plug it all in here.

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:53.516
So this is plus e, e
of t, z, and this is e.

00:17:53.516 --> 00:18:00.570
e of t has been given
2e0 cosine omega t.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:05.910
And z, we can write
this r cosine theta.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.730
In the usual description,
we have the z-axis

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.990
here, r, theta, and
the electric field

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:14.830
is going in the z direction.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:19.480
So z's are cosine theta.

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:23.760
So I think I have all
my constants there.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:33.580
So let's put it 2 e, e0,
r cos theta cos omega t,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.670
and this is our
perturbation that we said

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.980
it's 2h prime cosine omega t.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:45.400
That's harmonic perturbations
were defined that way.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.010
So we read the value
of h prime as this one.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.080
e e0 r cosine omega t.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.060
No, r cosine theta.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:07.950
OK.

00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:11.440
We have our h prime.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:14.490
So we have the
conditions of validity.

00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:17.580
We have our h prime.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:23.650
Two more things so that
we can really get started.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:26.110
What is our initial state?

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:28.290
The initial state
is the wave function

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:34.590
of the electron, which is 1
over square root of pi a0 cubed

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.300
e to the minus r over a0.

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:41.070
That's our initial state.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.690
What is our final state,
our momentum eigenstates

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.050
of the electron?

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:58.410
So you could call them psi,
or u sub k of the electron.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:04.230
And it would be 1
over l to the 3/2, e

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.470
to the ik of the
electron times x.

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:15.390
These are our initial
and final states.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.870
Remember, the plane waves had
to be normalized in a box.

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.060
So the box is back.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.440
u is the wave function of
the plane wave electron.

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.650
And we could use a plane
wave, because the electron

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.080
is energetic enough.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.480
And it has the box thing.

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.790
This is perfectly
well normalized.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.460
If you square it,
the exponential

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:44.330
vanishes, because
it's a pure phase,

00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.090
and you get 1 over l cubed.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.980
The box has volume l cubed.

00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:51.080
It's perfectly normalized.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:55.570
This is all ready now
for our computation.

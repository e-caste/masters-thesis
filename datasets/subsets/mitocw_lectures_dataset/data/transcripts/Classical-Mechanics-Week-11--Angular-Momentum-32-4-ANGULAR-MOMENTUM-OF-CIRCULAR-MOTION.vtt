00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.730
Well, we've been calculating
angular momentum about a point.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.480
Recall our definition
of angular momentum.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.521
We've been looking at
cases where the particle is

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:12.580
moving linearly.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.550
Now let's look at a
case where the particles

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.260
are undergoing circular motion.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.320
So suppose we have
a particle that's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.680
undergoing circular motion m.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.140
And let's choose some axes.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.860
And our particle, we
denote that it's rotating

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.870
about the vertical axis.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.130
I'm going to call
that axis k hat.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.010
And I'll make that omega
squared, omega z positive.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.910
So it's rotating about
the k-axis, the z-axis.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.700
Now, when we calculate
the angular momentum,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.330
we know because it's
rotating about the z-axis,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.030
this is our z-axis, that
the particle has a velocity

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.170
tangential to the circle.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.840
So its momentum is
tangential to the circle.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.519
And we draw our vector rs
to where the object is.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.230
Now, you could solve this
in Cartesian coordinates

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.900
but then you might have to
do some vector decomposition.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.530
But because there's a central
point to this motion, whenever

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.690
there's a central
point we like to choose

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.430
cylindrical coordinates.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.670
And the way we'll do that is
we'll define some angle theta.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.510
If this were my plus
x and my plus y-axis,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.670
then that's
consistent with k hat

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.640
being up in our
definition of omega.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.789
And I'll define an
r hat unit vector,

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.340
which is pointing radially
outward from the center

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.360
of the circle.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.570
And a theta hat vector, which
is tangent to the circle.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.830
And now I can calculate--

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.960
I can write down, say the
radius of this circle is r.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:58.170
Then l of s, the vector rs
has radius r pointing outward.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.870
And the momentum vector
is pointing tangential.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.050
And that's a very easy
cross-product to make r hat

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.669
cross theta hat.

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:12.330
That's what we're defining
to be k hat, maintaining

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.970
the cyclic order.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.180
And so, we get rp k hat.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.410
Now for circular motion
the momentum magnitude

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.960
is m, the magnitude of
the theta component.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.670
We've made that positive,
which is mr omega z.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.400
And so ls is--

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.310
There's an r here
and another r there.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.700
So we get mr squared
times omega z k hat,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.860
This is our vector omega.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.000
Now this turns out to be the
moment of inertia of a point

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.530
particle located at the center.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.329
And so we conclude that
the angular momentum

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.050
is proportional to
the angular velocity.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.770
Now, that's no surprise
in this particular case.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.490
Why?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.790
Because the vectors rs and p
are in the plane of motion.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.720
And whenever you
take a cross-product,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.230
l is perpendicular to
both of those vectors

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.900
so it's perpendicular
to the plane of motion.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.660
And therefore, l has to
point in the z direction.

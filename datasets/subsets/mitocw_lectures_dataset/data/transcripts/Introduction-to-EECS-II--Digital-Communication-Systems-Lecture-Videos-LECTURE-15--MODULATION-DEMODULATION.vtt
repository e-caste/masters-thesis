00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.460
PROFESSOR: There's quite a
bit I want to go through here.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.650
so we're going to talk
today about modulation,

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.950
which you've already
gotten some notion of,

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.920
and that's basically the task
of matching a transmitted signal

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.810
to the physical medium.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.710
And then we'll talk about
demodulation, as well.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.210
Whoops.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.210
So just to remind you of
how we got into this story,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.650
we started off
talking about bits

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.315
that we had to get across
to a receiver from a source.

00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:05.940
And we've been spending
quite some time

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.440
now focusing on this
piece of the system, which

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.020
is taking the bits,
converting them

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.570
to actual physical
samples of a voltage,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.580
for instance, and then
trying to get them

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.700
over some physical medium.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.530
And then, at the other end,
converting back to bits,

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.030
all right?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.955
So this is really a key
piece of the system.

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:27.830
If you can't get it over
the physical medium,

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.862
then you don't have anything.

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:31.820
So we've been spending
quite some time on that.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.430
We've talked about models
for signals and models

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.490
for systems, LTI
models for systems,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:38.760
all in the time domain.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.790
And then we came to the
frequency domain, which

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.980
we said will make
things a lot simpler,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.730
and actually is the way that
people think about transmission

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:50.000
on physical media, typically.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.420
OK, so the actual math.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.540
Well, we've seen--
this is just review.

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.180
We've seen that, most
recently, that you can actually

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.650
represent any signal as
a weighted combination

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.440
of exponentials, so this
was the transform domain

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.000
representation.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.380
And the weights here were given
by the discrete-time Fourier

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.010
transform.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.620
So you give me a signal,
I can find for you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.770
the discrete-time Fourier
transform, which then tells me

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.830
how to assemble complex
exponentials to get

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.660
the signal of
interest, all right?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.110
And so this Fourier
representation of the signal

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.250
is really the frequency
domain thinking.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.350
And then we saw how to apply
that actually to a system.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.620
We have an LTI system,
therefore characterized

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.630
by a frequency response.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.550
We first introduced
the frequency response

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.190
as a way of thinking about
what happens to cosines.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.920
Put a cosine in,
and you get a cosine

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.110
out that's scaled by the
magnitude of the frequency

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.790
response and with
the phase shifted

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.340
by the angle of the
frequency response.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.030
And then we went from
cosines, or in parallel we

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.780
talked about exponential
inputs, so inputs of this type.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.120
And now we have more
generally a signal

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.000
that's represented as a weighted
combination of exponentials

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.350
of that type.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.410
Out comes the same weighted
combination of exponentials,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.750
except each one is
scaled by the frequency

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.940
response as appropriate.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.440
And then comparing
that with what

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.000
we expect as a spectral
representation for the output.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.680
We get this key
relationship, which

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.550
is relating the input and
the output of a system,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.340
an LTI system, that's governed
by a frequency response.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.580
So now we're starting
to think in terms

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.520
of the spectral content of
the input, all right, which

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.770
is the frequency domain
description of the signal that

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.640
goes into the system.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.400
Then the frequency
response of the system

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.150
shaping that spectral content
to give you the spectral content

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.470
of what comes out, all right?

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.150
So this is the language
and the picture

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.620
that we have, and it's all
as simple as multiplication

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.990
once you've figured out
what the spectral content is

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.240
of the signal of interest,
once you have the frequency

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.570
response of the system.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.440
So we've got to know
how to do those pieces.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.780
And then we talked
most specifically

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.590
about a physical medium
that's close to what you're

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.560
doing in the lab, which
is the medium of, well,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.120
an acoustic channel
driven by a loudspeaker,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.690
and at the other
end are a microphone

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.290
to pick up the signal.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.740
And I showed you these
typical characteristics

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.370
of loud speakers, the kinds that
you'll find listed everywhere,

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.590
three different speakers.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.090
I mentioned last
time that, when you

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.370
look at frequency
specs for speakers,

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.930
people will typically only show
you the magnitude specification

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.350
because, for audio applications,
the phase distortions are

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.370
a little less important.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.280
They tend to not be
picked up by the ear.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.820
All of these-- let's see
they have passbands from--

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.190
this pointer's a
little weak here, but--

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.460
passbands from around 100 Hertz
to, let's say, 10 kilohertz.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.000
So in that region, they pass
signals more or less uniformly

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.040
in at least the magnitude
characteristic, and then

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.110
near the edges they taper off.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.780
And some speakers will
have bigger passbands,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.090
and will taper off closer to DC.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.880
Other speakers actually
will not pass frequencies

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.453
till you get till about, oh,
what is that, 120 Hertz or so

00:05:17.453 --> 00:05:18.870
on this characteristic,
but you've

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.500
got to get way up before you get
anything through that speaker.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.990
But nominally, we can
think of speakers,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.160
since they're aimed at
audio applications--

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.660
what?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.560
The ear here is something on the
order of, let's say, 100 Hertz

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.930
to 10 kilohertz.

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.630
OK, but the phase characteristic
is important, too.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.220
It's not important,
maybe, when you're

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.560
talking about sending
audio on a speaker,

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.960
but in Audiocom in the
lab, you're actually

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.540
sending pulses across it.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.797
You're communicating
something other than audio.

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:51.630
You're actually trying
to get a signal whose

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:52.890
particular shape matters.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.720
It's not how you hear
it, but what it looks

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.390
like before you sample it, OK?

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.210
So in settings like that,
the phase characteristic

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.610
is important, as well.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.440
Now, you haven't
explicitly probed

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.320
the frequency characteristic
of the speaker you're using.

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.300
You could do that,
but instead you've

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.977
been looking at things like step
responses in the time domain

00:06:11.977 --> 00:06:13.560
and constructing eye
diagrams, but you

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.360
could look in the
frequency domain

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.090
and characterize your particular
channel for your laptop sitting

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.590
in a particular place.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.390
You could look to see what the
magnitude and phase are like.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.320
OK, so I want to go through
this exercise of looking

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.850
at the spectral
content of a signal

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.130
you want to get across
this audio channel,

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.650
and then looking at how the
audio channel shapes it,

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.460
and then what you pick
up at the other end.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.330
So just to give you a feel for
how one thinks through this.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.100
So the input in the
typical application

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.310
you have for Audiocom you have--

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.010
let's see, if you wanted to
signal just a 1 and then all

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.780
0's.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.850
You would have 256
samples at height 1,

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.430
and then everything
from then on 0, OK?

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.370
So what I'd like to do is think
through how this pulse gets

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:10.290
across the medium, but thinking
it through in the frequency

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:11.293
domain, all right?

00:07:11.293 --> 00:07:12.960
So the first thing
we have to figure out

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.443
is, what's the spectral
content of this pulse?

00:07:16.443 --> 00:07:18.360
By the way, if we
understand it for one pulse,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.040
then we can understand
it-- then we know it

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.748
for a sequence of
pulses because if we're

00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:24.620
modeling the system as
time-invariant, once we figure

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.370
out what one pulse
does, we can figure out

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:28.080
what a later pulse will do.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.570
It's just the same response
delayed in time, OK?

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.100
So the key to it
is understanding

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.010
what happens with one pulse.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.630
So the spectral
content of the signal

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:39.180
is what we're interested in.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.030
And my question is, do
you have any guesses

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.480
as to what the spectral
content might be, just roughly,

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.040
qualitatively?

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.220
Where do you think the energy
of the signal is concentrated?

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.830
What frequency ranges?

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:55.400
Any thoughts?

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.060
I'll need a hand up and a
loud voice so I can figure out

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.560
what's--

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.636
at least one?

00:08:08.636 --> 00:08:09.564
Yeah?

00:08:09.564 --> 00:08:10.030
AUDIENCE: Low frequency.

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:11.655
PROFESSOR: Low
frequency is a good idea

00:08:11.655 --> 00:08:14.660
because, for most
of this signal,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.660
you've got essentially
nothing happening, right?

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.285
It's just flat.

00:08:17.285 --> 00:08:21.790
So you expect high
spectral content at DC.

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:25.540
But there is this
sharp transition,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.730
so you might expect high
frequencies associated

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:28.250
with that.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:31.600
So do you think it might
be low frequencies and then

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.870
high frequencies, not much
in between, or any thoughts?

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.250
OK, well, let's look
at what it actually is.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:43.140
Let's work it out.

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:54.530
So we're talking about a
signal that's at height 1.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.030
For-- let's do the general case.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:59.050
So let's say it's for
n samples, so from 0

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:04.430
to n minus 1 its height 1, and
then it's 0 outside of that,

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.930
OK?

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.570
So suppose this is x of n.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.940
How do we determine
the spectral content?

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.470
Well, we've got to write the--

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:18.070
we've got to compute
the DTFT, right?

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.550
So what's the DTFT?

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:28.510
It's a summation x m e to the
minus j omega m over all m.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:31.360
But in this case, it
simplifies, right?

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.000
Because there are only a few
non-zero values of the signal.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.770
So this is going to be--

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:37.270
let's see.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:40.720
It's going to be x0 e to
the minus j omega 0 plus x1

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.170
e the minus j
omega 1, and so on.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:47.260
That's going to be 1 plus
e to the minus j omega

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.610
plus e to the
minus j2 omega plus

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.708
e to the minus j
N minus 1 omega.

00:09:56.708 --> 00:09:57.500
So that's the DTFT.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.170
But till you work with
that and get it in a form

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.970
that you can make
sense of, you still

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.150
don't have a feel for where the
frequency content is, right?

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:09.400
You've got to--
the best way to get

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.910
at that is to think of what
the magnitude of this will be.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.590
And even then, it's
not obvious how

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:17.230
to think about the magnitude
of a sum of complex numbers

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:22.580
like this, so you've got to
play with it a little more.

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.718
OK, well, this is a
geometric series, right?

00:10:24.718 --> 00:10:26.510
Each term is obtained
from the previous one

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.990
by multiplying by to
the minus jam omega.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:32.420
And so if you've got the
sum of a finite number

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.980
of geometric series of
this type, what do we have?

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:42.790
We have that as the sum, right?

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.990
You agree?

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.350
So this was the factor by
which we multiply each term.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.850
Sorry.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.100
And we've got N such
terms, so you're summing

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.560
N terms of a geometric series.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.340
Well, we might be getting closer
here to extracting a magnitude,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.850
but you really want to do a
little bit more massaging here.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.540
Let's see.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:15.900
If I make this e to
the j omega N over 2,

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.750
then here's e to the
j omega N over 2,

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:27.810
minus e to the minus
j omega N over 2.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.642
And this is a trick we've done--

00:11:32.642 --> 00:11:33.975
we've played a few times before.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:48.600
Right?

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.290
I've just rearranged things.

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.790
Let's see.

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:53.320
How have I helped myself here?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.550
Have I helped myself at all?

00:12:00.298 --> 00:12:03.930
So what is-- what
does that simplify to?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.090
Well, the factor in front I
can write as some phase term e

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:17.370
to the minus j omega
N minus 1 over 2.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.370
And what's this?

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:21.943
Anybody?

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.260
Numerator?

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.010
Does the numerator
remind you of anything?

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.450
Sine?

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.810
Sine omega N over 2?

00:12:42.946 --> 00:12:51.280
And the denominator,
sine omega over 2, right?

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.520
So now it starts to look a
little bit more manageable.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.680
If I wanted to get
the magnitude of this,

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.420
well, the magnitude
of this is going

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:04.690
to be the magnitude of this
piece times the magnitude

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:05.750
of that piece.

00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.110
What's the magnitude
of the first term here?

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.800
Just 1, right?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.650
It's e to the j something,
so its magnitude is 1.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:16.690
So here's the
magnitude of the DTFT,

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.160
so that's the spectral
characteristic,

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.406
and that's something
that we can plot.

00:13:21.406 --> 00:13:22.380
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:24.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.850
Sorry.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.686
Question, hi.

00:13:25.686 --> 00:13:28.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:28.552 --> 00:13:29.260
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:29.890
Say that again?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:37.680
PROFESSOR: Did I make a
mistake somewhere here, or?

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.440
Oh, this thing?

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.910
This term here?

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.550
I was trying to combine
numerator and denominator here.

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.623
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:45.623 --> 00:13:46.540
PROFESSOR: Which part?

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.200
Sorry.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.700
I have to stand
where you are to see

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:51.648
if I made a mistake because
it's hard to see close up.

00:13:51.648 --> 00:13:56.151
AUDIENCE: Over the-- like,
when we go from the 1 minus e

00:13:56.151 --> 00:13:58.870
to the minus 2 again
to the other one,

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:00.870
why are we dividing by two?

00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:06.410
PROFESSOR: Oh, what are we-- oh.

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:07.480
Why are we dividing by 2?

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.270
Because when you multiply it
out, that's what it takes.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:14.980
I'm trying to group things to
get something interpretable.

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:17.260
I don't know what
this is, but I know

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.390
what the numerator
over sine looks

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.960
like, so I'm trying to
make this a little bit more

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.610
equally distributed, right?

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.920
So if I pull out that
factor, what's left?

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.180
Looks like part of a sine.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.680
OK?

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.140
So I'm just-- so it's
this time this gives me

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.790
the numerator here.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.710
And this times this gives
me the denominator here.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.080
So it's just rearranging terms.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.510
We've used this trick before.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.427
Any trick that works
twice is a method, OK?

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:46.760
So we really have a method here.

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.660
It's not just a trick.

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.160
If it works three times, you
can make a religion of it.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.920
OK, so that's the
derivation we have here.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.720
What's the height of
this at the origin?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.010
Let's just focus on that term.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.800
OK, so this is the magnitude
we're talking about.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.920
What's the height at the
origin, at omega equals 0?

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:24.870
Well, now you can use
L'Hopital's rule, right?

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.630
Because omega is something
that varies continuously.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.520
So for small values of
the argument, you're

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:33.810
really looking at something
of height N. And then,

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.410
when is the first time
that this goes to 0?

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.330
Well, for small
values of frequency,

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:43.680
the numerator is
not changing sign,

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.740
and this first
goes to 0 when you

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:52.003
get to omega equals 2 pi
over N, to private capital N.

00:15:52.003 --> 00:15:53.670
So actually, instead
of saying all that,

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:55.045
I should just draw
you a picture.

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.160
There's a picture of
one particular case.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.055
So this is a case where,
actually, the pulse

00:16:03.055 --> 00:16:04.190
didn't start at 0.

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:07.750
It was symmetrically
located around 0, OK?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:13.550
It was a pulse of length 11
symmetrically located around 0.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.460
And because it was
symmetrically located,

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.640
this phase factor went away,
and all you're left with

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.310
is the sine omega N over 2
divided by sine omega over 2.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.770
So you're looking at the actual
DTFT of a pulse of that type,

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:32.270
OK?

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:36.960
So this started at minus
5 and went to plus 5,

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:41.600
and was 11 samples long and was
0 everywhere outside of that.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.240
So that's what
this function looks

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:51.753
like, the sine omega N over 2
divided by sine omega over 2.

00:16:51.753 --> 00:16:53.920
Does it remind you of a
function you've seen before?

00:16:57.565 --> 00:16:58.065
Sinc?

00:16:58.065 --> 00:16:59.910
A sinc function?

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.410
It's very close to a sinc.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.859
The sinc, though, had just
frequency in the denominator.

00:17:03.859 --> 00:17:07.020
It didn't have sine of
something in the denominator.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:10.380
And the reason this
appears is, remember

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:14.910
that transforms and
frequency responses

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.710
have to be periodic
with period 2 pi.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.829
So it certainly
wouldn't be possible

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.960
for the transform of
a signal to be a sinc

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.172
because there's no
periodicity in the sinc.

00:17:24.172 --> 00:17:25.630
But when you work
it out carefully,

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:28.170
you find that it's
something close to a sinc,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.330
but one that has exactly
the right periodicity,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.030
so this thing will
repeat periodically

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.470
with period 2 pi, exactly
the way it's supposed to.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:38.240
So it's sort of sinc-like.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.460
For small values
of omega, the sine

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.590
is essentially
just omega over 2,

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:45.450
and it is essentially a sinc.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.550
But when you get to
larger values of omega,

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:50.215
this thing starts
to play a role.

00:17:50.215 --> 00:17:51.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:51.990
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.692
Sorry?

00:17:52.692 --> 00:17:54.780
AUDIENCE: Does the
magnitude mean anything?

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.197
PROFESSOR: I haven't-- I'm not
plotting the magnitude now.

00:17:57.197 --> 00:17:59.290
I was plotting the actual
DTFT for this case.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.150
So in this symmetric
case, the actual DTFT

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:10.570
is the sine N omega over
2 over sine omega over 2.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:13.050
So I was plotting
the actual DTFT.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:18.930
And the magnitude of the
DTFT I get just by taking

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:21.173
absolute value, right?

00:18:21.173 --> 00:18:24.213
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:24.213 --> 00:18:26.630
PROFESSOR: Well, I did this
for a case of a pulse starting

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.850
at time 0, OK?

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.430
So this factor came
purely from where I

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.510
located this on the time axis.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:35.960
So different positions of
this pulse on the time axis

00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:39.590
will modify this factor but
won't touch this factor, OK?

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.690
Shifts in time correspond
to multiplication by e

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.360
to the minus j omega
something, right?

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.310
You've seen that in recitation.

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.680
So whenever you shift
the pulse in time,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:52.010
what it does to the transform
is it leaves this part intact

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.450
and affects this
factor, but that

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.840
doesn't change the magnitude
of the transform, OK?

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.740
So in the case of a
symmetrical pulse,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.950
symmetrical about
the origin, actually

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.950
that phase factor goes away,
and the actual transform

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.210
is just that piece without
the e to the anything.

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:06.710
Sorry.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.000
I jumped over a few
steps in describing that.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.140
Just to go back a second.

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.150
This is not a sinc
function, but it's actually

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.420
referred to as a periodic sinc.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:21.800
It's got a fancier name, also.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.160
It crops up all over the place.

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.240
Height N at the origin
and the first zero

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:33.610
crossing at 2 pi over cap N.
So as you make the pulse wider

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.480
in time, you make it
narrower in frequency, right?

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:42.610
As N becomes larger, you
make this wider in time.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:45.970
The main lobe of this
frequency distribution

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.770
gets more concentrated,
and frequency gets

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.540
closer to being a DC signal.

00:19:49.540 --> 00:19:50.350
Makes sense, right?

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.600
The longer that
this stays constant,

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.480
the more the signal looks
like just DC and the more

00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:00.130
the frequency is
concentrated at the origin.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.760
But what you can see
here is there's actually

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.100
a full spread of frequencies.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.970
It's not that there's just low
frequency for the flat parts

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:11.710
and high frequency
for the vertical edge

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:12.668
and nothing in between.

00:20:12.668 --> 00:20:16.840
There's actually a full
spread of frequency components

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.610
that it takes to
make up that step.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.030
OK.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:26.410
If you had a pulse
that wasn't centered--

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:28.420
this is just to show you.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:31.470
Here is a pulse-- actually,
this is not centered.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.260
It's only 10 long, but
the magnitude here you're

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.740
only seeing half the
frequency scale, so 0 to pi

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.630
essentially, except
this is in terms

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:43.830
of f, which is omega over 2 pi.

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:46.020
You get the same kind of
magnitude characteristic,

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:48.060
but now because you've
shifted it off-center,

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.700
you've got a linear-phase
characteristic,

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.880
and what you're seeing here is
a linear-phase characteristic,

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.970
except every time you
have a flip in sign,

00:20:56.970 --> 00:20:59.220
you jump the phase by
180 degrees, right?

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.440
When you change the
sign of something

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:04.440
from a plus to a minus,
that's like adding 180 degrees

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.980
to the phase or subtracting
180 degrees to the phase.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:10.120
So you can spend time on all
of this and make sense of it.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.540
But the basic idea is that you
get the sinc-like distribution

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.520
and frequency.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.010
OK, so let's get back to
the particular pulse that's

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:25.650
of interest to us,
which is that pulse.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:29.230
So it's the same kind of
thing, except N is 256.

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:31.110
And what I've
plotted for you here

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:35.070
is the magnitude of the DTFT.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.400
It has the sinc-like shape.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.470
I haven't actually plotted it as
a continuous function of omega.

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:42.058
Instead, I've used the FFT.

00:21:42.058 --> 00:21:42.600
You remember?

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.770
We talked about the
Fast Fourier Transform.

00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:50.330
So what the fast Fourier
transform is going to do

00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:57.120
is, if the actual magnitude
DTFT was some continuous thing

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.760
like this, the fast
Fourier transform

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.900
is going to give me samples
of it, as many as I want.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.900
But the more samples
I ask for, the more

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:10.420
work I have to
do, of course, OK?

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.598
I asked for 48,000
samples of the DTFT

00:22:14.598 --> 00:22:16.390
so that I could get a
nice big spread here.

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.690
If your samples came from
sampling at 48 kilohertz,

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:29.530
for instance, then
the rightmost end

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:33.250
that corresponds to pi in
terms of actual frequency

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.740
would correspond to the
sampling frequency divided by 2,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.410
so that's 24 kilohertz
sitting there.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.580
So I actually have 24,000
points for 24,000 Hertz,

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.640
so I've got one point
at every Hertz position,

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.232
but I could pick anything else.

00:22:48.232 --> 00:22:49.690
The other thing I
wanted to mention

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.270
was that the reason
I could do this

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.430
is because I'm using the FFT.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.790
Because I told you
if I just did sort

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:01.430
of simple-minded
implementation of the formula,

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.610
I would take order p
squared computations,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:07.240
where p is the length of the
signal that I'm looking at.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.375
If I use the FFT, I
go from p squared to--

00:23:14.045 --> 00:23:19.270
I go down to p log to the
base 2 of p, all right?

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.080
Well, the number of points
I have here is 48,000,

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:29.530
so going from p to log 2 p is
going from 48,000 to 16, which

00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:31.670
is a factor of 3,000.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:33.670
So the difference is I'm
sitting at the terminal

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.540
and I hit the Return
key to get the FFT,

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.180
and maybe at 0.1
seconds later, I

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:42.700
get the answer,
versus if I didn't

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.395
use the FFT I'd
wait five minutes,

00:23:44.395 --> 00:23:46.270
and then I wouldn't be
trying to put together

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:48.970
these figures for you.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:52.860
OK, so the FFT really makes
a real practical difference,

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:58.690
and it really revolutionized
how numerical computations

00:23:58.690 --> 00:23:59.830
were done.

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:03.735
OK, so here you now see the
full spectral distribution

00:24:03.735 --> 00:24:05.110
if you're willing
to let your eye

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:07.135
interpolate between these
samples that I've got.

00:24:07.135 --> 00:24:10.240
You see the full
spectral distribution

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.220
of that rectangular pulse, OK?

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:14.890
So a short pulse in time.

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.530
It's got certainly
high DC content,

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:21.040
but it's got tremendous
frequency distribution, all

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.420
the way out to high frequencies.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:23.753
In fact, all the way to the end.

00:24:23.753 --> 00:24:26.560
You're still seeing
frequency content.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.070
It's visible to the eye.

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:30.040
So all the way out
to 24,000 Hertz,

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.010
and you could keep
going all right?

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.810
This is not a sinc.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.600
It's a sinc-like function
because if you extended it,

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.190
it would go back up again.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.520
It's got that period, 2
pi, exactly as it should.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.260
But for all intents
and purposes,

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.450
for small values of frequency,
the sine omega over 2 here--

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:50.890
this is essentially
omega over 2,

00:24:50.890 --> 00:24:53.665
and this is a
sinc-like function, OK?

00:24:53.665 --> 00:24:55.665
Now, this is different
from what you saw before.

00:24:55.665 --> 00:25:02.000
Before you had a constant
segment and frequency.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.750
At least, I think it's
different from what

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.125
you've seen before,
unless you've

00:25:05.125 --> 00:25:06.360
done examples in recitation.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.060
But before what we
had was, for instance,

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:14.720
trying to get a
frequency response that

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:19.430
was like this, right?

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:23.150
We ended up with a unit
sample response that

00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:24.980
was a sinc function in time.

00:25:28.103 --> 00:25:29.270
This is going the other way.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:32.610
This is a rectangular
function in time,

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.270
giving rise to a sinc-like
distribution in frequency.

00:25:39.734 --> 00:25:43.210
All right.

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:47.740
Let's zoom in a little bit
just to see what we have here.

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.310
And this is exactly what
we expect to be seeing,

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:51.660
the sinc-like distribution.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:54.030
The height there is
256, as it should be.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:56.910
That's the N. And then
this should be at 2 pi

00:25:56.910 --> 00:25:59.910
over capital N. If you
translate that to what it means

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:05.370
in actual frequency, this first
null there is at 187.5 Hertz.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:09.140
That's 48 kilohertz
divided by N, so that's--

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.200
OK, so that's that number.

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.200
So that gives you some
idea of how this thing is

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.550
spread in frequency.

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:31.840
OK, so if this pulse is applied
directly to the loudspeaker--

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.450
well, here, the
loudspeaker passband

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.890
goes from about 100 Hertz
to, let's say, 10,000 Hertz.

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.460
You see there's huge
amounts of the energy that's

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.180
not in the passband
of the loudspeaker.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:46.680
All right?

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.470
So this is not going to do very
well if you just directly apply

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:51.990
that pulse to the loudspeaker.

00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.073
You have to match the
frequency content of the input

00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:57.990
to the frequency response
of the system you're

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.540
trying to get this over.

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.040
OK.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:06.950
Now, just as an
experiment before we

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.890
get back to sending this
across a loudspeaker,

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:12.560
let's take a look
at what happens

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:17.392
if we send that rectangular
pulse over a lowpass channel.

00:27:17.392 --> 00:27:19.100
So let's save the
bandpass channel, which

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.610
is a little more
involved, for later,

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.720
and just look at
what happens if we

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.120
send this pulse over
a lowpass channel.

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:33.710
So I'm thinking about a
channel whose frequency

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.450
characteristic--

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.320
this is h of omega--

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.120
it passes low
frequencies, and then it

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.321
truncates higher frequencies.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.900
OK?

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.200
And what I'm going to
do is send in an x of N,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.440
which is this pulse in time.

00:27:54.440 --> 00:28:00.410
256 at height 1, and
then everything 0.

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.430
All right, so if I'm thinking
of it in the frequency domain,

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.097
then I take the spectral content
of the signal, which we've just

00:28:10.097 --> 00:28:13.990
worked out, and multiplied
by the frequency response

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:17.470
characteristic, which
just basically selects out

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.600
the frequency content
that's in the passband

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.550
and rejects everything else.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.460
And then that gives me the
spectral content of the output,

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.820
and I can translate
that back to what

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.060
happens in the time domain.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.160
So here is-- well, actually,
let's take a zoomed-in version.

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:39.040
I've taken a lowpass filter,
where this cutoff corresponds

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.960
to actually a
cutoff at 400 Hertz

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.740
if you're thinking in terms
of the underlying waveform.

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.850
So what we've done is take
the rectangular pulse,

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.230
put it through a
lowpass filter--

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:53.020
and I'm assuming an
ideal lowpass filter--

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.860
passes everything in this
frequency band and nothing

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:59.680
outside of it, OK?

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.780
So here again, we see
we're selecting out

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.640
part of the spectral
structure of the input,

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:06.010
but there's huge
amounts of the energy

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.410
of the input that
are being left out

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.450
of the output of the filter.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.400
Now, in the time domain, look
at what this corresponds to.

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.790
It's an approximation
to this pulse,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:21.132
but it's one in which all the
high-frequency content has

00:29:21.132 --> 00:29:23.590
disappeared because we've only
let the low-frequency pieces

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:24.250
through.

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:28.450
So what you have is a very
rounded kind of pulse.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:34.450
It spreads out well over the 256
mark, so here's the 0 to 256,

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.200
but this thing actually spills
over into adjacent bit slots.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.850
We've taken out the
high-frequency components,

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:43.370
so it can't make any
sharp turns anymore.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.900
It's got this
lower-frequency wiggling.

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.040
As you can imagine, if I
made this even smaller,

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.520
my wiggling would become
even more leisurely here,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.767
and I would spill further into
the adjacent bit slots, OK?

00:29:57.767 --> 00:29:59.350
So this is what
lowpass filtering will

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:03.810
do to that rectangular pulse.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:05.880
Any questions on this piece?

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:09.310
OK.

00:30:13.672 --> 00:30:15.630
Now, we've actually seen
examples of this type.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.140
I flashed these up last time.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:21.230
It's the same idea, except it
was not just a single pulse.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:23.838
It was a succession
of pulses like this.

00:30:23.838 --> 00:30:25.130
So you could do the same thing.

00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:27.500
Have a succession
of pulses like this.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:31.520
Take its DTFT to assess
the spectral content.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.520
I'm showing you not actually the
DTFT but something proportional

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:35.180
to it here.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.690
This is-- so ignore
the labels there.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.550
Think of this as
essentially the DTFT.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:43.770
To within the
scale factor it is.

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:47.120
So you can see that I
have spectral content

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.210
all the way out to the edges.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:52.310
But now send it through
a lowpass channel

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.040
which zeros out all
the spectral content

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.415
outside of some central
region, and what

00:30:57.415 --> 00:30:58.790
you have coming
out the other end

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:01.560
is something that can't take
the sharp turns anymore,

00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.410
so it's much more rounded.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:05.330
And as you narrow it
down still further,

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:08.870
you get even more rounding,
and you get a spilling over.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:12.170
You see this sharply confined
rectangular pulse now spills

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:15.500
over into the adjacent slots.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.600
And you can go still
further on that.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.880
The top plot here is the
same as the bottom plot

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.560
in the previous one.

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.270
But this is just
showing the sequence.

00:31:23.270 --> 00:31:27.350
So as you narrow it down
further and further and further,

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.990
what comes out
the other end gets

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:34.400
much less distinctive
in its features, OK?

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.370
It can only-- this only has
very low-frequency content,

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:39.380
so it can't do any sharp turns.

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.010
And this is an eye
diagram corresponding to--

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.140
in each of these
received signals-- just

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.113
to show you how
detection gets difficult

00:31:48.113 --> 00:31:50.030
if you've got a lowpass
channel and you've got

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:54.050
this pulse that's
not well-defined.

00:31:54.050 --> 00:31:56.240
Now, how might you actually--

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.520
how might you get a
better-defined pulse

00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.580
for a given channel?

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.020
So if I gave you this channel--

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.685
we sent in this pulse
of length 256 samples,

00:32:06.685 --> 00:32:08.810
and we got something that
we didn't like because it

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:12.057
spilled over into other slots.

00:32:12.057 --> 00:32:13.640
The reason it spilled
into other slots

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:17.480
is we were cutting out too
much of its spectral content.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:22.540
What could you do to this
pulse to get more of its energy

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.890
across that bandpass channel?

00:32:27.243 --> 00:32:28.180
Yeah?

00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:28.680
Sorry?

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.120
AUDIENCE: Set a longer pulse.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.698
PROFESSOR: Set a longer pulse.

00:32:31.698 --> 00:32:32.490
How does that work?

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:34.440
Now, you see, if
you make N longer,

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.680
you make the pulse longer, you
shrink this correspondingly

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.270
in the frequency domain, right?

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:47.120
We said that on these
sinc-type characteristics,

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.890
the height was N.
This first null was

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:53.550
2 pi over N. Make
the pulse longer,

00:32:53.550 --> 00:32:56.430
you pull the main lobe in
tighter, and more of this

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.780
is going to go through, OK?

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.630
And you can see that clearly.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:03.160
That's something you can
explore in your experiment.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:06.630
So if you wanted to get
more clearly defined

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:11.703
output for a given
lowpass channel,

00:33:11.703 --> 00:33:13.870
you might want to increase
the length of your pulse.

00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.245
Of course, that's going to
slow down your signaling rate,

00:33:16.245 --> 00:33:18.090
so there's a trade-off
involved, right?

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.680
Now, we've actually--
this is just

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.190
to sort of step back and point
out that what we're seeing here

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:35.510
are some properties that are
inherent to Fourier transforms,

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:36.010
OK?

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.310
So it's typically the
case that if you've

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:42.155
got a signal that's wide in
time, it's narrow in frequency.

00:33:42.155 --> 00:33:43.530
And if you make
it wider in time,

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:45.670
it gets narrower in frequency.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.630
In fact, as I mentioned
up there, the uncertainty

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.150
principle in physics really
comes from this result.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:59.130
It says that the spread in time
times the spread in frequency

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:00.330
has some lower bound, OK?

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.270
So this is some number
that's strictly positive.

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.260
So you can't make a signal
arbitrarily concentrated

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:10.020
in time and concentrated
in frequency.

00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.550
If you make one
small, the other one

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:13.438
will have to grow
correspondingly.

00:34:13.438 --> 00:34:15.480
So actually, the uncertainty
principle in physics

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.040
is precisely a theorem
in Fourier transforms

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.350
if you study it.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:25.260
Here is another such
complementarity or duality.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.500
The smoother you make a
signal in time, the more sharp

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:30.590
it is in frequency.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:31.090
Let's see.

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.840
We saw that here,
for instance, right?

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.840
We had a signal in time,
namely the unit sample

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.150
response of the ideal filter.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.050
This was-- this didn't
have any sharp edges to it.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:44.820
It was a sinc function.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.219
You got something
that's smooth in time,

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:51.313
it ends up having sharp
edges in frequency, OK?

00:34:51.313 --> 00:34:52.980
And the more smooth
you make it in time,

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.313
the sharper it
gets in frequency.

00:34:56.313 --> 00:34:57.480
And this we've already seen.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.030
This is the kind of trade-off
we're talking about.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.280
So these are characteristics
to be on the lookout for.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:07.310
In fact, I just did a
little experiment here.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.090
What if we decided not to try
and send a rectangular pulse

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.000
over, but we smoothed out
the pulse a little bit

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.200
to get rid of that sharp edge?

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.630
So that's another way
that you can try and get

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:25.735
a pulse over a lowpass
channel like this.

00:35:25.735 --> 00:35:27.110
So you see, what
I'm trying to do

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:30.740
is not have the sharp
discontinuities, the 0 to 1

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.000
and the 1 to 0.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:35.460
I want a more rounded
behavior in the time domain

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:39.950
so I get a sharper concentration
in the frequency domain,

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:41.850
and you can actually
see how that works.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:54.180
So what I've actually done here
is, instead of a signal that--

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.770
well, if you'll
permit me, I don't

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:59.010
want to draw these stem
plots, the lollipop figures,

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.000
because they get painful
to draw, but just assume

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:05.460
that this is 256 such things.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.220
That's the rectangular pulse
we were trying to send before.

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.320
What I've done now
is instead say,

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.880
well, let me around
the edges, so I'm

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:17.160
going to have a half cycle of
a cosine for that edge, OK?

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:18.870
So that's what--
these are the samples

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.760
I'm going to use at
this edge, and I'm

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:23.640
going to have a half-cycle
of a cosine at this edge.

00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.820
This is actually something
that's used quite a bit

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.898
in applications.

00:36:28.898 --> 00:36:30.190
All right, so what have I done?

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.690
I've removed the
sharp edge and gotten

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:35.860
a much-rounded transition.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:39.330
In fact, if you're thinking
of continuous functions,

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:41.610
the original had
a discontinuity,

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.920
whereas here I've got to
take two derivatives before I

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.430
encounter a discontinuity
because the function itself

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:49.943
and its slope at these
ends are well-matched,

00:36:49.943 --> 00:36:51.360
so I've got to
differentiate twice

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.630
before I get a discontinuity.

00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:56.160
So actually, it has quite
some smoothness to it.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:58.980
Smooth in time means
more tightly concentrated

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.000
in frequency.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.050
So all I'm doing
on the next slide

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:08.440
is showing you, so
your eye can compare,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.160
what the spectral content
is of the original pulse

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.438
and of this rounded pulse.

00:37:13.438 --> 00:37:14.980
And for the rounded
pulse, I actually

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.810
just flipped it over so that
you can compare more easily.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.250
So this is the negative
of the DTFT magnitude

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:23.140
of the shaped pulse.

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:25.690
And you can sort of
see right away here

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:29.000
that the frequency content
has essentially settled out.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.230
It's almost all contained
in this smaller region,

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.590
whereas the
rectangular pulse had

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:37.160
a frequency content that went
way off to high frequencies,

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:37.660
right?

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:42.250
Went off to 24 kilohertz,
for instance, in our example.

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.065
So the frequency content
of the shaped pulse

00:37:45.065 --> 00:37:46.690
is much more tightly
contained, and you

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:48.398
have a much better
chance of getting that

00:37:48.398 --> 00:37:50.480
across a lowpass channel.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.470
So this is just a
little bit of shaping

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.570
that can make a big
difference in terms

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.480
of adapting the signal you're
trying to send to the channel.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.020
So if I look in the time
domain, sending these two

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:05.740
pulses over the same
lowpass channel,

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.780
you can do a visual
comparison of what comes out.

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:13.300
So here's the original 256
rectangular pulse coming out

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.950
the other end.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:17.770
Here is my shaped pulse
coming out the other end.

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:20.980
And you can see the shaped pulse
is much more tightly confined

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.600
in the bit slot that
I assigned to it,

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.420
so it's much more
tightly confined

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.040
around the 256-sample width, OK?

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.697
So this is another
thing that is done,

00:38:32.697 --> 00:38:34.780
and it's done by thinking
in the frequency domain.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.360
People designed
these pulses thinking

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360
in the frequency domain.

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.250
They're not doing convolution.

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.160
OK, that was all
lowpass, but we want

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:49.075
to look at bandpass, so just a
couple of quick examples there.

00:38:49.075 --> 00:38:50.325
So we're back to the speakers.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:56.460
And we're taking our
rectangular pulse

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.590
and applying it to the speaker.

00:38:58.590 --> 00:39:02.630
So here's what the spectrum
looks like after ideal bandpass

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:03.130
filtering.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:04.590
So I'm not actually
filtering with the speaker

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.550
characteristic.

00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.860
I'm assuming an
ideal bandpass that

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.650
extends from 100
Hertz to 10,000 Hertz

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:13.450
and zeros out everything
outside that range.

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.950
So I send in the
spectral characteristic

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.890
of my rectangular pulse.

00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:20.880
I shape it with the bandpass.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.680
So what comes out is
something that has

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:23.982
this spectral characteristic.

00:39:23.982 --> 00:39:26.190
And you can see that the
frequency content is sharply

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:32.400
limited 10 kilohertz
above 0, and then there

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:35.010
is actually a central region
that's entirely missing.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:39.820
So remember, this had to
go originally up to 256,

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:42.780
but because we've chopped
out the center portion,

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.410
we're only going out to
150-something out there.

00:39:46.410 --> 00:39:47.910
So actually, if I
zoom in, you can

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:50.500
see that a lot more closely.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.920
So this is a zoomed-in
version of what

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.340
comes out from a loudspeaker,
from a bandpass filter,

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:00.830
if I send in a
rectangular pulse.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.512
The very low frequencies
are entirely missing,

00:40:03.512 --> 00:40:05.220
and we saw in the
previous characteristic

00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:08.260
that the very high frequencies
are missing, as well.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:12.750
So what's the shape of the
pulse that you get out?

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:15.630
Not very good.

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.370
Because the low
frequencies are missing,

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.620
this thing tends to
sag in the middle.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:23.160
It can't hold up DC.

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.680
And it can't make the very
sharp transitions, either,

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.550
so there is a more
leisurely transition.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.060
But again, this can't
stay at that level.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.040
It actually asymptotes.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:37.530
So the actual pulse occupies--
before it settles, occupies way

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:41.760
over the 256 bits that
I've allotted to it, OK?

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.310
So taking that rectangular
pulse and directly putting it

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:48.090
on the speaker is going to
give you something not pretty

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:52.270
at the other end and something
that you cannot signal with.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:58.140
So the question is what
to do about that, OK?

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:02.552
And the answer to that is this
thing that we call modulation.

00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:04.260
We've already seen it
in different forms.

00:41:08.198 --> 00:41:10.240
Let's think about it now
in the frequency domain.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:18.130
OK, so here's what
we're going to do.

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.400
Want the big stick of chalk.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:19.900
OK.

00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:29.717
We're going to shape the
spectral characteristics

00:41:29.717 --> 00:41:30.300
of the signal.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:34.600
We started off with some
time-domain signal links, x N,

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.920
corresponding DTFT x omega.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.010
It wasn't well-matched to
our channel characteristics,

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.600
and so what we're
going to do is multiply

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.260
by some carrier frequency.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.150
And this is simple
amplitude modulation.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.790
We're just referring to
it as modulation here.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:06.740
We get some signal out here.

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:15.720
And the question is, what is
the frequency characteristic

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.226
of that signal?

00:42:17.226 --> 00:42:18.990
OK, we've already seen
what the frequency

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:21.355
characteristic of the input is.

00:42:21.355 --> 00:42:23.480
What's the frequency
characteristic of that signal?

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:40.260
So just to give you an
example, we had our x of omega

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:43.800
looking something
like the sinc shape.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.570
Remember height N there?

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.180
And the question is, what's
the spectrum of this?

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.980
And there's a
computation up there

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:03.560
that I don't want to go
through, but it shows you

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.510
that the answer is
actually quite simple.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.120
So if I call this--

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.567
let me call this t
of N because it's

00:43:11.567 --> 00:43:13.025
the signal we're
going to transmit.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.510
Here's what the spectrum of the
transmitted signal looks like.

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:27.870
There is omega.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:29.430
There's pi.

00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:30.560
Here's omega c.

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:37.800
OK, so the
prescription is simple.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.430
Take the spectral characteristic
and replicate it at omega c

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:46.640
and replicate it at minus
omega c, and scale by 1/2.

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:52.310
So what you're going to get
is this characteristic here,

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:57.680
this characteristic here, and
the height will be N over 2.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.580
It's that simple.

00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:00.347
So you can go through the math.

00:44:00.347 --> 00:44:02.180
When you're done with
the math, what it says

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:04.310
is that the spectral
characteristic

00:44:04.310 --> 00:44:09.260
of this modulated signal is
the spectral characteristic

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:13.550
of the envelope of the baseband
signal, or the envelope,

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:17.642
but translated to the
position of the carrier.

00:44:17.642 --> 00:44:19.100
So you can begin
to see how this is

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.980
going to help us shift
a signal to get it

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:23.323
across a bandpass channel.

00:44:23.323 --> 00:44:24.740
We started off
with something that

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:28.370
was not well-suited to the
loudspeaker we now have a way

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.740
to shift its energy
to get it right

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.170
in the passband of the
speaker by picking the carrier

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.830
frequency appropriately.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:35.330
All right?

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:44.370
I think I'm going to
skip some of this.

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:47.060
But let's look at
what this does.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.560
It's really this
picture, but I just

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.520
want to show you how it
works with actual waveforms.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:57.650
So here is the rectangular
pulse times the cosine.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:59.270
I've picked-- what did I pick?

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:01.120
1 kilohertz as my carrier?

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:02.210
Yeah.

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:04.280
1,000 Hertz was the carrier.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:07.400
1,000 Hertz sits comfortably
in the passband of a speaker,

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.780
so it's a reasonable choice.

00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:13.480
By the way, in typical AM,
the carrier frequencies

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.458
are much higher
than-- or the ratio

00:45:15.458 --> 00:45:17.500
of the carrier frequency
to the rate of variation

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.387
of the envelope is
much higher than what

00:45:20.387 --> 00:45:21.470
we have in these examples.

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:25.060
So the audio channel is
actually very challenging.

00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:28.060
OK, so this is my
modulated signal.

00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:31.130
The question is, what does
its spectrum look like?

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:34.660
So I run it through
the FFT, and indeed I

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.470
get the replication here.

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.970
Let's zoom in a
little bit so we can

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.178
see it a little more closely.

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:49.390
So what I have is those
two sinc-like spectral

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:53.440
characteristics, but translated
to sit centered at 1,000

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.240
Hertz and minus 1,000 Hertz.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.270
Remember that this
is 0 out here, OK?

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.770
And the height,
well, it's now it's

00:45:59.770 --> 00:46:02.980
128, which is half the
256 that I had before.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.720
So in terms of positioning
this within where

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.680
the loudspeaker
will transmit it,

00:46:18.680 --> 00:46:20.935
we were taking the lower
cutoff of the loudspeaker

00:46:20.935 --> 00:46:22.900
as being around 100 Hertz.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.920
This is where 100 Hertz sits.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.350
So you can see
that a huge amount

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.730
of the energy of the
pulse is getting through.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.980
It's at the wrong frequencies.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.300
We'll have to deal
with getting it back.

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:36.300
But at least getting the energy
across is working here, OK?

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.927
And the upper cutoff of the
speaker is way off over here.

00:46:38.927 --> 00:46:40.510
So this is 10,000,
but I'm showing you

00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:45.520
a zoomed-in version, so the
upper frequency is way off.

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.650
In fact, that also
brings up the idea

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.830
that you could actually do
this trick multiple times.

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.470
You could actually pick another
carrier frequency somewhat

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.517
higher than this with some
other modulating signal on it

00:46:56.517 --> 00:46:57.850
and tuck that in there, as well.

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.790
So you could simultaneously
transmit messages

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.190
on multiple carriers
through that same speaker,

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:05.210
and you'll be exploring
that, as well.

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.710
OK.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.960
So what does the-- what's
the time-domain signal that

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:13.490
corresponds to this looks like?

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:17.650
So when you get it, you
impress this modulated signal

00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:20.830
on the loudspeaker, on
this bandpass filter.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:23.760
What's the output of
the bandpass filter?

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:28.390
You can see it's almost
exactly what you put in, OK?

00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:30.300
There's a little
bit of distortion

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:34.290
at the different places,
but it's basically exactly

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:36.000
the pulse that you put in.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.340
So almost all the
energy has gone through,

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.280
and you don't have
significant distortion

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.200
because you've squarely
placed the energy

00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:44.580
in the passband of the filter.

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:47.880
OK, now how do we recover?

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:52.470
How do we get back the
original baseband signal?

00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:56.970
Well, it turns out
it's very easy.

00:47:56.970 --> 00:47:59.800
Let me actually
do it in pictures,

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:03.030
and then we'll look at the math.

00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:05.940
This is what's coming
in to our receiver,

00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:10.140
and now we've got to process
this to get back a signal that

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:12.850
has this spectrum.

00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:15.010
We've learned a trick,
which is modulation.

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.680
Multiply it by a cosine,
and you'll take the spectrum

00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.257
and replicate it at omega
c and at minus omega c.

00:48:22.257 --> 00:48:23.840
I'm going to use the
same trick again.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:27.130
I'm going to take the
received signal multiplied

00:48:27.130 --> 00:48:30.010
by a cosine of the
same carrier frequency,

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.300
and what's that going to do?

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:37.500
Well, my scale is getting
bigger here each time.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.180
So here's my omega c.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.640
Here's my minus omega c.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.520
What's coming in is this signal.

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.890
I'm going to multiply it
by cosine omega c, so what

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:54.510
does that do in the spectrum?

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.770
It takes this spectrum,
replicates it at omega c.

00:48:58.770 --> 00:48:59.890
So what does that do?

00:48:59.890 --> 00:49:05.330
Well, it puts a piece here,
and it puts a piece here,

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:08.580
at 2 omega c, right?

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:11.612
Because I've taken
this spectrum--

00:49:11.612 --> 00:49:13.320
you've got to imagine
the change of scale

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.760
so I can draw all of this.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.320
I've taken this
spectrum and I've

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:19.800
placed it centered on omega c.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:21.270
And this is now--

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:22.845
this is the N over 2 here.

00:49:22.845 --> 00:49:24.720
Oh, but now it's going
to be N over 4, right?

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.140
Because I divide by 2.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:30.840
And then I take
the same spectrum

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.630
and I center it
on minus omega c.

00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:37.440
OK, so I've got
the N over 4 piece

00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:41.250
here, but I'm going
to have the other--

00:49:41.250 --> 00:49:43.080
oh, sorry.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:45.610
I drew it in the wrong place.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:47.520
I'm going to center
it at omega c.

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:52.590
So this is going to end
up at minus 2 omega c.

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.280
And the replication here.

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:58.380
So there's going to be a second
one sitting here at the origin.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:01.190
So the net effect
at the origin is

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:10.460
that I get the original
spectrum, but scaled by a half,

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.360
and then I get vestiges
of this, if you like,

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:18.188
centered at twice the
carrier frequency, OK?

00:50:18.188 --> 00:50:19.980
And that's actually
what the algebra shows.

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.290
The algebra is very simple.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:24.700
You're receiving this.

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.720
Multiply it again by a cosine.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.870
So take the received signal and
multiply it again by a cosine.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:33.290
Well, if you substitute for
what the received signal is,

00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:36.380
you get x n times
cosine squared.

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:39.110
Cosine squared, if you
use a standard identity,

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:40.595
splits into these two terms.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:43.640
Let's see.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.610
Do I have that right?

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:46.250
Yeah.

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:52.100
So here's the 0.5 x n
sitting here at the origin,

00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:57.210
and here's another term,
which is x n times the cosine.

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:59.420
So this is like a
modulated signal,

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:03.030
but modulated by twice
the carrier frequency.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:05.060
So what does this translate to?

00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:10.730
Well, it's actually 0.5 times
x n times cosine 2 omega c.

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:12.890
What does that do in
the spectral domain?

00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:16.190
It's going to take half of
that and place it at minus 2

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:18.410
omega c and plus 2 omega
c, so it's completely

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:20.310
consistent with this picture.

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.310
So what is it that we
have to do now to extract

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:23.268
the signal of interest?

00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:28.920
Just a lowpass
filtering here, OK?

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.850
So if you can select out this
piece with a lowpass filter,

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.800
you've recovered the
signal of interest.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:36.570
You can adjust the
scale factor, too,

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.470
so you can have a lowpass
filter with a gain of 2

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:41.320
and you've recovered
your original signal.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.410
All right, we'll
build on Monday.

00:51:43.410 --> 00:51:46.380
And that'll be the last
lecture on this material.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.150
Relative to the calendar,
we're just sliding forward,

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:51.210
so we'll wrap up
this stuff on Monday

00:51:51.210 --> 00:51:54.830
and then continue with packets.

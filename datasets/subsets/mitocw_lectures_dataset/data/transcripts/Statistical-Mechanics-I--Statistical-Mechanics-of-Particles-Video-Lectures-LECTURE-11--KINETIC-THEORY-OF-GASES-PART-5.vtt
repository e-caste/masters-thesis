00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.300
Let's start.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.460
So let's review what
we've been trying

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.980
to do in the past few lectures.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.710
It's to understand a typical
situation involving something

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.130
like a gas, which,
let's say, initially

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.770
is in one half of the container.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.020
And then expands until it
occupies the entire container,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.070
going from one equilibrium state
to another equilibrium state.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.570
Question is, how
to describe this

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.050
from the perspective of
microscopic degrees of freedom,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.130
getting the idea
that eventually you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.950
will come to some
form of equilibrium.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.320
And actually, more seriously,
quantifying the process

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.040
and timescales by which the
gas comes to equilibrium.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.560
So the first stage was to
say that we will describe

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.500
the process by looking at
the density, which describes

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.640
the number of representative
examples of the system, whose

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.540
collections of
coordinates and momenta

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.710
occupy a particular point in
the 6N-dimensional phase space.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:42.210
So basically, this is a function
that depends on 6N coordinates.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.300
And of course, it changes
as a function of time.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.340
And we saw that,
basically, if we

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.980
were to look at how
this set of points

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.400
were streaming in
phase space, and this

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.100
can be mathematically
represented

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.350
by looking at the
direct time dependence

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.560
and the implicit time
dependence of all

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.010
of the coordinates captured
through the Poisson bracket.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.950
And the answer was that
it is a characteristic

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.710
of the type of Hamiltonian
evolution equations,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.590
that the flow is such that
the phase space does not

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.810
change volume.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.460
And hence, this quantity is 0.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.230
We said, OK, all
of that is fine.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.040
But what does that tell me
about how this gas is expanding?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.990
So for that, we
said that we need

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.590
to look at descriptions that
are more appropriate to thinking

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.310
about the volume and
density of a gas expanding.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.770
And we really want
to capture that

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.200
through the
one-particle density.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.380
But along the way, we
introduced s particle densities,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.980
normalized up to something,
to correspond to, essentially,

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.810
integrating over all
of the coordinates

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.190
that we're not interested in.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.270
Say coordinates pertaining
to numbers s plus 1 to N,

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.850
corresponding
6N-dimensional phase

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.470
space and the entire [INAUDIBLE]
of this density or probability.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.460
Then the next stage was to
be more specific about what

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.230
governs the evolution of
these gas particles, i.e.,

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.160
what is the Hamiltonian.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.590
And we said, let's focus on
an N particle Hamiltonian that

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.570
is composed, by
necessity certainly,

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.740
of one-body terms that
is the kinetic energy

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.320
and the potential energy, the
latter describing the box,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.880
for example.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.580
And we added a
two-particle interaction.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.780
qi minus qj, which, for
the sake of simplicity,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.280
let's imagine is
spherically symmetric--

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.790
only depends on the relative
position of these particles.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.019
Then we say that if I
look at the evolution

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.490
of this s particle
density, I start

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.140
by writing an equation
that kind of looks

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.910
like the full
Liouville equation.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.830
There is a Hamiltonian that
describes this set of particles

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.820
interacting among themselves,
just replacing n by s.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.080
And so if these were the only
particles in the universe,

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.030
this is what I would get.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.900
Except that we know that
there are other particles.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.940
And since we have two-body
collisions possible,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.880
any one of the particles in the
set that I'm describing here,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.790
composed of s particles,
can potentially

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.450
collide with a
particle from this set

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.420
that I don't want to include.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.900
And that will change the
volume of phase space.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.290
This incompressibility
condition was valid

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.770
only if the entire thing of
the Hamiltonian was considered.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.060
Here, I'm only looking
at the partial subset.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.040
And so then what
did I have here?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.870
I had the force exerted
from particle s plus 1

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:39.600
on particle n changing the
momentum of the particle n.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.680
But the likelihood
that this happens

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.010
depends on finding the
other particle also.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:56.910
So I had this dependence on
the density that was s plus 1.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.490
So this was the BBGKY hierarchy.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.830
Then we said, let's take a
look at the typical value

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.050
of the terms that we
have in this equation.

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:15.640
And for s that is larger
than 2, this Hamiltonian

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.270
that pertains to
s particles will

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.300
have a collision term
among the particles.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.130
And that collision term will
give you some typical inverse

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.080
timescale here, which is
related to the collision time.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.320
Whereas on the right-hand
side, for this collision

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.430
to take place, you have
to find another particle

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.670
to interact with in the
range of interactions

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.700
that we indicated by d.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.450
And for density n,
this was smaller

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:53.850
by a factor of nd
cubed for dilute gases.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.680
Therefore, the left-hand
side is much larger

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.290
than the right-hand side.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.250
And within particular
approximation,

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.500
we said that we are going
to approximately set

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.470
this right-hand side to 0.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.490
OK?

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:12.730
Except that we couldn't
do this for the equation

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:20.990
that pertained to s equals to
1, because for s equals to 1,

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:24.620
I did not have the
analog of this term.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:30.940
If I were to write the precise
form of this Poisson bracket,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.730
I had the partial
derivative with respect

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:41.110
to time, the momentum
divided by mass,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:45.460
which is the velocity driving
the change in coordinate.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.350
And the force that comes
from the external potential,

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.490
let's call it f1, we
arrive in the change

00:07:51.490 --> 00:08:03.360
in momentum of the one-particle
density, which is a function--

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:10.410
let's write it explicitly--
of p1, q1, and t.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:16.720
And on the other side,
I had the possibility

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.100
to have a term such
as this that describes

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.280
a collision with
a second particle.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.840
I have to look at all
possible second particles

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.750
that I can collide with.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:36.182
They could come with
all variety of momenta,

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.679
which we will indicate p2.

00:08:38.679 --> 00:08:41.049
They can be all over the place.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.600
So I have integrations
over space.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.700
And then I have
a bunch of terms.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:53.440
So for this, we said, let's
take a slightly better look

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.400
at the kind of collisions
that are implicitly described

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:04.010
via the term that we
would have here as f2.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.890
And since the right-hand side
of f2 we set to 0, essentially,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.260
f2 really describes
the Newtonian evolution

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.580
of two particles coming
together and having a collision.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.160
And this collision,
I can-- really,

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:23.630
the way that I
have it over there

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:27.510
is in what I would
call a lab frame.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:30.010
And the perspective
that we should have

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.850
is that in this frame,
I have a particle that

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.800
is coming with
momentum, let's say,

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.920
p1, which is the one
that I have specified

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:44.240
on the left-hand
side of the equation.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.240
That's the density
that I'm following

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.260
in the channel
represented by p1.

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:55.660
But then along comes a
particle with momentum p2.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.340
And there is some
place where they

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.880
hit each other, after which
this one goes off with p1 prime.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.970
Actually, let me call
it p1 double prime.

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:11.980
And this one goes off
with p2 double prime.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.470
Now, we will find it
useful to also look

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.000
at the same thing in the
center of mass frame.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:34.120
Now, in the center of
mass frame-- oops--

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:44.050
my particle p1 is coming
with a momentum that

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:50.930
is shifted by the p
of center of mass,

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.360
which is really
p1 plus p2 over 2.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.720
So this is p1 minus p2 over 2.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.180
And my particle number two
comes with p2 minus center

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:08.950
of mass, which is
p2 minus p1 over 2.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:10.280
So they're minus each other.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.780
So in the center
of mass frame, they

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:16.270
are basically coming to each
other along the same line.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:21.330
So we could define one of
the axes of coordinates

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:24.280
as the distance along
which they are approaching.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.720
And let's say we put
the center of mass

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:30.690
at the origin,
which means that I

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.740
have two more
directions to work with.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:39.660
So essentially, the coordinates
of this second particle

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:48.230
can be described
through a vector b,

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:52.380
which we call the
impact parameter.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.290
And really, what
happens to the collision

00:11:55.290 --> 00:12:01.460
is classically determined by
how close they approach together

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.580
to make that.

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.650
To quantify that, we really
need this impact vector.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.060
So b equals to 0, they are
coming at each other head on.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.730
For a different b, they
are coming at some angle.

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.560
So really, I need
to put here a d2b.

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:27.690
Now, once I have specified the
form of the interaction that

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:32.730
is taking place when the
two things come together,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.960
then the process is
completely deterministic.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.670
Particle number one will come.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:43.960
And after the location at
which you have the interaction,

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:52.610
will go off with p1 double
prime minus center of mass.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.210
And particle number
two will come and get

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.865
deflected to p2 prime minus--
or double prime minus p

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:03.650
center of mass.

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.150
OK?

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:13.760
And again, it is important
to note that this parameter

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:19.560
A is irrelevant to the
collision, in that once I have

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:28.890
stated that before
collision, I have a momentum,

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:32.530
say, p1 and p2.

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:40.490
And this impact
parameter b is specified,

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:45.850
then p1 double prime
is known completely

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:48.810
as a function of p1, p2, and b.

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.600
And p2 double prime
is known completely

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:59.710
as a function of p1, p2, and b.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:05.030
And everything in that
sense is well-defined.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:10.320
So really, this parameter
A is not relevant.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.820
And it's really the
B that is important.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:19.260
But ultimately, we also need
to get these other terms,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.700
something that has the
appropriate dimensions

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.550
of inverse time.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.500
And if I have a density
of particles coming

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.520
hitting a target, how
frequently they hit

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.050
depends on the product
of the density as well

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:37.810
as the velocity.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.070
So really, I have to
add here a term that

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:44.100
is related to the velocity
with which these things are

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.630
approaching each other.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:51.030
And so I can write it either
as v2 minus v1, or p2 minus 1

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.690
over m.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.940
So that's the other thing
that I have to look at.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:07.510
And then, essentially,
what we saw

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.390
last time is that the
rest of the story-- if you

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.920
sort of think of these
as billiard balls,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.450
so that the collision is
instantaneous and takes place

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.690
at a well-specified
point, instantaneously,

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.910
at some location, you're
going with some momentum,

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:27.110
and then turn and go
with some other momentum.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:31.430
So the channel that was
carrying in momentum p1, which

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:35.240
is the one that we are
interested in, suddenly

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.766
gets depleted by an
amount that is related

00:15:39.766 --> 00:15:44.880
to the probability of having
simultaneously particles

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.580
of momenta p1 and p2.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:59.460
And the locations that I
have to specify here-- well,

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.360
again, I'm really
following this channel.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.790
And in this channel,
I have specified q1.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:12.110
And suddenly, I see that
at the moment of collision,

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:15.710
the momentum changes, if you are
thinking about billiard balls.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.050
So really, it is
at that location

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.720
that I'm interested
for particle one.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.050
For particle two, I'm
interested at something

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.580
that is, let's say, q1
plus, because it depends

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:32.150
on the location of particle
two shifted from particle one

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:35.230
by an amount that is
related by b and whatever

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.190
this amount slightly
of A is that is related

00:16:38.190 --> 00:16:41.531
to the size of
your billiard ball.

00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:42.030
OK?

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:52.550
Now, we said that there is a
corresponding addition, which

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:58.580
comes from the fact that it
is possible suddenly to not

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.140
have a particle moving
along, say, this direction.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:07.240
And the collision of
these two particles

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.740
created something
along that direction.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.119
So the same way
that probabilities

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.010
can be subtracted
amongst some channels,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:18.569
they can be added to
channels, because collision

00:17:18.569 --> 00:17:21.589
of two particles
created something.

00:17:21.589 --> 00:17:28.900
And so I will indicate
that by p1 prime, p2 prime,

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:34.140
again, coordinates in
t, something like this.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:38.950
So basically, I try to be a
little bit more careful here,

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:43.200
not calling these
outgoing channels p prime,

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.970
but p double prime.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.860
Because really, if
I were to invert

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:51.260
p1 double prime and
p2 double prime,

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.690
I will generate things
that are going backward.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.320
So there's a couple of
sign issues involved.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.220
But essentially, there
is a similar function

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.780
that relates p1
prime and p2 prime.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.900
It is, basically, you
have to search out

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:13.390
momenta whose outcome
will create particles

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:15.550
in the channels
prescribed by p1 and p2.

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.920
So as we said, up
to here, we have

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:26.240
done a variety of
approximations.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:30.130
They're kind of
physically reasonable.

00:18:30.130 --> 00:18:33.280
There is some difficulty
here in specifying

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.680
if I want to be very accurate
where the locations of q1

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:43.440
and q2 are within
this interaction size

00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:45.760
d that I am looking at.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.870
And if I don't think about
billiard balls, where

00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:51.810
the interactions are not
quite instantaneous where

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:56.470
you change momenta, but
particles that are deformable,

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.250
there is also certainly
a certain amount of time

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:01.710
where the potential is acting.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.530
And so exactly what time
you are looking at here

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.413
is also not appropriate--
is not completely, no.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.620
But if you sort of make all
of those things precise,

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:20.430
then my statement is
that this equation still

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:25.290
respects the reversibility
of the equations of motions

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.550
that we had initially.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:30.110
But at this stage, we
say, well, what can

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.950
I do with this equation?

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:34.750
I really want to
solve an equation that

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:40.320
involves f of p1, q1, and t.

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:42.310
So the best that
I can do is, first

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:46.300
of all, simplify all
of the arguments here

00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.330
to be more or less
at the same location.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:52.210
I don't want to think about
one particle being shifted

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.100
by an amount that is related
by b plus something that

00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.390
is related to the interaction
potential size, et cetera.

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:06.020
Let's sort of change our focus,
so that our picture size,

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.790
essentially, is
something that is

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:12.050
of the order of the
size of the interaction.

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.910
And also, our
resolution in time is

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.630
shifted, so that we don't
really ask about moments of time

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:21.770
slightly before and
after collision,

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:26.480
where the particle, let's say,
could be deformed or whatever.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.180
So having done that, we
make these approximations

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:33.780
that, essentially,
all of these f2's,

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:37.910
we are going to replace
as a product of f1's

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.540
evaluated all at
the same location--

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:44.600
the location that
is specified here,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.950
as well as the same time, the
time that is specified there.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:21:15.490
So this becomes-- OK?

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:20.120
So essentially, the
result of the collisions

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:27.790
is described on the left-hand
side of our equation

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:34.740
by a term that integrates over
all momenta and overall impact

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:39.840
parameters of a bracket,
which is a product of two

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.100
one-particle densities.

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:46.080
And just to simplify
notation, I will call this

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:51.460
the collision term that
involves two factors of f1.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.780
So that's just a
shorthand for that.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.280
Yes.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.516
AUDIENCE: Is that
process equivalent

00:21:57.516 --> 00:22:01.250
of a similar
molecule [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:03.600
PROFESSOR: That, if you
want to give it a name, yes.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.670
It's called the assumption
of molecular chaos.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:16.480
And physically, it
is the assumption

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:20.200
that the probability to
find the two particles

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.500
is the product of
one-particle probabilities.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.110
And again, we say
that you have to worry

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.460
about the accuracy
of that if you

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:34.530
want to focus on sizes that are
smaller than the interaction

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.010
parameter size.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:38.500
But we change that as
part of our resolution.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.073
So we don't worry
about that aspect.

00:22:41.073 --> 00:22:44.572
AUDIENCE: So molecular
chaos doesn't

00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:49.009
include eliminating this space?

00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:50.488
It's a separate thing.

00:22:53.848 --> 00:23:00.090
PROFESSOR: I've only seen the
word "molecular chaos" applied

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.710
in this context.

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.440
I think you are
asking whether or not

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:07.490
if q1 and q2 are different.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.060
I can replace that and
call that molecular chaos.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.680
I would say that that's
actually a correct statement.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.760
It's not an assumption.

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.730
Basically, when
the two particles

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:22.640
are away from each other
to a good approximation,

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.910
they don't really know
about-- well, actually,

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:29.370
what I am saying is if I
really want to sort of focus

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:32.305
on time dependence, maybe
that is also an assumption.

00:23:32.305 --> 00:23:33.730
Yes.

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:38.290
So they're really, if you
like, indeed, two parts.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:42.230
It is the replacing of f2
with the product of two

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:48.010
f2's, and then evaluating
them at the same point.

00:23:48.010 --> 00:23:48.510
Yes.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.690
AUDIENCE: But based on
your first line-- I mean,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:55.140
you could break that assumption
of different distribution

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.254
functions have different events
that occur when they get close,

00:23:58.254 --> 00:23:59.795
and the framework
still works, right?

00:23:59.795 --> 00:24:03.090
It would just become-- when you
got down to the bottom line,

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:06.900
it would just become a much
larger equation, right?

00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:08.150
PROFESSOR: I don't understand.

00:24:08.150 --> 00:24:10.316
AUDIENCE: Like if you assume
different interactions.

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:16.640
PROFESSOR: The
interactions are here

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.160
in how p1 prime and p2
prime depend on p1 and p2.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:21.146
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:24:21.146 --> 00:24:23.653
What I'm suggesting
is if you change H

00:24:23.653 --> 00:24:26.650
by keeping the top [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.340
That's a pretty simple
H. Would this framework

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.799
work for a more complicated H.
But then your bottom two lines

00:24:32.799 --> 00:24:33.840
would become [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.820
PROFESSOR: What
more can I do here?

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.225
How can I make
this more general?

00:24:38.225 --> 00:24:39.600
Are you thinking
about adding it?

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:40.503
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:24:40.503 --> 00:24:42.336
I'm not suggesting you
make it more general.

00:24:42.336 --> 00:24:44.590
I'm suggesting you make
it more specific to break

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:49.130
that assumption of
molecular chaos.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.150
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:52.850
So how should I modify
if I'm not saying--

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:55.174
AUDIENCE: I didn't
have something in mind.

00:24:55.174 --> 00:24:57.058
I was just suggesting
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:57.058 --> 00:24:59.540
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
where I have problem,

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.930
because it seems to me
that this is very general.

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:05.890
The only thing that I
left out is the body

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:10.400
interactions may be having to
do with this being spherically

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.450
symmetric.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.130
But apart from that, this
is basically as general

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:16.380
as you can get with two bodies.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.430
Now, the part that is
pertaining to three bodies,

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:24.000
again, you would basically--
not need to worry about as long

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.970
as nd cubed is less than 1.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:32.515
So I don't quite know
what you have in mind.

00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:34.393
AUDIENCE: I guess I was
thinking about three-

00:25:34.393 --> 00:25:35.538
and four-body interactions.

00:25:35.538 --> 00:25:38.490
But if you're covered against
that, then what I said,

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:41.830
it's not valid or relevant.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:42.680
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.970
So certainly, three-body
and higher body interactions

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.220
would be important
if you're thinking

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.790
about writing a description
for a liquid, for example.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:57.440
And then the story
becomes more complicated.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.550
You can't really
make the truncations

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.620
that would give you
the Boltzmann equation.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.070
You need to go by some
other set of approximations,

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.160
such as the Vlasov
equation, that you

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.710
will see in the problem set.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:15.610
And the actual theory that
one can write down for liquids

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.510
is very complicated.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:20.150
So it's-- yeah.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.122
AUDIENCE: Can it get
more complicated yet

00:26:22.122 --> 00:26:24.581
if, based on the same
framework, isn't this similar

00:26:24.581 --> 00:26:26.975
to, like, the formulation
of the neutron transport

00:26:26.975 --> 00:26:30.570
equation, where if you have,
in addition to scattering,

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:32.460
you have particles
that don't attract,

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:35.573
but you have fission events
and you have inelastic center?

00:26:35.573 --> 00:26:36.156
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:36.156 --> 00:26:36.230
Yes.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.530
That's good.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.630
AUDIENCE: And then your H would
change dramatically, right?

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.440
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:39.726
That's right.

00:26:39.726 --> 00:26:39.870
Yes.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:41.860
AUDIENCE: But my point is
that it's the same framework.

00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:42.420
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:42.919
Yes.

00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:44.320
So basically, you're right.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.650
One assumption that I have here
is that the number of particles

00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.320
is conserved.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:53.010
We say that if the particles
can break or diffuse,

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:56.850
one has to generalize
this approximation.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:27:00.330
And there would be an
appropriate generalization

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.470
of the Boltzmann equation
to cover those terms.

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:11.040
And I don't have a problem
set related to that,

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.900
but maybe you are suggesting
that I should provide one.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.400
OK.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.260
That's a good point.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:22.190
OK?

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:25.270
All right.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.510
So we have made some
assumptions here.

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:34.090
And I guess my claim is
that this equation-- well,

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.670
what equation?

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.880
So basically, what
I'm going to do,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.630
I call the right-hand
side of this equation

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:46.090
after this assumption
of molecular chaos, CFF.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:52.070
For simplicity, let me call
this bunch of first derivatives

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:56.380
that act on f1 L
for Liouvillian.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:58.680
It's kind of like a
Liouville operator.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:04.010
So I have an equation that is
the bunch of first derivatives

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:07.880
acting on f1, which
is essentially

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:12.700
a linear partial differential
equation in six or seven

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.770
dimensions, depending on
how you count time-- is

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:21.890
equal to a non-linear integral
on the right-hand side.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:23.190
OK?

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.370
So this is the entity that
is the Boltzmann equation.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:48.710
Now, the statement is that
this equation no longer

00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:51.220
has time reversal symmetry.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:56.420
And so if I were to solve this
equation for the one function

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.030
that I'm interested, after all,
the f1, which really tells me

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:03.740
how the particles stream from
the left-hand side of the box

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:06.480
to the right-hand
side of the box,

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.820
that equation is not reversible.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.480
That is, the solution
to this equation

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.840
will indeed take
the density that

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.940
was on the left-hand
side of the box

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:23.450
and uniformly distribute it
on the two sides of the box.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.780
And that will stay forever.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.450
That's, of course, a consequence
of the various approximations

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.140
that we made here,
removing the reversibility.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:34.810
OK?

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:37.820
And the statement to
show that mathematically

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.280
is that if there is a function--
and now, for simplicity,

00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:45.750
since from now on, we don't
care about f2, f3, et cetera,

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:51.250
we are only caring about f1,
I'm going to drop the index one

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.980
and say that if there is a
density f, which is really

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:02.760
my f1, that satisfies
the Boltzmann-- that is,

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:10.610
I have a form such as this--
then there is a quantity H that

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:15.620
only depends on time that,
under the evolution that

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:22.490
is implicit in this Boltzmann
equation will always decrease,

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:29.030
where H is an integral
over the coordinates

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:39.060
and momenta that are in this
function f of p, q, and t.

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:43.250
And all I need to do is
to multiply by the log.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.220
And then all of these
are vectors if I drop it

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.480
for saving time.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.350
And we said that
once we recognize

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.660
that f, up to a
normalization, is

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:01.060
the same thing as the
one-particle probability--

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:04.440
and having previously
seen objects such as this

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.990
in probability
theory corresponding

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.470
to entropy information,
entropy of mixing,

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:15.590
you will not be surprised at
how this expression came about.

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:19.370
And I had told you that in
each one of the four sections,

00:31:19.370 --> 00:31:23.700
we will introduce some quantity
that plays the role of entropy.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.680
So this is the one that is
appropriate to our section

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.880
on kinetic theory.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.949
So let's see how we go about--

00:31:30.949 --> 00:31:31.740
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:32.460
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.862
AUDIENCE: When you introduced
the-- initialized the concept

00:31:35.862 --> 00:31:40.722
of entropy of information
of the message that's

00:31:40.722 --> 00:31:42.666
p log p, [INAUDIBLE] entropy.

00:31:42.666 --> 00:31:44.620
And as far as I
understand, this concept

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.630
came up in, like, mid 20th
century at least, right?

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.450
PROFESSOR: I think
slightly later than that.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:51.550
Of that order, yes.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:52.522
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:52.522 --> 00:31:54.813
And these are
Boltzmann equations?

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:55.438
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:31:55.438 --> 00:31:58.578
AUDIENCE: And so this was, like,
100 years before, at least?

00:31:58.578 --> 00:32:00.911
PROFESSOR: Not 100 years, but
maybe 60 years away, yeah.

00:32:00.911 --> 00:32:01.411
50, 60.

00:32:01.411 --> 00:32:04.131
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:04.131 --> 00:32:07.562
I'm just interested, what is
the motivation for picking

00:32:07.562 --> 00:32:12.128
this form of functionality,
that it's integral of f log f

00:32:12.128 --> 00:32:14.190
rather than integral
of something else?

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.950
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.845
I mean, there is another
place that you've seen it,

00:32:17.845 --> 00:32:22.210
that has nothing to
do with information.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.460
And that's mixing entropy.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.550
If I have [? n ?] one
particles of one type

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:29.910
and two particles of
another type, et cetera,

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:33.130
and mixed them up, then
the mixing entropy,

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:36.780
you can relate to a
form such as this.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:39.050
It is some ni log ni.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:43.870
OK?

00:32:47.826 --> 00:32:48.325
Fine.

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:54.770
It's just for
discrete variables,

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.500
it makes much more sense
than for the continuum.

00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.370
But OK.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:05.060
So let's see if this
is indeed the case.

00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:10.550
So we say that dH
by dt is the-- I

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:15.330
have to take the time
derivative inside.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:19.450
And as we discussed
before, the full derivative

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:23.210
becomes a partial derivative
inside the integral.

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:28.060
And I have either
acting on f and acting

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.720
on log f, which will
give me 1 over f,

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.110
canceling the f outside.

00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:38.660
And this term corresponded
to the derivative

00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:41.760
of the normalization,
which is fixed.

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:49.215
And then we had to replace
what we have for df by dt.

00:33:51.850 --> 00:34:00.466
And for df by dt, we either
have the Poisson bracket

00:34:00.466 --> 00:34:06.790
of the one-particle Hamiltonian
with f coming from the L

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:12.000
part of the equation, once
we get d by dt on one side.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.980
And then the collision part
that depends on two f's.

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.250
And we have to
multiply this by f.

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:24.920
And again, let's remind you that
f really has argument-- oops,

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:29.940
log f-- that has argument p1.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.500
I won't write q1 and t.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.580
And the next thing that we
did at the end of last lecture

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:46.889
is that typically, when you have
integral of a Poisson bracket

00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:50.670
by doing some combination
of integrations by part,

00:34:50.670 --> 00:34:56.360
you can even eventually show
that this contribution is 0.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.510
And really, the important
thing is the integration

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:04.640
against the collision term
of the Boltzmann equation.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:09.510
So writing that explicitly,
what do we have?

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.290
We have that it is
integral d cubed.

00:35:13.290 --> 00:35:17.060
Let's say q1.

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:20.290
Again, I don't
really need to keep

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:24.090
track of the index on
this dummy variable.

00:35:24.090 --> 00:35:26.290
I have the integral over q1.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.860
I have the two integral over p1.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.530
Let's keep it so that it
doesn't confuse anybody.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:36.040
Then I have the collision term.

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:39.980
Now, the collision term is
a bunch of integrals itself.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:47.530
It involves integrals over p2,
integral over an impact vector

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:50.070
b, the relative velocity.

00:35:53.940 --> 00:36:01.910
And then I had minus
f of p1, f of p2

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:05.990
for the loss in the channel
because of the collisions,

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:10.690
plus the addition to the channel
from the inverse collisions.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.060
And this whole thing
has to be multiplied

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:22.041
by log f evaluated at p1.

00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:24.480
OK?

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.280
So that's really the quantity
that we are interested.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.200
And the quantity that we
are interested, we notice,

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.880
has some kind of a symmetry with
respect to indices one and two.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.920
Something to do with prime
and un-prime coordinates.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.980
But multiplied this bracket that
has all of these symmetries,

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.780
with this function that is only
evaluated for one of the four

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:54.460
coordinates for momenta
that are appearing here.

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:59.420
So our next set of tasks is to
somehow make this as symmetric

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:01.070
as possible.

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:06.250
So the first thing that we
do is we exchange indices one

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:10.920
and two, because really, these
are simply dummy integration

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.370
variables.

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:16.750
I can call the thing that I was
calling p1 p2, and vice versa.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:21.380
And the integration then
becomes the integral over q.

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:26.290
Maybe that's why it's useful not
to have, for the q, any index,

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:32.110
because I don't care to
change the index for that.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.500
d cubed p2, p1.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:38.780
Doesn't really matter in
what order I write them.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:43.330
d2b is a relative separation.

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:47.120
Again, it's an impact parameter.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.200
I can call this v1 minus v2.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.990
But since it's an
absolute value,

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.030
it doesn't matter really.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.950
And so the only
thing that happens

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.985
is that I will have--
essentially, the product is

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:00.485
symmetric.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:13.970
The only thing that
was separately f

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:16.410
of p1 before now
becomes f of p2.

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:22.420
And then what I can do is I
can say, OK, those are really

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.040
two forms of the same integral,
and I can average them,

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:33.310
and write the average, which is
1/2 the integral d cubed q, d

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:45.200
cubed p1, d cubed p2, d2 b,
relative velocity, minus f

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:53.700
of p1, f of p2, f of p1
prime, f of p2 prime.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:39:03.420
And then I have a log of f
of p1 plus log of f of p2.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:07.845
And I have divided through 1/2.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:08.345
OK?

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:22.200
So what I will do is to
now write the next line.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:27.320
And then we'll spend some
time discussing what happens.

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.500
So artificially, what will
happen looks like I essentially

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:37.800
move prime and un-prime things
the same way that I exchanged

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.270
one and two indices before.

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:45.010
I will exchange the superscripts
that are prime or non-prime.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:51.268
And if I were to do that, I
will get an integral d cubed q,

00:39:51.268 --> 00:39:59.980
d cubed, let's say, p1 prime,
d cubed p2 prime, d2b, v2 minus

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:09.740
v1 prime, minus
f of p1-- [SIGHS]

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:22.790
--prime, f or p2 prime,
plus f of p1, f of p2.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:25.470
And then here, we
would have log of f

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:31.820
of p1 prime, log
of f of p2 prime.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.180
OK?

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:40.290
So this is a statement
that just saying,

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:43.550
I moved the primes
and un-primes,

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:47.080
it's very easy to come
up with this answer.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.080
What you have to think very
much about what that means.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.660
Essentially, what I
had originally was

00:40:55.660 --> 00:41:02.070
integration
invariables p1 and p2.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:07.090
And p1 prime and p2 prime were
never integration variables.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:09.650
So there was not
symmetry at the level

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:13.070
that I have written
between one and two, which

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.790
are integration
variables, and one prime

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.630
and two prime, which
are the quantities that,

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:24.750
through the collision operator,
are related to p1 and p2.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:28.920
So essentially, p1
prime and p2 prime

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.330
are the kind of functions
that we have written here.

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:35.970
Here, I had p1 double
prime, p2 double prime.

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:40.300
But up to sort of inverting
some signs, et cetera,

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:45.290
this is the kind of functional
relationship that you have

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:50.380
between p primes and p's.

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:51.810
OK?

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.080
So now we have to worry
about a number of things.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.180
The simplest one
is actually what

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:05.170
happened to this factor
here-- the relative velocity.

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:08.200
Now think back about
collisions that you

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.360
have in the center of mass.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.590
In the center of
mass, two particles

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:17.500
come with velocities that
are opposite each other.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:21.320
They bang onto each other,
go different direction.

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.620
The magnitude of the
velocities does not

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.510
change an inelastic
collision, which

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.460
is what we are looking at.

00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:28.720
Right?

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:34.800
So after the collision, what
we have is that p2 prime minus

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:38.380
p1 prime is the same
thing as p1 and minus

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.735
p2 for elastic conditions.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.640
So as far as this
factor is concerned,

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:55.180
I could very well replace
that with v1 minus v2

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.220
without the primes.

00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.835
It really doesn't
make any difference.

00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:06.060
Another thing that you
can convince yourself

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:12.640
is that from the perspective
of the picture that I drew,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.071
there was some kind
of an impact vector B.

00:43:17.071 --> 00:43:19.060
You say, well, what
happens if I look

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.780
at from the perspective of the
products of the interaction?

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.600
So the products
of the interaction

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.270
are going in a
different direction.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.670
I would have to redraw
my coordinates that

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:34.820
would correspond to
A prime and B prime.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:38.380
But what you can convince
yourself that essentially,

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:43.200
the impact parameter, as far
as these products is concerned,

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.110
is just a rotated version
of the original one

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:49.070
without changing its magnitude.

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:53.220
So you have also that
magnitude of b prime

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:55.950
is the same thing
as magnitude of b.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:59.610
There's a rotation, but
the impact parameter

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:01.090
does not change.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:03.320
If you like, that
is also related

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.190
to conservation of energy,
because if it wasn't so,

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:11.670
the potential energy
would be different

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.920
right after the collisions.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.620
OK?

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:21.215
So I really was kind
of careless here.

00:44:21.215 --> 00:44:24.280
I should have
written d2 b prime.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:26.310
But I could have
written also d2b.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:27.660
It didn't make any difference.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.660
It's the same.

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:38.860
And then, of course, these
functions-- essentially,

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:47.330
you can see that you say, OK,
I start with, here, p1 and p2.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.920
And these were
functions of p1 and p2.

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.730
And here, I have reversed this.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:58.490
p1 prime and p2 prime are
the integration variables.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:02.950
p1 and p2 are functions
of p1 prime and p2 prime

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:07.130
that, in principle, are
obtained by inverting

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:10.034
this set of equations.

00:45:10.034 --> 00:45:12.500
Right?

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:15.300
But it really, again,
doesn't matter,

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:20.630
because once you have
specified what incoming p1, p2,

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:24.520
and b are, you know what the
outcome of the collision is.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:26.670
So it's really
the same function.

00:45:26.670 --> 00:45:28.750
Whether you are
inverting it, you

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:32.000
will, again, presume
the different location

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.080
of the arguments, but you will
have the same function that

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.500
would tell you what the
inverse relationship is.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.120
So really, these
functional forms

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.120
are the same as the functional
forms that we had before.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:48.990
And finally, I
claim that in order

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:52.920
to go through this
change of variable,

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:57.670
I have to also deal with the
Jacobian of the transformation.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:02.790
But that we have the
d3p1d3p2 is the same thing

00:46:02.790 --> 00:46:08.140
as d3p1 prime d3p2 prime.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.480
And that, in some sense,
you can sort of also

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:14.810
think about what we were doing
before with the Liouville

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.730
equation maintaining the
volume of phase space.

00:46:18.730 --> 00:46:23.490
So I have some volume of phase
space prior to the collision.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:27.730
After the collision, I would
need to have the same volume.

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:30.130
There is, of course,
in the volumes

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:33.890
that we are considering for the
case of the Liouville operator,

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:38.740
in addition,
products of dq1, dq2.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.410
But you can see that
all of those things

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:44.780
are really put into
the same volume when

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:46.840
we are considering
the collision.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.270
So really, the only
thing that is left

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:53.560
is that the Liouvillian
preservation

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.440
of the volume of
phase space would

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.160
say that the Jacobian
here, you can also ignore.

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:00.660
Yes.

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.782
AUDIENCE: So are you assuming
that this transformation

00:47:03.782 --> 00:47:08.246
[INAUDIBLE] is [? an article, ?]
because it's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:08.246 --> 00:47:10.110
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:14.010
So everything that we do
is within the framework

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:18.112
of a Hamiltonian
evolution equation.

00:47:18.112 --> 00:47:19.040
OK?

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.850
So if you like,
these kinds of things

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:25.260
that I'm saying
here sometimes are

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:29.730
said to be consequence of
microscopic reversibility,

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:34.720
in that I'm sort of using,
in this panel over here,

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.300
things that are completely
Newtonian and microscopic.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:45.186
The place that I use statistical
argument was over here.

00:47:45.186 --> 00:47:46.540
OK?

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:50.550
So essentially,
having done that,

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:55.200
you can basically
also rename variables.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.000
Things that I was calling
p1 prime I can call p1.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:05.860
It's another renaming
of some variable.

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:15.120
And again, it really doesn't
matter which relative velocity

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.790
I write down.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:17.630
They're all the same thing.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.380
So what will happen
is that I will

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:28.940
get minus f or p1, f of p2, plus
f of p1 prime, f of p2 prime.

00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:37.670
And the only thing that happened
is that the logs-- oops.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.010
I should have maintained.

00:48:43.735 --> 00:48:47.030
I don't know why--
where I made a mistake.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:52.080
But I should ultimately have
come up with this answer.

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.840
So what I wanted
to do, and I really

00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.850
have to maybe look
at it again, is

00:49:02.850 --> 00:49:07.920
do one more step
of symmetrization.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:17.180
The answer will come down to an
integral over p1 and p2, d2b,

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.720
at relative velocity.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:31.410
We would have minus f of p1,
f of p2, plus f of p1 prime,

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:32.970
f of p2 prime.

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:36.286
So this is our
collision operator

00:49:36.286 --> 00:49:38.650
that we have discussed
here-- the difference

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.240
between what comes in
and what comes out.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:49.660
And from the first part here,
we should get log of f of p1,

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.220
plus log of f of p2,
which is the same thing

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.475
as the log of the product.

00:49:56.070 --> 00:50:02.140
And if I had not made
errors, the subtraction

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.460
would have involved f of
p1 prime, f of p2 prime.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:16.510
And the idea is that if you
think about the function

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:24.650
log of something as a
function of that something,

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:28.710
the log is a monotonic function.

00:50:28.710 --> 00:50:33.600
So that if you were to
evaluate the log at two

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.440
different points,
the sign of the log

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.070
would grow in the same
way as the sign of the two

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:49.190
points, which means that here,
you have the difference of two

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.470
logs.

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:57.310
This is like log of
s1 minus log of s2.

00:50:57.310 --> 00:51:02.820
And it is multiplied
with minus s1 minus s2.

00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.860
So if s1 is greater
than s2, log s1

00:51:05.860 --> 00:51:07.190
would be greater than log s2.

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:12.040
If s1 is less than s2, log
s1 would be less than log s2.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:15.050
In either case,
what you would find

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:18.830
is that the product of the
two brackets is negative.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:20.570
And this whole thing
has to be negative.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:24.370
OK.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:31.020
So the thing that confused
me-- and maybe we can go back

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:40.130
and look at is that probably,
what I was doing here

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:47.510
was a little bit too
impatient, because when

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:57.640
I changed variables,
p1 prime f of p2.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:01.580
I removed the primes.

00:52:06.416 --> 00:52:06.915
Log.

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:10.350
Reduced primes.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:15.785
Actually, I had it here.

00:52:15.785 --> 00:52:17.831
I don't know why I was worried.

00:52:17.831 --> 00:52:18.330
Yeah.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:22.570
So the signs are, I think,
right, that when I add them,

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:24.770
I would get the subtraction.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:32.640
So in one case, I had the f's of
the p's with the negative sign.

00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:38.410
After I did this change, they
appear with the positive sign.

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:43.540
So there is the sign difference
between the two of them.

00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.380
OK?

00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.230
So we have a
function, therefore,

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:52.330
that, just like entropy
throughout the process,

00:52:52.330 --> 00:52:53.570
will increase.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:56.820
This is like a negative entropy.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:53:00.630
If I were to really solve
this set of equations,

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:03.305
starting with the f that
describes things that

00:53:03.305 --> 00:53:06.200
are distributed in
this box, and then

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:09.600
allow it to expand
into the other box,

00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:12.380
it will follow--
this solution will

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:17.910
follow some particular
trajectory that will ultimately

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:21.050
no longer change as
a function of time.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:22.840
It will not go back and forth.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.360
It will not have the
full reversibility

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:30.490
that these set of
equations does have.

00:53:30.490 --> 00:53:32.780
Now, that's actually
not a bad thing.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:37.690
It is true, indeed, that these
equations are reversible.

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:41.730
And there is a theorem that
if you wait sufficiently long,

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:44.960
this will go back into here.

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.130
But the time it take
for that to happen

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:53.085
grows something of the order of
the size of the system divided

00:53:53.085 --> 00:53:53.585
these.

00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.940
The time, up to
various pre-factors,

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.630
would grow exponentially
with the number of particles

00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:04.490
that you have.

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:07.390
And remember that you
have of the order of 10

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:10.050
to the 23 particles.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:13.290
So there is, indeed,
mathematically rigorously,

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:19.510
a recursion time if you really
had this box sitting in vacuum

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:23.420
and there was no influence on
the walls of the container.

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.760
After many, many, many,
many ages of the universe,

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:31.270
the gas would go back
for an instant of time

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:34.120
in the other box, and
then would go over there.

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:39.690
But that's something that really
is of no practical relevance

00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:44.310
when we are thinking about
the gas and how it expands.

00:54:44.310 --> 00:54:45.500
OK?

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:49.210
But now let's see, with
these approximations,

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.140
can we do better.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.840
Can we figure out
exactly how long does it

00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:58.180
take for the gas to go from
one side to the other side.

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.670
And what is the shape of the
streamlines and everything else

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:04.550
as this process is taking place?

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:06.704
Yes.

00:55:06.704 --> 00:55:07.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.580
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:26.080
Yes.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:30.380
So if you like, we
want to think of this

00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.835
in terms of information,
in terms of entropy.

00:55:32.835 --> 00:55:33.730
It doesn't matter.

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:37.610
It is something that is
changing as a function of time.

00:55:37.610 --> 00:55:40.620
And the timescale by
which that happens

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:45.200
has to do with the timescales
that we set up and imprinted

00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.017
into this equation.

00:55:47.017 --> 00:55:48.440
OK?

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:51.410
So the next step
that I have to answer

00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:54.260
is, what is that time step?

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:58.270
And in particular, if I look
at this equation by itself,

00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:01.330
I would say that it
has two timescales.

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:04.310
On the left-hand side,
you have this tau

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:06.990
that has to do with
the size of the box.

00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:09.350
We said it's very long.

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:13.100
On the right-hand
side, it has the time

00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:15.290
that I have to wait
for a collision

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:20.590
to occur, which is certainly
much shorter than this time,

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:23.170
for an ordinary gas.

00:56:23.170 --> 00:56:27.260
And so we expect, therefore,
that the right-hand side

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:31.800
of this equation would determine
things much more rapidly

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.040
compared to the left-hand
side of the equation.

00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:39.700
And we want to now
quantify that and make that

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:42.610
into something that
is relevant to things

00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:47.670
that we know and understand
about a gas expand.

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:49.480
OK?

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:55.350
So let's sort of think about,
well, what would happen?

00:56:55.350 --> 00:57:01.070
We said that this H,
as a function of time,

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:04.140
is going in one direction.

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:08.060
Presumably, after some time--
we don't know how long here,

00:57:08.060 --> 00:57:10.440
and that's a good
question-- eventually,

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:12.500
hopefully, it will
reach an equilibrium,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.320
like, the entropy
will cease to change.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.175
And the question is,
what is this equilibrium?

00:57:19.175 --> 00:57:21.800
So let's see if we can gain some
information about equilibrium.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:34.210
So we said that dH
by dt presumably

00:57:34.210 --> 00:57:38.330
has to be 0, because
if it is not 0,

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:40.650
then it can continue
to decrease.

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:44.920
You are not quite
where you want to be.

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:50.630
Now let's look at what is the
condition for dH by dt to be 0.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:56.050
H is this integral that
I have to perform over

00:57:56.050 --> 00:58:00.010
the entire phase space.

00:58:00.010 --> 00:58:04.050
Now, each element of
that integral evaluated

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:07.200
at some particular
location in phase space

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.090
is by itself positive.

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:12.070
This argument that
we had before is not

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:13.800
about the entire integral.

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.010
It's valid about every little
piece of the integration

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.340
that I am making.

00:58:18.340 --> 00:58:20.830
It has a particular sign.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:26.530
So if the entire integral has to
be 0, every little piece of it

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:29.770
has to be individually 0.

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:32.310
So that means that
I would require

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:39.190
that log of f at
any q evaluated,

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:47.680
let's say, for p1 and p2
should be the same thing

00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:53.230
as log of f evaluated
at p1 prime and p2.

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:03.680
This would be true for all q.

00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.180
Right?

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.630
You look at this and
you say, well, what?

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:14.560
This seems kind of-- yes?

00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:17.015
AUDIENCE: What about the
other one in parentheses,

00:59:17.015 --> 00:59:19.500
beside the integral?

00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.350
PROFESSOR: It is the same thing.

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:24.300
So this is s1 minus s2.

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.700
And the other is
log of s1 minus s2.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.823
So I'm saying that the only time
it is 0 is s1 is equal to s2.

00:59:34.447 --> 00:59:38.360
When s1 equals to s2,
both parentheses are 0.

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:41.000
Although, even if it wasn't,
it would have been sufficient

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.620
for one parentheses to be 0.

00:59:42.620 --> 00:59:48.210
But this is necessary, because
the sign is determined by this.

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.566
OK?

00:59:49.566 --> 00:59:51.450
Now, you look at this
and you say, well,

00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:53.780
what the he-- what
does this mean?

00:59:53.780 --> 00:59:59.220
How can I-- and the functions
p1 prime and p2 prime I

00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:02.300
have to get by integrating
Newton's equations.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.920
I have no idea how
complicated they are.

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:08.670
And you want me to
solve this equation.

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:10.410
Well, I tell you that
the answer to this

01:00:10.410 --> 01:00:12.580
is actually very simple.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:17.080
So let me write the
answer to it in stages.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:21.615
Log of f of p and q.

01:00:21.615 --> 01:00:24.390
So it's a function
of p and q that I'm

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:28.090
after that have to be
evaluated at p1, p2,

01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:31.320
and then should be equal
to p1 prime and p2 prime

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.702
for any combination of p1,
p2, et cetera, that I choose.

01:00:35.702 --> 01:00:41.980
Well, I say, OK, I will put
any function of q that I like.

01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.810
And that will work, because
it's independent of p.

01:00:46.810 --> 01:00:48.940
So I have minus
alpha, minus alpha

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:52.030
is the same as minus
alpha, minus alpha.

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:52.890
OK?

01:00:52.890 --> 01:00:57.800
Then I claim that, OK, I
will put a minus gamma dot p.

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.360
Gamma could be dependent on q.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.720
Dot p.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:07.590
And I claim that that would
work, because that term would

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.555
give me gamma dot
p1 plus p2, gamma

01:01:11.555 --> 01:01:14.550
dot p1 prime plus p2 prime.

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:16.150
What do I know for sure?

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:18.240
Momentum is conserved.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:24.280
p1 plus p2 is the same thing
as p1 prime plus p2 prime.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.760
It's just the
conservation of momentum.

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.670
I know that to be true for sure.

01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:34.790
And finally, kinetic
energy is conserved.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:39.440
Once I'm away from the location
where the interaction is taking

01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:43.580
place, I can choose
any function of q

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:46.970
multiplied with p
squared over 2m.

01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:48.820
And then on the
left-hand side, I

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.910
would have the sum of the
incoming kinetic energies.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.410
On the right-hand
side, I would have

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:56.740
the sum of outgoing
kinetic energies.

01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.800
So what have I done?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.090
I have identified
quantities that

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:04.260
are conserved in the collision.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.960
So basically, I
can keep going if I

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:10.290
have additional such things.

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:13.640
And so basically,
the key to this

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:18.020
is to identify
collision-conserved quantities.

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.030
And so momentum, energy,
the first one corresponds

01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:27.970
to the number of particles.

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:30.740
These are quantities
that are conserved.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.610
And so you know that
this form will work,

01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:38.450
which means that I have a
candidate for equilibrium,

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:43.580
which is that f of p and q
should have a form that is

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:49.540
exponential of some function of
q that I don't-- at this stage,

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.830
could be quite arbitrary.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:59.150
And some other function of
q times p squared minus 2m.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:03.750
And let me absorb
this other gamma term.

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.690
I can certainly do so
by putting something

01:03:06.690 --> 01:03:11.400
like pi of 1 squared over 2m.

01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:18.726
OK?

01:03:18.726 --> 01:03:23.030
And this certainly
is a form that

01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:31.660
will set the right-hand
side of the H theorem to 0.

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.130
And furthermore, it
sets the right-hand side

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:39.220
of the Boltzmann equation
to 0, because, again,

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.840
for the Boltzmann
equation, all I

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.190
needed was that the
product of two f's

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:46.590
should be the same before
and after the collision.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:49.030
And this is just the logs.

01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:53.300
If I were to exponentiate that,
I have exactly what I need.

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.690
So basically, this also
sets the right-hand side

01:03:57.690 --> 01:04:00.000
of the Boltzmann equation to 0.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.650
And this is what I will
call a local equilibrium.

01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:10.600
What do I mean by that?

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:13.250
Essentially, we can
see that right now, I

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:16.510
have no knowledge
about the relationship

01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:18.920
between different
points in space,

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:22.700
because these alpha, beta, and
pi are completely arbitrary, as

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:26.770
far as my argumentation
so far is concerned.

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:33.280
So locally, at each point in q,
I can have a form such as this.

01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.480
And this form, you
should remind you

01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.750
it's something like a Boltzmann
weight of the kinetic energy,

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:44.180
but moving in some
particular direction.

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:49.950
And essentially,
what this captures

01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:54.220
is that through relaxing
the right-hand side

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.930
of the Boltzmann
equation, we randomize

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:03.170
the magnitude of the momenta,
so that the magnitudes

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:08.890
of the kinetic energy are
kind of Boltzmann-distributed.

01:05:08.890 --> 01:05:11.910
This is what this term does.

01:05:11.910 --> 01:05:19.990
If I say that this term being
much larger than this term

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:21.440
is the more important one.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.020
If I need neglect this,
then this is what happens.

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:27.620
I will very rapidly
reach a situation

01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:31.005
in which the momenta
have been randomized

01:05:31.005 --> 01:05:32.410
through the collisions.

01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:35.040
Essentially, the
collisions, they

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.550
change the direction
of the momenta.

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:43.880
They preserve the
average of the momenta.

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:45.940
So there is some
sense of the momentum

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:49.660
of the incoming thing
that is left over still.

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.290
But there is some
relaxation that took place.

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:56.450
But clearly, this is not
the end of the story,

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:58.940
because this f that
I have written here--

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:01.650
let's say local equilibrium.

01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:11.464
f local equilibrium does not
satisfy the Boltzmann equation.

01:06:11.464 --> 01:06:13.080
Right?

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:17.490
It set the right-hand side of
the Boltzmann equation to 0.

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:19.470
But it doesn't set
the left-hand side.

01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:23.990
The left-hand side completely
is unhappy with this.

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:27.260
For the left-hand
side to be 0, I

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:32.640
would require the Poisson
bracket of H1 and f to be 0.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.300
After all, the
Liouvillian operator

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:38.690
had the Poisson
bracket of H1 and f.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:41.310
And we have seen
functions that satisfy

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:49.500
this have to be of the form
f1 of H. And in our case,

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:54.240
my f1 is simply the kinetic
energy of one particle,

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.385
plus the potential
due to the box.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:01.560
OK?

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:08.640
So you can see that the only way
that I can make this marriage

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:18.670
with this is to have a
global equilibrium, where

01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:28.390
f for the global equilibrium
is proportional, let's say,

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:35.200
to exponential of minus beta
p squared over 2m plus U of q.

01:07:39.592 --> 01:07:41.060
OK?

01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:47.430
So I identify a piece that looks
like this p squared over 2m.

01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:51.740
I have to make pi to be 0
in order to achieve this.

01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:54.940
I have to make beta to
be independent of q.

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.120
I have to make alpha
of f marriage with beta

01:07:58.120 --> 01:08:00.870
to give me the potential.

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:02.440
OK?

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:06.240
So essentially, what
happens is this.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:11.400
I open this hole.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.120
The gas starts to stream out.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:18.899
And then the particles will
collide with each other.

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:21.910
The collision of particles
over some timescale that

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:24.470
is related to this
collision time

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:30.470
will randomize their momenta
so that locally, suddenly,

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:35.420
I have a solution such as this.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:39.859
But then the left-hand side
of the Boltzmann equation

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:41.440
takes over.

01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:44.220
And over a timescale
that is much longer,

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.740
it will then change
the parameters of this.

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.109
So basically, these
parameters should really

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:56.210
be thought of as functions of
time, whose evolution changes.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:09:00.479
So initially, maybe
locally over here,

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:04.080
there is a stream velocity
that goes towards the right.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.220
So I should have an
average at that time that

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.210
prefers to go to the right.

01:09:09.210 --> 01:09:11.049
I wait sufficiently long.

01:09:11.049 --> 01:09:13.090
Presumably, the whole
thing comes to equilibrium.

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:16.120
And that average goes
to 0 [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.790
So presumably, the
next thing that I

01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:22.020
need to do in order to
answer the question,

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.439
how does this thing
come to equilibrium,

01:09:24.439 --> 01:09:29.510
is to find out how the
left-hand side of the equation

01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:33.819
manipulates these parameters
alpha, beta, and pi.

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:36.910
But that's not quite
consistent either.

01:09:36.910 --> 01:09:40.620
Because I first assume that
the right-hand side is 0,

01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.569
and then said, oh, that's
not a good solution.

01:09:43.569 --> 01:09:46.300
Let's go and see what
the left-hand side does.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:49.120
But then if the left-hand
side is changing things,

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:53.279
I can't be over here
where dH by dt is 0.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.240
So I have not done
things consistently yet,

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.480
although I have clearly
captured the whole lot of what

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.620
I want to describe eventually.

01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.600
OK?

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.971
So let's see how we can
do it systematically.

01:10:05.971 --> 01:10:06.762
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:10:06.762 --> 01:10:07.600
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:13.420
AUDIENCE: When you [? write ?]
the condition for [INAUDIBLE],

01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:15.845
[? did you ?] write
f1 of Hamiltonian.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:17.785
And ends up
Hamiltonian [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:17.785 --> 01:10:19.105
includes interaction terms.

01:10:19.105 --> 01:10:20.980
PROFESSOR: It's the
one-particle Hamiltonian.

01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:21.924
AUDIENCE: Oh.

01:10:21.924 --> 01:10:22.870
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:27.840
So by the time I got to the
equation for f1, I have H1.

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.490
H1 does not have a second
particle in it to collide with.

01:10:36.290 --> 01:10:39.105
OK?

01:10:39.105 --> 01:10:42.360
AUDIENCE: Then equilibrium
system's distribution

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:44.760
of particles in
container does not

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:50.418
depend on their interactions
after the [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:53.681
PROFESSOR: In the story that
we are following here, yes, it

01:10:53.681 --> 01:10:54.180
does not.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.810
So this is an
approximation that actually

01:10:57.810 --> 01:11:00.680
goes with the
approximations that we

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.410
made in neglecting some of the
higher order terms, with nd

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:07.310
cubed being much
less than 1, and not

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:10.710
looking at things at resolution
that is of the order of d.

01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:13.740
And we would imagine that it
is only at the resolutions--

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:17.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] neglected
[INAUDIBLE] atomized gas

01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:19.842
conjoined onto the molecules.

01:11:19.842 --> 01:11:20.798
Something like that.

01:11:20.798 --> 01:11:23.830
PROFESSOR: That would require
a different description.

01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:24.658
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:11:24.658 --> 01:11:25.486
It would require [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:25.486 --> 01:11:26.152
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:26.152 --> 01:11:27.080
So indeed.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.910
Eventually, in the description
that we are going to get,

01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:33.400
we are looking at
the distribution

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:35.720
that would be appropriate
to a dilute gas

01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.251
and which interactions
are not seen.

01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:43.800
OK?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.300
All right.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.220
So let's see how we
can do it better.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.170
So clearly, the
key to the process

01:11:49.170 --> 01:11:56.620
is that collisions that take
place frequently at timescale

01:11:56.620 --> 01:12:00.240
tau x randomize a lot of things.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:06.790
But they cannot randomize
quantities that are conserved

01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:07.870
in collisions.

01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:11.057
So those are the quantities
that we have to look at.

01:12:11.057 --> 01:12:13.140
And again, these are
quantities that are conserved

01:12:13.140 --> 01:12:16.060
in collision, as
opposed to quantities

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:20.270
that are conserved
according to H1.

01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:24.390
Like, momentum is
conserved in the collision.

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:26.720
Clearly, momentum
was not conserved

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.400
in H1 because of
the size of the box

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:34.400
and did not appear in
the eventual solution.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:35.340
OK.

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:36.797
Let's see what we get.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:51.100
So we are going to make
a couple of definitions.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.495
First, we define
a local density.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:04.560
I say that I take my solution
to Boltzmann equation.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.170
And now I don't know what it is.

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:09.070
But whatever it is,
I take the solution

01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:12.520
to the Boltzmann equation as
a function of p and q and t.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.120
But all I am interested is,
at this particular location,

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.400
have the particles arrived
yet, what's the density.

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:24.720
So to get that, I
essentially integrate

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.760
over the momenta, which is
the quantity that I am not

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:30.390
interested.

01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.890
OK?

01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:33.050
Obvious.

01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:37.160
I define-- maybe I need
the average kinetic energy

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.810
at that location.

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:44.520
So maybe, in general, I need the
average or some other quantity

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.860
that I define at
location q and t.

01:13:51.990 --> 01:14:03.830
What I do is I integrate at that
position f of p, and q, and t,

01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:11.510
and this function O. Actually,
I also define a normalization.

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:17.420
I divide by n of q and t.

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:17.920
OK?

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:26.090
Now, I implicitly used
something over there

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:29.180
that, again, I
define here, which

01:14:29.180 --> 01:14:43.620
is a collision-conserved
quantity,

01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:54.320
is some function of momentum--
I could put q also--

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:03.020
such that when evaluated for
p1 plus p2 for any pair of p1's

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:08.630
and p2's that I take is the
same thing as when evaluated

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:13.120
for functions of p1 and
p2 that would correspond

01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:18.990
to the outcomes of
the collision from

01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:22.070
or giving rights to p1, p2.

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.570
OK?

01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:28.420
And then there's a
following theorem

01:15:28.420 --> 01:15:31.130
that we were going
to use, which is

01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:40.800
that for any collision-conserved
quantity, what I have is

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:46.645
that I will define a quantity J,
which is a function of q and t

01:15:46.645 --> 01:15:53.000
in principle, which is
obtained by integrating

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.830
over all momenta.

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:02.915
Chi-- let's say,
evaluated at p1;

01:16:02.915 --> 01:16:10.360
it could be evaluated at q--
times this collision operator--

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:14.775
C of f, f.

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:25.680
And the answer is that for any
collision-conserved quantity,

01:16:25.680 --> 01:16:31.175
if you were to evaluate
this, the answer would be 0.

01:16:31.175 --> 01:16:33.460
OK?

01:16:33.460 --> 01:16:37.610
So let's write that down.

01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:44.500
So J of q and t is an integral
over some momentum p1.

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:50.396
Because of the collision
integral, what do I have?

01:16:50.396 --> 01:16:53.450
I have the integration
over momentum.

01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:56.430
I have the integration over b.

01:16:56.430 --> 01:17:01.480
I have the relative
velocity v2 minus v1.

01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:06.420
And then I have the
subtraction of interaction

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:11.320
between p1 and p2--
addition of the interactions

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.310
between p1 prime, p2 prime.

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:19.380
And this collision
integral has to be

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.150
multiplied with chi
evaluated at p1.

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:28.390
OK?

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.890
Fine.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:37.470
So then I will follow
exactly the steps

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:42.720
that we had in the
proof of the H theorem.

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:45.360
I have some function
that only depends

01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.900
on one of four momenta
that are appearing here.

01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:52.500
And I want to symmetrize it.

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:58.590
So I change the
index one to two.

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:05.510
So this becomes 1/2 of
chi of p1 plus chi of p2.

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:14.670
I do this transition between
primed and un-primed.

01:18:14.670 --> 01:18:18.940
And when I do that, I pick
this additional factor

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:26.808
of minus chi of p1
prime, chi of p2 prime.

01:18:26.808 --> 01:18:32.030
And this becomes
division by 2 times 2.

01:18:36.690 --> 01:18:42.210
But then I stated that chi is
a collision-conserved quantity,

01:18:42.210 --> 01:18:48.360
so that this term in the
bracket is 0 for each point

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:49.610
that I'm integrating.

01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:51.130
And hence, the answer is 0.

01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:55.630
Yes.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:59.130
AUDIENCE: In the
[INAUDIBLE] theorem,

01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:05.252
in the second
[INAUDIBLE], do you

01:19:05.252 --> 01:19:10.686
want to put minus sign of the--?

01:19:10.686 --> 01:19:13.410
PROFESSOR: There
was a minus sign

01:19:13.410 --> 01:19:15.772
worry that I had somewhere.

01:19:15.772 --> 01:19:22.660
AUDIENCE: I think in front
of 1/2, at the right term.

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:27.040
PROFESSOR: In front of
the 1/2, minus f of p1.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.580
You say I have to do this?

01:19:28.580 --> 01:19:29.568
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

01:19:29.568 --> 01:19:31.544
The next term.

01:19:34.508 --> 01:19:35.496
PROFESSOR: Here?

01:19:35.496 --> 01:19:36.154
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:19:36.154 --> 01:19:41.918
I mean, if you put minus
sign in front of the 1/2,

01:19:41.918 --> 01:19:43.894
then [INAUDIBLE]?

01:19:48.834 --> 01:19:49.610
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:53.830
Let's put a question
mark here, because I

01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.997
don't want to go over that.

01:19:55.997 --> 01:19:57.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but you switched

01:19:57.580 --> 01:20:00.310
the order of the
subtraction [? 1/2. ?]

01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:01.620
So it's minus [INAUDIBLE].

01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.950
PROFESSOR: But I changed
also the arguments here.

01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:05.202
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:20:05.202 --> 01:20:05.910
PROFESSOR: Right?

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:07.545
So there is some issue.

01:20:07.545 --> 01:20:12.830
But this eventual
thing is correct.

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:16.271
So we will go back to that.

01:20:16.271 --> 01:20:16.770
OK.

01:20:19.300 --> 01:20:25.020
So what is the use
of stating that

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:29.040
for every conserved
quantity, you have this?

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:33.020
It will allow us
to get equations

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:36.820
that will determine how
these parameters change

01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.190
as a function of time?

01:20:39.190 --> 01:20:39.690
OK.

01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:41.251
So let's see how that goes.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:57.530
If then I have
that Lf is C, f, f,

01:20:57.530 --> 01:21:04.130
and I showed that the integral
of chi against C, f, f is 0,

01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:07.690
then I also know
that the integral

01:21:07.690 --> 01:21:23.971
of chi against this
L operator on f is 0.

01:21:23.971 --> 01:21:24.470
OK?

01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:27.550
And let's remind you
that the L operator is

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:32.460
a bunch of first derivatives--
d by dt, d by dq, d by dp.

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:36.790
And so I can use the
following result.

01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:41.460
I can write the result as this
derivative acting on both chi

01:21:41.460 --> 01:21:42.890
and f.

01:21:42.890 --> 01:21:46.755
And then I will get chi
prime f plus f chi prime.

01:21:46.755 --> 01:21:54.220
Chi f prime I have, so I have
to subtract fL acting on chi.

01:21:58.950 --> 01:22:00.850
OK?

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:08.640
And proceeding a little bit.

01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:10.260
One more line maybe.

01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:12.390
d cubed p.

01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:19.100
I have dt plus--
well, actually, let

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.843
me do the rest next time around.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.290
We're going to
take a look at how

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.680
point of view and composition
are very clearly connected.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.980
But, before we show
the connections,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.180
we have to sort of
define, visually define,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.680
what I mean by point
of view, for example.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.000
So, take a look at
these four images.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.040
Now, it doesn't look
it, but these images

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.480
are of the identical
sample, just

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.200
simply taken with four
different points of view.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.720
There, it's true that I also
changed the background on them,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.250
but, generally, what I
did was I moved the sample

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.020
around or the camera, and we
get four really completely

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.630
different-looking visual ideas
of what this stuff was about.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.000
Which one is right,
I'm not sure there

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.340
is a right in any of this.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.190
That's one of the fun things
about this kind of work:

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.560
There are no hard, fast
rules that we have to follow.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.430
But I wanted, to give
you, this example

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.140
to show you that just by
simply changing the angle or-of

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.400
your camera, or moving
your material around,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.250
you see different things.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.270
Again, we're learning
to see in this course.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.380
So, in this situation, I
wanted to show the fabrication

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.700
of this particular
pyramid, sort of telling

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.880
a story in a particular image.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.940
But for now, just
take a real good look

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.100
at this pyramid that was
made with this wafer that

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.100
was imprinted with a pattern.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.530
And, I felt that this
was not quite right

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.370
because there was a
little ambiguity in where

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.210
the pyramid's point is.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.960
It's a little too close
to the curve of the wafer.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.289
So by simply raising the
camera ever so slightly,

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.170
we get a nice and clean
line without ... well,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.680
let's continue calling it
ambiguity for the time being.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.880
Here is an example where, for
this particular device (it's

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.610
a micro rotor) I shot
it from above because I

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.306
was using a stereo microscope.

00:02:13.306 --> 00:02:15.430
I had just gotten this
brand new piece of equipment

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.190
that I had to use of course
because it's brand new!

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.020
And, from that point of
view, very unfortunately,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.240
you see all kinds of
dust and yuck, which

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.940
I could not get rid
of because I don't

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.500
have control over the light.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.340
So, I simply changed back
to my camera and my 105 lens

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.070
with a different
point of view which

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.450
gave me a much cleaner image.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.980
Many times, we get stuck
on a particular approach

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.270
to looking at things, let's
say, directly from above

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.010
and it doesn't necessarily
give the best image.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
Here's an example where,
this is a PDMS that's been

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.000
etched with a grading on it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.880
And I took it with
this particular view.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.490
And just by simply
changing the PDMS

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.590
to a slightly
different position,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.620
we get a different
point of view.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.500
Let's go back and
forth on this and see.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.230
It's kind of fun
to do this anyway,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.970
but you'll notice
that you really see.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.160
This one has a better approach
to looking at the refraction

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.902
but, at the same
time, you notice

00:03:18.902 --> 00:03:21.360
when we-I did that, the shadow
is changing in its position.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.680
Again, this is encouraging
you to understand

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.780
that when you change your
point of view, of course

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.480
you're also changing
your composition,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.310
and they are very
much intertwined,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.130
which we'll see more later on.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.680
In this situation,
I had a petri dish,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.750
with various gels that
had different colors.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.110
(Let's just leave it with
that at the time being) This

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.410
was my primary,
initial point of view,

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.560
and I thought it
was kind of boring.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.390
And so the point of view was
a little tighter in that I

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.290
chose to get the camera closer.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.730
And I also included
different kinds

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.430
of gels: In this
situation, larger ones.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.690
Uh, it is a different
point of view

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.870
in terms of your selection
of what it is that you

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.060
are going to be showing.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.560
So these are not
very deep changes,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.760
but enough to make very,
very different images.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.680
As for example, this one which
is a glass wafer that's been

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.579
etched so that they're
creating channels

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.080
on the wafer from
this point of view.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.800
And here is another
point of view

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.260
where I'm not showing
the whole thing.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.240
And maybe we don't have to show
the whole thing all the time.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.680
Maybe we can show
the work by something

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.990
that is, in my opinion, a more
interesting in composition

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:40.670
in a different point of view.

00:04:43.547 --> 00:04:45.630
HERE, A SMALL CHANGE: Take
a look at both of these

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.540
and I hope you see
that in the first one,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.400
it was a bit of a sloppy
point of view in the sense

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.420
that I'm showing labels.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.659
That really is not
something of value.

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:03.260
And so by simply moving the
camera slightly and then

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.810
focusing a little closer,
it's a cleaner point of view.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.340
Again, this is also
about composition,

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.540
but, they are very
much connected.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.260
Here is this researcher's
point of view

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:21.560
where he decided to show the
flexibility of this material

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.190
and include hands, which
is a very good idea when

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.180
you want to show scale.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.890
For me, I've decided to
be a little more playful

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.659
and just playing more
around the flexibility

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:35.050
and showing the shadows of it.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.610
And we did get a cover of
a journal, which is nice.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.510
A whole different point of view,
same material, both are good.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.970
You know there's not, again,
not one is better than the other

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.300
necessarily.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.270
I decided to dig out from the
depths of my slide collection

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.180
when I was an
architectural photographer

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.790
to show you a difference
that does somewhat inform us,

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.070
in this course.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.260
Here's a beautiful
space in California

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.400
designed by Isamu Noguchi.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.740
This is the first
image that I made.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.060
And here is the second
image that I made.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:17.270
And let's go back and forth
a little on this as well.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.150
And you see in
this second image,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.870
I decided to have
the camera point

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.860
slightly upward and
changing the point of view

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.620
so that we see a slant of sky.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.260
I think this is a better image.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.850
I think it's more interesting.

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:38.570
But I also think that
it allows the viewer

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:42.030
to sort of participate
more in the image.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.140
That is to kind of
go along, upward

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.470
and be part of paying
attention to what

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.250
is going on with the sky.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.450
I think showing the edges and
the connection between the edge

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:59.380
of something beyond is an
interesting view of how to show

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.590
things as I did here ' back
to our world ' when I needed

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:06.940
to show bubbles, uh,
for a book that we did.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.870
I decided to keep the
edge of the plate showing

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.160
and show the background.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:16.420
It is a point of view that
I felt sort of worked.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:19.290
And here is another point of
view with the same material.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.230
Which is better?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:23.880
I'd be interested to
hear your opinions.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.690
Here is a device with
the researcher's point

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:29.330
of view of it.

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.630
And this is my point of
view where I ' first of all,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.215
I did get it in focus [LAUGHS]
but since we're talking about

00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:38.590
point of view, I'll stay with
that, at that, I'll try to.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:40.450
And all I did was I put it on a
white background (which, we'll

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.866
get to backgrounds
later as well),

00:07:41.866 --> 00:07:46.100
and I just slanted the device
and the camera's point of view,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.100
and I think it's a much
more successful picture.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.830
And finally, in
this situation, when

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:56.760
you do have a device that
is almost, pretty much

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.720
symmetrical, if you're going to
take a photograph, from above,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:05.560
you just better make sure that
you make the image symmetrical

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.390
as well.

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.110
Take a look at this
first one again.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.410
And, you know
there's nothing worse

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.020
than an almost okay image.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.920
If it were really
really off symmetry,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.910
that would work better than
just a tad off symmetry.

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:23.160
So, my suggestion
is to, if you do

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.180
decide to make a
symmetrical-like image, to just

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.840
make sure it is a
symmetrical point of view.

[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.964 --> 00:00:04.419
[RUSTLING]

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:05.892
[CLICKING]

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.260
GARY GENSLER: On
Monday, we talked

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.540
about financial
technology as a whole,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.210
and what we're going to do
in these next four classes

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:20.590
is really talk about
three major technologies.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.250
The broad subject of artificial
intelligence, machine learning,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.100
and deep learning,
we'll talk about today,

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.760
and next Monday, we'll move on
and talk about the marketing

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.080
channels, what I'll broadly
call OpenAPI and some

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.640
of those conversational agents
and the relationship that

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.210
is happening there.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.930
And then next Wednesday's
class, I might be off.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.830
It's the following
Monday's class,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.680
we'll talk about blockchain
technology and cryptocurrency.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.920
So we're taking three
big slices of technology,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.190
and then we're going
to go into the sectors.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.430
And so what I thought of about
in structuring this class,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.790
as we've already discussed,
is I take a broad view

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.470
of what the subject of fintech
is, that it's technologies

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:16.080
of our time that are potentially
materially affecting finance.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.525
So in any decade,
any five year, it

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:20.010
might be different technologies.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.680
It's technologies of a certain
time that are materially

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.800
affecting finance,
and it's the broad--

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.750
any competitor can use fintech.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.810
Now, I recognize
that a lot of people

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.270
use the subject or fintech,
and they narrow it down,

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.420
and they just use those
terms for the disruptors,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.190
the startups.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.690
And there were
really good questions

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.990
of why I think of
it more broadly.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.010
I just think that the incumbents
are very much involved

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.260
in this fintech
wave, and to ignore

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.640
that would be at your peril if
you're starting a new business,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.520
if you're an entrepreneur.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.170
And of course, if you're Jamie
Dimon running JPMorgan Chase,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.877
or you're running a big
bank in China or in Europe,

00:02:03.877 --> 00:02:06.210
you would be at your peril
if you didn't think about it.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.020
And big tech, of course,
has found their way in here.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.403
The Alibaba example's in China,
but all around the globe,

00:02:15.403 --> 00:02:17.070
whether it's Brazil,
whether it's India,

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.780
whether it's-- your big tech
has found their way in here.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.300
And so I've also decided
to sort of structure it

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.470
around these three big
thematic technologies,

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.040
and then we'll start to dive
into the sectors themselves

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.680
and take a look at
four or five sectors

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.410
before we call it a day at
the end of the half semester.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.780
So I'm about to pull up
some slides, but, Romain,

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.802
are there any broad questions?

00:02:45.802 --> 00:02:47.010
ROMAIN: Nothing so far, Gary.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.177
GARY GENSLER: OK, thank you.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.480
So just give me a
second to make sure

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.585
I pull up the right
set of slides.

00:03:08.031 --> 00:03:24.880
I think that-- all right,
so two readings today.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.980
I don't know if you were
able to take a look at them.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.240
I hope you had the time
to take a look at them.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.400
And these were
really just a chance

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.710
to sort of grab hold of a broad
discussion of what's going on.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.080
Again, I went to the
Financial Stability Board.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.220
It's a little dated
because it's 2017,

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.220
but I thought the
executive summaries

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.530
and these various
sections were helpful.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.750
And then a shorter medium
post really on six examples,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.210
and today, we're
going to talk about

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:58.780
what is artificial intelligence,
what is machine learning

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.820
and deep learning, and then what
are the eight or 10 major areas

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.505
in finance that it's being used.

00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:07.880
And then next
Monday, we're going

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.350
to talk about a lot
of the challenges

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.450
and go a little deeper
with regard to this.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.910
Now, I said that I
had study questions.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.149
We're going to see if
we can get this to work,

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:23.620
and I'm going to ask for
volunteers to speak up.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.230
If not, Romain might
just unmute everybody,

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:31.690
and then we'll see who I can
cold call on or something.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.430
But who would like
to take a crack?

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.140
And remember, we're all
pass emergency and no credit

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.180
emergency, so this
is just about trying

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.340
to get the conversation going.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.410
But who would want to
answer the question, what

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.300
is artificial intelligence,
machine learning, deep

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.800
learning?

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.290
And you don't need to
be a computer scientist,

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.570
but these terms are
really important

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.450
if you're going to be an
entrepreneur and do a startup,

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.030
or if you're going to be in
a big incumbent or big tech

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.690
company, just to have
this conceptual framework

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.963
and understanding of artificial
intelligence, machine

00:05:05.963 --> 00:05:07.130
learning, and deep learning.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.690
So I'm going to wait for
Romain to either find

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.080
somebody who's raised their
blue hand, or, Romain, you

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.440
get to help me cold
call if you wish.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.970
But hopefully, somebody
wants to just dive into this.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.550
ROMAIN: I'm still waiting
let's see who will be-- ah,

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.200
we have our first
volunteer of the day.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.493
Thank you, Michael.

00:05:28.493 --> 00:05:29.410
GARY GENSLER: Michael.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.140
STUDENT: Sorry, I
forgot to unmute.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.970
So my understanding-- artificial
intelligence just is more

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.980
of an over encompassing
term, being--

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.130
just computer is kind of
mimicking human behavior

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.327
and thought, so that's more--

00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:51.660
GARY GENSLER: Let's pause there.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.540
And a very good
answer, so computers

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.490
mimicking human behavior.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.750
And, Michael, just a sense--

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.000
do you have a sense of how--
when did this come about?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.720
Was this in the last
five years, or was it

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.050
a longer time ago that
somebody came up with this term

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.000
"artificial intelligence?"

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.210
STUDENT: More like the
early to mid 1900s.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.340
It's been a while.

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:16.798
GARY GENSLER: So
it's been a while.

00:06:16.798 --> 00:06:18.820
It's actually way
back in the 1950s,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.610
"artificial
intelligence--" the concept

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.580
of a computer mimicking humans.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.140
In fact, at MIT, we have the
Computer Science and Artificial

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.210
Intelligence Lab.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.950
It's not a creature
that was just invented

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.940
in the 20-teens or 20-naughts.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.680
It goes back decades.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.760
It was a merger of
two earlier labs,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.420
but we've had an artificial
intelligence lab at MIT

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.810
for multiple decades.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.880
So who wants to say what
machine learning is?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.500
Romain?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.018
I hand it off you
to find another--

00:06:53.018 --> 00:06:55.060
ROMAIN: Who will be the
next volunteer for today?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:00.670
STUDENT: I think the
machine [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:05.860
there's very limited or even
no intervention with human,

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.370
and learning are you
solve problems step

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.680
by step in a sequential manner.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.960
So that is like
the machine solve

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.185
problems step by step without
much intervention by humans.

00:07:18.185 --> 00:07:19.810
GARY GENSLER: So I
think you're raising

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.320
two points, is the
machine solving

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.510
a problem without
intervention, which is good.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.550
And then you said
briefly, learning.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.020
Do you want to say
something more,

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.728
or anybody want to
say, what does it mean

00:07:30.728 --> 00:07:32.455
that the machine is learning?

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.892
ROMAIN: We have Rakan
who raised his hand.

00:07:41.892 --> 00:07:43.350
STUDENT: Yes, well,
essentially, it

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.330
means that you're
feeding the machine data,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.415
and as you feed
the machine data,

00:07:50.415 --> 00:07:53.370
the machine learns not
to do specific tasks.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:55.770
And you get better
results as you feed

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:58.050
it more data and more and more.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.870
GARY GENSLER: All right, so the
concept of machine learning,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.670
again, is not that new.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:07.200
It was first written about
in the 1980s and 1990s.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.740
It had a little bit of a wave--

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.590
you might call it a boomlet,
a little bit of a hype cycle--

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:14.660
and then it sort of tamped down.

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.170
But the conceptual framework
is that the computer, machines,

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:25.250
with data, are actually
learning, that they actually--

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.270
whatever algorithms or decision
making or pattern recognition

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:31.730
that they have gets better.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.490
So machine learning is a subset
of artificial intelligence.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.520
Artificial intelligence
is this concept

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:41.380
of computers, a
form of machines,

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:45.790
mimicking human intelligence,
but it could mimic it

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:46.870
without learning.

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:51.460
It could just replicate or
automate what we are doing.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.960
Machine learning
was a new concept--

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.040
it didn't take off.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.250
It didn't dramatically
change our lives at first--

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.670
where, actually, the
computers could adapt

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.960
and change based upon
analysis of the data,

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.900
and that their algorithms
and their pattern recognition

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.830
could shift.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.430
Does anybody want to take
a crack at deep learning?

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.112
ROMAIN: Anyone?

00:09:22.112 --> 00:09:23.070
Albert raised his hand.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:29.670
STUDENT: So deep
learning involves

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.170
using large neural networks
to perform machine learning,

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:36.120
so it's sort of a subset
of machine learning.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.127
But it can be very powerful,
and most of the time,

00:09:39.127 --> 00:09:41.460
it just gets better and better
as you feed it more data.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.835
Other machine
learning algorithms

00:09:42.835 --> 00:09:46.680
tend to have sort of a plateau
and can't improve no matter

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.690
how much data you feed them.

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.700
GARY GENSLER: So important
concept there in a phrase

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.510
was "neural networks."

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.890
Think of our brain's--

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.290
neural, neurology.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:04.380
It's about our brains.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.360
Early computer
scientists started

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.780
to think can we learn something
from how the human brain

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:16.560
works, which is in essence, a
biological computer that takes

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.120
electrical pulses and
stores data, analyzes data,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.760
recognizes patterns.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.830
Even all of us right
now are recognizing

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.960
voice and visual patterns.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.960
That's in our human brain.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.000
So when looking at the brain,
the conceptual framework

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
is could we build a network
similar to the brain,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.380
and thus, using these
words, neural networks.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:43.560
In deep learning and
machine learning,

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.930
there's pattern recognition,
but deep learning

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.990
is a subset of machine
learning that has

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:53.440
multiple layers of connections.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.950
And in machine learning, you
can take a base layer of data

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:02.190
and try to find patterns,
but deep learning

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:04.290
finds patterns in the patterns.

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.760
And you can think of it as
putting it through layers.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.120
Now, if you're in Sloan,
and you're deeply involved

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:17.340
in computer science, and
you also enjoy the topic,

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.780
you can go much further.

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.530
But in this class, we're
not trying to go there.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:28.530
The importance of deep learning
is that it can find and extract

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:32.490
patterns even better
than machine learning,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:36.960
but it takes more computational
power and often more data.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.460
Deep learning is more an
innovation of the 20-teens,

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.390
and by 2011 and 2012, it really
started to change things.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.570
And in the last
eight years, we've

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.590
seen dramatic advancements
even in deep learning.

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:56.070
It's a conceptual framework
of taking a pool of data,

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.630
looking at its patterns,
and going a little higher.

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.760
I'm going to talk about
an example a little bit

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.850
later in this
discussion, but please

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:11.760
bring me back to talk about deep
learning in facial recognition,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.730
deep learning in
autonomous vehicles

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:16.230
and just thinking
about it there,

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.000
and then we'll pull
it back to finance.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:18.992
ROMAIN: Gary?

00:12:18.992 --> 00:12:20.200
GARY GENSLER: Yes, questions?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.050
ROMAIN: We have two questions--
one from Rosana, who's asking,

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:25.230
what is the difference
between representation

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:27.150
learning and deep learning?

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:29.430
And then we'll give
the floor to Pablo.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.930
GARY GENSLER: So
very good question.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:33.510
Representation learning,
you can think almost as

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.580
in between machine
learning and deep learning.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:41.010
If we said, this is almost
like those Russian dolls.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:43.770
The AI is the big vessel.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.890
Machine learning is a
subset, and deep learning

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.420
was a subset of
machine learning.

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.320
Representational learning is
a subset, in this context,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:58.560
of machine learning, and it's
basically extracting features.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.830
So think of machine learning
that's looking for patterns.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.340
It's extracting
features out of data.

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:11.130
So photo recognition, our
standard Facebook photo

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:15.750
recognition that might
recognize Kelly versus Romain

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.910
is extracting certain
features of Kelly's face.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.530
I'm sorry if I'm
picking on you Kelly.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.610
You just happen to
be on my screen.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.650
But it's extracting
features, so some people

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:31.820
call it feature learning or
representational learning,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:36.570
but extracting features as
opposed to specific data.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:38.390
And then deep
learning is generally

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.670
thought of as a subset
even though there

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:46.150
is some debate as to how
you would categorize these.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.920
And you said there
was another question?

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.920
STUDENT: Yeah, hi, Gary.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.070
This is Pablo.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.490
So I just wanted to verify,
because my understanding

00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.220
is that, also, one of the big
differences between machine

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.920
learning and deep learning,
or artificial intelligence

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.390
in general besides
deep learning,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.300
is that deep learning
used unstructured data,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.610
whereas typically, for
machine learning models,

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.390
you need basically tables of
data that you have organized

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.645
and labeled and everything.

00:14:12.645 --> 00:14:14.020
And just the check
whether that's

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:18.640
the difference besides
the additional complexity

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.270
and multiple layers.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.940
GARY GENSLER: So let
me step back and share

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.620
the important vocabulary,
and again this

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.470
is important vocabulary
well beyond being a computer

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.150
scientist.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.400
It's important vocabulary if
you're running a business,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:38.290
and you're trying to get the
most out of data and your data

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:39.710
analytics team.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:42.700
So I'm going to assume we're
talking as if you are now going

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:45.610
to be in a C-suite, and you
want to get the most out

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.340
of your data analytics
teams and so forth--

00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:53.620
is this concept of structured
data versus unstructured data,

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:57.490
and then I'll go to
that specific question.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:06.360
Data that we see all the time
with our eyes, that we read,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.200
that comes into
us, you can think

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.020
of as unstructured
sometimes because it

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.910
doesn't have a label on it.

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:17.200
But if it has a label
on it, all of a sudden,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.270
people call it structured data.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.300
So machine learning,
conceptually,

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:30.120
is that the machines are getting
better at recognizing patterns.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.980
It's primarily about
pattern recognition,

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.990
that the machines are getting
better recognizing patterns off

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:39.110
of the data.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.410
And the question here
is, is machine learning

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:44.050
always structured learning?

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.390
And structured learning
means that the data

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.510
is labeled, that you
have a whole data set,

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.420
and it's labeled.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.580
An example of labeling
I will give you,

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.720
that we all live with in our
daily lives-- how many people--

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.390
just use the blue
hands if you wish.

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:06.190
How many people have ever
been asked in a computer,

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.830
will you please
look at this picture

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.210
and tell us whether
there are any traffic

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:14.243
lights in the picture?

00:16:14.243 --> 00:16:15.910
We want to make sure
you're not a robot.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.680
All right, so here,
I'm just going to--

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.290
Romain, just cold call somebody
that put their hand up.

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:28.510
I want to ask them a question.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.500
ROMAIN: Sophia, please?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.100
GARY GENSLER: All right,
Sophia, are you are unmuted?

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.160
STUDENT: Yes I'm on.

00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:36.327
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so, Sophia, when you go in,

00:16:36.327 --> 00:16:38.270
and you tell the
computer that you're

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:43.160
not a machine, why do you think
they ask you that question?

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.380
STUDENT: To make sure that
there aren't any bots who

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:48.090
are trying to take
advantage of any service

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.840
that the machine
is trying to offer.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.280
GARY GENSLER:
Really good answer.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.550
You're correct, but you're
not completely correct.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.200
What's the other
reason that they're

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:00.755
asking you whether that's
a traffic light or not?

00:17:00.755 --> 00:17:02.130
STUDENT: And also
to collect data

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:04.270
so that they can use
that data for labeling

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:06.020
for future purposes as well.

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.450
GARY GENSLER: So they
are labeling data.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:14.310
They're using Sophia, if I
might say, as free labor.

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:20.940
Sophia is training the data
that Google or whomever

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:22.569
is putting together there.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.670
And thank you, Sofia.

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:26.940
You're labeling that data
so that autonomous vehicles

00:17:26.940 --> 00:17:28.680
will work better in the future.

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.280
You're also frankly
labeling data

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:34.530
to put millions of people
out of jobs as truckers,

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.030
but I don't want
you to get sort of

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:41.040
wrapped up into those sort
of social and public policy

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:43.300
debates, but that's
what's happening.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.270
So back to the earlier question.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.820
Data can be labeled by us.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.490
An earlier form of
labeling was labeling

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.220
what is an A, what is
a B, what is a C, what

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:56.280
are all the letters
of the alphabet

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.680
so that our postal
services now can

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:04.140
use a form of machine learning
to read all of our written

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.090
scratch on envelopes.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:08.520
If we address an
envelope, it can all

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.490
be read by computers
rather than humans.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.750
To your earlier question--

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.230
I went a long way around
this, but machine learning

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.740
can be both unstructured
and structured.

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.100
The question was, is machine
learning always labeled?

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.290
Is machine learning
always structured?

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:26.880
And the answer's no.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.670
Machine learning can also be
unstructured and unlabeled.

00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.640
Deep learning can be
both labeled, which

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.230
is structured, or unlabeled.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.350
Some of the economics and
some of the computer science

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.570
are worthwhile to understand.

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.530
Labeled data can
be trained faster.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:54.580
Label data can, in many regards,
lower your error rates faster

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.620
and have a certain--

00:18:56.620 --> 00:19:02.800
extract correlations better,
but it comes with a cost.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.170
You need to label the
data, and so there's

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.900
some tradeoff of getting Sophia
to label data or other humans

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:16.660
to label data versus
unlabeled data.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:20.320
Think about radiology in
the practice of medicine,

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:25.030
and looking at body
scans or mammograms

00:19:25.030 --> 00:19:28.960
or any form of
radiology to identify

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.910
whether there's an anomaly.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:34.330
There's something that needs
to have further investigation

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:38.890
to see whether it's
a tumor or not.

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:42.130
Radiology is dramatically
changing in the last three

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:46.040
or five years based upon machine
learning and deep learning.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:47.470
Remember, deep
learning just means

00:19:47.470 --> 00:19:50.640
there's multiple layers
of pattern recognition

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.810
in these neural networks.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:57.520
Labeled radiology, labeled
mammograms, or labeled

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:04.730
MRIs will train the
machines faster,

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:11.170
but unstructured, unlabeled
data can also be used.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.930
You need bigger data sets.

00:20:13.930 --> 00:20:15.550
So I went I went
off a little bit,

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:17.050
but I hope that that's helpful.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.080
Other questions, Romain?

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:22.910
ROMAIN: Yes, we have
one from Victor.

00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.164
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:20:24.164 --> 00:20:25.460
STUDENT: Hi, professor.

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.746
I just wanted to
double click on the--

00:20:27.746 --> 00:20:30.530
take a step back in the initial
definitions between machine

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.780
learning and deep learning,
because we were discussing

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.960
that deep learning had
the feature that it

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.970
keeps learning despite the
data growing exponentially.

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.310
It doesn't plateau.

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:44.900
But I don't fully understood
the differentiation between two

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.670
concepts beyond that.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:50.930
GARY GENSLER: So I
didn't disagree or agree

00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:53.030
with that comment,
and I apologize,

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:55.790
I can't remember who said
that deep learning keeps

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.770
to grow exponentially.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:02.000
I think both machine
learning and deep learning--

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.720
both machine learning and
deep learning learn from data,

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.943
and this word "learn" should
be explored a little bit more.

00:21:10.943 --> 00:21:12.860
What machine learning
and deep learning can do

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.770
is extract correlations.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.200
I hope nearly
everybody in this class

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.150
has taken some
form of statistics

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:21.510
at some point in time.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.270
You might have hated
statistics, but we all took it,

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.530
and some of us took
more advanced statistics

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:30.420
where you use linear
algebra and the like.

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.450
But just thinking about a
standard regression analysis--

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.420
a standard regression
analysis finds a pattern,

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.170
generally a linear pattern,
or a quadratic pattern

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.200
if you move on.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.810
Machine learning and deep
learning find pattern,

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:52.850
and they're really remarkable
tools to extract correlations.

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.370
And one of the features
of both machine learning

00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.130
and deep learning is
they look at error rates,

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:03.410
particularly versus data
sets that have been labeled.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.790
And traditionally, what you do
is you have a big data set--

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:11.690
maybe it's millions of pieces
of data that you're training on,

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:14.300
and you take a
random sample of it

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.810
and put it to the side, a
random sample on the side

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.730
that you label.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.580
And then you compare
what comes out

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.740
of the machine learning with
the test data on the side

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.240
and see what's the error rate.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.960
And this labeled set on this
side might say, these are men,

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.600
these are women,
this is a stoplight,

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.700
this is a traffic light,
whatever the labeled data is,

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:45.620
and you see the predictive
model, what's the error rate.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.020
Both machine learning
and deep learning

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:52.130
continue to do quite well.

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:55.080
And I apologize I cannot
remember who said it earlier,

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.390
which student said, deep
learning continues to grow

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:01.830
further than machine learning.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:05.720
It can, but I wouldn't accept
that machine learning can't get

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:08.180
better and lower error rates.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.730
Now, once you get down
to very low error rates,

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.645
that's another
circumstance altogether.

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:18.020
The difference between deep
learning and machine learning

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.540
is that--

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:26.340
I'm going to use photo
recognition software.

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:29.850
If you put a photograph into a
computer, where does it start?

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:34.070
Does anybody-- what does it
see at the very beginning,

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.650
it's base level of data?

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:41.550
STUDENT: The pixel?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:43.470
GARY GENSLER: What did I hear?

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:44.720
STUDENT: I said, the pixels.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.950
GARY GENSLER: Pixels.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.700
So the only thing a
computer can read is pixels.

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:51.840
It has to start with
the pixels and build up,

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:54.400
and the next layer at most--

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.120
and again, I once
pretended to know something

00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.420
about computer science.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:03.820
But I programmed in
Fortran and APL years ago,

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:07.440
and that was before
many of you were born.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.860
But I guess I used to know
how to program something.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.320
But if you read the
pixels, the next layer

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.080
up to find a pattern
in the pixels

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.850
is just small changes
of shade, and then

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:23.700
you can think of the next
layer up from those little--

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:26.130
you can see edges.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:30.060
So the computer has to
sort of go through layers

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.620
from the pixels up to this is
a traffic light versus a stop

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:40.920
sign, and so deep learning
interposes multiple layers

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.000
of pattern recognition.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.430
Some would say that
you need many layers,

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.590
and then other research
shows that, no,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:50.950
once you get to
about three layers,

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.250
there's less and
less return on this.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.570
So let me sort of--

00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:59.285
unless, Romain, is there
other questions, or can I--

00:24:59.285 --> 00:25:00.410
ROMAIN: No, we're all good.

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.650
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so again, this

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:05.150
is just a broad
thing, and we're not

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:06.410
going to spend as much time.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:09.020
But what's natural
language processing?

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.550
Does anybody want to--

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.390
just what are these
words broadly mean?

00:25:20.242 --> 00:25:21.200
ROMAIN: Any volunteers?

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.500
GARY GENSLER: I'll
volunteer, then.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.650
So natural language
processing is just

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:39.550
simply taking human
language, natural language,

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.630
and processing it down
to computer language,

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:47.170
all the way down to
machine readable code,

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:50.050
or going the other direction.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:53.490
So you can almost think
of it as input and output

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:59.080
to the computer, or we
have many, many languages

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:05.170
represented on this call right
here with 99 participants.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:06.910
You can think about
it as translating

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.640
French to German and
German to French,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.060
but instead it's
natural language, what

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.420
we do, down to the computer.

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.680
And this is really important
in terms of user interface

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:25.050
and user experiences, and we'll
get to that a little bit more.

00:26:25.050 --> 00:26:27.300
And then we're going to talk
a lot about which sectors

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.240
in financial services
are being most affected

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.220
at this point in time.

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.100
So I won't call on the class
right now because I want

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.260
to keep moving to go forward.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.490
So we're in to talk about the
financial world and fintech,

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.480
and then-- oops, I
didn't change this.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.680
This slide will-- I'll
shift, because that's

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.840
from the other day.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.360
So we looked at this
slide the other day,

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.100
and it just helps us--

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.960
what is AI machine learning?

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:58.590
Extracting useful
patterns from the data,

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:00.870
using neural networks
that we talked about,

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:04.040
optimizing to lower error rates.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:09.930
Optimizing so that you actually
say with 99% or 99 1/2%

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:13.800
of the time, this is a traffic
light, this is a stop sign.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.810
Actually optimizing.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:18.750
There's lots of programs
that you can use.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.940
Google has TensorFlow, and--

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.070
I don't know.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.260
Have many of you
ever used TensorFlow?

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.210
I don't know all of
your backgrounds,

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:32.197
but any show blue hands?

00:27:32.197 --> 00:27:34.030
I'm not going to call
on you to describe it.

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:36.280
I'm just kind of curious
if there's many people that

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.240
have used TensorFlow or not.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.556
ROMAIN: How about
we go with Devin?

00:27:42.556 --> 00:27:44.380
GARY GENSLER: So Devin's
actually used it.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.880
I wasn't going to
pick on them up,

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.993
but if you wanted to say
anything about it, Devin.

00:27:48.993 --> 00:27:50.410
STUDENT: Yeah, I
can very briefly.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:54.310
So it essentially gives
like a plug-and-play method

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:58.858
to do machine learning and
build neural nets in Python.

00:27:58.858 --> 00:28:01.150
You don't necessarily have
to have a full understanding

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:03.070
of how under the hood works.

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:05.200
You can just add bits as
you want, take bits away

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.133
as you want, and it speeds
up the whole process.

00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:10.300
GARY GENSLER: And so what's
important about that is,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:15.040
just as somebody that
came of age in the 1970s

00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:18.250
and '80s didn't have to learn
how to computer code all

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.800
the way down to
machine readable code,

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.000
they could learn how to use--

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.170
by the 1990s, C++, or C
And C++, and later, Python.

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:34.640
And many people in this
class know how to use Python.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.740
In the machine
learning area, there's

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.360
been plug and play
programs like TensorFlow,

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.250
where you don't need
to actually know

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.290
how to build the data
and things like that.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.080
Most importantly,
and this is if you're

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.380
thinking about
being a data analyst

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.930
or actually building
a business around it,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:29:00.730
it's the data and the questions
you train on the data.

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.790
And most studies have
shown, as of 2019,

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:08.560
that 90%, 95% of the
cost of data analytics

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.930
is what some people might
call cleaning up the data,

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:13.660
making sure the
data's well labeled.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.480
We talked about structured
versus unstructured data

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.440
earlier.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:21.070
Really important about
that labeling, the cost.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:26.430
If you have 1,000 people working
in a machine learning shop,

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:30.420
or 500 people or five,
it is quite likely

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.480
that a big bulk of their time
is standardizing the data, so

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.840
to speak cleaning up the data,
making sure that the fields are

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:46.610
filled, and ensuring that you
can then train on this data,

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:51.507
meaning it's labeled, or
enough of it's labeled.

00:29:51.507 --> 00:29:53.840
And then thinking about what
the questions you're really

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.230
trying to achieve, what
you're trying to extract.

00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:58.490
Why is it happening now?

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.980
This is off of Lex Freeman's
slide again, but why?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.520
Because the hardware, the
tools, the analytics-- a lot

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.960
has shifted in the last
five or eight years.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.710
To give you a sense of what it's
being used for, all of these,

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:13.430
we know.

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:14.540
We know already.

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:18.090
It's dramatically
changing our lives.

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.940
When we're sitting at
home, sheltering at a home,

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.680
and you're thinking
about the next movie,

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.050
and you're on Netflix,
Netflix is telling us

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:27.900
what they think the next
thing we should watch.

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.170
That's training off of
not just the knowledge

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.750
of what each of us
has been watching,

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.080
but it's about what
others are watching.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.270
It's the Postal
Service that no longer

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.260
has to have a human
reading the text,

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:46.020
our scrawl on the envelope.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:50.070
It's Facebook with the facial
recognition programs and so

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:55.380
forth, and autonomous
vehicles that

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.570
are now being
tested on the roads

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:00.240
but are very likely
part of our future.

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.800
Now, will they be rolled out in
a dramatic way in five years,

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.360
or will it be 15 years?

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.100
But I would feel
comfortable that we

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.670
will have autonomous
vehicles on the road

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:16.080
sometime at least by the
2030, but maybe others

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.610
would be more optimistic.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.540
So it's changing a lot
in many, many fields.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:26.370
The question is now, how is it
shifting this field of finance?

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:32.295
Why do I put it at the center
of what we're doing here?

00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.065
So we talked about this.

00:31:37.065 --> 00:31:39.570
This was just my little
attempt, and so now you

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.080
have a slide that does what
we chatted about before.

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:49.895
One important thing also is
happening is, in finance--

00:31:49.895 --> 00:31:51.270
[CLEARING HIS THROAT]
excuse me--

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.680
people are grabbing alternative
data, using alternative data.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.490
I said earlier that the
most important questions

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:02.340
are what's the good data?

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:06.870
So then we think about, in
finance, what type of data

00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:09.480
do we want to grab?

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.810
Data analytics in finance
goes back centuries.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:14.730
That is not new.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.040
The Medicis, when
they had to figure out

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.300
to whom to land
in Renaissance era

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.840
had to figure out who
is a good credit or not.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.110
And two data scientists from
Stanford started a company

00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:29.790
called Fair Isaac--

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:32.940
those were their last
names, Fair and Isaac--

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:36.030
and that became the FICO
company, the Fair Isaac

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.670
Company.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:41.530
So the data analytics in
finance and the consumer side

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:45.540
has certainly been around
since the 1950s and 1960s,

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.470
but where we are
now is to say what

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:50.380
is the additional types of
data that we might take,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:54.970
and not just banking and
checking and so forth?

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.540
But Alibaba can look at a
company, look at a company

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.440
very closely, and do a full
cash flow underwriting.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.740
Alibaba, because
they have AliPay,

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.550
can see what that small
business is spending

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:12.500
and what that small
business is receiving.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:15.440
Amazon Prime can't
quite do it as much,

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.570
but they can do a
bit of it as well.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.150
And even Toast, which
is a fintech company

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:25.440
in the restaurant business
until this Corona shut down,

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.600
Toast could see a
lot about what's

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:31.590
happening restaurant by
restaurant in their cash flows.

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:37.600
They had the revenue side more
than the expenditure side.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.700
Alibaba, much better
data sets than Toast,

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:47.840
but I wouldn't put at rest
a Toast started earlier

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:53.120
in the last year to do credit
extension to the restaurant

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.470
business.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.990
Now, do you need deep
learning and machine learning

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.680
to do that?

00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.940
Not necessarily.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.790
You can still use
plain old regression

00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:07.160
and linear statistics,
linear regression analysis,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:12.975
but machine learning and deep
learning help you go further.

00:34:12.975 --> 00:34:14.600
And then there's, of
course, everything

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.350
about our usage, our browser
history, our email receipts,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:19.429
and so forth.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.310
If we look at China,
they've stood up

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:28.670
a broader social credit
system, and in that system,

00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:32.989
they can tap into
data about users

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.370
in many different platforms.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:36.460
Romain, do I see--
are you waving at me?

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.406
Is there a question?

00:34:38.406 --> 00:34:39.239
ROMAIN: No, I'm not.

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:40.440
Sorry for that.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.732
GARY GENSLER: That's all right.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:47.080
So natural language
processing, I mentioned.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.139
I just want to say a
few more words about it.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:55.120
Think of it as computers input
and output interpretation.

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:58.430
This sort of going
from German to French,

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:03.760
or going from computer language
to human language and back

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:04.780
again.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.710
That's this important
back and forth,

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:10.960
and so it's natural
language understanding,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:14.500
meaning a computer understands
something, and also

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.570
natural language generation.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.260
So it can be audio,
image, video,

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:24.590
any form of communication--
even a gesture.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.480
This hand wave can
be interpreted--

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:32.220
if not now in 2020, within a
few years will be interpreted.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:37.210
A movement of your face
will be interpreted as well.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:44.340
And so how it's being used
is really quite interesting,

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:48.740
but we all know about chat bots
and voice assistance already.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.250
That's shifting our worlds.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:52.790
Yeah?

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.650
ROMAIN: We have a
question from Nadia.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.600
GARY GENSLER: Nadia, please.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.030
STUDENT: I have one question
related to the chat bots.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:00.470
What kind of
factors do you think

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:02.300
will encourage people
to use chat bots?

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:04.910
Because now, I do
think people prefer

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:09.280
to talk to a person
rather than chat bots.

00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.700
GARY GENSLER: Well,
I think, Nadia,

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.280
we might still prefer
to talk to a person,

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.950
but there's a certain
efficiency in--

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:23.860
and I'm just going to stay
in finance for a minute.

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:29.750
But there's a certain efficiency
that financial service firms

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:34.010
find that they can use chat
bots instead of putting

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.250
a human on the phone.

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.930
So even when you and I call
up to a Bank of America,

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:43.800
and we want to check in on
something on our credit cards,

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.720
we're put through a
various series of push one

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.150
if you want this, push
two if you want that,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:51.870
and we're pushing buttons.

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:55.610
That's not high
technology, by the way,

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:58.820
but that's an efficiency
that Bank of America

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.060
has interposed into the
system instead of having

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.640
a call center of humans.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.750
And so if they can move
from a cost center of humans

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:14.050
to an automated call
center of chat bots,

00:37:14.050 --> 00:37:19.150
they can provide services at a
lower cost and to more people.

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:22.930
Now, you and I might still
want a human on the other side,

00:37:22.930 --> 00:37:28.710
but business is
interposing an automation,

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:36.050
and that automation means,
often, quicker response time.

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:39.890
So many of us, you go
into a website today,

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:44.870
and there's a little bot
window that comes up.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:49.940
And the first thing that
comes up on so many websites--

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.460
and this is true if
it's a financial site.

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:57.290
It's true if it's a
commercial website where

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:58.850
you're buying something online.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.920
It's probably true
of dating websites,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.410
that there's some little bot
window that comes up and says,

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:05.060
can we help you.

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.620
That's not a human, but it
does give us greater service.

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.920
It gives us an immediate
recognition somebody's

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.280
answering a question.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.530
Nadia, do I sense you'd
prefer not to have

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:18.970
the chat bots interposed?

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:28.000
Is Nadia still there?

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.760
STUDENT: Oh, yeah.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.810
Yeah, because I do
think sometimes,

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:34.420
chat bots, we ask a
question, but their answer

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:38.320
is not really related
to our questions.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.720
GARY GENSLER: So you
would prefer a human

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:44.950
because you think the human
will interpret your question

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.920
and be able to answer it better?

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.840
STUDENT: Yes.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.290
GARY GENSLER: So if the chat
bot could answer as well

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:53.700
as Kelly could answer--

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.840
again, I'm sorry, Kelly.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.280
You're on my screen.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.380
But if the chat bot could answer
as well as Kelly or Camillo

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:03.480
or others in this
class could answer,

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.590
you'd be all right with that?

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.213
STUDENT: Yeah, it's faster.

00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:09.630
GARY GENSLER: See,
if it's faster,

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:11.320
and it can answer as well.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.084
So those are some of the
commercial challenges.

00:39:15.084 --> 00:39:18.230
ROMAIN: I think Ivy would
like to contribute as well.

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:20.340
GARY GENSLER: Sure.

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:24.660
STUDENT: Yeah, I just wanted
to offer a little bit of some

00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.490
of the consumer
studies that we did

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:28.610
when I was working
for a startup where

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:30.180
we were building chat bot.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:34.230
And interesting enough, I
think most people are actually

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.740
pretty--

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.410
and we did a pretty
large survey,

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.490
and most people were
pretty open to the idea

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:42.240
of working with a chat
bot because I think

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:44.310
that's become so pervasive.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:47.040
But then there's
this idea, they want

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.490
to know that it is a chat
bot, that the company is very

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.890
transparent about that,
because people change

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.110
their behavior when they
are speaking to the chat

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:58.110
bot or some kind of
virtual assistant,

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.340
as long as they know,
just to build that trust.

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.370
And also, I guess
we try to be more

00:40:02.370 --> 00:40:05.190
explicit in our
wording, both verbally

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:07.500
as well as written texts.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.660
And then secondly,
I think because--

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.900
I guess I wanted to pose
this as a question, too.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.300
When I think about chat
bots and things like that,

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.540
the technology is not
necessarily there,

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:22.920
or it takes a long time.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:28.110
And so I'm just curious what
your thoughts are in terms of--

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:35.360
for me, I see it as like AI
gets us 80% of the way there,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.210
but we need the human
touch 20% of the way there.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:41.280
And so I actually see a lot
of companies either having

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.030
that human at the end of the--

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.260
you ultimately still need a
human at the end of the day.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.825
So I mean, I just wanted
to explore that a little.

00:40:48.825 --> 00:40:51.950
GARY GENSLER: I think what
Nadia and Ivy are raising,

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.900
and I'm sure we're all
grappling with this.

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.480
We are living in a
very exciting time,

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.460
and I'm not talking
about this corona crisis.

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.580
That's a different
type of challenge.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:06.320
But we're living
in an exciting time

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:10.190
where we can automate a lot of
things that humans have done.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:12.230
We've automated so
many things that humans

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.420
have done for
centuries, but we're now

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:19.070
automating this
interface, through chat

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:24.310
bots and conversational
interfaces, voice assistance.

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:28.550
I would dare say that, of the
90-plus people in this class

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:32.570
now, that most of us, if not all
of us, at some point in time,

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:34.540
have used Siri.

00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.460
I mean, if we're
driving along a highway,

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.800
and we're supposed
to be hands free,

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.210
we might talk and start up
an app or something legally,

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.240
legally.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.270
And there's a lot of
automation that's going on.

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:56.280
How many of us have called
to arrange a reservation

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.140
at a restaurant, and
we're not quite sure

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:04.050
if we're talking to a human
or a conversational agent?

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:05.940
But I think that
what Ivy's saying

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:12.690
is that there might always need
to be a human somewhere there.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:15.630
I don't know, Ivy,
if that's correct.

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:18.390
That's where we are in 2020.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.310
Let's think about
autonomous vehicles.

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.760
Right now, we're not
comfortable enough.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.080
The manufacturers aren't
comfortable enough.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:27.840
The computer scientist
aren't comfortable enough.

00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:29.550
The regulators aren't
comfortable enough.

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:31.080
The public's not
comfortable enough

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:35.910
to have autonomous vehicles
on the road with no humans

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:41.280
whatsoever, but that's
not really necessarily

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.710
where we'll be in 2030.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.090
Or take radiology.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:48.930
Right now, at least
in advanced economies

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:51.840
like in Europe and
the US and elsewhere,

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.580
in advanced economies,
we say we still

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.100
want a doctor's eyes on
a radiologist report.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.920
So the mammogram might be read
by some artificial intelligence

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:07.380
machine learning trained data,
but we still have a human.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:11.370
But is that really the tradeoff
we'll make in a few years?

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:13.140
And is it the right
tradeoff to be

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.140
made in less developed
countries, where

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.170
they don't have the resources
to have the doctors?

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.440
And now, we even look in
the middle of this crisis,

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.870
the corona crisis, if--

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:27.300
this is sort of God willing.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.380
If the Baidus of China
and the Googles of the US

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:35.280
and others sharp
analytic AI shops

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.540
come up with a way to
extract patterns and develop

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:43.770
some recognition as to
who's most vulnerable,

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.140
are we going to rely
on that, or are we

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.380
going to say a human has to also
interpret it and be involved

00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:50.820
in it?

00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:52.410
And I don't know.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:54.270
So I think we're
at an exciting time

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.150
where we're automating
more and more.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.250
I do agree with you,
Ivy, there's always

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:00.540
going to be a role for humans.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:06.360
I'm not terribly worried that
we'll all be put out of a job.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:10.130
200 years ago, our ancestors,
all of our ancestors,

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:12.155
were, by and large,
working on farms.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:16.950
That's the economies.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:20.340
And we have found other
things to fill those roles

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:21.930
and those needs.

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:28.370
I think we'll still have the
humans, but not in every task.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.200
So let me go through
a little bit--

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.000
so the Financial
Stability Board, this is

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.520
their definitions
I'm going to pass on,

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.890
but this was in that
paper that you all

00:44:40.890 --> 00:44:43.950
read about what big data
and machine learning was.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:46.560
When I show this page
to computer scientists,

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:50.970
when I show it to
colleagues of mine at MIT

00:44:50.970 --> 00:44:54.375
from the College of
Computing, they look at it,

00:44:54.375 --> 00:44:56.250
and they say, jeez,
that's funny that a bunch

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:59.010
of financial
treasury secretaries

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:01.680
and central bankers
and their staffs

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.930
define big data machine
learning this way.

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.090
So I partly put
it up because this

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:10.170
is kind of what the regulators
define as to what it is.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:12.810
Machine learning may be defined
as a method of designing

00:45:12.810 --> 00:45:16.200
sequence of actions to solve a
problem, known as algorithms,

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.090
and so forth.

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.440
Computer scientists would name
it a little bit differently.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.230
So I said to you
the other day that I

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:28.220
think of financial technology
as history is building

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:32.570
on these things, but machine
learning and deep learning

00:45:32.570 --> 00:45:34.480
is at this top level.

00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.620
In the customer interface,
it's the chat box

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:41.960
we were just talking about, and
on the risk management side,

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:45.420
it's extracting patterns to
make better risk decisions.

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:48.770
So it's in these
two broad fields,

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:54.040
I sort of think of it is
the customer interface

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:57.970
and then lowering risk
and extracting patterns.

00:45:57.970 --> 00:45:59.800
And sometimes, it's
not just lowering risk.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.020
It's enhancing returns.

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:04.600
And so I was going to
go through and chat

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:09.700
about each of these
eight areas, and not

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:12.190
all of the areas we're going
to talk about are as robust.

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.390
Asset management, right now--

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.480
asset management from
hedge funds all the way

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:21.990
to the BlackRock and Fidelity
are exploring the use

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:24.530
of machine learning and AI.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.710
By and large, most high
frequency trading shops,

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:31.520
most hedge funds today,
most asset managers today,

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:35.740
are not using much
machine learning and AI.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:40.150
I view that as an
opportunity in the 2020s.

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:45.640
I view that as a real
possibility of a shift, a very

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:46.630
significant shift.

00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:49.180
But where is it
being used so far?

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:51.730
So BlackRock has been
announcing and saying

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.320
that they're already
using BlackRock

00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:55.960
as one of the world's, if
not the world's, largest

00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:57.610
asset manager.

00:46:57.610 --> 00:47:00.820
Before this corona crisis,
probably $6 or $7 trillion

00:47:00.820 --> 00:47:01.940
of assets.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:05.470
It's, of course, a
lower number now.

00:47:05.470 --> 00:47:06.970
And BlackRock and
others have been

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.470
saying we're using machine
learning to actually listen

00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:16.930
to all of the audio files,
all of the audio files

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:18.910
of the major companies
when they announce

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:22.080
their quarterly earnings.

00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:29.210
And they're also putting in
news articles, digital news

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:32.330
or articles about
those announcements,

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:37.790
and also feeding in some of
the actual financial statements

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.920
that are released.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.480
And that takes a little bit of
natural language processing.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.780
You need some form of
taking the audio files,

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.580
taking the written files,
and interpreting that.

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:55.490
But with that data they're
looking for sentiment.

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:59.510
They're trying to
interpret the sentiments

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.550
and see if the stock
price are moving

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:05.700
based on all of that data.

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.790
Now, that's BlackRock with
$6 or $7 trillion of assets.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:11.650
They're deeply resourced,
fidelity, and so forth.

00:48:11.650 --> 00:48:13.530
But if you go down
the value chain,

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.890
if you go down to
smaller asset managers,

00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:21.920
they're not doing a
lot, I would say, yet.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:24.530
But there are hedge funds
that are specifically saying,

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:26.720
we are data analytic
hedge funds.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.130
We want to move
a little further.

00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:31.130
We want to try to use this
machine learning because it's

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:34.225
a better way to
extract correlations,

00:48:34.225 --> 00:48:35.600
and that's what
it's looking for.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.580
It's pattern recognition.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:40.790
I think that you're going
to see more and more high

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:44.510
frequency trading shops and
hedge funds exploring this.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.030
But one conversation I had
in the last couple of months

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.800
with the high frequency
trading shop--

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.170
and it was a shop that
had about 100 employees.

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:54.100
It was not big, but
it was big enough.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.770
It was certainly making
money in those days.

00:48:57.770 --> 00:49:00.620
I don't know how it's doing now.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.430
But they said, look, we feel
pretty good about what we do,

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:09.500
and when we look for
algorithms, when we look--

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:14.270
our algorithmic trading doesn't
need all of that expenditure

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:17.300
and all that resource
intensive thing of machine

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:21.180
learning and cleaning up the
data and finding the patterns.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:26.930
And in fact, we think that is
not flexible enough yet for us.

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:30.950
We're looking for short
term opportunities,

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:35.110
and we think that regression
analysis and our classic linear

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:39.000
and correlation analyses
are enough at this moment.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.480
What's going to come in
2023 is a different thing,

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.290
but what they're doing now,
[INAUDIBLE] not really needed.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.260
Questions about asset
management just before I

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:49.930
go to a couple other fields?

00:49:52.792 --> 00:49:55.250
ROMAIN: Now is the time to
raise your hand if you have any.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.433
I don't see any, Gary.

00:49:59.433 --> 00:50:01.002
GARY GENSLER: So cost--

00:50:01.002 --> 00:50:03.880
STUDENT: Sorry, Gary, I
raised it in the last second,

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.030
so Romain didn't see it.

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.210
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:07.210 --> 00:50:08.530
STUDENT: My question is--

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:11.320
so I fully understand
their claims

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.960
that this is not the claims
of the asset manager,

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:18.840
you were talking of
high speed trading.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:22.320
I don't see why machine
learning or any algorithm

00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:25.922
besides linear regression
doesn't have enough flexibility

00:50:25.922 --> 00:50:27.630
to actually replicate
what they're doing,

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:31.860
but with a bit more of
accuracy or computing

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:35.250
performance, et cetera,
because in the end,

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:37.770
my understanding is
that you need the same--

00:50:37.770 --> 00:50:39.300
except when you go
to deep learning.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:41.448
But you need the
same data sources

00:50:41.448 --> 00:50:43.740
that you currently have, and
the only thing that you're

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:49.640
going to do is, instead of just
having linear models predicting

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.990
the different traits
that you want to do,

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:55.260
you have other
models that can find

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.330
alternative basically
trends and et cetera.

00:50:58.330 --> 00:51:00.850
So I don't see the
limitation there of using it.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:03.790
GARY GENSLER: So I think you
raise a really good point.

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:06.110
We're in a period of transition.

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:09.570
I personally don't think
that machine learning

00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:13.440
and deep learning is the
answer to all these pattern

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.350
recognition
challenges in finance.

00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:23.280
But you will find I'm more to
the sort of center maximalist

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:25.480
than center minimalist,
and those of you

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:28.470
that know me, that when we talk
about blockchain technology,

00:51:28.470 --> 00:51:31.740
you'll find I'm more to
the center minimalist side.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:35.010
But what I mean by that is
I think that the pattern

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.900
recognition out of deep
learning, machine learning--

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.340
and by pattern recognition I
mean the ability to extract,

00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:47.810
with remarkable ability,
correlations and then create

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:51.650
certain decision sets based
on those correlations--

00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:56.660
is better than classic linear
algebra, classic regression

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:58.370
analysis.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:03.380
But it comes with a cost, and
that's the tradeoff in 2020.

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.190
Maybe in a handful of
years, it'll be less cost,

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:10.460
but I'm going to use
an example, which

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.060
is not about asset management,
but it's about lending.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:18.740
I had this conversation just
a few weeks ago with the CEO

00:52:18.740 --> 00:52:21.000
of a major peer to
peer lending company,

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.940
and as this is
being recorded, I'm

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:27.530
just going to maybe
not say his name.

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.820
And I said, do you use
machine learning and deep

00:52:31.820 --> 00:52:36.410
learning to do your
credit decisions,

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.150
all your credit decisions?

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:41.720
And he said, yes, we use
a lot of alternative data.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.150
We run it into
the decision sets,

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.650
and we see what patterns emerge.

00:52:46.650 --> 00:52:49.040
And I said, so you extend
credit then based on that?

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.290
He said, well, not exactly.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:55.280
He said, what we do is,
we look for patterns,

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:57.920
and then when we find
them, we then just

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:04.300
use classic algebra and linear
flagging when we actually

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:05.770
extend the credit.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.927
So we use it to
look for patterns,

00:53:09.927 --> 00:53:12.385
but then we sort of use the
traditional way, and I ask why.

00:53:12.385 --> 00:53:13.843
He said, well,
there's two reasons.

00:53:13.843 --> 00:53:17.800
It's less costly than running
the whole thing all the time,

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:21.940
and two, they can explain
it better to regulators,

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.850
and they can explain it
better to the public.

00:53:24.850 --> 00:53:26.890
And at least in
consumer finance,

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:30.070
there were laws passed about
50 years ago-- in the US,

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.620
it's called the Fair
Credit Reporting Act.

00:53:32.620 --> 00:53:34.240
These laws were
passed and said if you

00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:36.610
deny somebody credit you
have to be able to explain

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:39.430
why you're denying them credit.

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:41.950
And of course, there are other
laws in many other countries

00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:43.630
similar to that,
and there are also

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:46.450
laws about avoiding biases.

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.720
In our country, we call it
the Equal Credit Opportunity

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:52.030
Act or ECOA, and
in other countries,

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.580
similar things about
avoiding biases

00:53:54.580 --> 00:54:00.440
for gender and race and
background and the like.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.420
So I'm just saying that,
whether it's asset management,

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.280
whether it's consumer
credit, there's

00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.260
some tradeoffs of these
new data analytic tools.

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:17.580
And those tradeoffs, I think,
in the next handful of years,

00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:22.800
will keep tipping in the way
towards using deep learning.

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.910
But they don't come--

00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:28.300
they're not cost free
is what I'm saying.

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.040
ROMAIN: José has his hand up.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.390
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:34.150
STUDENT: So you
talked a bit about how

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:37.390
this is impacting the high
frequency trading shops.

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:39.730
Is there something
similar happening

00:54:39.730 --> 00:54:43.450
on more like value investing
long term or in the hedge

00:54:43.450 --> 00:54:44.240
funds?

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:48.370
So I heard some of them
are using satellite image

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:50.188
to predict the number of cars--

00:54:50.188 --> 00:54:51.730
to see the number
of cars [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:54.200
and predict the sales for
that year, things like that.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:58.600
But I don't know, do you see a
lot of headroom in this area?

00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:02.680
GARY GENSLER: I think there
is headroom where I'm saying,

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.100
I've mentioned two areas,
but I think you're right.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.150
There's a third area.

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:10.450
The two areas are
sentiment analysis, just

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:15.460
sentiment analysis around
either an individual company

00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.800
or the overall
markets and seeing

00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:21.730
what the sentiment, the
mood, the sense of the crowd

00:55:21.730 --> 00:55:29.300
is off of words,
images, or the like.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.410
And then also the
high frequency traders

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:35.950
and so forth just looking for
the patterns in the short term

00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.060
trading.

00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.360
You're talking about more on
the broader value orientation,

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.880
and I absolutely share
your view that we'll

00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.980
see more of that develop.

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:48.670
I haven't heard a lot of it,
but you're right about sector

00:55:48.670 --> 00:55:51.450
after sector that you
might be able to analyze.

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:55.050
But again, it has
to have some ability

00:55:55.050 --> 00:56:01.000
to extract a pattern better
than classic linear regressions

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.200
in analysis.

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.200
So let me just try to hit
a couple more of these

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.825
because we're going
to run out of time,

00:56:05.825 --> 00:56:08.010
but we are going to talk
Monday more about these.

00:56:08.010 --> 00:56:11.040
We talked about call centers,
chat bots, robo-advising,

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.710
and so forth, so I
think you've got that.

00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.770
A lot of that is
not just efficiency,

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:22.150
but it's also inclusion.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:24.940
You can cover many,
many more people

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:27.760
by automating some
of these tasks.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.940
It's just reality,
it's the tradeoff

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:38.620
of efficiency and inclusion,
that you cover far more people.

00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:40.660
You can also be more targeted.

00:56:40.660 --> 00:56:44.280
You can be more targeted
with advice and so forth

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:45.760
as these are automated.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.500
It comes with the tradeoff
that Ivy and Nadia

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:52.120
were talking about earlier.

00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:54.880
Credit and insurance--
this is the concept

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:57.550
of basically how you
allocate or extend

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:03.550
or price, either alone
or price insurance.

00:57:03.550 --> 00:57:06.960
To date, the insurance companies
and insurance underwriting

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:09.510
are starting to grapple with
this, starting to move on,

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:11.610
and we'll talk about
some fintech companies

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.830
in this space.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.760
I think that insurance companies
have been a little bit slower

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.250
to do it than, let's
say, the credit card

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:23.340
companies, but the allocation--

00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:26.940
I think this will be
dramatically shifting.

00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:29.480
I think if you look at
what's going on, again,

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.970
in consumer credit and small
business credit in China,

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:35.430
through WeChat Pay
and AliPay, they're

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:40.640
much further along than we
are, frankly, here in the US.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:47.190
We're still largely reliant on
a 30 or 40-year-old architecture

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:50.790
around the Fair Isaac
Company, the FICO scores

00:57:50.790 --> 00:57:54.510
that are used in about 30
countries around the globe.

00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:58.500
These are still quite
limited, but FICO itself,

00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.590
FICO itself rolls out
new versions of FICO

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:02.760
every few years.

00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:07.650
I think they're rolling
out FICO 10.0 this summer,

00:58:07.650 --> 00:58:10.270
or were before
the corona crisis.

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:13.290
I think, if you look at
the end of the 2020s,

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:16.650
either FICO will
not exist at all,

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:21.600
or FICO 14.0 or 15.0
will look a lot more

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.250
like a machine learning,
deep learning type of model.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:29.280
What it is right now
is pretty rudimentary

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.490
compared to what it could
be in 5 or 10 years.

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:36.890
This is an area that's
being used a lot--

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:38.850
fraud detection and prevention.

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:40.940
The credit card
companies, if you

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:46.640
look at Cap 1 and Bank of
America, Discover, American

00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:50.690
Express, they're deeply now
using machine learning tools

00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:52.520
for fraud detection.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:57.230
Many of us probably remember
just a year or two ago,

00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:59.360
you would still call up
your credit card company,

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.610
and you would say I'm
traveling to France,

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:04.430
I'm traveling to Italy,
wherever I'm traveling.

00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:06.350
I want to put a
flag on there that I

00:59:06.350 --> 00:59:09.320
might be using my cell phone--

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:13.470
using my credit card in
one of these countries.

00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:15.560
Well, most companies
now don't ask you

00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.270
to put a travel alert on it.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:18.800
Now, part of that
is because they

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.230
know where we're traveling
because we're walking around

00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:24.870
with these location devices.

00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:28.285
The banks no longer need us
to call them to tell them

00:59:28.285 --> 00:59:29.910
we're going to be in
Paris because they

00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:31.130
know we're in Paris--

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:36.300
this location tracking
company device.

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:40.410
But in addition to
that location device,

00:59:40.410 --> 00:59:42.360
they are also using
machine learning

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.570
to do fraud detection and
prevention in the credit card

00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:47.910
space.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.390
Similarly, they're
using it to track

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:53.000
and try to comply with laws
called anti money laundering.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.520
These two areas, fraud detection
and any money laundering,

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.630
which I might call
compliance broadly,

00:59:59.630 --> 01:00:03.860
are two of the areas most
developed right now in 2020.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.380
That doesn't mean they'll
be the most developed later.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:09.560
I think a lot more will happen
in the underwriting space.

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.945
A lot more will happen in
the asset management space.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.780
Robotic process
automation-- I want

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.490
to just pause for a minute.

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:23.060
Does anybody have a sense of
what these three words together

01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:26.290
mean-- robotic
process automation?

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:29.905
Romain, you get to see if
there's any blue hands up.

01:00:29.905 --> 01:00:32.001
ROMAIN: Andrea.

01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:33.830
STUDENT: Hi.

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:36.600
So robotic process
automation is very simple.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:39.280
You have a lot of
manual processes

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.080
or manual work done
in, for example,

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.020
back office of the banks.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.030
And the idea here
is, instead of people

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:48.550
doing that, low skilled
work or workforce,

01:00:48.550 --> 01:00:53.540
you can actually teach robots
or the algorithms with the PC

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.330
to do it instead of you.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:56.890
So for example,
it can be anything

01:00:56.890 --> 01:00:59.050
as simple as just
going through the forms

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:03.490
and copying or
overwriting and rewriting

01:01:03.490 --> 01:01:09.257
some of the words or parts of
the forms to some other place.

01:01:09.257 --> 01:01:10.090
GARY GENSLER: Right.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:14.320
So robotic process
automation can be as simple

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.330
as you're giving your
permission to a startup

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:26.320
company, a fintech company,
to access your bank account.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:31.000
And one of us gives a fintech
company-- maybe Credit Karma.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.400
We give Credit Karma the
right to go in and look

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.020
at a bank account of ours.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.040
Credit Karma might not have
permission from Bank of America

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:40.490
go in, but they have my--

01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:41.880
I'm permissioned them.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:46.777
I've given them my password
and my user ID, and they go in,

01:01:46.777 --> 01:01:47.860
and they want to automate.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:49.360
Credit Karma wants to automate.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.150
They don't want to have a human
actually have to type that all

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.680
in.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.880
It can be as simple as just
automating inserting the user

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.830
name and the password
and the like,

01:01:59.830 --> 01:02:03.250
but then you go further than
it can navigate the web page.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.830
It can navigate and
click the right buttons

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:08.270
and get the right
data and so forth.

01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:10.090
So robotic process
automation can

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:16.170
be helping a startup
company say Gary Gensler,

01:02:16.170 --> 01:02:18.780
we want you as a
client of Credit Karma.

01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.640
We, Credit Karma,
will figure out

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:23.310
how to interface
with Bank of America

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:26.670
and with Chase and the others.

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:30.870
But also, the banks are using
robotic process automation

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:36.030
to automate so much of their
both back office and their data

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:37.170
entry.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.470
And one form, just
to say, is many

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:43.320
of us now feel very
comfortable to deposit

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.810
a check from our cell phone.

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:49.560
So you can take your cell phone,
take a picture of a check,

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.750
and somehow, that
gives an instruction,

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:56.550
a digital instruction,
to move money.

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:59.580
Well, part of that's
natural language processing,

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:03.880
that the cell phone could take
a picture, read all that data,

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:07.920
put it into computer language,
and actually move a digital.

01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:10.650
Part of that is robotic
process automation.

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:11.910
Romain, was there a question?

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.298
I think I saw some
flashing chat rooms.

01:03:14.298 --> 01:03:15.090
ROMAIN: Yes, sorry.

01:03:15.090 --> 01:03:16.820
You have 15 minutes left.

01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.890
GARY GENSLER: Oh, OK.

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:20.710
Then was there a question or no?

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:22.340
ROMAIN: No question
at this point.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:23.632
GARY GENSLER: So now, trading--

01:03:23.632 --> 01:03:27.280
trading is an area I spent a
lot of time with Goldman Sachs.

01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.640
And in that trading
of the day, we

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.680
were automating everything
we could automate,

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.820
and this is in the 1990s.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.010
And ever since, anything is--

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:41.220
a trading floor in 2020 looks
very different than a trading

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:45.630
floor in the 1990s in terms
of the day to day trading,

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:49.290
and this is trading at
the center of the markets,

01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:55.860
the platforms themselves, and
of course, the high frequency

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.020
traders on the other
end of the market

01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:00.390
is basically just
like asset management.

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:02.010
What patterns can you see?

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.200
Now, this is less
about value investing.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.300
This is the patterns
right in the nanoseconds

01:04:09.300 --> 01:04:11.640
and milliseconds and so forth.

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.580
I'll make one note in terms
of trading, which is not

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.830
related to machine
learning, but just related

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:20.730
to the corona crisis that
we are all living in.

01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:23.970
I have an overall belief
that this coronavirus

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:28.680
crisis will accentuate trends
that we've already seen.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.700
In industry after industry,
if we're locked down

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:37.320
for two, three, or four months,
or God forbid, for 18 or 24

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:38.610
months--

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.130
if we're locked
down for that long,

01:04:41.130 --> 01:04:44.820
we're going to find
new ways to engage

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:47.460
with each other in
economic activity

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:49.620
and social activity
and the like.

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.890
And we've already had
some trends, deep trends--

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:55.770
we talked about them Monday--

01:04:55.770 --> 01:05:00.270
that we're unlikely to be using
many paper money and coinage

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:01.880
money.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:07.250
Three months from now,
nearly 70% or 80% the world

01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:11.390
will have forgotten how to
use paper money and coinage.

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:14.810
In fact, it will even be viewed
as a disease delivery device.

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:15.820
It might be dirty.

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:17.570
It might be something
we don't want to use

01:05:17.570 --> 01:05:21.900
because it could be a problem.

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:23.810
Well, let me talk about
trading for a second.

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:28.340
The New York Stock Exchange
and the world's largest stock

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.620
exchanges are now electronic.

01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.050
They could have done
that two years ago.

01:05:34.050 --> 01:05:35.880
When the Intercontinental
Exchange,

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.580
which is a big public company,
bought the New York Stock

01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:43.110
Exchange a handful of years
ago, five or so years ago,

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.360
Jeff Sprecher, the
entrepreneur who

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.800
started the Intercontinental
Exchange in 1998 or '99,

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.280
he's always been an
entrepreneur, an innovator,

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.098
to do electronic trading.

01:05:55.098 --> 01:05:57.390
They could have taken the
New York Stock Exchange fully

01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:59.040
electronic, but guess what?

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.310
That's what happened in
the last three weeks.

01:06:02.310 --> 01:06:05.750
So after we get out of
this lockdown period,

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:11.370
will we bring back the floor
of these London and New

01:06:11.370 --> 01:06:16.200
York and Shanghai and
Mumbai and so forth?

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.420
Will we bring back the floors?

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.711
I think quite possibly not.

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:29.420
Not sure, but there's a lot
that's shifting on, I think.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.460
Natural language
processing-- we talked

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:35.360
about in customer service,
process automation,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.770
and sentiment analysis.

01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:39.860
These are sort of the
slices that I think about

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:42.690
in these fields.

01:06:42.690 --> 01:06:47.570
So I was curious how many
people have ever used Siri?

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:50.210
Probably almost every
hand would go up.

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:53.225
But how many people
have ever used Erica?

01:06:57.610 --> 01:07:00.572
ROMAIN: So perhaps we
have Shaheryar who'd

01:07:00.572 --> 01:07:01.780
like to share his experience.

01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:05.880
Sorry for your name--
mispronouncing it.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.650
STUDENT: Yeah, so it's
essentially like Siri,

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:11.390
but you actually-- it's a
product of Bank of America,

01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:14.740
and you can use it to
check your spending habits.

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.290
You can also use it to, if
you need things with regards

01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:20.150
to check depositing, or if
you want to know something,

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.990
it can do that.

01:07:20.990 --> 01:07:25.626
But currently, I believe
it's not as refined as Siri,

01:07:25.626 --> 01:07:27.626
and I still think there
is a lot room over there

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:30.650
for improvement.

01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.780
GARY GENSLER: Why do you
think it is that Erica--

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.510
and JP Morgan has one as well.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:38.450
I can't remember
what her name is.

01:07:38.450 --> 01:07:44.960
They all do seem to be
mostly female voices,

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.060
if I'm not mistaken.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:50.980
But why is it that
Erica and the like,

01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:55.040
a virtual assistant, as
they're called in finance,

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.550
aren't as developed as the
Siris and Alexas, do you think?

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:01.885
STUDENT: Sorry, can you
repeat the question?

01:08:01.885 --> 01:08:03.260
GARY GENSLER:
Anybody can answer.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:07.430
Why is it that the finance
virtual assistants like Erica

01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:13.370
are not yet as fully developed
as the Home and other ones

01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:16.050
like Siri and Alexa?

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.240
STUDENT: I believe some of--

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:19.157
I think it's got something
to do with the fact

01:08:19.157 --> 01:08:21.810
that the number of users
for financial assistance

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:25.370
is way lower as compared
to Alexa, Siri, or Alexa

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:26.510
or whatever.

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:30.920
So I believe that is something
which may explain it,

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:35.508
the disparity between these
two kinds of assistants.

01:08:35.508 --> 01:08:36.300
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:39.160
Any other thoughts
on that, one why--

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:43.250
ROMAIN: Nikhil has a different
take, and that we have Laira.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:45.899
STUDENT: Probably along
similar lines, banks so far,

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:49.609
the interactions probably have
been in person or over phones,

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:52.550
and they weren't used to
processing data and processing

01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:53.310
requests.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:55.520
I think they have
a smaller data set

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.960
to go through and understand
what problem customer

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.000
questions are.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.040
And that's probably a limiting
factor versus, say, Siri,

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:07.819
they have much more
data on everyday users.

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:10.583
I think that's probably
the biggest differentiator.

01:09:10.583 --> 01:09:13.000
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, and was
there another comment, Romain,

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:13.790
you said?

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:14.990
Sure.

01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:16.779
ROMAIN: So I think
Laira had her hand up,

01:09:16.779 --> 01:09:18.330
but I think she withdrew it.

01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:20.660
So perhaps we can
hear from Brian.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:21.819
GARY GENSLER: OK.

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:23.960
STUDENT: So in
addition to the data,

01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.439
I think there's also a
human capital element.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:29.410
It's possible that Apple
has better human capital

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:32.840
capabilities than do these
financial institutions,

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:34.510
so it's harnessing
that data as well.

01:09:34.510 --> 01:09:35.420
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.359
So what we've just
talked about was data,

01:09:37.359 --> 01:09:40.779
human capital, experience--

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:41.470
all true.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:43.660
Also, Erica and
the financial firms

01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:48.470
only started more
recently, and so forth.

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:51.970
But the voice recognition
programs and then

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:58.660
taking that data that an
Apple has or their competitors

01:09:58.660 --> 01:10:00.660
in big tech around the globe--

01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:03.430
because it's not
just here in the US--

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:06.400
is really remarkable now.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.710
Even to the extent
that I don't know

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:13.030
how many people use earbuds,
but if you look closely

01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:17.380
at the user agreement on the
airbuds that you use, it says--

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:22.060
and if it's an Apple,
if I'm mistaken,

01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.280
the Apple lawyers will chase me.

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.695
But the user agreement
says that they

01:10:26.695 --> 01:10:32.350
can listen to that to
help you to make sure

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:34.930
that there's not a drop
between your earbuds

01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:37.240
and your cell phone.

01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:45.050
They are picking up vast amounts
of data, vast amounts of data

01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:47.240
from our text messaging.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.340
If you look at
something like Google,

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:53.060
they're picking it up from
Google Chrome, Google Maps,

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:55.180
Gmail.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:57.310
Multiple places that
they can pick up,

01:10:57.310 --> 01:11:00.640
and we talked about this
conceptually, big tech

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.120
versus big finance versus
startups in this triangle

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:06.910
of competitive landscape.

01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:10.090
And why I wanted to sort of
close on Bank of America Erica

01:11:10.090 --> 01:11:12.460
and this discussion
of Erica versus Siri

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:18.020
and Alexa is big tech using
Google, just as an example,

01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:22.270
has this remarkable network that
they're layering activities.

01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:25.430
Remember, we said data
network activities--

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:29.040
that's the Bank of International
Settlement way to put it,

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:30.520
and what a perfect
example to show.

01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:32.680
Google has Gmail.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.660
It has Maps.

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:36.100
It has Google Chrome.

01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.110
It has Android, the
operating system.

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:42.070
So all of these different
ways to build their network,

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:44.980
and they layer
activities on top of it,

01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:47.890
and then vast amounts
of data come in

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:52.430
and the human capital that was
mentioned at the end there.

01:11:52.430 --> 01:11:56.350
And they have more experience
to move it forward.

01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:58.400
Apple, similarly.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:04.290
Baidu and Alibaba in China
and so forth, similarly.

01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:07.800
If I were a CEO of
a big incumbent,

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:12.774
yes, I would be very focused
on the fintech startups, but I

01:12:12.774 --> 01:12:13.710
tell you--

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:16.230
I'd be looking at
big tech in a way

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:20.010
that their advantages are
really significant, very

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:22.260
significant advantages.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.225
Romain, I see some
hands up maybe.

01:12:25.225 --> 01:12:28.310
ROMAIN: We now have Laira
who has her hand up.

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:32.060
STUDENT: Yeah, I'm just curious
to know what do you think?

01:12:32.060 --> 01:12:37.580
So currently, we know that tech
has kind of-- or AI has kind of

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.890
emerged to the financial
and payment space

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:41.820
in the form of
virtual assistants,

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:45.170
but what do you anticipate the
next step would be in terms

01:12:45.170 --> 01:12:48.370
of this integration
of technology and AI

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:50.090
into the payment space?

01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:54.610
What next after the
virtual assistants?

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:57.440
GARY GENSLER: We're going to
have a whole class on payments

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.960
specifically, but
I think that what's

01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:04.060
happening in the
payment space is

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.690
we've seen specialized
payment service providers.

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:09.640
Of course, we've seen a
lot of the competition

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.400
starting with PayPal in 1998.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:18.460
This is not a new
space for disruption.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.890
But what we've
seen more recently

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:24.640
is, in the retail space, whether
it's companies I've mentioned

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.490
earlier, like Toast, that
got into one vertical,

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:31.010
one slice within payments,
which was restaurants--

01:13:31.010 --> 01:13:38.280
they can provide a better
product for that slice.

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.780
And then can collect back
to AI enough robust data

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.550
within that slice--

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:47.640
this is using Toast
as an example--

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:54.420
that they can provide better
software, better hardware,

01:13:54.420 --> 01:14:00.090
and also less risk loans.

01:14:00.090 --> 01:14:03.030
Basically, as Toast
started to provide lending

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:08.430
to restaurants within that
space, built upon the payment.

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:13.740
So it's the marriage between
the user experience providing

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:14.550
the users--

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:17.170
in that case, the restaurants
in the payment space--

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:20.940
but providing the users
in that space something

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:23.780
that the generalized platform--

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.340
a bank payment system
is generalized.

01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.460
It's multi sector.

01:14:29.460 --> 01:14:31.635
It's a general
product, and Toast

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:33.510
was able to say, no, we
can provide something

01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:35.233
that just restaurants--

01:14:35.233 --> 01:14:36.900
there might be something
a little unique

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:38.760
about the restaurant
business that we can

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.740
provide software and hardware.

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.750
In their case, it was tablets.

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:45.330
They were providing
tablets for the servers

01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:48.000
to walk around and
take the orders.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.540
They could integrate the menu
right into the payment app.

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:54.630
So there was something a
little bit unique about that.

01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:57.450
But then based on that,
they get a bunch of data,

01:14:57.450 --> 01:15:01.020
and that data helps
them with, I would say,

01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:04.770
underwriting
decisions based on--

01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:07.040
it doesn't have to
be machine learning.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.010
But it's enhanced data analytics
because of machine learning.

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:12.020
So I hope that helps.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:15.670
I think on the
conversational agents

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:19.610
and the virtual assistants,
what we're seeing in the payment

01:15:19.610 --> 01:15:21.230
space, because that
was your question,

01:15:21.230 --> 01:15:26.960
is we're moving from
card authorized payments

01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:30.260
to mobile app QR codes.

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:35.540
Then the QR codes is not
based upon virtual assistants,

01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:37.820
but it's an interesting
question whether we'll

01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:42.830
get to some voice
authenticated payments.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:48.080
There are a lot of uses of
voice authentication already.

01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:50.930
Vanguard and many
other asset managers,

01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:52.760
where you can have your
brokerage accounts,

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:55.220
you can call in and
get voice authenticated

01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.640
before you can do a trade.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.280
And that voice
authentication is just

01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.900
like other forms
of authentication,

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:09.840
but it's not perfect
as of this moment.

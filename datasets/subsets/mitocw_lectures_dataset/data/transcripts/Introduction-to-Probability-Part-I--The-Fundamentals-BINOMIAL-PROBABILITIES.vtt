00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
The coefficients n-choose-k
that we calculated in the

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.220
previous segment are known as
the binomial coefficients.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.060
They are intimately related
to certain probabilities

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.590
associated with coin tossing
models, the so-called binomial

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.930
probabilities.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.670
This is going to
be our subject.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.540
We consider a coin which we
toss n times in a row,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.190
independently.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.840
For each one of the tosses of
this coin, we assume that

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.360
there is a certain probability,
p, that the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.290
result is heads, which of
course, implies that the

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.340
probability of obtaining tails
in any particular toss is

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.180
going to be 1 minus p.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.740
The question we want to address
is the following.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.400
We want to calculate the
probability that in those n

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.010
independent coin tosses,
we're going to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.835
observe exactly k heads.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.980
Let us start working our way
towards the solution to this

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.600
problem by looking first
at a simple setting

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.300
and then move on.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.600
So let us answer this
simple question.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.530
What is the probability
that we observe

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.940
this particular sequence?

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.780
Of course here we take n equal
to six, and we wish to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.020
calculate this probability.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.200
Now, because we have assumed
that the coin tosses are

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.250
independent, we can multiply
probabilities.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.000
So the probability of this
sequence is equal to the

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.690
probability that the first
toss is heads times the

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.850
probability that the second
toss is tails, which is 1

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.860
minus p, times the probability
that the third toss is tails,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.460
which is 1 minus p, times the
probability of heads, times

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.820
the probability of
heads, times the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.289
probability of heads.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.290
And by collecting terms, this is
p to the 4th times 1 minus

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.620
p to the second power.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.840
More generally, if I give you a
particular sequence of heads

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.910
and tails, as in this example,
and I ask you, what is the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.710
probability that this particular
sequence is

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.160
observed, then by generalizing
from this answer or from the

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.170
derivation of this answer, you
see that you're going to get p

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.615
to the power number of heads.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.940
And the reason is that each
time that there's a head

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.220
showing up in this sequence,
there's a corresponding factor

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.570
of p in this numerical answer.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.450
And then there are factors
associated with tails.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.050
Each tail contributes a
factor of 1 minus p.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.980
And so we're going to have
here 1 minus p to a power

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.910
equal to the number of tails.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.270
Now, if I ask you about the
probability of a particular

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.720
sequence and that particular
sequence has happened to have

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.400
exactly k heads, what is the
probability of that sequence?

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.340
Well, we already calculated
what it is.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.920
It is the previous answer,
except we use the symbol k

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.560
instead of just writing out
explicitly "number of heads."

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.960
And the number of tails is the
number of tosses minus how

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.400
many tosses resulted in heads.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.810
Now, we're ready to consider
the actual problem that we

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.100
want to solve, which
is calculate the

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.010
probability of k heads.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.270
The event of obtaining
k heads can happen in

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.490
many different ways.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.280
Any particular k-head sequence
makes that event to occur.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:04.590
Any particular k-head sequence
has a probability equal to

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.840
this expression.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.170
The overall probability of k
heads is going to be the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:18.230
probability of any particular
k-head sequence, times the

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.170
number of k-head sequences
that we have.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.800
Now, the reason why we can carry
out this argument is the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.090
fact that any k-head sequence
has the same probability.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.520
Otherwise, we wouldn't be able
to write down an answer which

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.980
is just the product
of two terms.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.600
But because every k-head
sequence has the same

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.860
probability, to find the overall
probability, we take

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.050
the probability of each one of
them and multiply it with the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.360
number of how many
of these we have.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.110
So to make further progress, now
we need to calculate the

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.550
number of possible
k-head sequences.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.920
How many are there?

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.340
Well, specifying a k-head
sequence is

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.160
the same as the following.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.580
You think of having
n time slots.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.590
These time slots corresponds
to the different

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.240
tosses of your coin.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.410
And to specify a k-head
sequence, you need to tell me

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.610
which ones of these slots happen
to contain a head.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.420
You need to tell me
k of those slots.

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:40.800
So in other words, what you're
doing is you're specifying a

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.460
subset of the set of
these n slots, a

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.290
subset that has k elements.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:53.070
You need to choose k of the
slots out of the n and tell me

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.630
that those k slots have heads.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.560
That's the way of specifying a
particular k-head sequence.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.630
So what's the number of
k-head sequences?

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.760
Well, it's the same as the
number of ways that you can

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.110
choose k slots out of the n
slots, which is our binomial

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.410
coefficient, n-choose-k.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.420
Therefore, the answer to our
problem is this expression

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:25.590
here, times n-choose-k, which
is shown up here.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.080
At this point, we can pause and
consider a simple question

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.040
to check your understanding of
the binomial probabilities.

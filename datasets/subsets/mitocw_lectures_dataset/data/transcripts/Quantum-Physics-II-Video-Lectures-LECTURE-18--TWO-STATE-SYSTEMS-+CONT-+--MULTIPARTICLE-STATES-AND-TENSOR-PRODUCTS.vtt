00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.200
PROFESSOR: It's
time to get started.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.040
Today, we'll complete
our discussion

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.020
of nuclear magnetic resonance.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.290
And we started that last time.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.020
And after that, we will talk
about multi-particle states,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.860
the kind of quantum
mechanical states

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.840
that you need if your system
has more than one particle.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.460
That will bring us
naturally to the idea

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.260
of denser products of
vector spaces, which

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.910
is the key mathematical
idea behind operations

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.870
such as addition of
angular momentum.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.980
By introducing a little
before, we really

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.460
talk about addition
of angular momentum,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.350
the idea of denser
products of vector spaces.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.860
I really hope that
this subject will

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.130
look a lot less mysterious
in a couple of weeks

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.020
when we will really be
adding angular momentum.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.000
So you will have seen the
main mathematical structures.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.790
And you will know
what you're supposed

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.350
to do when you have a formula.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.110
So that should be of some help.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.140
So last time, we
were talking about

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.770
nuclear magnetic resonance.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.200
And I described the problem.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.110
Here is a summary of where
more or less we got last time.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.970
We said in the set up for
nuclear magnetic resonance,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.250
we have a large magnetic field,
the longitudinal magnetic field

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.070
it's sometimes called,
along the z direction.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.860
In addition to that
longitudinal magnetic field,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.289
there's a rotating magnetic
field in the xy plane.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.835
And it's rotating in the
direction that you see here.

00:02:12.835 --> 00:02:20.350
As seen on the xy plane,
it's clockwise on the plane.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.470
In terms of a rotation
around the z direction,

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.810
it's negative in the sense
that the positive rotation

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.484
around the z plane
would go like this.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:32.787
And this magnetic
field is rotating

00:02:32.787 --> 00:02:34.020
in the other direction.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.390
So I wrote it here.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.820
The magnitude of this radio
frequency component is B1.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.080
And typically, it's
much smaller than B0

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.880
in the problems of interest.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.310
Then, as you recall,
the spin Hamiltonian

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.490
is always given by this
constant gamma that

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.960
relates to the dipole moment of
a particle to its spin angular

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.260
momentum B dot S,
the S operator.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.440
And the S operator
has components

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.270
Sx, Sy, Sz multiplied by
B. Well, the z component

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.172
picks up a z, the x component
Sx, the y component Sy.

00:03:23.172 --> 00:03:24.380
And this is your Hamiltonian.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.510
And as we emphasized last
time, this Hamiltonian

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.880
is time dependent.

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.090
Moreover, at different times,
the Hamiltonians don't commute.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:41.370
So the HS at time T1, HS at
time T2, they don't commute.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.770
Therefore, any of the formulas
we have for solving problems

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.325
like this don't apply.

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.860
The only formula that applies
is this time ordered exponential

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.610
that we spoke about
that in general

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.500
is very difficult to use.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.770
The time ordered exponential
just never quits.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.520
And we're writing
terms, term after term.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.100
And then, you have
to add it all up.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.110
And adding it all
up is difficult.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.960
So most of the time,
it's not a great help.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.680
So what did we say we would do?

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.870
We wondered if we could
somehow do quantum mechanics,

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.760
or think of quantum mechanics,
in the rotating frame,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.600
in a frame that is rotating with
a magnetic field in such a way

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.460
that perhaps in that frame
the physics would simplify.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.830
And physics simplified would
be that the Hamiltonian becomes

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.030
time independent.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.740
So we're trying to figure
out, how would the Hamiltonian

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.720
look in another frame?

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:53.380
Now, we've not discussed
in general very explicitly

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.620
transformations of Hamiltonians
within different frames.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.750
But we can sort of
roughly try to guess

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.320
what it would have to do.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.490
So what we said
last time is that we

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.380
would imagine that you
have an original system

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.650
and no magnetic field,
nothing whatsoever.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.000
So forget about all
that-- no magnetic field.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.630
You put the spin state.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.980
It stays there forever,
doesn't precess.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.480
It doesn't precess because
there's no magnetic field.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.720
Then, you jump into
a rotating frame.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.600
So this was a static
frame, no magnetic field.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.480
And then, you start rotating.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.220
And then, you look at the spins.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.680
And the spins are not moving.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.020
But you say, oh, I'm rotating.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.425
So for me, they seem to be
precessing, in fact precessing

00:05:45.425 --> 00:05:49.300
with the angular frequency
that I am rotating.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.800
And therefore, in
my rotating frame,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.680
I would have a
Hamiltonian that I

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.100
would call the rotating
Hamiltonian, HR.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.160
And how would it look?

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.960
We claim that in fact spin
states in my rotating frame

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.700
would have to be
rotating really this way.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.050
Because I'm rotating
with the magnetic field.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.880
So for me, they're rotating
in the positive z direction

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.430
with angular frequency omega.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.730
And this would be
the operator that

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.970
makes them rotate
exactly that way.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.580
Because if you remember,
an operator here minus

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.990
i angle Sz over h
bar, this is the angle

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.530
as a function of time.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:43.790
Omega t, that's how these
operators rotate states.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.720
So this U of t is the
U of t that rotates

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.150
states the way I want
them in my rotating frame.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.720
Now, you remember for
time independent systems,

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:04.560
the unitary operator is e
to the minus iht over h bar.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.340
So you identify the
Hamiltonian as omega Sz.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.840
In general, given
a unitary operator,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.120
the Hamiltonian is
obtained this way.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.620
You take the time derivative
of it multiplied by U dagger.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.080
And that's the formula for
the Hamiltonian given the time

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:32.220
evolution operator, something
we did about a couple of weeks

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.640
ago.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.900
So that's where we stood-- some
idea about the rotating frame.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.930
So the way we now
make this complete

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.290
is to say, well, I'm going to
attempt to do the following.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:59.282
I'm going to act with U, this U
of t, on this complicated state

00:07:59.282 --> 00:08:02.590
that I don't know
how it behaves.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:09.100
And this I'm going to call
the rotated wave function.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:11.740
It's a definition.

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.800
We're going to use
this operator that

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.200
seems to induce a
rotation of the frames

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.630
and act it on the
state to find this.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.290
And we're going to hope
that the Schrodinger

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.970
equation for this
one is simpler.

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:34.239
So actually, last time, I
actually did a computation

00:08:34.239 --> 00:08:36.980
and found what is the
Schrodinger Hamiltonian

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:43.390
for this, psi R. I want to do
it in a slightly different way.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:48.190
I think it's a little easier
perhaps, or maybe less

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.670
familiar but more interesting.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.300
I write this like that-- U of t.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.625
And I say, look,
this state evolves

00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:59.470
due to its own Hamiltonian.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.840
U of t is an extra
thing I've put here.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.710
So here is U of t.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.240
But how do I distinguish it?

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:15.390
I put an S for the spin
system, for HS, psi 0.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:22.430
So psi of t is being evolved
by the Schrodinger Hamiltonian,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.120
the unitary operator
associated to the Hamiltonian

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.030
that we want times time of 0.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:34.320
So this is the total
unitary operator

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.660
that evolves this state.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.490
Therefore, I'm going
to say, I'm going

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:45.190
to recover the Hamiltonian
using this formula.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:51.190
So I will simply say that
the rotating Hamiltonian

00:09:51.190 --> 00:10:04.660
is going to be HR is ih bar
dt of this whole thing, U

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:11.420
of t US of t, times its dagger.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.045
Because this is
the general formula

00:10:13.045 --> 00:10:15.180
to obtain the
Hamiltonian when you

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.560
know the time
evolution operator.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:24.290
So the dagger of this would
be US dagger U of t dagger.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.370
Now we have to evaluate
this derivative.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.410
It's is not all that bad.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.850
If the time
derivative hits the U,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:43.480
this one, then U and U
dagger annihilate each other.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:46.170
So you're left with
U dagger of t here.

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:56.430
So you get ih bar dtU U dagger.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.640
Now, when it acts on this
second one, what do we get?

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.590
Well, I'll write it this way.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:06.860
Plus U of t, because
this will be first.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.787
Then, ih bar dtUS.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:24.260
And then, you have US dagger,
and then U dagger of t.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:34.840
Now, this thing is how much?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.530
Well, in this thing is
in fact this Hamiltonian

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:45.070
associated to what we called
U, which is just omega Sz.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.610
So actually, I don't
know if I have-- yeah,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.370
I have this notation here.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:59.570
I think it's useful-- H of
U, the Hamiltonian associated

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:01.550
to whatever U it is.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:07.740
So you get a nice
formula-- plus U of t.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:14.941
This is the Hamiltonian
HS U dagger of t.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.290
So this formula we
derived also last time

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:29.850
by looking at the differential
equations satisfied by psi R.

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.690
So it's a nice formula.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:35.700
If somebody gives you
something like this

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.920
and says, here's a
unitary operator,

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.200
what is the new Hamiltonian?

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:47.550
The new Hamiltonian is equal to
the transformed old Hamiltonian

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.220
plus the Hamiltonian associated
to this time evolution

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.115
operator.

00:12:52.115 --> 00:12:53.530
It's a nice formula.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.300
Now, more concretely
now, we can see

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.840
what this is supposed to be.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:08.625
So here is the
important crucial step.

00:13:08.625 --> 00:13:13.170
Let's see, HR is
supposed to be what?

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:18.290
We now know we're going to
choose U to be this thing.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:25.050
Therefore, HU is omega Sz hat.

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:30.540
But now we have U
of t, U dagger of t.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:35.720
So I have plus e to
the minus i omega

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:42.880
tSz over h bar times
the Hamiltonian

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.900
that we have over there,
this full Hamiltonian HS.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.614
So what is it?

00:13:49.614 --> 00:14:01.050
Minus gamma big parentheses
B0 Sz hat plus B1 cosine omega

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:11.150
tSx minus sine omega
tSy-- like that--

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.510
e to the i omega tSz over h bar.

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:20.260
OK, that's supposed to
be our new Hamiltonian.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.170
And unless it simplifies, we
have not gained all that much.

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:34.410
So before simplifying,
are there questions,

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:36.225
anything we've gotten so far?

00:14:39.005 --> 00:14:41.440
Yes.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:47.284
AUDIENCE: So U of t is
the unitary operator that

00:14:47.284 --> 00:14:50.693
enacts the rotation,
and it's not

00:14:50.693 --> 00:14:55.780
corresponding to any
Hamiltonian of the spin?

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.740
PROFESSOR: Right, U of t is the
thing that essentially moves us

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.510
into the rotating frame.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:05.380
This is the hope that we have.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.965
Any unitary operator, if
it's what evolves your state,

00:15:08.965 --> 00:15:10.880
it corresponds to Hamiltonian.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.210
But that's not
anything a priori to do

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:15.890
with our original Hamiltonian.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.540
It's just another Hamiltonian.

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:24.150
So you choose your U of t
behind some Hamiltonian.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.930
But what you learn is
that the Hamiltonian

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:30.200
for your new system, or
for the new wave function,

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.136
will involve that
other Hamiltonian.

00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:34.582
Yes?

00:15:34.582 --> 00:15:36.992
AUDIENCE: HR equals [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.250
PROFESSOR: This is-- yeah.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:42.500
It's HU.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.130
I think you are probably right.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:46.920
I should call it
just HU for-- yeah,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.590
it's a bad idea to call it HR.

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.410
U, HU, much better-- thank you.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:16:01.220
Here, HR is the Hamiltonian
associated to the Schrodinger

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.410
equation here.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.420
So the claim behind
this calculation

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:12.320
is that if you calculated
ih bar d dt of psi R of t,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:19.030
you would find HR psi R of t.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.015
So that's the
calculation I think

00:16:21.015 --> 00:16:23.760
we did last time
in which we just

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:25.480
calculated these derivatives.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.000
And you find this answer.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.590
OK, so let's continue
here and see what happens.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:39.040
Well, I have an Sz and a Sz
similarity transformation here.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.390
But here is Sz.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:43.835
So that Sz doesn't care.

00:16:43.835 --> 00:16:45.900
And it can just go out.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.080
So what do we have?

00:16:47.080 --> 00:17:01.130
We have omega minus gamma
B0 Sz hat like that.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.500
Then, the rest would be what?

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.400
I can take out the
numbers gamma, the B1.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.790
And then, I have this
exponential-- e to the minus i

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:19.040
omega t Sz hat over h bar.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:27.760
I'm just having here cosine
omega tSx hat minus sine omega

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:36.210
tSy hat, e to the i
omega tSz hat over h bar.

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:49.810
OK, now there's two
ways to do this.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.640
You have an exponential here
and another exponential.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.690
This is the kind of thing
you've done quite a few times

00:17:57.690 --> 00:17:58.870
in different ways.

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:03.190
You could expand exponentials
and just multiply.

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:09.150
Or you can sort of do this
usual formula of e to the AB e

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:13.850
to the minus A for this
term and for this term,

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:17.670
and simplify, and
do many things.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.270
So let's do something different.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.830
When one looks at
this, one could say,

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:26.550
well, here's my problem.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.940
HR-- I know U of t.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:32.380
I fixed it.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:37.150
So knowing psi is knowing
psi R. But to know psi R,

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:39.580
I need to know HR.

00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:42.620
And HR still looks
very complicated

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.460
unless somehow this whole
idea has worked out very well

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:49.630
and this simplifies.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:51.610
And the hope is
that it simplifies.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.230
Because in the rotating
frame, the field

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.380
is not rotating anymore.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:05.800
So I'll call this M of t.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.050
And I think one
way of doing this,

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:11.810
doing something,
if you're in a rush

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:15.940
and you don't have a formula
sheet or any of those things,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:20.080
is to just take its derivative,
its time derivative.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.270
Now, if you have a
function of time,

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.990
and you don't know what it
is, take its time derivative.

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:28.500
And maybe you'll see a
differential equation

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.990
or see something.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:38.220
So let's take the
d dt of M of t.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.040
OK, so what do we get?

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.860
Well, we get the
following-- e to the minus

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:49.210
i omega tSz over h bar.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:53.860
And I'll put the big
parentheses here.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.280
OK, here I have an object.

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.160
This is something I
think you are familiar.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.830
You've been computing these
things for coherence state,

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.010
for squeeze state,
and for all that.

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.150
So this will certainly
sound familiar.

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.200
If you take a time derivative
of this exponential,

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:15.320
it will bring an operator down.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.610
When you take the time
derivative of this operator,

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:22.420
it will bring the operator
down but with a different sign.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.660
And therefore, it will
form the commutator

00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:27.220
with the thing like
this in the middle.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:32.540
So the first thing in this
thing is the commutator

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:39.240
of-- you take the time
derivative of this-- minus i

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:49.650
omega Sz hat over h bar
with the rest of this thing,

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:57.320
with cosine omega tSx
minus sine omega tSy.

00:21:03.335 --> 00:21:07.330
Because the first derivative
brings down the minus i omega

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:08.410
this over that.

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:12.205
So I'll actually take the
minus i omega over h bar out.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.300
OK, that's the
first term that you

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:25.330
get from differentiating
this and that.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.520
And then, you have
to differentiate

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.510
the term in the middle.

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:39.060
So then, you get minus
omega sine omega tSx

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:48.500
hat minus omega
cosine omega tSy hat.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.340
And now, we can close
the big parentheses

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.010
and put the other
exponential like that.

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:14.880
OK, so let's see this.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:22.540
Sz with Sx is ih bar Sy.

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:31.020
So you get here minus i
omega over h bar, ih bar Sy

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.900
cosine omega t.

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:40.840
Because Sz with Sx-- you
should remember that I think.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.470
Otherwise, you'll waste
time. x, y, and z,

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:48.660
when you have Sz
with Sx, you get Sy.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.850
Sx with Sy, you get a z.

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:54.310
And that order helps.

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:58.520
So ih bar this, and
then the other term

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.040
would be minus sine omega t.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:13.394
But now, Sz with Sy is minus
ih bar, so plus ih bar Sx.

00:23:16.572 --> 00:23:18.720
OK, I won't copy the other term.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.150
And let's see if it worked out.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.645
Minus i and i is a plus.

00:23:24.645 --> 00:23:30.970
The h bar cancels, so plus
omega Sy cosine omega t

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:34.730
minus omega cosine omega tSy.

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:38.110
So this term cancels with this.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:42.330
And this-- there's an ih bar.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.780
The sign is the same, so
it's a plus omega sine

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.540
Sx minus omega sine.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.510
So these two cancel.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.140
And happily, this
whole thing is 0.

00:23:56.790 --> 00:24:02.260
So that is the signal
your strategy worked.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:02.760
Why?

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:06.840
Because M of t looks like it
has lots of time dependence.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:10.300
But in fact, it has none.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.010
Its derivative is 0.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:17.920
So if its derivative is
0, you can evaluate it

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.420
at any time you want.

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:28.270
Well, the best time to evaluate
it is time equals 0 now.

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:32.500
And you put here 0--
disappears, disappears.

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.890
This term disappears.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:42.300
The whole thing is just
Sx hat, nothing else.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:48.150
So you may want to do it
the other way by doing

00:24:48.150 --> 00:24:51.430
this similarity on
this and on that,

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.200
or do it whichever way you want.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:55.930
But this is good enough.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.960
So we have that this
whole Hamiltonian

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.440
has become very simple.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:06.730
So HR has become--
and I'll copy it here,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:17.780
I want to make sure-- minus
gamma B0 plus omega Sz

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:25.140
hat minus gamma B1Sx hat.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:30.920
Very nice Hamiltonian--
just two pieces.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.620
The Sz part of the Hamiltonian
that used to be this

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:38.310
got this extra piece
from the rotation.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:42.340
That's our omega Sz.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.280
And this piece over
here is all that

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.190
is left of the rotating one.

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:51.090
Because in the rotating
frame, the magnetic field

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:57.120
is always along the x-axis
as it was at time equals 0.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.490
So it's a perfectly
nice Hamiltonian.

00:25:59.490 --> 00:26:01.820
Let's factor a few things.

00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:06.410
Let's remember the
notation that omega 0

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:10.180
is [INAUDIBLE] more
frequency associated to B0.

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:22.060
So I'll write here, this
is equal to minus gamma B0

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:32.410
minus omega over gamma
Sz hat plus B1Sx hat,

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:43.160
which is minus gamma B0 1
minus omega over omega 0 Sz

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:48.780
hat plus B1Sx hat.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.780
So let me look at
what we've done.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:56.650
First step, I just factor a
gamma here, so nothing else.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:59.370
And the same gamma went out.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.330
Next step was to
use this equation,

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:08.020
omega 0 equals gamma.
[INAUDIBLE] to eliminate gamma.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.310
So you eliminated gamma by that.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.240
So it's equal to
omega 0 over B0.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:15.780
So the B0 went out.

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:19.100
And you have 1 minus this thing.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:23.810
And then, you can
think of this HR

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:33.220
as minus gamma BR times S. In
the usual notation for spin

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:38.420
Hamiltonians, minus
gamma BS, this

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.780
is the rotating B, the
so-called rotating B.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.550
But of course, it's not
rotating anymore, happily.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:56.320
This is just B0 times 1
minus omega over omega 0 Sz

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.100
plus B1Sx.

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.020
And then, how about our answer?

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.260
What is the answer
to this problem?

00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.940
Well, the answer
is the psi and t.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:33.700
So psi t is U dagger
times psi R of t.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:46.000
And U dagger was e to the i
omega tSz over h bar-- omega t,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:46.730
yeah.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.480
And what is the other U?

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.430
Well, the other U associated
to a time evolution

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:59.540
is just e to the
minus iHRt over h bar.

00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.840
Because HR is time independent.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:09.310
So this equation that tells us
how psi R evolves is with HR.

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:11.970
HR is time independent.

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.420
And therefore,
you'll have here e

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:23.500
to the minus iHR, which is this.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:37.300
So it becomes plus i gamma
BR dot S over h bar t acting

00:29:37.300 --> 00:29:42.680
on the state psi
at time equals 0.

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.290
You see, the state
psi R at time equals

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:56.860
0 is the same as the
state psi at time

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.820
equals 0 because the unitary
operator is the same.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:09.690
So let me box this as well.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.740
This is the complete solution
for the problem of the rotating

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:14.800
spins.

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.860
So the quantum
mechanical problem

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.250
is you've gotten this time
dependent magnetic field.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.270
You want to know
the spin evolution.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.280
Well, the spin evolution
is a little complicated.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.210
It's this whole thing.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:33.460
And let me just make sure
everything is good here.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.790
Perfect.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.380
Fine.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.360
All right.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.080
Questions.

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.482
Yes?

00:30:41.482 --> 00:30:46.150
AUDIENCE: So you have x
hat, so xc hat and xs hat--

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.280
AUDIENCE: BR.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:48.695
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Oh.

00:30:48.695 --> 00:30:49.920
I'm sorry.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.253
It should be BR.

00:30:52.253 --> 00:30:53.120
I'm sorry.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.930
What is the mistake here?

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:55.470
Sorry.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.460
This is terrible.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.320
z hat, x hat.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.748
Thank you.

00:31:01.748 --> 00:31:04.522
That's a magnetic field.

00:31:04.522 --> 00:31:05.230
Another question.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.452
Yes?

00:31:07.452 --> 00:31:09.160
AUDIENCE: This is a
question [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:12.800
But when we take d
dt of f of t, how

00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:17.990
can we take the computation
relation with hu

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.918
in that computation?

00:31:19.918 --> 00:31:24.582
Why is that the Hamiltonian
that we take in the computation?

00:31:24.582 --> 00:31:26.082
BARTON ZWIEBACH: I
don't understand.

00:31:26.082 --> 00:31:29.120
When we take the tan
derivative of m of t,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.720
here was m of t
from here to here.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:32.636
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:35.835 --> 00:31:37.501
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Why
is this thing here?

00:31:37.501 --> 00:31:39.324
AUDIENCE: Yeah, omega sc.

00:31:39.324 --> 00:31:40.740
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
It's because when

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.300
you take the time
derivative of this--

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.960
let me give you a formula
that you should check.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.590
tA minus tA.

00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:59.560
d dt of this is equal
to e to the tA, A, B,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:03.150
e to the minus tA.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.370
That's the formula we used.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.130
It should be all right.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:16.910
So we have our time
dependent states,

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:23.580
and let's analyze it
and see what it's doing.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.240
Yes?

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.820
One more question.

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.040
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE] that
we have these magnetic fields,

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:34.546
but somehow, in our
Hamiltonian, it all

00:32:34.546 --> 00:32:38.830
boils down to just the spin
operating in the x direction.

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:41.210
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Well, they're
still in the z direction.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.876
AUDIENCE: There's
still the z component,

00:32:42.876 --> 00:32:45.509
but the time variant components
in the y and x direction--

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:47.050
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Has become something

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:48.518
like in the x direction.

00:32:48.518 --> 00:32:49.017
Right.

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.056
AUDIENCE: It's hard
to say physically,

00:32:54.056 --> 00:32:55.986
but what does the system
actually look like?

00:32:55.986 --> 00:32:58.360
BARTON ZWIEBACH: That's what
we're going to do right now.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.370
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:04.090
BARTON ZWIEBACH: This formula
is very pleasant to look at.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.390
You say, oh, I'm
very accomplished.

00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:08.090
I solved it.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:09.760
But what does that do?

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.600
What does that describe?

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.260
That's what we have to do now.

00:33:16.948 --> 00:33:20.430
And that's the interesting
part, of course.

00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:26.580
So applications always have
B1 much smaller than B0.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:32.650
This is the longitudinal
component, and that's the case.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:34.830
Let me describe
for you what this

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:43.250
is doing in case one, omega
much smaller than omega 0.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:47.808
You see, given B0,
there is an omega

00:33:47.808 --> 00:33:52.900
0, the Larmor one over there.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:34:00.710
And B0 is very large, so
omega 0 is very large as well.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:03.010
So omega very slow
is reasonable.

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:06.880
The magnetic field is
rotating much smaller

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.310
than whatever rotation this
other magnetic field would

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:11.414
create on the things.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:19.580
Moreover, if omega is
much smaller than omega 0,

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:36.199
BR is sort of like B0 z
plus B1 x, roughly that.

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:37.760
So what does this do?

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.980
Well, this is a magnetic
field mostly along the z-axis.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:46.980
So here is x, y, z.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.949
This is a magnetic field
that's like this, BR.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:12.260
Now, this BR, let's assume
also for an assumption that

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.530
at t equals 0, the spin of
whatever spin state you have

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:23.690
is up plus z.

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:30.370
So what does this magnetic
field do to the spin?

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:31.740
Well, you have it here.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:39.800
So this is going
to rotate the spin

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:44.240
states around the axis of BR.

00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:59.330
The rotation operator here, this
is minus the angular velocity,

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:02.100
so there's a minus sign
here that you always

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.350
must think about.

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.470
But forget about
it for a second.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.140
This is rotating
around BR, so this,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.640
supposed to have a spin state
here in the z direction,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.670
is going to start to rotating
in a little cone like that.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.660
It's very close to
the BR, so it's just

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:25.820
going to rotate
around it like that.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:28.350
And that's what this
part is going to do.

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.290
But you say, but that's
not the whole thing.

00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:34.170
The whole thing is this as well.

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:41.920
Well, intuitively, this
rotation that this produces

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.680
a rotation around
the z-axis, but it's

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:51.910
much slower than this rotation
because this BR field,

00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:59.050
its magnitude is
like B0 roughly.

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:03.620
Therefore, it produces
a very fast rotation.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:07.960
So what you must imagine
is this little spin state

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.560
generating this cone here
and rotating a million times

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:15.390
a second, but this
whole thing is still

00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:20.530
being rotated by this
exponential around the z-axis.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:23.300
So this whole cone,
in some sense,

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:26.500
is precessing around the z-axis.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.870
Now, if you want to
know where the spin is

00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:35.840
at any instant of time,
you do the following thing.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.350
You say, time equals one second.

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:42.340
So you come here
and say, one second,

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:44.400
a billion turns and a quarter.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.720
It ends up here.

00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:52.000
But in one second, this
rotates it by five degrees,

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.240
so then it rotates
a little more.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.730
You could do it that way.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:58.680
That's a good way
to think about it.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:02.290
But in the approximation,
which is so fast,

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:06.050
basically, this cone has now,
by the second exponential,

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.418
been rotated like that.

00:38:11.410 --> 00:38:14.130
Now let's do the
case that is really

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:19.810
the important one, the case,
as you could imagine in which

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:26.230
we know some resonance and
omega is set equal to omega 0.

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:37.880
So the physicists know what
omega 0 is for the spins,

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.140
and then they make the
radio frequency coincide

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:43.810
with that omega 0.

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:49.760
In that case, you lose
completely the z component here

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.750
of this BR.

00:38:53.750 --> 00:39:02.410
So BR is going to be B1 x.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.030
And then, here is
what's going to happen.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:14.130
You have a B1 x here, a B1
over here in the x direction.

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:18.260
The spin state is sitting
at time equals 0 here.

00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:25.570
And since normal
exponentials that

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:28.890
do time evolutions
have a minus sign here,

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:32.910
I claim that instead of
rotating the spin around B1,

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:35.830
it's really rotating
it around minus B1.

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:41.650
So the spin will
just go down here.

00:39:41.650 --> 00:39:43.838
Rotate, rotate, rotate, rotate.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:57.810
Now, it's rotating with B1,
which is much smaller than B0.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:00.610
So it's rotating with
an angular frequency

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:05.990
that is much smaller than omega
0, but it's rotating down here.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:14.935
And now, what's really
happening is the following.

00:40:14.935 --> 00:40:17.590
Let me draw this if I can.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.800
Here it is.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:36.450
The spin is up, and it
begins to go into the y-axis.

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.125
Here is z.

00:40:37.125 --> 00:40:41.940
B1 is turning into the y-axis,
so it rotates a little.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.880
So let me ask you, what is the
second exponential going to do?

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.400
It's going to rotate it
further, but this time

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.600
around the z-axis.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:58.230
So this one goes down a
little bit in some time,

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.250
but then this z exponential,
the other exponential,

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.580
is going to rotate
it around the z-axis.

00:41:03.580 --> 00:41:07.910
So this is going to go
down a little but rotate.

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:09.630
So actually, what's
going to happen

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:18.240
is that it's going
to do a spiral.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.615
As it begins to go down,
the other one rotates.

00:41:20.615 --> 00:41:23.290
It goes down a little,
the other one rotates it.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:33.830
In fact, this, since B1 is much
smaller than B0 or omega 0,

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:36.890
here now, omega is
equal to omega 0,

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.930
so this is rotating around
the z direction with omega 0.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:46.910
But B1 is much smaller than B0,
so this rotation is very slow.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:50.730
As it goes down a little,
it's rotating very fast

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:56.990
and fills out the spiral
until it gets down here.

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:03.880
So that's what the poor
spin is doing in this thing.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:09.840
It's actually of
interest to time

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:15.830
the radio frequency signals,
to time the systems of B1

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.310
so that you get it
to go into the plane

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.350
so that the spin is
maximally perpendicular

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.430
to the original direction.

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:29.365
For that, you
choose omega 1 times

00:42:29.365 --> 00:42:35.450
time, which is the Larmor
frequency associated

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:40.390
to B1 times time, to
be equal to pi over 2.

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:50.110
And omega 1, just like any
omega, is gamma B1 pi over 2.

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:56.160
So t is pi over 2 gamma B1.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:59.890
It's called the half
pulse, something like that.

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.380
No, a 90 degree pulse.

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:10.330
That's a normal name for it.

00:43:10.330 --> 00:43:13.810
So if you keep the
radio frequency

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:19.880
on for this much time, then the
spin, at the end of the day,

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:26.250
it got to the equator of the
sphere, and B1 has disappeared.

00:43:26.250 --> 00:43:29.710
So B1 is gone, BR
is gone, and then

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.475
it keeps rotating because there
is the other magnetic field

00:43:33.475 --> 00:43:38.010
still, the longitudinal
magnetic field.

00:43:38.010 --> 00:43:40.750
One exercise that you
still have in the homework

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:45.770
is to figure out the equation
of the spiral that comes out

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:46.430
of here.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:50.160
You will find it
sounds complicated,

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.690
but it's a couple of lines.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:54.010
It's very simple,
actually, to do it,

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:56.840
after you think about
it for a second.

00:43:56.840 --> 00:43:59.790
That's one thing
you'll have to do.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:04.740
So this, in fact, is basically
the solution of the problem,

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.260
and let's just talk
for a few minutes

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.140
about what it's used for.

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.500
So this is basically
the technique

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:20.766
that is exactly used for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging,

00:44:20.766 --> 00:44:21.265
MRIs.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:28.340
If you have to say one of
the interesting applications

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.490
of quantum mechanics
to technology,

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:35.910
MRIs, Magnetic
Resonance Imaging,

00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:39.650
is one of the great ones.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.930
So how does it work?

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.830
Well, it's a very useful device.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:50.540
In fact, it
revolutionized medicine

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.130
because it goes much beyond
what you can do with x-rays.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:55.660
It's very popular.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:59.790
I imagine a good fraction
of you have had an MRI.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:00.360
Let's see.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.160
How many people have had
an MRI in their lives?

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:09.800
We're pretty much, I
think, 60% of people here.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.130
So you remember getting
into this cavity?

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:16.140
Well, you've experienced
there a large--

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:19.830
if you worry about
cell phone radiation,

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:22.790
well, there, you
were with two Tesla,

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:27.350
20,000 Gauss, a big, big magnet.

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:33.210
It's big enough that it has to
be cooled with liquid helium

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:37.310
at 3 degrees Kelvin
so you can get

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:41.810
the currents big enough and
the magnetic field big enough.

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:51.980
So they put you into this
cylinder, a solenoid,

00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:52.855
and there you go.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.840
And it's not
dangerous unless you

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:06.200
forget some metal or
some device like that.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.710
In fact, it says in
WebMD that if you

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:15.030
have some sort of tattoos,
they used iron ink,

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:20.550
it can burn your skin or you
could have some problems.

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:22.520
Anyway, if you're
claustrophobic,

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.240
may have MRIs that are
open air, but they're

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:29.500
less powerful, less
strong magnetic field.

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.380
So this is two Tesla, roughly.

00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:39.350
And so what happens
is that basically,

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.910
this thing just is
trying to figure out

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:44.480
the local
concentration of water.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.800
It begins like that.

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.530
The magnetic fields react with
the hydrogen atoms, in fact,

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:54.590
with the protons inside there.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.310
Each proton has a
magnetic dipole moment.

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:04.310
It gets roughly aligned to the
magnetic field, to this B0.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.730
So the protons get
aligned to the B0

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:17.890
that is going in here, B0.

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.630
So the proton spin is up there.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.500
In fact, because of
temperature, not all

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.040
of your protons in
your body get aligned.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:32.015
Maybe one in a million does,
but that's high enough.

00:47:32.015 --> 00:47:36.400
And then they send
this 90 degree pulse.

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.300
So this thing starts
spiraling, and then

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.840
it finally goes
into this direction

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.440
and it rotates,
rotates like crazy.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:51.410
Then, as it rotates like
crazy, a rotating dipole moment

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:54.420
is like a generator of
electromagnetic waves.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.400
So it generates an
electromagnetic wave,

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:03.740
and there are detectors all
over that pick up this signal.

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:07.230
The strength of that
signal is proportional

00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:10.510
to the concentration of water.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:14.480
So it gives you an
idea, not to distinguish

00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:20.935
solid matter versus soft matter,
but all kinds of liquids.

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:26.860
So it's very, very useful.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.480
You pick a signal over here
and you get it from a receiver,

00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.070
and it tells you about the
local concentration of water.

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:38.560
And therefore, it allows you to
distinguish different tissues.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.160
Some tissues have lots of water,
some tissues have less water,

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.535
so it begins to distinguish
different tissues.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:50.480
Now, there's two more
things that people do.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:58.270
This pin is rotating very fast,
but there's a relaxation time.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:02.910
After it rotates
for a while, there's

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:12.170
a time, T2, is relaxation
of this rotation.

00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.990
Relaxation time.

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:16.600
And then there's
another time, T1,

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:20.610
which is the time after
this is turned off

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:25.180
that it takes the
spin to go back

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:26.810
again to the original position.

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.480
So two times, the
relaxation time

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.340
in which you lose
your rotation here

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.380
because it's interacting
with other spins.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.850
It's called spin,
spin, relaxation.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:48.180
And then an interaction with a
whole set of neighboring atoms

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.740
that brings it
eventually back up

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.440
and aligns it to
the magnetic field.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:57.840
So you measure two
things, T1 and T2,

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:01.260
and those are very
good clues because you

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.000
can put any liquid
in the machine

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.870
and measure its T1 and T2.

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:11.430
And then you place a table
of T1's and T2's, and then

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.720
if you want to figure
out what kind of thing

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.550
you have in your
body, they look it up,

00:50:16.550 --> 00:50:18.730
and immediately,
they may know what

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:20.240
are the possible candidates.

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:27.490
In fact, T2 is actually
enough to distinguish

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:31.550
white matter, gray matter,
and fluids in your brain.

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:34.940
Totally different T2's.

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:41.640
T1 is helpful to discuss
all kinds of things as well.

00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.760
So basically, people have
figured out how to do that.

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:46.570
Finally, one last thing.

00:50:46.570 --> 00:50:51.450
When you go into the machine,
it sometimes makes noises.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:53.040
Big noises.

00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:57.530
And those are gradient
magnets that are being moved.

00:50:57.530 --> 00:51:01.320
You see, basically, if this
thing would be like that,

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.940
you would pick up
a signal and you

00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:05.420
wouldn't know where
it comes from.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.690
So what these
people do now-- this

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.740
has gotten extremely
sophisticated.

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:15.890
They put a gradient magnet which
changes the value of B0 locally

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.550
by increasing it.

00:51:17.550 --> 00:51:20.540
For example, the B0 is
not really constant in z,

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.270
but it changes.

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:28.390
So the omega 0 of rotation
of the spins changes as well.

00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:32.650
So with a sufficiently high
gradient of magnetic field,

00:51:32.650 --> 00:51:34.660
they can have
spatial resolution.

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:37.370
If they pick a signal a
little bit higher frequency,

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:40.550
they know it's a little
bit higher up in your body.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:43.470
So they get resolutions
with these magnets

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.390
of about how much?

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:48.350
Very high resolutions.

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:51.290
Half a millimeter.

00:51:51.290 --> 00:51:56.780
So at the end of the day,
it's a great machine,

00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:00.980
and lots of mathematics
in reconstructing images,

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.480
lots of computation, lots
of experimental analysis

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.530
of constants, much of
it phenomenological.

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.930
It would be hard to
predict those constants,

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:14.260
but you can measure them.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:19.090
So it's very, very
practical and very nice.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:26.040
So it's a nice application,
and we'll leave it at that.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.370
Are there any questions?

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:32.840
Not that I know much
more about that.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.745
But it's a junior lab
experiment as well.

00:52:36.745 --> 00:52:40.520
So I believe the calculation
is fairly straightforward

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.980
and the technology
is just amazing.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.010
It's great.

00:52:44.010 --> 00:52:45.110
Yes?

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.200
AUDIENCE: So about
getting your spin back up

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:49.550
along the z direction,
is that mechanism

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:52.079
the same as when you
relax [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:52.079 --> 00:52:53.620
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
When you relax what?

00:52:53.620 --> 00:52:57.370
AUDIENCE: So is the mechanism
for getting your spin back

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.620
along the z
direction to find T1,

00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:02.062
is that the same
mechanism as when

00:53:02.062 --> 00:53:04.970
you do all of this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.130
BARTON ZWIEBACH: No.

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:08.670
It's sort of a
different mechanism.

00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:09.930
We don't analyze it.

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:17.040
It's not being driven by
Schrodinger time evolution.

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:20.510
All these relaxations are
more complicated phenomena.

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:23.380
In fact, if you maintain
the magnetic field,

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.270
this is supposed to go
on forever and never stop

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:27.180
rotating.

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.700
But due to interactions
with other things,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:34.400
it's sort of stops
rotating at some stage,

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.070
and then eventually, many
of them also go back up.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:41.170
So these are not easily
calculable things

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.700
within our analysis.

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:45.970
These are
phenomenological constants

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:52.310
that need to be measured
or done by experiment.

00:53:52.310 --> 00:53:56.890
So last part of today's lecture
is multi-particle states

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.520
and tensor products.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.980
Let's get on with that.

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:07.600
Let's see we have there.

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:17.230
So multi-particle states
and tensor products.

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.440
The idea is the following.

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.980
You have a system with
more than one particle.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:36.660
Let's talk two particles.

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.030
It won't matter at this
moment whether they're

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:41.980
distinguishable,
not distinguishable.

00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:43.810
Those are things
that come later,

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:48.320
and we will probably not discuss
much of that in this semester.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.880
This will be more in 806.

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.110
But let's consider if
we have particle one,

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:58.100
and we'll keep the
possibility that this

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:00.230
is completely
distinguishable, in fact.

00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:03.010
Particle one.

00:55:03.010 --> 00:55:08.810
Its quantum mechanics is
described by a complex vector

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:22.165
space, v. And you have
some operators, T1, T2.

00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:31.850
Particle two,
complex vector space,

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:42.300
w, and the operators,
S1, S2, all that.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.340
You see, the list of
operators is something

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.050
that you are already
familiar with.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:52.930
Quantum mechanics operators
can include momentum, position,

00:55:52.930 --> 00:55:57.380
if it's three dimensional,
three positions, three momenta,

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:04.560
angular momentum, spin,
Hamiltonians, all those things,

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:08.860
and those exist
for both particles.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:13.130
So the question is, how do we
describe the composite system,

00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:17.200
the system of the
two particles that

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.720
exist at the same time, that
possibly could interact even

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.780
with each other?

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:27.570
So we need a description
of these two things.

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:32.710
Well, a description
of particle one

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:37.145
is described by some vector,
v, in the vector space.

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:45.350
Description of particle two is
some state, some vector omega,

00:56:45.350 --> 00:56:49.330
in the vector space w.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:55.820
So we imagine that
it's a reasonable thing

00:56:55.820 --> 00:57:00.200
to give you those two
vectors and say, look,

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.360
that's what particle
one is doing,

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:06.370
that's what particle two is
doing, and that is correct.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.330
It's a bit more subtle than
that, as we'll see now,

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:17.360
but we could list v
and list w, and this

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:25.345
is the information
about each particle.

00:57:31.970 --> 00:57:38.690
And this is, in some ways,
too naive, as we will see.

00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:44.400
It has the right idea, but
the amazing possibilities

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:47.280
that can take place when
you have these two particles

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:53.340
are not quite reflected
on that thing yet.

00:57:53.340 --> 00:58:04.620
So to make this idea clearer,
we'll use a notation.

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:10.650
So I will say that I
will encode these things

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:21.940
and I will write them
as v tensor product w.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:30.640
It's reflecting that we're going
to do something more than just

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.920
view this as the possibility.

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.670
You have a system.

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:35.510
You know what the
particle one is doing,

00:58:35.510 --> 00:58:38.830
you know what the second
particle is doing.

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.890
List those two, that's
all that can happen.

00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:43.840
Not quite true.

00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:48.630
So let's put it like that, and
this will be the information.

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:50.680
BARTON ZWIEBACH:
I'm not multiplying

00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:52.870
this in any obvious way.

00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:55.270
It's not that I'm supposed
to multiply and do

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.910
a calculation here.

00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:59.030
I'm just putting the
two pieces of data

00:58:59.030 --> 00:59:02.630
but putting this
curly ball here as

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:05.570
to say that it's
the two together,

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:09.810
and we'll have some ways of
dealing with this object.

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:16.760
And this will be
said to be an element

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:28.526
of a new, complex vector
space, v tensor w.

00:59:36.550 --> 00:59:48.550
So what we are saying here,
with v belonging to v and w

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:54.560
belonging to w, this
thing belongs to v plus w.

00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.440
Tensor product of
the vector spaces.

01:00:05.610 --> 01:00:08.270
At this moment, this
is a little funny,

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:16.130
but let me ask you
some things about it.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:21.734
We have v w.

01:00:21.734 --> 01:00:24.850
So this is an element
of that space.

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:27.300
I put a vector of the
first vector space here

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.880
and I put a vector of
the second vector space,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.440
and this will be a vector here.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:35.090
I'm not saying it's the
most general vector there,

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:39.690
or how we operate with them,
but it's a vector there.

01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:43.000
Now, you say, look,
when I had states,

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.350
you had states plus minus, you
put constants in front of them.

01:00:48.350 --> 01:00:54.825
So I'll put a constant in
front of this v, alpha.

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:08.710
Well, is this something related?

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:13.370
We had this vector that was a
vector in the tensor product.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:16.050
How is this vector
related to this vector?

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:37.060
Well, unless you declare that
these things are somewhat

01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:41.520
related, this object is
going to be very, very large

01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:44.940
because if this vector has
nothing to do with this,

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.800
this is going to be
yet another vector

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.610
linearly independent with this.

01:01:48.610 --> 01:01:52.820
So it's, again, your choice
what you're going to declare.

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:56.480
If you will be constructing
what is called a direct product,

01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.280
not a tensor product,
and that's apologies

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.400
to [? Shanker. ?] He uses the
word "direct products" wrong

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.380
mathematically.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.690
Mathematicians don't call
this a direct product.

01:02:08.690 --> 01:02:10.470
Direct product is
something in which

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:12.930
this has nothing
to do with this.

01:02:12.930 --> 01:02:16.340
But in physics, you're
thinking of the amplitude

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:20.470
to have a first particle
doing that, and suddenly,

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:24.280
that amplitude becomes twice
as big and this other one

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:25.010
doesn't change.

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:26.870
Well, the amplitude
defining this one here

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:29.850
and that one there has
become twice as big

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:32.930
just because this one is
twice more likely to be here

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:34.250
and that's the same.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.230
So we're going to say that
this is the same as that.

01:02:38.230 --> 01:02:42.460
The alpha can go out
and it's the same thing,

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:47.740
and it's also the same
thing as v tensor alpha w.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:55.390
So numbers go out,
and they don't go out

01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:57.270
with a complex conjugate.

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:59.345
They go out just like that.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:05.760
So that's one thing
we declare that

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.770
will happen with these
things, and that's

01:03:07.770 --> 01:03:11.010
a property that we impose.

01:03:11.010 --> 01:03:13.990
It's what is usually
understood to take place

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.050
in tensor products.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:27.580
Now, if this is a
vector in this space,

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:37.260
then if, for example,
v1 is a vector

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:43.650
and v2 cross w2 is a
vector in v cross w,

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:47.250
then this is supposed to
be a linear vector space.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:59.610
So it should be true that alpha
v1 omega 1 plus beta v2 omega 2

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:03.520
also belongs to
this vector space.

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.430
And suddenly, you see why
this was a little too naive.

01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:11.810
If you tell me, this is
what particle one is doing

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:14.770
and this is what particle
is doing, end of story,

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:18.010
this list, well,
quantum mechanics

01:04:18.010 --> 01:04:21.430
seems to say that there's
more interesting possibilities

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:25.280
in which the state is
a superposition now

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:29.020
in which first particle
is doing this, which

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.450
may be a superposition
itself, and this one

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:36.090
is doing this, plus first
particle is doing that

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:39.510
and second particle
is doing that.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:42.940
So it's not enough to say to
the state of two particles,

01:04:42.940 --> 01:04:46.280
say, you just need to
know the state of one,

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.190
state of the other,
list the two.

01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:51.895
That is a possible
state of the system,

01:04:51.895 --> 01:04:54.180
but it's not the most general.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.520
The most general
is a superposition

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.750
in which particle
one does something,

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:02.340
particle two does something,
plus another possibility,

01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.500
particle one is
doing something else,

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.240
particle two is
doing another thing.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:14.180
This is the origin of this
famous idea of entanglement,

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.490
as we will see you next time.

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:19.120
But let's just continue here.

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.020
These particles,
roughly speaking,

01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.110
seem to be entangled,
in which you

01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:29.660
can't say what particle one
is doing without knowing what

01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:32.155
particle two is doing
and things like that.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:41.330
So something new has happened
by taking this idea slowly

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:43.360
and figuring out
what's going on,

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:47.600
but we need yet one
more thing to cut down

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.610
this tensor product.

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.650
This tensor product is
still a little bigger

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:57.920
than what you may want it to
be in the following sense.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.310
Suppose you have
v1 plus v2, which

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:06.875
is another vector,
tensor w, another vector.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:12.330
Unless you tell
me what this is, I

01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:22.420
don't know that this is
actually v1 plus v2 unless you

01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.520
declare it.

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.150
This is just another
vector here and that.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:30.810
Why should that
be equal to this?

01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:34.520
Well, it's the way you feel
about quantum mechanics.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:37.660
That's how you should think
of the composite system.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.970
If the first state can be
either of two possibilities

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:43.690
while the other one
is not, well it's

01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:52.500
a superposition in which, yes,
the first state is doing this

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.410
and the first state
is doing something

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:57.340
different with the
second doing the same.

01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:02.680
So this is part of also an
axiom of the tensor product.

01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:04.510
Whenever you have
tensor products,

01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:07.170
you will simplify in that way.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:10.430
It looks almost trivial,
but it's certainly

01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:12.410
something that has to be stated.

01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:16.190
If you had a direct product,
you form a vector space

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:19.540
by just putting first
vector, second vector,

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:21.260
and you don't explain anything.

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:23.210
This would not be true.

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:36.740
So similarly, we'll also have v1
w1 plus w2 equals v1 w1 plus v1

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.320
w2.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.910
So these are our
last operations.

01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:49.190
So with these two
operations, we've

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:55.390
defined completely how to
calculate with this two

01:07:55.390 --> 01:08:01.920
particle Hilbert space, and
how to define the states.

01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:09.170
Let me add some intuition to
this by stating the following.

01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:16.390
So what is this
space, v tensor w,

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:19.944
is the space spanned
by things like this.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:29.560
So with these rules,
here comes the thing

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:33.319
that puts it all, in
a sense, together.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:55.819
If e1 up to en is a basis
for v, and f1 up to fm

01:08:55.819 --> 01:09:09.399
is a basis for w, this set
of things, ei tensor fj,

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.649
and how many of them are there?

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:15.500
There are n of this
and m of those.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:23.270
This for i from 1 up
to n, j from 1 up to m,

01:09:23.270 --> 01:09:31.594
form a basis for v tensor w.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:39.880
So basically, if you have a
four dimensional vector space

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.646
v and a 10 dimensional
vector space w,

01:09:43.646 --> 01:09:47.490
v cross w is 40 dimensional.

01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:50.240
You multiply the dimensions.

01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.310
You don't sum them.

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:56.810
In the tensor product,
the dimensions multiply.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:59.290
You see, the elements
of this tensor product

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:01.760
was one vector here,
one vector there.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:05.740
So it behooves you that you
would expect that, well, you

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.480
can get all vectors that can
sit here with all the ei's, all

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.510
the vectors here,
but only if you

01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:15.520
have these rules of
superposition and linearity.

01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:20.350
So this is the whole
basis of the vector space.

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:27.240
And dimension of
v cross w would be

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:33.210
equal to the dimension of
v times the dimension of w.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:44.390
Questions?

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:45.194
Yes?

01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:48.644
AUDIENCE: So for the
first box thing up there,

01:10:48.644 --> 01:10:53.711
so v and w are two
different vector spaces.

01:10:53.711 --> 01:10:56.169
Let's say that they're vector
spaces over different fields.

01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.111
How do you know that--

01:10:57.111 --> 01:10:57.590
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Oh no.

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:58.465
Different fields, no.

01:10:58.465 --> 01:11:00.390
Both are over complex numbers.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.376
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:11:01.376 --> 01:11:03.629
They're both complex.

01:11:03.629 --> 01:11:05.920
BARTON ZWIEBACH: Both spaces
are complex vector spaces.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.110
Did I say it?

01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:09.830
Complex vector space,
complex vector space.

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:20.460
Then v cross w is an element
of a new complex vector space.

01:11:20.460 --> 01:11:22.380
So yes, everybody's
complex here.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:31.740
Let me continue a
little more because we

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.400
need to get a little further.

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.930
I would like to get a
little further here today.

01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:41.020
We still have about 10 minutes.

01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.630
These are really,
in some ways simple

01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:47.870
but in some ways
very subtle ideas.

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:49.080
I hope you appreciate it.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.040
At some moments, you
think, this is obvious.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.030
It's ridiculous.

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:53.820
It's taking too
long to explain it.

01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:57.790
At some point, you step back
and say, I'm now confused.

01:11:57.790 --> 01:12:00.630
What does that mean?

01:12:00.630 --> 01:12:03.800
It is subtle.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:06.170
So let's see now what happens.

01:12:06.170 --> 01:12:13.430
We need to do
operators on v cross w.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:22.450
So suppose T is an operator in
v, and s is an operator in w.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:29.990
So we call them like that, T
operators and the S operator

01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.500
on w.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:31.730
So here it is.

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:37.500
We define an s
tensor T that will

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:43.970
be an operator on the
tensor product, v cross w.

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:45.720
Let's see how it is.

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:50.120
So if this is an operator
on the tensor product,

01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:55.800
it should know how to
act on v any element.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.750
In any basic element or
element of this form,

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:02.970
since all the elements can
be written as superposition

01:13:02.970 --> 01:13:05.660
of these things, if this
is a linear operator

01:13:05.660 --> 01:13:09.110
and I define it acting
on this, we've got it.

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:13.120
Now, what I'm going to
write in the right hand side

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.440
is a matter of common sense.

01:13:15.440 --> 01:13:20.030
It's a definition, but
it's hardly possible

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:22.890
to have any other definition
than what I'm going to do.

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:31.480
Lights.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.975
Main screen, window shades.

01:13:38.836 --> 01:13:40.195
Oh, lights here.

01:13:40.195 --> 01:13:42.010
There we go.

01:13:42.010 --> 01:13:56.280
Well, you know, I got the
order wrong here, T cross S.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.970
And the only thing
you could do is

01:13:57.970 --> 01:14:04.458
if T, you know how it acts
on v. Well, let it act on v.

01:14:04.458 --> 01:14:10.085
And it will be a vector in
v, and you know how S acts

01:14:10.085 --> 01:14:13.560
on omega, so let
it act on omega,

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.630
and that's the definition.

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:21.140
Not that complicated,
really, in a sense.

01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:26.840
Each operator acts on its
thing, so you just let it act.

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:32.400
Whoever has to act, acts
wherever it can do it.

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:38.640
And it's linear operator, and
if you act on more things,

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.860
it will be linear.

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.620
It will all be fine here.

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:45.310
Now, this is a fine operator.

01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:50.050
Now, the operators that are
a little more surprising,

01:14:50.050 --> 01:14:53.090
perhaps, at first sight
are the following.

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:09.105
Suppose you have an operator,
T1, that is an operator on v,

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:13.580
and you want it to act
on the tensor product.

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:16.350
You say, well, I need
another operator.

01:15:16.350 --> 01:15:20.070
This acts on v. I need another
operator attached on the tensor

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:26.430
product, but you don't give
me one, so what am I to do?

01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:29.850
So this is what is called
upgrading an operator that

01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.800
acts on one vector space
to an operator that

01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:35.940
acts on the whole thing
because you need everything

01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.840
to act now on the
tensor product.

01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.060
So what you do is the following.

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:48.700
You let the operator
become T1 that acts on v,

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.740
and you put tensor product
with the identity operator.

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.360
This is more or less
what you would imagine.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:03.570
You have now an operator that
belongs to the linear operators

01:16:03.570 --> 01:16:05.680
on the tensor product,
but it's the operator

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:07.680
you got times that.

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:14.740
If you had an operator,
S1, belonging to L of w,

01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:18.560
it would go into 1 times S1.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:29.494
Now I ask you the question,
do these operators commute?

01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:35.450
Strange question, but it's
a fundamental question.

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:39.470
It's really the basis of most
of your intuition about two

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:42.820
particle systems.

01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:44.750
Well, let's see if they commute.

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:54.230
You have T1 tensor 1
multiplied by 1 tensor S1.

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:59.500
It's going to act on v tensor w.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:08.750
Or you have it in the
other order, 1 S1 T1 1.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:22.020
Well, when it acts, the first
part, it gives me T1 tensor 1,

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:26.747
but now acting on this,
this is v tensor Sw.

01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:31.710
And then when I
act on this one, I

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:39.285
get now T1 on v tensor S1 of w.

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:48.670
And when I act here, the first
step, it gives me a T1 on v,

01:17:48.670 --> 01:17:51.310
and the second gives
me the S1 on w,

01:17:51.310 --> 01:17:53.090
so it gives me the same thing.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:57.830
T1 on v, S1 on w.

01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:02.680
So these two operators,
because they originated,

01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:05.750
they've operators of the
first particle, operator

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:11.000
of the second particle, they
can act on the whole system,

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.850
but they still commute.

01:18:12.850 --> 01:18:15.520
They don't know
about each other,

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:18.390
and the communication
now is the calculation

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:21.660
which you just have seen.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:24.350
What this is a good
example of this thing

01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:32.120
is that when you try to
write the Hamiltonian

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:36.810
of the whole system, H
total, you would say,

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:40.090
oh, it's the Hamiltonian
of the first system,

01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:46.340
tensor 1, plus 1
tensor the Hamiltonian

01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:47.590
of the second system.

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:55.880
Time for an example.

01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:03.490
So the example is a famous one,
and this is a great example

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:08.250
because it's at the basis of
combining angular momentum.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:13.100
So it's an example you're going
to see now and see many times.

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.715
Two spin one 1/2 particles.

01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:31.130
The first partoc;e has a
state plus and a state minus

01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:33.910
for the first article.

01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:38.805
The second particle has a
state plus and a state minus.

01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:46.050
So how do we form
the tensor product?

01:19:46.050 --> 01:19:48.300
Well, we say,
these are our basis

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:50.340
states for the
first Hilbert space,

01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:52.800
the basis states for the
second Hilbert space.

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:55.920
We're supposed to take
the product state.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:02.320
So our tensor product is going
to be spanned, so two spins.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:10.260
The tensor vector
space is spanned

01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:18.570
by a vector in the first
times a vector in the second,

01:20:18.570 --> 01:20:20.890
the basis vectors.

01:20:20.890 --> 01:20:30.770
You could have plus in 1,
minus in 2, minus in 1,

01:20:30.770 --> 01:20:38.320
plus in 2, and minus
in 1, minus in 2.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:45.220
So two spin states form a
four-dimensional complex vector

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:47.940
space.

01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:52.120
That's how you describe them,
with those little products.

01:20:52.120 --> 01:20:55.310
And the most general
state is the following.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:10.900
Most general state
is a psi, which

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:21.340
is alpha plus plus-- you could
put 1 and 2-- plus here's alpha

01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:33.172
1, alpha 2, plus, minus,
plus alpha 3 minus, plus,

01:21:33.172 --> 01:21:37.920
plus alpha 4 minus, minus.

01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:51.340
Let's do just one simple
computation, be done for today.

01:21:51.340 --> 01:21:57.130
I want you to try
to figure out what

01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:04.130
is the result of acting with
a total z component of angular

01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:10.190
momentum on this state,
whatever that means.

01:22:10.190 --> 01:22:13.910
Total z component
of angular momentum.

01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:18.810
So naively speaking, the total
z component of angular momentum

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:21.350
would be the z component
of angular momentum

01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:25.910
of the first particle plus
the z component of the angular

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:27.850
momentum of the second
particle, but you

01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:30.400
know that's not the
way we should write it.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:31.915
So how is it really?

01:22:31.915 --> 01:22:40.270
It should be Sz of the first
particle tensor product with 1

01:22:40.270 --> 01:22:46.280
plus 1 tensor product with
Sz of the second particle.

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:48.536
You can say 2 or 1 here.

01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.230
This is really what it is.

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:57.740
You see, how do we upgrade an
operator in the first Hilbert

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.380
space to an operator
on the tensor product?

01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.810
You just let it act
on the first state

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:05.070
but do nothing on the second.

01:23:05.070 --> 01:23:09.590
So summing the two
angular momenta really

01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:16.120
means constructing this new
operator in the new, larger,

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:22.650
more extended space in
which it acts in this way.

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:27.720
So let's just calculate what
that is and we'll stop there.

01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:39.150
Let's see.

01:23:39.150 --> 01:23:45.350
For example, we'll have
the first term, Sz 1

01:23:45.350 --> 01:23:52.630
tensor 1 acting on psi
on the whole state.

01:23:52.630 --> 01:23:57.400
Well, it acts on the
first term, alpha 1.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:24:02.680
Now, this operator is
supposed to act on this thing,

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:06.710
so this acts on that
and that acts on that.

01:24:06.710 --> 01:24:09.450
So you get-- I'll write
this whole thing-- Sz

01:24:09.450 --> 01:24:16.280
hat on plus tensor plus
for the first term.

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:20.100
This term just acted on that.

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.470
We can act with
the second one now.

01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:27.010
Well, I was putting the first,
so let me leave the first.

01:24:27.010 --> 01:24:30.370
Let's do the second
term, plus alpha 2.

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:35.520
It still acts on the first
only, Sz hat plus tensor

01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:46.230
minus plus alpha 2 Sz hat on
minus tensor plus, plus alpha

01:24:46.230 --> 01:24:53.030
4 Sz hat on minus tensor minus.

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:54.650
Now, what is this?

01:24:54.650 --> 01:25:00.530
Well, this thing is h
bar over 2 times plus,

01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:03.200
and the number, of course,
goes out of the tensor product.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.630
You don't worry about that.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:07.340
There's h bar over 2 everywhere.

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.250
Alpha 1 plus, plus.

01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:20.750
Here the same, another plus,
so plus alpha 2 plus, minus.

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:26.350
And here is minus, so
minus alpha 3 minus,

01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:32.075
plus, minus alpha 4,
also minus, minus, minus.

01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:37.530
So that's what it is.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.440
If I do the other one, you
could do it with me now quickly.

01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:49.650
1 tensor Sz 2 on psi.

01:25:49.650 --> 01:25:53.050
Once you get accustomed,
these are pretty direct.

01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:56.620
So I have to act with
Sz hat on these ones,

01:25:56.620 --> 01:26:00.780
so I just act on the second
one, on the second state.

01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.860
So I get h bar over 2.

01:26:03.860 --> 01:26:05.970
For the first one,
you get a plus,

01:26:05.970 --> 01:26:07.790
because it's acting
on this thing,

01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:13.110
so you get alpha 1 plus, plus.

01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:16.030
For the second one,
however, you get a minus

01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:19.200
because it's the second
operator, so minus alpha

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.710
2 plus, minus.

01:26:22.710 --> 01:26:26.110
For the third one,
it's a plus, so you

01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:32.160
get a plus alpha 3 minus, plus.

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.230
And for the last
one, it's a minus,

01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:42.540
so you get minus
alpha 4 minus, minus.

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:45.710
So when you add them
together, these two pieces,

01:26:45.710 --> 01:26:52.290
it's the total, Sz total,
acting on the state,

01:26:52.290 --> 01:26:53.480
and what did you get?

01:26:53.480 --> 01:27:03.360
You get h bar, this one's
at, alpha plus, plus alpha 1.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:06.010
These two cancel,
these two cancel.

01:27:06.010 --> 01:27:13.680
Minus alpha 4 minus, minus.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:20.120
That's the whole action
of Sz on this thing.

01:27:20.120 --> 01:27:32.100
And if you wanted to have a
state with total Sz equals 0,

01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.330
then you would have to put
alpha 1 and alpha 4 to 0.

01:27:41.620 --> 01:27:44.050
You will, if you
want, at some stage,

01:27:44.050 --> 01:27:49.510
calculate, maybe in recitation,
how much is Sy at this state

01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:53.080
and how much is
Sx at this state,

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:55.370
and try to figure
out if there is

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:59.510
a state whose total spin
angular momentum is 0.

01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:02.530
It's just a
calculation like this.

01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:06.080
So next week, we'll
continue with this

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:11.490
and with teleportation
and Bell inequalities.

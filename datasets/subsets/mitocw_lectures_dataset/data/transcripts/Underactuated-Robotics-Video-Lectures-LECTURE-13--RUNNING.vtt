00:00:21.275 --> 00:00:22.900
PROFESSOR: So today
we're going to talk

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.970
about the dynamics of running.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.910
And ask questions as
freely as possible,

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.820
and also if my handwriting's
bad, let me know.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.480
It generally is.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.980
So.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.432
So this is actually
a really fun lecture.

00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:48.640
We have a lot of cool videos.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.223
I don't know if any of you have
seen Raibert hoppers and stuff

00:00:51.223 --> 00:00:53.740
before, but we have some cool
models and some cool analysis

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:54.240
too.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.470
So hopefully,
you'll be as excited

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.320
as I am to participate in
this learning experience.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.550
So here we go.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.560
So the basic model
we'll be looked

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.480
at today in several
different versions of this

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.760
is the SLIP model.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.220
This is the spring-loaded
inverted pendulum.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:18.880
All right.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.170
It's like the running version
of the rimless wheel or compass

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.730
gait.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:25.580
It's pretty simple.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.497
You just have a mass at
the end of a pendulum.

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:32.260
You have a spring here,
spring constant k.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:39.600
The spring is a rest
length r naught and a--

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.350
yeah, we already said
the spring constant.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.808
And so then this--
the coordinates,

00:01:42.808 --> 00:01:52.840
then, are this length r and the
angle theta from the upright.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.160
So what we're going to
want to look at here

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.660
is not just this
model, but also,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.770
in the same way we had for the
rimless wheel, as you remember,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.640
is a 1-D iterated map.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.380
So you probably remember that
for the compass gait that

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.460
lets you look at
the stability of it,

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.585
and there's all these
interesting dynamics that are

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:14.338
captured by that simple system.

00:02:14.338 --> 00:02:16.630
So we're going to want to
look at the 1-D iterated map,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.797
and the other thing I'm
going to try to convince you

00:02:18.797 --> 00:02:24.440
is that this is a
biologically plausible system.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.280
So if you look at
the rimless wheel,

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.620
it feels like something
that's walking,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.880
compass gait even more
so, [INAUDIBLE] knees.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.470
These things all--
just intuitively,

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.720
you can believe that they're--

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.980
sorry-- a-- whoa, that's
probably going to be bad--

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.437
that you could believe that
they're walking systems.

00:02:45.437 --> 00:02:47.520
But this one maybe doesn't
seem to you immediately

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.798
like a running system.

00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:51.090
Maybe it seems like a jumping
system or bouncing system

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.860
or something, but
actually, it actually

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.990
is a pretty good model
for running systems.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.770
So the two things that we're
going to have to go through,

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.380
how do you get a
1-D iterated map?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.250
Now that maybe is a
bit surprising for you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.830
because if you look at
this, the full state

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.875
space of this inverted pendulum
right now, it has states of r--

00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:16.180
sorry-- r theta,
r dot, theta dot.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.002
Now that's four parameters.

00:03:19.002 --> 00:03:20.460
You remember when
you slice through

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.020
and you pick a
surface of section,

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.313
you can cut it down by one.

00:03:23.313 --> 00:03:25.730
So for the rimless wheel, maybe
you have theta, theta dot.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.570
You cut out theta dot,
you're in pretty good shape.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.280
Here we have four,
but we're actually

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.480
going to show that we can
actually get this down

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.770
to a 1-D system
and actually look

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.978
at the iterated map for this.

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.680
So that's kind of cool.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.577
And the other thing is
that also, this system

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:38.160
bounces and takes
off, so actually, we

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.520
need two coordinate systems.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.760
One is this r theta,
r dot, theta dot.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.860
And then when it's
in flight, we're

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.790
going to have x, y, x
dot, y dot, all right.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.231
And both of these
are 4-D, so going

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.640
to have to deal with
that either way.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.730
But first the convincing part.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.900
So the justification here
comes from a field called

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.310
comparative biomechanics.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.230
Now this is a pretty cool field.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.750
They look at all sorts
of different systems

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.940
and try to figure out these
commonalities in the kinematics

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.250
or the dynamics or certain
properties and figure out,

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.105
what are the fundamental
common features

00:04:30.105 --> 00:04:32.140
of these different
biological systems?

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.760
So this running
model, actually, you

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.780
can look at it in the context of
things from cockroaches, which

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:52.290
are on the order of a
gram in mass, horses,

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.300
which are on the order of--

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.600
well, some of them, at
least, are 135 kilograms.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.420
It's not that heavy, really,
so you could imagine maybe

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.250
heavier horses.

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.940
Crabs.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.175
Now you can think about the
kinematics of these system

00:05:06.175 --> 00:05:07.800
and just how wildly
different they are.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.915
Cockroaches, six-legged,
bouncing all around,

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:11.100
[INAUDIBLE] tripod gait.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.110
Horses, quadrupeds.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.790
Crabs, actually they run
sideways with eight legs.

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.580
This is different information,
so I won't put it there.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.080
But crabs actually
will run sideways

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.740
using their eight legs.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.823
It's actually pretty cool.

00:05:23.823 --> 00:05:25.170
I don't know if you've seen it.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:29.580
And then humans, which maybe
is the one that we most--

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.150
well, I don't know, that's
probably unfairly biocentric.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.120
So we're humans.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.580
And all of these, despite the
very different kinematics,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.620
despite, what is this, five
orders of magnitude in mass,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.898
they all have incredible
dynamic similarity.

00:05:58.903 --> 00:06:01.320
Let's hope I'm not getting
graded on spelling, because I'm

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.405
pretty sure that's way off.

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:08.150
[INAUDIBLE] And so if you
look at it in the right way,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.650
you can actually see that all
of these systems, cockroaches,

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.550
horses, crabs, camels, cats,
bunny rabbits, all these things

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.280
actually look very similar.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.850
And so Bob Full, some of
you may know Bob Full,

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.262
I think at Berkeley.

00:06:27.262 --> 00:06:29.720
He looks at a lot of things,
especially the cockroach work.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.360
He has a lot of cool
work on cockroaches.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.070
And he also has
this paper which--

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:46.190
let's see if I can
find what page this on.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.155
Sorry, here.

00:06:47.155 --> 00:06:50.440
There we go.

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.350
Is that clear up there?

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:54.580
Ooh.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.890
Sorry.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.135
So here, you can
look at the-- oh,

00:07:01.135 --> 00:07:03.880
let me dim the lights a bit.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.290
If you look at the
plot on the left,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.843
this is speed and
the stride length.

00:07:10.843 --> 00:07:12.760
So if you plot speed and
stride lengths-- here

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.440
they've got gerbils,
dogs, and camels,

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.410
but you can do this for a
very wide variety of systems.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.250
You can see that they're
all bounced over the place.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.243
You don't have--

00:07:22.243 --> 00:07:24.160
I mean, they're all
behaving very differently,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.147
so that's not
necessarily the right way

00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:28.480
to look at them if you want
to see what is fundamentally

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.525
similar between them.

00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:31.900
If you look at the right, this
is the [INAUDIBLE] number.

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.860
In this case, you can
see it's just the ratio--

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:37.480
well, it's 2 times the
ratio of kinetic energy

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.890
to potential energy.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.770
So it's just this
non-dimensional quantity.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.270
If you plot this and you look
at the relative stride length,

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.580
which is--

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.220
you can see they all collapse
very tightly on this line.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.500
And so there's actually--
that's impressive agreement.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.820
You see that these are--

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.190
camels, dogs, and
gerbils are all--

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.320
look very similar
when you look at them

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.460
in this non-dimensional way.

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.860
So all these systems,
orders of magnitude,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:08.080
again, of difference in masses,
stride lengths too, probably,

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.140
all look very similar
when you compare them

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.270
in the right framework.

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:14.470
And that's what
comparative biomechanics

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:19.240
tries to do, in addition
to other things, obviously.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.950
So here's something
that's really cool

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.330
and that connects us
back to our SLIP model.

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:29.030
If we look at the
next page, you'll

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:34.610
see right here, here in--

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.070
this is the relative
spring constant

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:39.770
for individual individual
leg [INAUDIBLE] systems,

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:43.280
cockroach to kangaroo,
five orders of magnitude.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.740
You can see that they're
all pretty similar.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.320
This is huge spectrum
of masses, and yet

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.810
in the framework of
the SLIP model's spring

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.150
constant, they all
behave pretty similarly,

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.510
humans, all these things.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.020
And so if you look
at these systems

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.750
through this simple
model, they all not only

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:03.130
look similar to one another, but
their dynamics and their center

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.248
of mass [INAUDIBLE] are
pretty well described

00:09:05.248 --> 00:09:06.290
by this kind of behavior.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:06.938
Sorry.

00:09:06.938 --> 00:09:07.980
By that kind of behavior.

00:09:12.872 --> 00:09:17.150
So hopefully that will be
somewhat compelling argument

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:18.920
that this model
is representative

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.440
of actual running behavior,
not just something

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.180
that comes out of nowhere.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.606
And a lot of work was done
on this in the '80s and '90s

00:09:26.606 --> 00:09:30.412
on trying to study this model
and connect it to animals

00:09:30.412 --> 00:09:31.370
and that sort of stuff.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.558
I don't know if you've
seen Raibert's work,

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:37.100
but he has robots that are very
similar to these sort of SLIP

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.658
model that run and
jump and actually

00:09:38.658 --> 00:09:40.700
are from the '80s and such
like that actually are

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.000
some of the really cool robots.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.600
And I'll show you some of those.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.203
So he actually didn't
even call them SLIP.

00:09:47.203 --> 00:09:48.620
He actually made
them before SLIP,

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.225
and that motivated some of
the work on SLIP models.

00:09:52.225 --> 00:09:52.850
But I can show.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.517
Here, I'll show you
a picture of a robot

00:09:54.517 --> 00:10:01.340
so you can see the kind of cool
stuff that we're getting to.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.550
I don't know if--

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:04.460
are many of you familiar
with the Leg Lab?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.060
They should be around.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.780
Yeah, they had a
lot of cool robots.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:14.570
And here, see if I can give
you just a little picture

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:17.972
[INAUDIBLE] Ah.

00:10:17.972 --> 00:10:19.467
Oh, so that's the biped robot.

00:10:19.467 --> 00:10:21.800
This thing's bouncing, but
that's not really the picture

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.675
I wanted to show you.

00:10:27.856 --> 00:10:28.850
Ah, here we go.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.290
Yeah.

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:38.960
So this little robot, you can
see that's tracing its foot.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.760
This up here is tracing
its center mass.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.130
And you see how center mass
actually compresses right

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:44.107
above the foot.

00:10:44.107 --> 00:10:45.440
And that's what you expect here.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.732
It lands, and it squishes down.

00:10:46.732 --> 00:10:48.320
And so instead of
when you're walking

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.903
and you vault over
this leg-- like you

00:10:49.903 --> 00:10:51.200
think about that rimless wheel.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.180
Its center mass rolls
up over its foot.

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.520
This one, both intuitively
in the model and you

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.020
can see right here
this robot, which

00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:58.670
is similar to the
model in many ways,

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.680
is squishing down into
its foot, all right.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.180
And that actually
is one of the ways

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.693
of looking at the difference
between what is running,

00:11:04.693 --> 00:11:05.360
what is walking.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.310
So one of the
definitions for running

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.510
is that you're supposed
to have an aerial phase.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.200
But not every running
animal has an aerial phase.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.160
So this is-- actually, I think
comparative biomechanicians

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.930
look at this center of mass to
center of pressure trajectory,

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:19.430
because--

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.380
I don't know if you
know Groucho Marx.

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:22.990
Groucho Marx had this funny run.

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:23.850
Maybe I'll do it.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.085
So [INAUDIBLE] but
sort of like this--

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:26.585
you know?

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:27.830
That kind of goofy
thing where your feet

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.027
aren't coming up the ground?

00:11:29.027 --> 00:11:30.110
That doesn't seem natural.

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:31.568
But actually, some
animals do that.

00:11:31.568 --> 00:11:35.520
There's actually elephants
that do that Groucho run.

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.292
So maybe if you're big
enough, it makes sense.

00:11:38.292 --> 00:11:41.690
But yeah, so [INAUDIBLE] this
is very different from walking.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.068
And it's actually quite
similar to running,

00:11:44.068 --> 00:11:45.860
and actually, if you
look at these animals,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.360
it captures a lot
of their dynamics.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:52.160
So and another
important thing is

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.490
that these kind of robots
which came around in the '80s

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.830
were the similar kind of work
in robotics, because again,

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.575
the same time [INAUDIBLE] these
slow, careful walking robots.

00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:03.950
Again, here are
these robots that

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.092
are flying through the air.

00:12:05.092 --> 00:12:06.800
I'll show you some
videos later, but they

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.425
did flips and all
kinds of crazy stuff.

00:12:08.425 --> 00:12:10.910
I mean, they're throwing
themselves around wildly,

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.785
which is not what people
thought of when they

00:12:12.785 --> 00:12:14.330
thought of these legged robots.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:19.400
Oh, and the other thing--

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.290
this is cool too.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:22.790
If you look at
animals, like we're

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:24.748
talking about this springs
and stuff like that,

00:12:24.748 --> 00:12:26.540
that's not just some
sort of obtuse model

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.623
that comes out of nowhere.

00:12:27.623 --> 00:12:30.717
If you look at horses and
stuff, well, animals, actually,

00:12:30.717 --> 00:12:31.550
are full of springs.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.383
Their tendons can store
up energy and stuff.

00:12:33.383 --> 00:12:35.360
And actually, horses
have a big tendon

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.150
that runs through their leg
all the way up, I think,

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.140
behind their hip.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.180
And apparently, one of
the limiting factors

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:44.540
of trying to run fast is that
you can't pull your leg forward

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.850
fast enough to get
to the next stride.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.810
And so what they
actually can do is

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.348
they can preload
when they're pushing,

00:12:51.348 --> 00:12:53.390
and then that tendon
actually acts like a spring.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.807
It actually stores
energy and lets

00:12:54.807 --> 00:12:57.740
them swing faster than they
would be able to if they just

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:58.640
used the motor.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.220
And if you look at the oxygen
intake of these animals,

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:03.020
you can see that they're
behaving much more

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.250
efficiently than you could hope
to accomplish if you just had--

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:10.100
if you were simulating a
spring with a bunch of motor--

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.400
with your muscles
acting like a spring.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.150
So it's actually they're
physical springs.

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:16.790
Actually, this tendon
in there actually

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.880
have this actual behavior.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.112
So hopefully-- maybe I'm
dwelling on that point

00:13:21.112 --> 00:13:22.820
too much, but I think
that's really cool,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.950
that these animals actually have
this kind of spring behavior.

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.750
You can see it in
their dynamics,

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.450
and actually, this model
captures a lot of that.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.177
Oh, and here's one other
thing that Russ [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:35.177 --> 00:13:36.260
and it's pretty cool, too.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.112
If you think about--

00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:38.570
this is sort of
tangent, but if you

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:40.410
think about how birds
sit on purchase forever,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.900
right, I mean, it
seems like that'd

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.150
be tiring to be able to hang
there forever just squeezing,

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.780
right?

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.565
But they actually
have tendons, too,

00:13:46.565 --> 00:13:48.065
such that when they
sit on the perch

00:13:48.065 --> 00:13:49.815
and their weight
squishes their legs down,

00:13:49.815 --> 00:13:54.190
it actually will clamp their
talons in and let them hold on.

00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:56.090
So that's cool, too,
that these animals

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.820
have all these interesting
passive structures and springs,

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:01.320
stuff like that, that help them
do all these kind of things.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.510
And so it's not like the,
just use your muscles

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:07.360
and just dominate, all
these kind of things.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.818
There's a lot of
passive structures

00:14:08.818 --> 00:14:12.650
that do a lot of this for free.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:17.060
So hopefully, you all
think that's awesome.

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:18.530
All right.

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:20.360
All right, so getting
back to the system.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:25.520
Looking at this-- sorry--
at this model again--

00:14:28.566 --> 00:14:30.140
did you see where
I put my chalk?

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.210
All right.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.836
So going back to
the SLIP system--

00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:43.070
let's see.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.300
Again, the state space here--

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.760
is it-- yeah, it's
still dark in here.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.730
So going back to this
system, again, we

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:13.468
have r theta, r dot, theta dot,
and in the aerial phase, x, y,

00:15:13.468 --> 00:15:16.945
x dot, y dot.

00:15:16.945 --> 00:15:19.210
All right, I'll bring
this one back down.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:29.740
And let me put in the
assumptions really clearly

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:31.240
of what this model
is going to have,

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.190
so the assumptions
for the SLIP model.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.060
So one is that you
have a massless--

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:53.870
whoa, that's terrible--
massless leg and toe.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:54.370
All right?

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:57.400
So all your mass is
concentrated in that [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.400
at the body.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:13.337
You have an ideal lossless
spring in your leg.

00:16:13.337 --> 00:16:14.920
And what that means,
that effectively,

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.888
your collisions with the ground,
unlike all the walking models,

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:18.805
are perfectly elastic.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:34.170
All right?

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.093
And now you can see that that's
not an extra assumption that

00:16:37.093 --> 00:16:38.010
is derived from these.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.657
When it hits, even though
this toe sticks in right away

00:16:41.657 --> 00:16:43.740
and [INAUDIBLE] inelastic
collision with that toe,

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.782
because there's no mass
there, there's no energy,

00:16:45.782 --> 00:16:47.310
there's not momentum in it--

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:48.170
sorry.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:51.215
This is [INAUDIBLE] you
don't lose any energy.

00:16:51.215 --> 00:16:52.590
And so it's actually
conservative

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:53.382
as it runs through.

00:16:53.382 --> 00:16:54.150
And then if you--

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.800
it's flying through
the air, there's

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.840
no drag or anything,
that's conservative when it

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.320
flies through the air as well.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.760
And so this system
actually is completely

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.030
conservative in
its full operation.

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.250
So yeah, so it's very
different than a rimless wheel.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.980
And also, then the other
assumption we have to make

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:26.430
is that the leg instantly goes
to the desired theta and rest

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:27.690
length.

00:17:27.690 --> 00:17:29.670
So again, when it's
massless, the rest length,

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.510
it will do that automatically.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.650
But you have to assume
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.750
teleported to that theta.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.960
So you don't worry about
collisions with the ground

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960
or everything like that.

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.720
Your leg just goes to
the theta touchdown.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.588
So the moment you take off,
it's in this new configuration.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:44.927
So now what we
have to do is, now

00:17:44.927 --> 00:17:46.510
that we have the
system and the model,

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:48.135
we want to pick our
surface of section,

00:17:48.135 --> 00:17:51.430
because our goal here is to turn
this into a 1-D iterated map,

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.370
right, because that's
what this is all about.

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:54.745
We're going to
try to figure out,

00:17:54.745 --> 00:17:57.482
how do we pick a spot where you
can just look at one section

00:17:57.482 --> 00:17:59.440
and describe all the
dynamics, just being like,

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.640
OK, we're here.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.690
Simulate to the next one.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:02.860
And then we can just
iterate this map

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:05.050
and figure out the fixed points,
figure out a lot of things,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:06.580
as we did with
the rimless wheel.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.860
So does anyone have an idea of
what a good surface of section

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:09.360
would be?

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:16.910
No?

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.270
What special configurations
are there that we can look at?

00:18:22.538 --> 00:18:23.330
AUDIENCE: Take-off.

00:18:23.330 --> 00:18:24.750
PROFESSOR: Take-off.

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.000
What else?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.500
That's one.

00:18:30.156 --> 00:18:31.530
AUDIENCE: Full compression.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:32.405
PROFESSOR: Full com--

00:18:32.405 --> 00:18:34.045
AUDIENCE: Or rest
length [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.045 --> 00:18:35.050
PROFESSOR: At the rest length?

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:35.560
That's true.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.913
Full compression you
could do, but that

00:18:37.913 --> 00:18:40.330
would be like there'd be a 0
r dot or something like that.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:40.630
But yeah.

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:41.530
No, I mean, you could.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.940
There's a lot of these
special configurations.

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.380
But the one that you
really want to look at,

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.380
the one that collapses
things down the most

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:47.830
is if you look at the apex.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:50.750
So you look at the maximum
height of this flight.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.000
So we can just look at that y.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.450
And the reason we can do this
I can describe right here.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:56.770
So we look in the flight phase.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.360
Now, first of all,
x, we don't really

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.202
care about what x is
for the stability.

00:19:07.202 --> 00:19:09.160
Doesn't matter where it
is along that position.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.990
That doesn't affect
the dynamics directly.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:12.970
So we don't care about x.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.570
So y, we definitely
do care about.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:24.260
This matters.

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.730
x dot, well, x dot, because
we know it's conservative

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:36.950
and we know that since at
the apex y dot equals 0,

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.680
then x dot is purely a
function of y, right?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.160
We can look at the total
energy of the system, which

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:50.960
is 1/2 m V squared plus mgy.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:54.680
We know y dot is 0, so that
means that V is just x dot.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.590
And so you can write x
dot is a function of y.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:02.668
And so here, we know this is 0.

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:03.710
We don't care about this.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:05.252
This one we can find
directly from y.

00:20:05.252 --> 00:20:08.690
And so everything that happens
between one apex, another apex,

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.550
we know if we just know y.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:12.420
You see that?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.230
Yes.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.530
AUDIENCE: We're always
adjusting the angles [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:18.558
landing so that it is
vertical at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:18.558 --> 00:20:20.850
PROFESSOR: It's set at whatever
desired angle we're at.

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:24.390
So there's some nominal angle
we want on this touchdown.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.983
So let's say it's 30
degrees or whatever.

00:20:26.983 --> 00:20:28.650
And so that means
that then you take off

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.670
and your angle-- your
leg goes to 30 degrees,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.830
and then you hit there.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.370
And so the touchdown
angle is always the same.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.770
And so there's no control
in this at the moment.

00:20:37.770 --> 00:20:41.105
It's just the passive stability
of this balancing system.

00:20:41.105 --> 00:20:42.480
Does that makes
sense to everyone

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.022
how we can collapse
all these things?

00:20:50.069 --> 00:20:50.902
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:20:50.902 --> 00:20:51.826
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:20:51.826 --> 00:20:53.375
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] why
don't we care about x again?

00:20:53.375 --> 00:20:53.800
Because--

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.610
PROFESSOR: Because
that doesn't affect

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:55.660
the stability of the system.

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.430
So if we're trying to get
somewhere and hit a target,

00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:59.470
yeah, then we have to look
at x in our controller.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.900
But because the x doesn't
figure in the dynamics anywhere,

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.610
right, doesn't matter,
because again--

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:04.510
sorry, this is something
I probably should have

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.635
mentioned in the beginning.

00:21:05.635 --> 00:21:07.770
It's not going downhill
or anything like that.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.920
So how far it goes
in x doesn't matter.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.500
The dynamics are going to be
the same invariant to that,

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.425
if that makes sense.

00:21:13.425 --> 00:21:15.550
And so because of that, I
mean, x will be changing,

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:18.003
but it won't affect
the next apex height,

00:21:18.003 --> 00:21:20.253
because it doesn't figure
into the dynamics like that.

00:21:20.253 --> 00:21:21.370
Does that make sense?

00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:26.420
All right.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:30.460
So we can represent the
whole thing just using y.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.755
I guess that's the
important thing to realize.

00:21:32.755 --> 00:21:33.880
So what do I want to erase?

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:34.797
I'll erase this stuff.

00:21:38.099 --> 00:21:39.560
I'll throw this back up.

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.260
Hmm.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.370
This isn't ideal.

00:22:01.092 --> 00:22:03.300
All right, this is not going
to get better than that.

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.460
All right.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:06.110
So we just go through
this transition

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.390
and we go from apex
to apex, we can

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:15.470
look at is we have y apex at n.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:21.740
Then we need to figure out how
that translates into the y,

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:26.973
x dot, and y dot at that apex.

00:22:26.973 --> 00:22:29.390
All right, so we need to map
this one piece of information

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.980
into all of these.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:38.330
And then we can map
that into the y,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:44.540
x dot, y dot at the touchdown,
so when it comes in and hits.

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:49.190
Now we have to change our
coordinate system to r theta,

00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:51.230
r dot, theta dot.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:54.650
This is still a touchdown,
and we swing that

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:56.930
through in the stance phase.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:23:03.290
Then we get that to r theta,
r dot, theta dot at take-off.

00:23:03.290 --> 00:23:06.038
So my D and my O are
as different as I

00:23:06.038 --> 00:23:06.830
can make them look.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.790
Then at take-off again, we
switch to our aerial phase.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:22.460
We go back to y, x
dot, y dot at takeoff.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:31.430
And that brings us, then, to
a y, x dot, y dot at apex.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:37.013
And then here, of course,
we grab y n plus 1 at apex.

00:23:37.013 --> 00:23:40.640
[PHONE RINGING]

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.232
So these transitions,
I'll number of them

00:23:43.232 --> 00:23:44.690
and make this a
little bit clearer.

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:49.160
That's one, two, three, four.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:52.070
Sorry.

00:23:57.726 --> 00:24:01.430
So all right.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.895
And the key now is
to figure out how

00:24:04.895 --> 00:24:07.020
to push our system throughout
all these transitions

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:09.270
so we can figure out what
this mapping is going to be.

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:19.330
So some of these are pretty
easy to do, and some of them

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:21.820
can be quite tricky to do.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.090
But all of them are
quite manageable.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:35.500
So what you look at first
is the energy, which

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.430
is our kinetic plus
potential, again,

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:44.155
is 1/2 mv squared plus mgy.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:51.160
So at the first step,
if you want to convert--

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.430
if we want to take y apex and
turn it into these guys again,

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.750
we can have the
energy of the apex

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:05.320
we know is 1/2 m x dot, again,
because we know y dot 0,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:10.335
plus mgy is equal to a constant.

00:25:10.335 --> 00:25:11.960
And so then this
means that we can say,

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:18.730
all right, x dot equals
this function of y.

00:25:24.524 --> 00:25:26.560
So we can figure
out what x dot is,

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.400
[INAUDIBLE] and
then we know also--

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:29.440
sorry.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.410
We know y dot equals 0.

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.010
And so here, then, that
gets our first transition.

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:42.010
Two then, if we want--

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.170
we know that x
dot at touchdown--

00:25:44.170 --> 00:25:47.650
so this is the ballistic
phase coming down from apex--

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:52.160
is equal to x dot apex, because
there's no forces on it,

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.970
so it's just going to keep
carrying forward in x.

00:25:54.970 --> 00:26:01.660
And then we know y touchdown
is going to be r naught cosine

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.270
theta naught.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:03.728
So this is what I
was talking about

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:05.080
with there's the desired theta.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.497
So your touchdown,
you know you're

00:26:06.497 --> 00:26:09.400
going to touch down
at this desired theta.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.400
And this, then, again,
since we know our energy,

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.180
we can get y dot
touchdown, all right.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:22.210
So here that gets our transition
from apex to touchdown.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:25.090
Now this is just a
coordinate transformation.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:26.380
It's pretty easy to do.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.790
Just make sure you get
your velocities right.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.140
You have to decompose
them properly.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.910
But you can just transform
those coordinates,

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.993
and then you get that
without too much difficulty.

00:26:32.993 --> 00:26:37.694
But then you get to the tricky
one, and the tricky one--

00:26:37.694 --> 00:26:42.170
[INAUDIBLE] The tricky
one is the stance phase.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:49.930
So how do you push yourself
from when you come in

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:53.380
and hit to squishing down
and launching back out?

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.110
So that's the
involved part of this.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:02.740
So four is stance dynamics.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.380
AUDIENCE: Is that y a
touchdown [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.716
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:27:11.716 --> 00:27:14.710
AUDIENCE: y [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:18.340
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah,
this is touchdown.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:18.940
Sorry.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.060
So to get to two, to
get this falling phase,

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.210
you know x doesn't change.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:25.150
There's no forces
in the x direction.

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:27.790
y touchdown, you fix this angle.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:29.475
That's instantaneous
warp of the leg.

00:27:29.475 --> 00:27:30.850
So you know when
it touches down,

00:27:30.850 --> 00:27:32.080
it's going to be this
high, because that's

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:34.660
when touchdown's defined, is
when the toe hits the ground.

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.830
And then here, you
know your height.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:36.550
You know this.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:37.925
And again,
conservation of energy

00:27:37.925 --> 00:27:41.603
will give you this at
the y dot touchdown

00:27:41.603 --> 00:27:43.270
since that just allows
you to figure out

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.437
your state when you come in.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.350
So stance dynamics.

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:55.450
So here, you've
got a idea of what

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:57.220
you expect the system to do.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.710
You have a spring.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:02.880
And if you're running
in steady state,

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.032
I believe you take off the
same angle you come in.

00:28:06.032 --> 00:28:07.490
But so what you
can imagine happens

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:10.990
is this thing swings around like
this, but the center of mass

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:13.408
goes in and comes back out.

00:28:13.408 --> 00:28:14.950
So again, it's doing
that compression

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.533
and then launching
itself, all right.

00:28:17.533 --> 00:28:19.200
So I think it's a
assumption Raibert did

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.920
for the steady state operation.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.580
It comes in, out
at the same angle,

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.680
and serves as a
compression in the middle.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:26.350
And so again, this
kind of behavior

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.730
is, again, one of those
ways of defining running,

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:28.960
like for the Groucho
kind of running,

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.070
is that you see
the center of mass

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.750
come in to the
center of pressure,

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:33.580
as opposed to vaulting over it.

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.610
If this was a stiff leg,
it would go like this.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.950
So that distinction is one
way of defining running.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:47.836
So we can define take-off, so
we know our final condition.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:58.542
So take-off happens
when r equals r naught.

00:28:58.542 --> 00:29:00.250
So when you get back
to your rest length,

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.830
you assume that your
body then, it goes back

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.780
to the ballistic phase.

00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:08.830
All right, then we can write
down our energies here.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.870
Now again, we're in
the polar coordinates

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.622
now, so our energies look
a little bit different.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:24.220
Our kinetic energy
looks like that,

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:34.370
and our potential energy is this
term, and what else do we need?

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.785
What else?

00:29:36.785 --> 00:29:37.910
AUDIENCE: Spring potential.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:38.910
PROFESSOR: Spring, yeah.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:49.342
So it's k over 2 x-- sorry--

00:29:49.342 --> 00:29:54.800
r minus r naught squared.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:30:01.280
And so using that, you
probably remember Lagrange.

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.910
It's not that bad of a system.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:06.960
You can get the
equations of motion.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.720
The equation of
motion here, you get--

00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:26.671
oh, sorry.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:51.130
And so you have all
your expected terms,

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.720
centrifugal terms,
Coriolis terms, all

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.920
that if you try to make
sense of what this is.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.670
And so if you want to get
from touchdown to take-off,

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.800
you can't get a closed
form solution from this.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.900
You can simulate pretty
easily, obviously.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.317
But you don't get
the closed form,

00:31:08.317 --> 00:31:10.440
so you can't get this
analytical kind of mapping.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.930
But if you use a small
angle and small displacement

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.360
approximation, you can
linearize the system,

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.660
and you can get a closed form
solution for this touchdown

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.850
to take-off phase, all right.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.220
And so that's this assumption
that theta is much,

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:25.240
much less than 1.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:30.780
Your delta r over r0
is much less than 1.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:33.820
And so then you can get
to a closed form solution.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:34.585
It's kind of ugly.

00:31:34.585 --> 00:31:35.460
It's not really ugly.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.377
I mean, it's not so ugly
as to be prohibitive,

00:31:37.377 --> 00:31:40.455
but I'm not going
to write it down.

00:31:40.455 --> 00:31:42.580
But that lets you actually
get a closed form return

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.610
map, all right.

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:46.530
And something cool
about that is that you

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:52.320
get these two fixed points.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:54.915
You get one stable fixed point
and one unstable fixed point.

00:31:54.915 --> 00:31:58.280
And-- hmm.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:03.520
And actually, a number
of people thought

00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:05.680
that a system like this,
this conservative system,

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.680
shouldn't be able to get
that sort of stability,

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.460
because if you remember
in the rimless wheel,

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.080
the energy loss was
critical towards achieving

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:15.790
the stability.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.720
When you went faster, you hit
harder, you lost more energy.

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:23.980
And when you went slower,
you didn't lose much energy,

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.110
so you were able to speed up
as you went down this ramp.

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:29.592
So the fact that you can
achieve stability in this system

00:32:29.592 --> 00:32:32.050
is kind of cool, too, because
it's completely conservative,

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:34.420
yet somehow, dynamics are
able to actually push it

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.380
towards a repeatable state.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.060
[INAUDIBLE] an then looking at--

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.070
we're going to see
this return map.

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:48.280
This is from [INAUDIBLE]
Geyer's thesis work, I believe.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:59.010
And it's pretty cool, if
I can get to it for you.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:13.198
There we go.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.020
There we go.

00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:23.530
So this is actually
the return map

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:25.030
for this small
angle approximation

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.680
you can get analytically.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.732
And you see there's this
unstable fixed point,

00:33:28.732 --> 00:33:30.940
and then down there, there's
that stable fixed point.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:35.680
So you zoom in, and you can
see the stability region,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.110
that that unstable one
is defining the boundary

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.050
of the stability for that.

00:33:41.050 --> 00:33:45.010
The apex height, why does it
get to that minimum there?

00:33:45.010 --> 00:33:49.280
Why doesn't it go
below that 0.87?

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:49.780
Anyone know?

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:58.295
Why don't we look
at it below that?

00:33:58.295 --> 00:34:00.670
AUDIENCE: Because that's
the maximum range?

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.570
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's your
height at the cosine theta

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:06.070
length of the leg.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:08.530
And so you can't get below that.

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:10.210
And then the weird
thing is, and this

00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:12.168
is something I was talking
about with Russ just

00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:14.545
before he went
home, was why does

00:34:14.545 --> 00:34:15.670
it keep climbing like that?

00:34:23.966 --> 00:34:25.929
AUDIENCE: Why does it
keep climbing [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:28.290
PROFESSOR: Well, because
this is conservative.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.400
So how can you
have an instability

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.675
that pushes you up to larger
and larger apex heights?

00:34:32.675 --> 00:34:34.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
to a more vertical--

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:36.460
PROFESSOR: At some point,
though, it should cap.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.960
There should be another stable
fixed point bouncing straight

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.690
up.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:41.710
There isn't.

00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:43.929
The thing is that,
what we think is

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:45.610
that that unstable
one right there is

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.063
your vertical bouncing.

00:34:47.063 --> 00:34:49.480
And the thing is that, actually,
when you linearize these,

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.239
they don't quite
conserve energy anymore.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.710
This actually can be a
non-conservative term.

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:56.252
So we think that's
what this is from.

00:34:56.252 --> 00:34:58.252
So it really shouldn't
be climbing up like that,

00:34:58.252 --> 00:34:59.977
because when you
simulate these things,

00:34:59.977 --> 00:35:01.810
you don't get above
that second fixed point.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.000
It rolls up to
this unstable one.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.710
And so then-- but
looking at this again,

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.300
now here's another
strange thing.

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.370
It looks like it should be
globally stable, then, right?

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:10.828
Because if in
practice we can't get

00:35:10.828 --> 00:35:12.930
above that unstable
fixed point--

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:17.170
and if you look at this apex
axis, right, the higher it is,

00:35:17.170 --> 00:35:18.130
the slower it moves.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.185
So at your minimum apex
height, right, that's

00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:21.310
when you're moving fastest.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:23.685
It looks like it's stable
throughout the entire operating

00:35:23.685 --> 00:35:24.460
regime, right?

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:27.430
The fastest it can move is
that little guy on the far left

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:29.210
where it's apparently stable.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:31.460
And the slowest it can move
is this vertical bouncing,

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:33.145
[INAUDIBLE] fixed point.

00:35:33.145 --> 00:35:34.270
So how do you explain that?

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:42.043
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:42.043 --> 00:35:43.960
PROFESSOR: Well, that's
the thing is that it--

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:45.460
that's pretty much
exactly the issue

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:49.150
is that your failure mode can
come from coming in, squishing

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:49.803
really low--

00:35:49.803 --> 00:35:51.220
I'm going to fall
in my face here,

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:52.990
so I should let everyone see it.

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.490
You can compress
and get really low,

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:55.660
and then you bounce forward.

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:57.010
And if you bounce forward
at such a directory

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.510
that you never get high
enough for your leg

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.130
to be out, touch it
down, then you're

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.700
just going to bounce
forward, land on your face.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.160
You can't actually
warp your leg.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.035
Does that make sense?

00:36:04.035 --> 00:36:05.411
So that can be
your failure mode.

00:36:05.411 --> 00:36:06.970
So you bounce in,
you shoot across,

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.680
and then if you never
have an apex high enough,

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.305
you'll never get your
leg ahead of you.

00:36:11.305 --> 00:36:12.430
So that's the failure mode.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:15.280
So that's actually then what
we see when we simulate it.

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.655
And the simulation actually
looks a little bit different.

00:36:17.655 --> 00:36:20.020
There's actually-- this
guy looks pretty good,

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.100
but if you simulate
it and you have

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.750
slightly different
parameters, that

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:26.500
curve there comes down
a little bit lower,

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.000
and so you're actually
able to be from the top

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.950
and bounce in and
overshoot and go unstable.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:31.270
So it's not like you're
guaranteed stability

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.978
by starting to bounce
vertically, either.

00:36:32.978 --> 00:36:36.358
So this will change
with different energies,

00:36:36.358 --> 00:36:38.650
different parameter settings,
and everything like that.

00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:41.140
But the takehome thing
I think that's cool

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.845
is that, even this
simplified perspective of it,

00:36:44.845 --> 00:36:46.970
you get this stability in
this conservative system.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.700
You get this stability that
you can see in the simulation,

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:50.908
and that even though it's
not dampening on any energy

00:36:50.908 --> 00:36:53.382
or anything like that,
is able to bounce

00:36:53.382 --> 00:36:54.340
along and right itself.

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.507
And apparently, what that's
related to-- apparently,

00:36:56.507 --> 00:36:58.570
people didn't used to
think that was possible.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.240
But the coordinate
transform is actually

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.790
enough to get that kind
of stability, is that--

00:37:03.790 --> 00:37:06.010
it's called piecewise holonomic.

00:37:06.010 --> 00:37:07.660
And by switching
these coordinates,

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:09.760
you're actually
able to get the--

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.955
that allows the dynamics
to stabilize themselves,

00:37:11.955 --> 00:37:14.080
apparently, as opposed to
a normal holonomic system

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:16.570
apparently couldn't
actually converge in back

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:17.758
towards this fixed point.

00:37:17.758 --> 00:37:19.550
If you think about the
pendulum [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:21.800
like that, that's not going
to converge [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.050
It has to conserve the energy.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.690
But apparently, with
piecewise holonomic systems,

00:37:25.690 --> 00:37:27.650
it's available.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:30.040
But you can read some
papers and get into that.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:34.450
But I don't know much
more than I just told you.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:43.300
All right, so here's another
thing that's interesting,

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.110
is that if you look at-- if
you want to model those Raibert

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:51.220
hoppers, right, they obviously
aren't completely conservative.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.332
They do have some mass in
the toe and in the leg,

00:37:54.332 --> 00:37:56.290
and so when they hit,
they do lose some energy,

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.990
because when that toe hits
and sticks to the ground,

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:01.880
it's going to be a
dissipative reaction.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:04.920
So you can look at
this model by, I think,

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:08.640
[INAUDIBLE] and Buehler in '91.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:11.122
I'm going to use
my big chalk again.

00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:14.465
Ah, and here's my old big chalk.

00:38:14.465 --> 00:38:17.230
So looking at this.

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:23.800
So here we have a toe mass.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:28.890
So we have the mass of the
body and mass of the toe.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:35.155
And this spring can possibly
be non-linear if you want.

00:38:35.155 --> 00:38:37.780
And this was largely-- they did
some analytics, but a lot of it

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.447
was computationally
driven, the analysis

00:38:39.447 --> 00:38:40.570
they did of this system.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:43.840
And so the thing is,
because of this hit here,

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:48.745
you have a loss due
to the toe mass.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:59.875
So must add energy.

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:06.370
And I do this with a
control on the spring.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:08.725
You can vary your spring
constant like that.

00:39:08.725 --> 00:39:11.840
You can add energy
to the system.

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:16.012
And so the control in the spring
is their only control then.

00:39:16.012 --> 00:39:18.220
And you actually can get
similar stability properties

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.850
to the SLIP model.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:20.475
You can get these
when you simulate it.

00:39:20.475 --> 00:39:23.110
You can find the same stable
fixed point, unstable fixed

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.520
point kind of behavior.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.090
And so this is all what
we've been talking about.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.420
The image we have is this
sagittal plane dynamics, right?

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.140
The sagittal plane is this
plane, and so this idea

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:37.060
of running through like that.

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.560
Getting a little
bit aerial phase so

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.020
I look less ridiculous.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.135
And so the other thing,
though, is that it's

00:39:43.135 --> 00:39:44.260
good for the lateral plane.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:48.550
If you look at the lateral
plane dynamics, certain animals,

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.890
the same kind of SLIP model
and that kind of behavior

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.150
can actually be witnessed.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:58.570
So this is, again, something
Bob Full spend a lot of time on.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.450
If you look at a cockroach,
which has a tripod gait--

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.587
here's a cockroach.

00:40:06.587 --> 00:40:08.170
I wish they actually
looked like that.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.773
Probably wouldn't
be as disturbing.

00:40:12.731 --> 00:40:14.710
There.

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.590
And so what you have is, they
use three legs at a time,

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.670
and they're springy legs.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:25.030
As it runs, if you
look at the dynamics,

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.770
you actually can see the--

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:29.710
you actually can see that these
legs are acting like springs.

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:35.290
And actually, the same
SLIP behavior you'd expect,

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.200
you witness in the cockroaches.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.050
And so there's some
cool things here.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:42.760
Let me show you.

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:47.110
So these-- have any of
you heard of preflex,

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.625
as opposed to reflex?

00:40:48.625 --> 00:40:52.840
It's like pithy kind
of name, I guess.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:56.710
So the preflex is where
actually, you can actually

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:01.300
look at the time
constant required

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.778
for the monosynaptic reflex,
which is the electrical signal

00:41:03.778 --> 00:41:06.070
to go through and actually
to the spinal cord and back.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.550
So not to the brain and
to the full path, but just

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.290
the quick reflex
kind of response.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:14.890
And actually, some
of these creatures

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.330
actually respond
faster than that.

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:21.250
So the theory is, is
that it's actually

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.843
a musculoskeletal response.

00:41:23.843 --> 00:41:25.760
So it's not even-- it's
not controlled at all.

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.100
It's not going to the muscles
or anything like that.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:27.820
It's tendons.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.735
It's the springiness in the leg.

00:41:29.735 --> 00:41:32.110
And that is actually what's
providing some of the control

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:33.430
here and some of the stability.

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.210
And so there's a really
incredibly awesome video

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:41.380
that I am definitely
going to show you,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:46.690
regardless of how inconvenient
this thing comes out.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:49.347
AUDIENCE: It's not an
anticipatory neural.

00:41:49.347 --> 00:41:50.180
PROFESSOR: It's not.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.722
And that's because
you can actually--

00:41:51.722 --> 00:41:55.930
can perturb them
almost instantaneous,

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:57.100
slam with perturbation.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.840
And so they can't
anticipate this.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.947
And you actually can see, within
one step, a cockroach step,

00:42:01.947 --> 00:42:04.280
they'll spring back, and their
center of mass trajectory

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.660
will get back on track.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.500
And so it's not like they see
something coming or there's--

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:10.210
they're going to step something
that's going to hit them.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:12.835
It's that there's just-- they're
running along, a perturbation,

00:42:12.835 --> 00:42:16.115
and then they start
bouncing right away.

00:42:16.115 --> 00:42:16.990
I'm sorry about this.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:22.150
I don't know what's
happening here.

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:32.230
Yeah.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.340
I'll have to--

00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:42.840
[INAUDIBLE]

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.970
AUDIENCE: So in that
model, is it now the spring

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.456
is actually [INAUDIBLE] Because
now that you have x, y, z,

00:42:48.456 --> 00:42:50.462
and it's at an
angle, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:50.462 --> 00:42:51.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean you--

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.200
AUDIENCE: Is that
how you do that, or--

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.640
PROFESSOR: If you're
doing the lateral plane,

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.595
I think you have to have some
sort of springiness like that

00:42:56.595 --> 00:42:57.678
that can push you through.

00:42:57.678 --> 00:43:00.250
But you can actually look at
the cockroach running along

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.840
the sagittal plane, and you
don't need the [INAUDIBLE] You

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:02.020
can--

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.072
AUDIENCE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:03.072 --> 00:43:05.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can treat
several legs if they're just

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:07.892
like one spring in the tripod.

00:43:07.892 --> 00:43:09.100
If there's something called--

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.100
I don't know if you've seen--
you know Bob Full's work at all

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.508
and these templates and anchors,
where the anchors are the more

00:43:15.508 --> 00:43:17.050
complicated system,
and the templates

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:19.023
are these really
simplified systems?

00:43:19.023 --> 00:43:20.440
So your SLIP little
thing here can

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.780
be like a template, which
is a really minimalist model

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.300
but captures some of
the essential dynamics

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:27.698
and does so in a concise way.

00:43:27.698 --> 00:43:29.740
And you can look at just
a cockroach as following

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:30.760
this kind of running.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:32.640
I mean, and it actually
captures a lot of it.

00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:33.640
I mean, there's more
complicated ones.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.100
If you look at the lateral
plane dynamics, I mean,

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.960
you probably need a
more complicated model.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.760
But so--

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:46.457
AUDIENCE: What did you say
this model was called again?

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:47.540
PROFESSOR: This is a SLIP.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.350
Oh, but [INAUDIBLE] and
Buehler came with this.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.200
So this is-- yeah, it
has a mass of the toe.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.710
I don't know if it
has a different--

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:55.265
I don't think it has
a different name.

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:57.050
Yeah, so let me get to this.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.250
There you go.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:03.690
All right.

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:06.990
So first, the less
exciting thing, I think,

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.670
right here, but
still pretty cool.

00:44:11.410 --> 00:44:14.727
So measuring the force on
these cockroaches' steps,

00:44:14.727 --> 00:44:17.310
you could imagine, is difficult.
Something they did, actually,

00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:19.980
to facilitate these experiments
is they actually have

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.870
these guys running on Jello.

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.390
I think he set up diffraction
[INAUDIBLE] on this jello.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:26.130
And so you see
that, how it changes

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:27.540
color when they're pushing?

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.500
They're actually
able to figure out

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:30.333
the magnitude and the
direction of the force

00:44:30.333 --> 00:44:32.460
to some level of accuracy
by looking at that.

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.650
And apparently, orange
jello works really well.

00:44:34.650 --> 00:44:36.442
I don't know what it
is about orange jello,

00:44:36.442 --> 00:44:39.840
but if you ever want to analyze
the forces on a cockroach's

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:43.740
legs, start with orange jello,
if that's the only thing you

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.600
get out of this lecture.

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:49.923
But yeah, so that's pretty
cool, but that's just

00:44:49.923 --> 00:44:51.090
analyzing when it's turning.

00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:53.715
They can figure out-- that's to
look at some of the springiness

00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:57.230
and how the force response and
the center of mass response

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.730
connect.

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:59.310
But here.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.450
This is one of the greatest
experiments of all time

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.950
right here.

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.780
All right, so this is looking
at the perturbation experienced

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.190
by these cockroaches.

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:11.607
So what they did, they
bolt a cannon to the back,

00:45:11.607 --> 00:45:13.440
because pulling strings
and stuff like that,

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.460
it's not fast enough.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.647
It's nowhere near fast enough.

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:17.730
This cockroach is running.

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.430
Aw, come on.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.480
What's going on here?

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:22.980
All right.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:26.540
Really sorry.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:31.900
It's running.

00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:33.880
Bam.

00:45:33.880 --> 00:45:34.510
Perturbation.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.340
The little cannonball actually
hits it on the way back,

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:36.700
you see.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:37.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:38.228
That's not really fair.

00:45:38.228 --> 00:45:40.120
That's double perturbation.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.480
But they tracked the
center of mass of this guy,

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.550
and actually, you
could see it gets back

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:46.992
on in less than a step.

00:45:46.992 --> 00:45:48.700
And if you look at
the time scale of this

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:56.560
and the time scale of
their monosynaptic reflex,

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:57.650
it happens too quickly.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:58.870
And so they think it's
actually compliance

00:45:58.870 --> 00:46:01.287
in the legs and everything
like that that's just passively

00:46:01.287 --> 00:46:03.910
tuned such that it gets banged
to the side and rights itself.

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:06.025
AUDIENCE: Will you put
this on the course website?

00:46:06.025 --> 00:46:07.120
PROFESSOR: Actually, I think--

00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.220
I mean, it's Bob Full's video,
but he may have it available.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.740
But a great thing is that
the guy who did this thing--

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.920
Devin did it.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.425
And he said-- and
this is all he said,

00:46:18.425 --> 00:46:20.050
so he didn't go
through the full thing.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:21.730
But he's like,
you'd be surprised

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:25.750
by how little gunpowder
is necessary to perturb

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:26.350
a cockroach.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:27.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.590
And so you could only
imagine the first cockroach

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:30.700
they got out there.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:34.120
And they're like ah, this is
about the right amount and just

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.440
blows the cockroach up or
launches it across the room

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.270
or--

00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:40.690
so that would have been a fun
trial in an experiment to watch

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.868
from a different room, I think.

00:46:42.868 --> 00:46:44.410
Yeah, we'll watch
this one more time.

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:46.306
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:46.306 --> 00:46:48.400
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]
But you see, that's just

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.073
a fantastic little experiment.

00:46:50.073 --> 00:46:51.490
And the perturbation,
as you see--

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:52.690
I mean, it doesn't
know that's coming.

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:53.990
That hits it like that.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:55.730
It just responds
almost instantaneously.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:01.490
So I think that's really cool.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.860
And that shows this--

00:47:02.860 --> 00:47:04.630
I mean that's SLIP
in the lateral plane.

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.060
And it shows that these
springs and this compliance

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:07.810
in the actual--

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:09.310
in the animal can
actually do things

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:11.290
that just a control
couldn't do, that the time

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:12.748
scale of the response
can be faster

00:47:12.748 --> 00:47:15.500
than control could achieve.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.100
I don't know if I have--

00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.770
yeah, I don't think I
have these [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.580
So does anybody have a question?

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:28.380
Yeah.

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:36.680
OK, so that's nature having
this spring bouncy compliance.

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:41.870
But you can see Raibert's
hoppers, back in just the '80s

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:45.320
and '90s, did
amazing things, too.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.510
If you look at--

00:47:46.510 --> 00:47:49.250
let's see, where's
this 1-D monoped?

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:50.187
There.

00:47:50.187 --> 00:47:52.270
Some of these videos are
pretty crappy, but there.

00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:55.920
So that's just a little
monoped running around.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.420
Do you see?

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:57.950
And I mean, it's constrained
to be in the plane.

00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.615
It's on a boom, but it
could fall down forward

00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:00.290
and everything like that.

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:01.880
It's not like it's free to roll.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:05.300
So it's achieved the stability
bouncing around that circle.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:09.980
But thought they could do more
than that if you look at--

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:11.360
they built bipeds.

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:19.220
This is-- I think, yeah, Russ
grabbed this from a VHS tapes.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.080
So this is actually
what's funny is

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.170
that I think this is the
fastest biped around,

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:26.010
but it wasn't quite that fast.

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.973
That's skipping frames,
but I think it's still--

00:48:28.973 --> 00:48:30.890
unless something has
changed in the last year.

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:33.330
It runs like 2.2
meters a second,

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.990
which I think is actually
still the fastest biped.

00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:39.318
But Russ would know if
anything has changed.

00:48:39.318 --> 00:48:41.730
AUDIENCE: Is it spinning around?

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.610
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:45.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I'm sorry.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:46.930
It looks like it's spinning
around but it's not [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:46.930 --> 00:48:47.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:47.760
Oh.

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.240
But check out that.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.630
So here-- oh, come on.

00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:56.662
There.

00:48:56.662 --> 00:48:58.120
So they figured
they could do more.

00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:58.850
Here's a biped.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:01.130
So this one isn't on a boom.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.690
Bam.

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:03.470
Check that out.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.290
Look at this one more time.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:09.610
Running there, [INAUDIBLE]
speed, like gymnastics.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:12.660
That's like a robot
doing a front flip.

00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:16.240
Then here, this is
pretty impressive, too.

00:49:21.740 --> 00:49:23.510
Yeah.

00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:27.470
Right over those stairs
like nobody's business.

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:30.488
AUDIENCE: Is there a [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:30.488 --> 00:49:32.030
PROFESSOR: If what
were out of phase?

00:49:32.030 --> 00:49:32.536
If the--

00:49:32.536 --> 00:49:32.912
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:32.912 --> 00:49:34.984
PROFESSOR: If the stairs
were out of phase?

00:49:34.984 --> 00:49:35.588
I don't know.

00:49:35.588 --> 00:49:37.130
You could probably
imagine setting up

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.570
stairs that would make
it easier and stairs

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:39.653
that would make it harder.

00:49:39.653 --> 00:49:41.112
So yeah, you probably
could come up

00:49:41.112 --> 00:49:43.580
with something that would be
problematic if it had to hop.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.140
Well, maybe could hop
on one foot for a while.

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:45.410
I don't know.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:46.040
It's on a boom.

00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:49.660
But yeah, so I mean, these are--

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.160
I mean, even now, you can look
at these things, and you're--

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.170
I mean, they would be amazing
if someone just achieved this,

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.090
but these were back in the '80s
and '90s that people did this.

00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:01.556
And so I mean, you've
probably seen Big Dog.

00:50:01.556 --> 00:50:05.180
Raibert worked on Big Dog, too,
and it's like 20 years later

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:05.872
than this stuff.

00:50:05.872 --> 00:50:08.080
And it's still state of the
art, that kind of control

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:11.184
and similar control
in a lot of ways.

00:50:11.184 --> 00:50:12.780
We can do some more of these.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:13.280
Oh.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:17.510
Oh, there's one
that's-- let's see.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.460
and the thing is
that not only do

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.950
these guys do
these crazy things,

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:28.655
but their robustness is
really pretty incredible.

00:50:28.655 --> 00:50:30.530
I mean, a lot of these,
like the Honda robots

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:33.950
walk on, carefully, just ground
and everything like that.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.000
Here.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.595
[INAUDIBLE] towing him along.

00:50:38.595 --> 00:50:40.220
It's probably not
the most comfortable.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.470
It looks like it's a
little bit less smooth.

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:47.840
But I mean, it's running along
sidewalks outside of MIT.

00:50:50.912 --> 00:50:53.120
They have-- this other one's
[INAUDIBLE] just running

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.320
by itself on grass
and everything, too.

00:50:57.320 --> 00:51:00.630
Oh, the quadrupeds
are pretty cool, too.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.433
That's a quadruped
running down the hallway.

00:51:03.433 --> 00:51:04.850
And they actually
did a cool paper

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:08.210
called "Four Legs Running
as One," "Four Legs that

00:51:08.210 --> 00:51:09.740
Run as One," something--

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:13.070
"Running With Four Legs as if
it Were One"-- there we go--

00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:14.780
that used the same
kind of control ideas

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:16.190
but actually can
get these quadrupeds

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.910
and actually run based
on the same ideas.

00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:20.535
And you see that thing's moving
pretty fast and pretty robustly

00:51:20.535 --> 00:51:22.570
right down hallway like that.

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:29.870
So it's really pretty amazing
capabilities, even today.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.990
There's one I really wish
I could find for you.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.490
Yeah.

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:40.060
And so interesting thing
that some more recent work,

00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:42.573
they've--

00:51:42.573 --> 00:51:53.760
oh, let's look at
[INAUDIBLE] Yeah.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.410
Check that out.

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:01.180
Isn't that just amazing, right?

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.593
And actuators that these guys
use is hydraulics at the hips

00:52:04.593 --> 00:52:06.010
and then pneumatics
along the leg,

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:08.560
so {?_{?_[FFFT]_?}_?}
with a pneumatic.

00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:11.770
Need that so you can
rocket yourself that far.

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:16.895
But it's just incredible.

00:52:16.895 --> 00:52:17.890
Yeah.

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:23.220
So something that people
are working on more recently

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.160
is this thing
called SLIP walkers.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.970
So you can imagine if you have a
compass gait with springy legs,

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:32.040
right, as it's spring
constant gets very high,

00:52:32.040 --> 00:52:34.553
it starts behaving just
like a compass gait.

00:52:34.553 --> 00:52:36.720
If the spring constant goes
to infinity, it's rigid,

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.610
it's going to be just
like a compass gait.

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:40.270
If you let those strings
get looser and looser,

00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:41.895
it's going to start
being more like one

00:52:41.895 --> 00:52:44.940
of these bouncy bipeds, right,
more like this SLIP behavior.

00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:47.190
And so actually, you can
get stability properties--

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:50.580
I mean, it can be stable
through a relatively broad range

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:54.012
of bounciness so that the
same robot can vault over

00:52:54.012 --> 00:52:55.470
its legs and walking
and then start

00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:56.760
bouncing and start running.

00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:58.485
It actually could
do that transition.

00:52:58.485 --> 00:53:00.360
And that's a cool anything
also that you see.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.510
I should have brought
this up at the beginning

00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:02.968
when we were talking
about biology.

00:53:02.968 --> 00:53:06.690
But those transitions
are interesting,

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.000
because if you look
at the efficiency

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.130
of human locomotion-- so you
can measure O2 consumption,

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.550
and you can see how efficient it
is to walk at different speeds

00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:17.450
and to run at different speeds.

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:20.570
You can look at the
efficiency curve for--

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:28.920
I believe this is speed, and
this is, let's say, efficiency.

00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:30.600
And so you have
something with walking

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.060
and some curve like this.

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:42.360
And then running, you
have some curve like this.

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.150
I mean, quantitatively,
these could be wrong,

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:47.020
but this is a
qualitative feature.

00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.980
So if you look at the
efficiency of a person walking

00:53:49.980 --> 00:53:51.480
and you just put
them on a treadmill

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:53.460
and just tell them, start
walking, speed it up, speed it

00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:54.990
up, and tell them
just to transition

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.620
to running whenever they want,
they'll transition right here.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:53:59.940
That switches.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:01.640
And so you know the
feeling, I'm sure,

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.820
where you're walking
faster and faster

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.390
and suddenly it just feels
more comfortable to just start

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:05.550
jogging.

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:08.800
Apparently, that happens when
the efficiency of that motion

00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:10.800
outweighs that of walking,
because obviously you

00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.720
can walk where it's
uncomfortable to walk and run

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.053
where it's uncomfortable to run.

00:54:14.053 --> 00:54:16.360
But the natural transition
happens at that efficiency,

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:16.860
bifurcation.

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:18.138
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:18.138 --> 00:54:19.287
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:54:19.287 --> 00:54:20.370
Yeah, that should be cost.

00:54:26.267 --> 00:54:27.350
Now it's even more skewed.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.570
There we go.

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:41.030
Thank you.

00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:44.880
Yeah, so [INAUDIBLE]
SLIP walkers, I think.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.090
Hopefully, you can get
some of this in transition,

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:49.280
but I'm not sure exactly
where they are right now.

00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:51.560
I don't know if they
have any videos of those.

00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:54.920
There's some papers about them.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:55:01.950
And I think that's all the stuff
that Russ wanted me to convey.

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:09.660
So we just have some
idea of this culture

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:12.785
of these cool running models
and these springy things

00:55:12.785 --> 00:55:14.660
and these preflexes and
stuff, and in nature,

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:18.740
the fact that springs are
critical to locomotion

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:21.470
of horses and the stability
of the cockroach running

00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:23.040
and everything like that.

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:26.150
So if anyone has
any questions, I'd

00:55:26.150 --> 00:55:27.695
love to answer them
about anything.

00:55:27.695 --> 00:55:29.180
AUDIENCE: When you were
saying how they were--

00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.790
the transitioning using the
spring model between walking

00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:32.557
to running--

00:55:32.557 --> 00:55:33.890
PROFESSOR: Oh, the SLIP walkers?

00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:34.700
AUDIENCE: Hmm?

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:35.867
PROFESSOR: The SLIP walkers?

00:55:35.867 --> 00:55:37.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
the SLIP walkers.

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:40.730
Is it still [INAUDIBLE]
elastic collision,

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:44.630
or do they [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:46.160
PROFESSOR: I think in practice.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:47.825
I think they have
idealized legs.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.270
I think they've done
simulations idealized legs, too.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:55.653
But you can do either
way, I'm pretty sure.

00:55:55.653 --> 00:55:57.320
I haven't looked at
that work as closely

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.403
as I probably should have.

00:55:58.403 --> 00:56:01.430
But yeah, for the walking,
vaulting behavior,

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:03.860
you need either a toe
thing that's going to--

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.860
or you can let your spring
constant go to infinity.

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.470
And then you'll have
a rigid impact, right.

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:12.752
So you can treat
it that way, too.

00:56:12.752 --> 00:56:14.210
But then yeah, if
you loosen it up,

00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.400
then you're not going to have
the intermediate still lossy

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:16.900
behavior.

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:18.890
But yeah, I think
they have done stuff

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.350
with idealized legs and probably
non-idealized ones, too.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:24.110
So anything else?

00:56:28.312 --> 00:56:29.770
AUDIENCE: If you
get it just right,

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:32.510
can you adjust the
spring constant so

00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:37.670
that you'll get the push
off right before landing?

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.450
PROFESSOR: Oh, you
mean toe off, kind of,

00:56:39.450 --> 00:56:41.200
or the toe-off thing
that pushes you

00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.700
forward that
[INAUDIBLE] efficiency?

00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:43.367
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:56:43.367 --> 00:56:44.658
PROFESSOR: I think you should--

00:56:44.658 --> 00:56:46.790
I mean, I'm not sure
about how the tuning would

00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:47.998
relate to the walking things.

00:56:47.998 --> 00:56:50.480
But when you have these
idealized legs with the spring,

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.500
I mean, you can't
be more efficient

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:53.010
than if you're
vaulting over them.

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:54.980
So I don't know if
it connects to the--

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:58.130
I mean, it seems like it could
connect to that toe off launch,

00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:01.310
but I'm not sure if
that is explicit,

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.790
just by having your
leg not be a strike

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:09.440
with the dissipative inelastic
collision is going to help you.

00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.750
But I don't know if you get
the same kind of-- yeah,

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:14.910
it seems like you should, but
I don't know if that exact

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:15.410
point--

00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:17.150
I haven't seen that exact point.

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:19.880
But it could easily be
addressed in other papers.

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.360
Yeah, I should--

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.360
I don't know if I have
the references right now,

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:25.632
but I can make sure that
Russ gives those to your

00:57:25.632 --> 00:57:27.620
or get those to you
myself next lecture

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:28.850
if you want to look up
some of the SLIP walkers,

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:30.740
because that's pretty
new stuff, I think.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.290
Yeah.

WEBVTT

00:00:15.922 --> 00:00:18.380
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So we're going
to dive into human factors.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.838
There are kind of
two halves to it.

00:00:19.838 --> 00:00:21.947
So about halfway through
we'll take a break.

00:00:21.947 --> 00:00:23.530
But let's just do
the first half of it

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.450
now, because I don't want to
run over into Mark's upcoming

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.080
talk at 4:00.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.150
So human factors
is something that's

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.655
kind of near and dear to me.

00:00:33.655 --> 00:00:35.360
I actually really
like this subject.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.750
When I was an undergrad,
I took the course 16.400.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.730
I really strongly recommend it.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.063
We can only cover a
very small amount today.

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:44.480
You know, I have
less than an hour

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.580
to get through all
of this for you.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.860
But I think it's really
an interesting class,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.470
and it's very pertinent
to everything related

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.990
to aircraft and aerodynamics.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.400
And this class 16.400 was
one of my favorite classes.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.518
Still today, I refer back to it.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:02.060
And one of the things
we did was also

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.480
go through different
NTSB reports.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.150
So I gave a link there as well.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.270
And you can read through
accident investigations.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.730
And not all of them are scary.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.980
You know, many of these reports,
nobody actually got injured.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.650
But it's good to just read
through what happened.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.970
What was the decision making?

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.130
What led to the issue?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.010
It's a really
interesting exercise.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.690
And one thing in particular that
we did in that course, 16.400,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.683
was really interesting is that
they have you be on basically

00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:34.475
a flight simulator.

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:36.410
So you're pretending
to be a pilot.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.048
And then there's
all kinds of inputs

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:39.590
coming into you,
which is really what

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.130
you're going to experience in
the cockpit when you're flying.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.463
You know, you've got people
talking to you on the radio.

00:01:44.463 --> 00:01:46.400
You have your passengers
inside the plane.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.800
You have all kinds of inputs
coming up on the screen.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.600
You're looking for
other aircraft.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.160
You're trying to
identify an airport

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.330
that you're coming up on.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.160
There's a lot happening,
a lot of information.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.290
And then we had to basically
talk about if a light went out,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.070
the absence of a light, trying
to expect a pilot to identify

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.912
that is totally unreasonable.

00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:08.120
So it was really interesting.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.510
And taking this course as
an aerospace engineering

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.390
student at MIT
the lesson was you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.360
need to design these
things to be better,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.320
because if you engineered
this system such that somebody

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.800
under that much stress and
looking at those many inputs

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.550
were supposed to notice
a light going out,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.320
that's totally unreasonable.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.070
Now, on the other hand,
talking about a pilot,

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.010
we will talk a little
bit about how many inputs

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.220
are on a person with a
pilot, how a lot of things

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.810
are attributed to pilot error.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.060
The whole purpose of this
course and the whole purpose

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.110
of learning to fly is how you
can minimize the pilot error

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.690
aspect, not the
engineering design aspect.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.480
But certainly, it's good
to experience both sides,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.370
designing the aircraft
and the avionics,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.315
as well as flying the aircraft.

00:02:55.315 --> 00:02:57.690
So one thing I really want to
point out-- it's little bit

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.240
morbid, but I just want
to talk about accidents

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.590
and what causes them.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.220
Well, a very large
number of accidents

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.450
are what's called controlled
flight into terrain.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.090
Does anyone know what controlled
flight into terrain means?

00:03:15.054 --> 00:03:18.512
AUDIENCE: There's no instrument
error or adverse weather,

00:03:18.512 --> 00:03:22.000
but mostly human error
that would be playing

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.687
into [INAUDIBLE] something.

00:03:23.687 --> 00:03:25.270
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Yeah, so what he said

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.740
was that there's no instrument
error and it's pilot error.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.240
So it's not necessarily that
it means that it's pilot error.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.360
But what it's saying is that
there's nothing physically

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
wrong with the aircraft.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.660
So it's not that
the engine broke.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.370
It's not like the case
with Captain Sully

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.110
where birds were
ingested into the engines

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.790
and the engine stopped working.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.020
But it is the case that a
fully functional aircraft

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.830
was flown into terrain, into a
mountain, or into the ground.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.210
So why does that happen?

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.060
So as we just heard,
it's the pilot's fault

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.150
is one of the most
common answers.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.250
They attribute things
to pilot error.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.770
And the NTSB does this a lot.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.290
If you watch the movie
about Captain Sully,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.230
it made it seem like the NTSB
was out to get him as well.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.420
I've heard the reality is
that they were much more

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.130
friendly towards him.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.519
But the situation is that
that's kind of a natural thing

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.440
that they have to explore.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.510
They ultimately found
that he wasn't at fault,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.290
but that becomes a big issue.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.350
So I don't think that it's
always the case, again,

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.710
that it's pilot error.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.620
Please take 16.400
and look into that.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.120
But for the purposes of this
class, for being a pilot,

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.923
you need to be aware
of all the things

00:04:41.923 --> 00:04:43.090
that are under your control.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.088
How do you get a really
good weather briefing?

00:04:45.088 --> 00:04:46.630
How do you make sure
you're prepared,

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.220
so that it is not your fault and
you don't have any accidents?

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.430
So just to get you in the
zone for the types of things

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.850
we're going to discuss today,
here's a practice question.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.820
I just want to see where
people are on this.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.570
I know I haven't taught
it yet, but I just

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.820
want to know what you
think the answer is

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.220
so I know how much time
to spend on these topics

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.453
in the next couple slides.

00:05:08.453 --> 00:05:09.870
I'll give you a
chance to read it.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.650
OK, so how many
people think it's A?

00:05:30.891 --> 00:05:33.090
All right, how many
people think it's B?

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.400
We had movement on B, but nobody
fully raised the arm on B.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.080
All right, C?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.850
Lot of hands raised on C.
All right, how about D?

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:50.600
Now that everybody
raise their hands on C,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.690
almost no one wants
to admit D. All right,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.390
so it is, in fact,
spatial disorientation.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.810
So we're going to talk about the
first half aeromedical factors.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.010
And then we'll take a break.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.160
And then we'll get into the
aeronautical decision-making.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.860
All right, so
aeromedical factors,

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.810
so Philip has already
talked about some

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.700
of the regulations
associated with getting

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.500
your medical certificate and
having an EMT or an aviation

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.830
medical examiner
basically check you out.

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.810
So there are a lot of
physiological factors

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.340
that can affect a pilot.

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:29.640
And some of those you know are
unrelated to that medical exam

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.910
that can happen to any of us.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.780
So we're going to go through
the ones that are listed here.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.000
So hypoxia, it
basically is related

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.360
to not having enough
oxygen, or having a reduced

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.790
amount of oxygen.
And there are a lot

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:47.530
of different types of hypoxia.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.170
And it results in a
lot of disorientation.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.600
A lot of things that you
would be able to do normally,

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.490
you won't be able to do in
those types of conditions.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.020
So impaired judgment, visual
impairment drowsiness,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:05.630
a lot of issues can happen if
you're under that situation.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.771
So let's see if we've
got this video going.

00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:08.438
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:08.438 --> 00:07:10.146
- And as you feel your
symptoms, go ahead

00:07:10.146 --> 00:07:11.432
and list what they are.

00:07:11.432 --> 00:07:13.428
- Six of spades.

00:07:13.428 --> 00:07:14.925
Six of spades.

00:07:14.925 --> 00:07:17.120
No symptoms yet.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.870
TINA SRIVASTAVA: He's
taking off his mask.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.340
So he doesn't have the oxygen.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.316
- Two of hearts.

00:07:24.316 --> 00:07:31.771
- Do you have any
of air [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:36.533
- I think I have tinkling in
my toes, in my toes, in my...

00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:39.723
- What was the last question?

00:07:39.723 --> 00:07:41.711
- What was the last card?

00:07:46.681 --> 00:07:48.440
- Four of spades.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.226
Tingling in the toes right now.

00:07:50.226 --> 00:07:56.595
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:56.595 --> 00:07:58.720
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So if you
heard what he just said,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.260
he's feeling tinkling in his
toes, tingling in his toes.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.962
- Four of spades.

00:08:08.962 --> 00:08:11.249
- What are you symptoms.

00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:12.720
- Four-- Four of spades.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.048
Four of spades.

00:08:16.765 --> 00:08:18.494
- What are your symptoms?

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.020
- What are you
feeling right now, 14?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.030
- Five of spades,
five of spades.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.592
- Good.

00:08:30.592 --> 00:08:32.830
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.100
- What do you feel, Sir?

00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:37.890
- Four of spades.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.125
Four of spades.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:45.310
- What's your symptoms, sir?

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.610
- What are you feeling, 14?

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.450
- Four-- four of
spades, four of spades.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.610
- What's your symptoms, sir?

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.480
- Four of spades, four
of spades right now.

00:08:59.959 --> 00:09:02.941
- Where did you get the
card that you're looking at.

00:09:09.402 --> 00:09:11.390
What card is that?

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.875
- This is four of spades.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:15.863
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:15.863 --> 00:09:17.777
- Four of spades,
four of spades.

00:09:17.777 --> 00:09:18.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.930
TINA SRIVASTAVA: I'll let
you watch the whole thing.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.740
It basically just
gets a lot worse.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.360
But you can see--

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.760
and one of the biggest
problems is also maybe

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.530
not being able to realize
that there is a problem.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.290
So that's what makes it
even more of an issue.

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:37.230
Another issue is carbon
monoxide poisoning.

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:40.740
So this can actually
happen in the aircraft

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.850
that you fly just based on
where the heat comes in.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.660
And you get
headache, drowsiness,

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.710
a lot of issues
there, blurred vision.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.110
The way to detect
that is there's

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:57.090
actually a CO detector, a
carbon monoxide detector,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:58.480
inside the aircraft.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.040
And so when that middle
part becomes very dark,

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.590
then you'll know that
there's an issue.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.250
And so it's good to know
what the symptoms are.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.580
So if you're starting to
experience those symptoms,

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.300
you know what the problem is.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.170
And you can, for
example, open your window

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:19.290
to get some fresh air
into the aircraft.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.950
Some aircraft, even
certain Cirruses

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:26.620
have supplemental oxygen. So
you can use that as an option

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.120
as well.

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.533
There's another video.

00:10:33.533 --> 00:10:35.450
Just for time, I'm not
going to go through it.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.330
But there's a lot of issues
associated with high G-force.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:44.100
And you might have seen some
things with the Top Gun, which

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:46.943
we heard from Laz is a
terrible representation.

00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:48.360
But even on that
one, when they're

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.870
pulling high-G maneuvers, we've
seen loss of consciousness

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.180
and other issues.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.430
Another one that you might
have actually heard of this

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.470
before is hyperventilation.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.260
Some people here on the
ground experience this.

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:06.480
And so you might just be over
anxious, breathing too quickly.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.727
It makes you not be able
to breathe properly.

00:11:08.727 --> 00:11:10.560
You might need to just
sort of take a break,

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.940
breathe into a bag.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.190
Another good reason to
have a co-pilot with you.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.000
So a lot of the issues in terms
of the disorientation that you

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.150
face are somehow related to
how your inner ear works.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.080
So the fluid in your inner
ear is sort of related

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.700
to how you feel motion.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.710
So I won't get into the details.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.220
You don't actually have to
know a ton of detail about it.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.310
But one thing to know in
terms of how you feel motion

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.530
is that you have fluid
moving in your ear canal.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.760
You can't actually
really detect the fluid.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:56.890
What happens is you have these
little hairs that come up.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.320
And so when the fluid
changes direction--

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.690
so let's say that the
fluid starts moving

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:05.640
in a particular direction.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:11.530
Then all these hair
pieces start moving,

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.510
and so you feel that motion.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:19.150
Now, the fluid can continue
to move in that direction.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:25.540
But over time,
the hair follicles

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.630
will basically resume
where they are.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:31.690
They won't feel
motion occurring.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.520
Or they'll basically
be stagnant.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.710
So it could be the case
that the fluid is moving,

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:40.390
and the hair is
sitting like this.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:49.060
Now, all of a sudden, when
the fluid stops moving,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:54.430
the hair tries to just
return to its previous state.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.680
And when that happens,
you might actually

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:01.190
think that you've started
moving in the other direction.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.090
So this is an issue
where, basically,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.780
if you are flying along
and you start turning

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.200
and you're in a
constant rate turn,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.340
you might start feeling
like you're not turning.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.580
And then, when you come out
of that turn-- so you roll out

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.590
and now you're straight
and level again,

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:24.940
you feel like you have just
started turning to the right.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.220
So even though now you're
flying straight and level,

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.820
your ear is telling you that
you've turned to the right.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.180
And so you tried to correct that
by turning back to the left.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.480
So it might be the case that
your airplane's actual motion

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.623
was constant rate turned to the
left and then it flattened out,

00:13:40.623 --> 00:13:42.040
but you don't
realize you're flat.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.330
So you start turning again.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.510
So these are reasons
why you don't

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:48.640
want to rely on your inner ear.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.970
People refer to it as flying
by the seat of your pants--

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:53.800
basically, what
you feel as opposed

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.150
to looking at the instruments.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.740
But actually, the
seat of your pants

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.140
is primarily your inner
ear is what's giving you

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:01.660
all these indications.

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.190
So there's a lot
of things that can

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.145
contribute to disorientation.

00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:06.520
So we already
talked a little bit

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.352
about spatial disorientation.

00:14:08.352 --> 00:14:10.060
Well, there are a lot
of things that-- we

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.520
talked about the
vestibular system, which

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.600
is that inner ear.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.370
But also even visual
cues can cause

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.340
you to have spatial
disorientation, and then

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:23.290
the feeling on your
skin, so, you know,

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:27.950
how much you're pressuring
against the seat, for example.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:31.120
So one thing about
spatial disorientation

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.290
is that when you're flying and
you're looking out the window,

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:38.020
your eyes are a big part
of your orientation.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:39.730
So you're looking
at the horizon,

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.040
and if the horizon is tilted,
you think you're turning.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.930
That's how you determine
what's going on.

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.360
But there are a
lot of false cues

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.780
you can get from
looking outside.

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:53.070
So one thing is that--

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.620
and we spent a little bit of
time talking about IFR flight

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.650
earlier today, where you
can't see outside the airplane

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:01.750
and you're just relying
on your instruments.

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:04.030
Well, it's also good
to do a reference

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.910
check of your instruments
because of some of the tricks

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.500
your eyes can play on you.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:13.720
So, for example, if there
is a low cloud layer that's

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.900
kind of tilted, the
horizon might look tilted

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:17.955
and may not look flat.

00:15:17.955 --> 00:15:20.080
And you might think you're
tilted when you're flat.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.740
Or you might think you're
flat when you're tilted.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.620
There is also other--

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:29.570
because of the motion in your
inner ear when you actually

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:32.420
have a motion in one direction,
if you actually turn over,

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.200
if you bend your head down,
so let's say you're writing

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.120
with a pencil
while you're flying

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.000
and you dropped your pencil,
well, when you bend down,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.550
you actually feel emotions
that don't actually exist.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.760
You might think you're
sort of tumbling.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.520
And so that's really not good.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.020
Actually, if you
fly out of Hanscom,

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.000
you have to wear a badge anyway.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.380
And so you have a lanyard.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:57.500
Maybe you clip your
pencil to that lanyard

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.000
or do whatever you
can such that you

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.670
can reach everything you need
to reach without physically

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.020
bending over.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:06.530
Or if you have a
co-pilot that is also

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:08.750
could be a pilot in
command or safety pilot,

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.090
you can ask them
to take control.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:13.490
And we talked about positive
exchange of controls.

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.440
Ask them to take
control of the aircraft

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.750
before you reach down
to pick up something,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.210
because it can have a more
significant effect than you

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:22.810
think it will.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.640
And I will reserve some of
the aerobatic talk for Mark

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.760
to discuss some of these
with you in more detail.

00:16:33.143 --> 00:16:34.810
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Tina was talking trash

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:35.780
about the autopilot.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.280
But that's also a good
argument for if you

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.140
have to bend down and
get something, take

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.057
your hands off the
controls completely, that's

00:16:43.057 --> 00:16:46.330
better than leaving them on
while you're fishing around

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:47.150
for something.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.660
And if you have an
autopilot, yet better.

00:16:51.863 --> 00:16:54.280
TINA SRIVASTAVA: I think the
autopilot is a very important

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:56.050
tool to use when you're flying.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.030
I was just cautioning
against it--

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:01.900
again, when I was flying on my
check ride with Mark up there,

00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.819
mysteriously, the
autopilot stopped working.

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:07.180
And I had to perform
everything without it.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.700
So you can't rely on that.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.450
When you're flying,
it could stop working.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.470
But also your check ride pilot
will not let you use one.

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:16.210
So this is something
once you're flying,

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:17.710
and you can even
ask your instructor

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.420
to help you with
that, to actually get

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.609
a sense of these
disorientation, you

00:17:21.609 --> 00:17:24.760
can try you know climbing
while accelerating, climbing

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.099
while turning, these
different types of motions,

00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:29.163
and also consider
moving your head,

00:17:29.163 --> 00:17:31.330
making sure the other person
has the flight controls

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.300
to experience some
of these motions.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.190
Or if you like,
over near, I think,

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.250
Building 33 or Building
35, they have a centrifuge,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:43.680
and you can experience a
lot of these things as well.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.410
So how do you deal with
all these disorientation

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.710
that are happening?

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.160
One is just being aware of
the causes of them help,

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.070
making sure you know
that they're there,

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:57.100
getting briefings in advance
so you know what's happening.

00:17:57.100 --> 00:18:00.088
And, really, try to avoid
sudden head movements

00:18:00.088 --> 00:18:00.880
when you're flying.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.420
So we've talked about scanning
and looking for traffic,

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:06.420
but avoid very sudden head
movements while you're flying,

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.710
because you are moving.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.235
And it can cause you to
have a lot of effects.

00:18:10.235 --> 00:18:12.360
And then the other thing
is just being well rested,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.320
eating properly.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:15.240
If you're hungry,
if you're tired,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.280
your body is not at its best.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.260
It can also contribute.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.210
So here are just
some more examples

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.903
of the visual illusions.

00:18:23.903 --> 00:18:25.320
And then there are
also times when

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.850
the visual illusions are worse.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.400
So nighttime, we're going to
have a whole section of night

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:30.420
flying tomorrow.

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.460
But as it relates
to human factors,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:35.490
I will say that you might
think you're coming in

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:37.920
towards the airport,
but you're actually

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.100
seeing a cluster of lights
that's a city somewhere else.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.342
You might start going
to the wrong place.

00:18:43.342 --> 00:18:45.300
If you don't keep
referencing your instruments,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.180
you might not notice that
you're kind of off track.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.580
I'll give you one tip, though.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.020
I was flying to Hyannis.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.370
Hyannis is a city right
at the base of the Cape

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.890
before you go all the way
down the arm of the Cape.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.380
And there's a great
restaurant there right next

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:04.290
to the Hyannis airport, a
little French restaurant.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.870
During the day, they have
kind of little sandwiches

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:07.530
and pastries.

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.630
And at night, it becomes kind
of a nicer French restaurant.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:12.720
So I was actually
flying there at night.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.960
And coming into Hyannis, I was
having a little bit of issue

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.210
because my heading
indicator kept processing

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.865
and I wasn't sure exactly--

00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:21.240
and things happened
very quickly,

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.847
because I'd been talking
about the Bravo clearance,

00:19:23.847 --> 00:19:25.430
because going from
Bedford over there,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.780
you're talking to
all these controllers

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.578
and worrying about
your altitude.

00:19:29.578 --> 00:19:30.870
And so there's a lot happening.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.660
And as I got close to
the Hyannis airport,

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.840
I wasn't exactly sure that I was
going for the-- they have two

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:38.670
different intersecting runways.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.380
I wasn't exactly
sure I was lined up

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:41.790
for the correct runway.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:43.800
So I just talked to
the tower controller.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.090
And I told them that I
was having this issue.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.900
And so they lit up
the runway that I

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.180
was trying to land at very
bright just for a moment

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.037
so I could get oriented
and get myself situated.

00:19:55.037 --> 00:19:55.870
That was very great.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:20:00.120
So good also to use other
people, whether it's the flight

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.030
service folks or the
tower folks to give you

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:04.080
help when you need it.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.092
So this is also just another
thing that happens at night.

00:20:12.092 --> 00:20:14.050
And we'll talk about this
with the night flying

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.970
that sometimes a stationary
light can appear to move.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.220
And so you have to be careful.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.200
Don't trust everything you see.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.240
A big one in terms of
an optical illusion,

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:28.870
whether it's day or night, is
that if a runway is not flat,

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:32.700
but it's actually inclined
going up or inclined going down,

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:35.130
not only as it relates to
performance when we're talking

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.110
about how long it
takes you to land,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.000
but also as you're
coming in, you

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.460
might think that you're a
different place than you are.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.620
This is also the case if the
runway is wider or narrower

00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:47.610
than you're used to.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:50.010
So at Hanscom, you might
have very wide runways.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:53.220
If you fly out of Beverly,
you have narrower runways.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.320
So just that
difference can make you

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.300
think you're at a
different orientation

00:20:57.300 --> 00:20:59.500
or you're higher or
lower than where you are.

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.540
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Tina, can
you go back to that one?

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:03.087
So basically, they're saying
if the runway is sloped

00:21:03.087 --> 00:21:04.920
and you rely on your
ordinary sight picture,

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.443
you might follow a higher or
lower than standard guide path.

00:21:09.443 --> 00:21:10.860
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:14.730
So what it's saying,
the top one is

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:16.440
showing that, you
know, obviously,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.790
that's just when it's flat.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.640
And so when it's
inclined up, you

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.235
might you might try
to be farther away,

00:21:23.235 --> 00:21:24.610
so that you get
the same picture.

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:28.000
So that the dotted aircraft
is where you should be.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.050
But the solid aircraft is
where you might actually be,

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:32.610
where you're trying
to compensate

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:33.615
because of the illusion.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.230
And then, if there's
a featureless terrain,

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.120
it can really
affect you as well.

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.380
So like right now, we
have a snowy condition.

00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.950
So it's harder to
see what's happening.

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:49.620
It makes it difficult.
And in general, it

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:55.080
makes you fly a lower
approach, which is not good.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.138
OK, and then just
a couple more--

00:21:57.138 --> 00:21:58.430
I won't dive into each of them.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:02.510
But fog or haze, different types
of things, can cause a mirage

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:04.040
or can cause an illusion.

00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.370
And so you really want to keep
referencing your instruments

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:10.070
to make sure you are in
fact holding the altitude,

00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:13.870
or use your autopilot
to help you out.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.790
And, of course, any
reference system,

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:18.430
so if you have a
VASI or a PAPI, those

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:21.700
are great tools that even if
it looks like the runways, one

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.520
place or the other, if
the lights are all red,

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.700
you're too low.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.420
OK, another one is
motion sickness.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.620
So one thing I want to tell
you about motion sickness

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.162
is when you go up and you take
your first discovery flight,

00:22:35.162 --> 00:22:37.120
you come out of this
class, you're ready to go,

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.070
you might feel a
little bit motion sick.

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.670
And that's OK.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:40.780
You're in a tiny airplane.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.090
It might be bouncing
around a little bit.

00:22:43.090 --> 00:22:45.430
What I'm here to say
is that that goes away.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.070
You can actually train
your body to get used to it

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.710
and kind of get over
that motion sickness.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:53.890
But, unfortunately, you
can lose that tolerance

00:22:53.890 --> 00:22:55.720
that you built up
if you wait a really

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.100
long time between flights.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.070
I'm at MIT, so I
don't know how much I

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.540
need to tell you about stress.

00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.820
I think we all
know about stress.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.290
We have different ways
of dealing with it.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.320
But just as much as it
affects your ability

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.690
to take an exam at
MIT, that stress

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:17.020
can also affect your ability
to fly and think logically

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.393
as you might need to to do
aeronautical decision making.

00:23:20.393 --> 00:23:22.060
PHILIP GREENSPUN: And
that's a good time

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.685
to think about whether
you should bring

00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:25.300
an instructor along on a trip.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:29.120
You know, if you're tired or
you're upset about something,

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.218
then be part of
a two-pilot crew.

00:23:33.218 --> 00:23:34.260
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Exactly.

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:36.280
Fatigue is a big one.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.060
If you do take my advice and
look at those NTSB reports,

00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.880
a large number of
them are talking

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:46.920
about airline pilots that have
just been flying for 22 hours

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.460
and something happens, whereas
if you really think through it,

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:53.260
you know, maybe that issue
wouldn't have happened,

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.510
but they're so tired that those
things result in an issue.

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.530
So really be mindful of how much
fatigue can affect your ability

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:04.430
to fly and what stresses
it puts on the pilot.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:10.300
Dehydration and heat
stroke are big ones.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:13.780
Here, in this area, it gets
very hot in the summers.

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.460
Make sure to bring
a bottle of water

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.930
with you when you go flying.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.910
It can be a big issue.

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.520
And, you know, if you're
feeling kind of lightheaded,

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.020
take a drink of water.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:26.600
It can make a big difference.

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.420
All right, so no
alcohol or drugs

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.290
while flying or before flying.

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:34.840
There are some
specific regulations.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.860
They're much more
strict than driving,

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.370
which I think is a good thing.

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:42.530
So please take a look at that,
14 CFR Part 91, the blood

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.800
alcohol level and the
time since the last drink.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:46.920
It's really not worth it.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.635
You're flying as
a hobby, for fun,

00:24:48.635 --> 00:24:50.010
don't do something
that's unsafe.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.490
Some of these are
ways to remember,

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.478
the bottle to throttle
examples here.

00:24:58.478 --> 00:25:00.020
So I'll let you take
a look at those.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.477
Also, don't carry drugs.

00:25:04.477 --> 00:25:06.310
I don't know if I need
to elaborate on that.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.800
OK, so we talked about vision.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.290
Vision is one of the things
that in your medical exam,

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.050
you're AME is going
to look at your vision

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.810
and test your ability to see.

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.670
One thing to keep
in mind is that when

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:23.220
you're looking out
your windshield,

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:25.980
you can basically
kind of zone out.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.205
And so you think you're
looking out your windshield

00:25:28.205 --> 00:25:29.580
and you're scanning
for aircraft,

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.500
but you've sort of
stopped paying attention.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.250
So one thing that they
recommend you do is actually

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:38.010
have a series of very
specific eye movements.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.890
I just moved my head.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.265
But, again, don't
move your head.

00:25:40.265 --> 00:25:44.010
But kind of look with
your eyes to scan across,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:47.340
so that you're actually
specifically deciding

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.830
and you're specifically
looking and scanning

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.240
the air for other aircraft.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.830
And tell this to
your passengers.

00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:56.880
You don't have to be a trained
pilot to look for aircraft.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.160
I always tell all
of my passengers.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.270
Look out the window.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.490
Tell me if you see
other aircraft.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.060
OK, so we're going to dive into
aeronautical decision-making.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.180
One quick thing I'll say is that
I brought a couple of magazines

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:14.050
here.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.240
Although some of them are older,
they have some good content.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.440
So this one is about
aviation safety.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:23.350
For folks today that we're
interested in the talk

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.720
about instrument
flight, there's actually

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.860
a magazine called IFR Refresher
and specifically focuses

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.500
on topics related to
instrument flight.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:37.060
And then a number of
these Aviation Safety

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.800
that talk about topics
that I felt were relevant,

00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.940
such as flying with
icing is one of the ones

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.910
here and flying at night.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.670
And then there's a
general IFR magazine

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:51.700
that just talks about some
good articles about how

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:55.570
you handle your skills in
flying instrument approaches,

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:57.670
such as ILS.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:02.650
So these are kind of first
come, first serve over here.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:04.900
So aeronautical
decision-making--

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:08.660
so how you make decisions
when you're in the cockpit

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.910
can really affect how
you successfully exit

00:27:12.910 --> 00:27:16.390
a very negative situations.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.880
So whether it's what we were
just talking about with regard

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.050
to having spatial disorientation
or having carbon monoxide

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:25.760
poisoning versus
an engine failure

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.390
or specific issue
or a weather issue,

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:30.910
the way that you go
about making a decision

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:34.940
can significantly
impact the outcome.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.230
So we're going to talk about
decision-making, hazards,

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:41.950
how we go about evaluating
risks, and having

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:45.210
personal checklists.

00:27:45.210 --> 00:27:48.160
So in aeronautical
decision-making,

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.160
one thing to think
about is just that there

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.890
is a way that you
can teach someone

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.850
how to make good decisions.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:56.940
So in addition to learning
about your airplane

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.610
and learning how to
fly, one thing that

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.530
throughout your pilot
training is that you'll

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.650
learn how to make decisions.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:09.350
So crew resource management
is one specific aspect.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.560
And we've been alluding
to that all day,

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:15.070
talking about how to
use either your co-pilot

00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:17.140
or whoever it is that's
sitting next to you

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.160
in the plane or your
other passengers as well.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.440
There are a number of
aircraft that we talk about,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.810
and we discuss the
FAA regulations

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.970
earlier about
mandated requirements

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:31.030
to have a co-pilot or
sometimes other folks.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:33.640
But there even people
outside your cockpit

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.250
that you could rely on--
air traffic controllers,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.190
we talked about, flight
service stations, for example.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.770
So again really think
about when you're

00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:49.510
flying, although the FAA might
require just a crew of one,

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:51.960
whether you really are
all alone or there are

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.500
other people you can rely on.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.610
So there are a lot of aspects
to making good decisions.

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.510
And this is part of why pilots
love talking to other pilots.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.030
They also just like
discussing if they

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.830
encountered an
issue, how they went

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.600
about dealing with that issue.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.090
And talking to other people
about their experiences

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:14.520
is actually a good way to learn.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.080
One thing you
should also know is

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.450
about your personal attitudes.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.570
I think that might have
been another reason Laz,

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.890
our F-22 pilot yesterday was
so against Top Gun, the concept

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:30.930
of being a very arrogant person
that violates the rules is

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.560
really not a good stereotype
for a pilot because people

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.130
that fly like that are more
likely to have accidents.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.470
How you can modify
your behavior,

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:43.150
how to recognize and
cope with stress,

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.690
we could certainly
use that here at MIT.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.360
And then how to really
assess risks properly,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.640
we talked about
weather as an example.

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.430
How do you know if you have
the right weather information?

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.980
Have you evaluated a
risk appropriately?

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.200
And we've really tried to give
you pointers and cues for that.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.580
Especially if they tell you
VFR flight not advisable,

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:03.540
it's not advisable.

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:07.470
That means it's
probably a bad idea.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.420
So hazards and risks--

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:13.530
so a hazard is
basically a condition

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:17.100
or an event, something
that you might encounter,

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:19.920
whereas risk is
basically your assessment

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.930
of how likely is that risk?

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.380
How likely is that hazard
going to come to be?

00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:28.245
What impact could that
hazard have on your outcome?

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.790
So one thing, again,
is about your attitude.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:36.990
So don't be like
those Top Gun pilots.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.990
If you're very
anti-authority and you say,

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:43.050
you know, I don't care
even if the weather

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.770
folks said VFR flight not
advisable, I'm a great pilot.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.090
I can do it any way.

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:49.800
That type of
attitude is probably

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.900
going to lead you
in unsafe condition.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.960
It's really not a good idea.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.920
We also discussed the
concept of personal minimums

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.330
and setting personal
minimums for yourself.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:05.150
The reason is that today,
for example, or after you've

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.550
done a little bit
of flying, you might

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.070
have a good sense of what
you're comfortable with.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:13.850
You might have gone up with
a lot of gusting winds.

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:15.680
And so you might
decide that, hey, I

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.460
was a little bit uncomfortable
with winds gusting to 20 knots.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.950
Even if my aircraft
is capable of it,

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:24.200
I think that's something
that until I get a little bit

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.010
more experience, I'm going to
set as a personal minimum I

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:30.020
don't want winds
gusting over 15 knots

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:32.690
before I decide to take
a flight by myself.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.580
So you can set your
personal minimums.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.410
Why are we talking about that?

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.220
Well, the reason is on the
actual day that you're flying,

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.890
you may re-evaluate
the situation.

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.230
You might really want
to go flying that day.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.560
Maybe you've already arranged
with a friend to come with you.

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:51.650
Maybe you have a destination
you're really trying to reach.

00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.510
Philip described a
number of situations

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.250
where he's flying cross-country.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:56.220
He has a plan.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.410
He has to follow it.

00:31:57.410 --> 00:32:01.320
And he can't really be
away missing several days

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:02.690
where he was trying to go.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.960
And so sometimes
in the moment you

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.840
might have an impulsive nature.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.000
You might decide that
I think I can do it.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.870
I'm sure it's fine.

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:14.990
So having personal
minimums and actually

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:17.600
writing those down
are a really good way

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.760
to hold yourself
accountable to what

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:27.000
you had decided in a calm state
of mind was a good restriction.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.940
So one thing to keep in mind
is the assessment of risk.

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:33.870
You also shouldn't be
overly risk averse.

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:37.110
The FAA has guidance on
what type of equipment

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:38.760
is required in your aircraft.

00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.710
So certain things
are that's required.

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.990
If it's not there,
you can't fly.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.450
But there are other
things that are optional.

00:32:45.450 --> 00:32:47.970
And so if there's a piece of
equipment that's optional,

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.460
that's not functional.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.760
There's a lot of importance
around understanding

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.070
what is the risk of that
not being operational

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.920
as an example.

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.810
And we'll go through a
checklist in a little bit

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.390
to assess both your
personal state of being,

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:05.490
your aircraft state of
being, the environment,

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.860
and assessing all
those risks together.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.720
But for a given risk, you want
to know, one, how likely is it?

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.750
So maybe if you're
talking about weather,

00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:19.200
there is a chance that
a storm will come in.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.240
There's a chance that it won't.

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.020
Then also the severity, are we
talking about some light rain

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:25.710
showers?

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:29.280
Or are we talking about a
very, very dangerous front

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.672
with icing or thunderstorms?

00:33:31.672 --> 00:33:33.630
So that's the difference
between the likelihood

00:33:33.630 --> 00:33:34.830
and the severity.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:39.090
Both of those have to be
assessed for a given hazard

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:42.370
that you encounter when
you assess its risk.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:45.490
So there's this way
of checking yourself.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:46.990
It's called IMSAFE.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:50.460
So this is just
determining just you--

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:53.460
not the airplane, not the
environment-- as a pilot

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.930
if you're safe to fly.

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.440
So do you have an illness?

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.700
Or are you taking medications
that might affect your ability

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:00.240
to fly?

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.160
Are you very stressed out?

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:04.530
Do you have your
thermodynamics final coming up

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.040
and you're really
nervous about it?

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.080
Again, we talked about there
are also legal regulations.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.679
You can't have alcohol or drugs
that could affect your ability

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.610
to fly.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.290
Are you just very tired?

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.630
Or really, just are you
very distracted by something

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:21.449
that's happening?

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.760
The PAVE checklist
is the one I was

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.980
referring to that
actually considers

00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:27.870
all of these different things.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:30.630
So the IMSAFE is just the pilot.

00:34:30.630 --> 00:34:33.389
A is referring to the aircraft.

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:36.030
So this is when we're talking
about are certain things

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:37.292
different about the aircraft?

00:34:37.292 --> 00:34:39.000
Maybe it's a new
aircraft that you're not

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:40.324
really comfortable with.

00:34:40.324 --> 00:34:41.699
Maybe you're
checked out, but you

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.255
don't have that many hours
in that particular aircraft.

00:34:44.255 --> 00:34:46.380
Or maybe you know we've
talked about the difference

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:48.300
between steam gauge and G1000.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:50.699
Maybe you're really used
to flying steam gauge

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.923
and this is a G1000.

00:34:51.923 --> 00:34:54.090
So there's nothing actually
wrong with the airplane,

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.949
but you may be less comfortable.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.840
Environmental, so
that could be weather.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:59.845
That could be flying
to a new airport.

00:34:59.845 --> 00:35:01.470
That could be flying
to an airport that

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:02.910
has some special conditions.

00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:04.260
Maybe it's a grass strip.

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.670
You're flying to
Katama, which is a grass

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:11.923
runway out at Martha's Vineyard
right next to the beach.

00:35:11.923 --> 00:35:12.840
It's really beautiful.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.710
I recommend it.

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:17.580
But maybe if it's your first
time, flying to a soft field,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.620
that could be a concern.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.955
External pressures, that's what
we were just talking about.

00:35:22.955 --> 00:35:24.330
You're already
committed to being

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:26.120
somewhere later in the day.

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.990
You've met up with somebody.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.950
You're with a friend.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:30.720
You had decided to
take them flying.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.730
They really wanted to go.

00:35:32.730 --> 00:35:35.370
But the weather is
looking a little bit iffy.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.130
So one thing that's good
about this PAVE checklist

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:40.470
is to kind of put
things in perspective.

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.000
That maybe you're feeling
a little bit stressed out

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.900
or distracted about an MIT exam,
but the aircraft is the one

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.530
that you've been flying a lot.

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:51.780
You're very familiar with it.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:53.405
You have a lot of
time on the aircraft.

00:35:53.405 --> 00:35:54.660
Everything is working well.

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.160
You have a good amount of fuel.

00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:57.120
The weather's great.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.290
It's a beautiful day.

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.150
You're flying to
familiar airports.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.298
And you don't have any
external pressures that day.

00:36:02.298 --> 00:36:03.840
There's no one you're
trying to meet.

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.590
There's nothing you're
trying to get done.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:08.250
So that might be a good day
that, OK, one of these things

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:12.090
is a little bit iffy, nothing
crossed your minimums,

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:14.100
but it's just something
that maybe you

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.900
could still go ahead and fly.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.610
However, if it's
multiple things,

00:36:17.610 --> 00:36:19.690
if it's a different aircraft.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.880
It's a different location.

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.140
You're having stresses.

00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:24.120
These start becoming
times that you

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.038
want to take these risks even
more seriously, because as they

00:36:27.038 --> 00:36:28.830
come together, it could
affect your ability

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:31.690
to have a safe flight.

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.230
So just these types
of personal checklists

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.280
are a great way to assess
risk and make decisions

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.200
as you're trying to
decide whether or not

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.243
to go on a flight.

00:36:43.243 --> 00:36:45.410
And these are just a breakdown
of some of the things

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:48.020
I just said on the
environmental condition.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:50.000
So nighttime is also on there.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.980
Tomorrow, we'll talk
about night flying

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.500
in particular and the
fact that basically

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.710
in the US with just your
private pilot's license,

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.970
you can fly at night.

00:36:58.970 --> 00:37:00.710
A lot of other
countries consider

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:05.540
night flying just as advanced
as instrument flying.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.190
And you need your
instrument rating

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:09.560
to fly at night because
of all the concerns

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.560
about not being able to see
much outside your airplane.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.300
So be mindful that,
you know, it's

00:37:14.300 --> 00:37:16.910
a slightly more challenging
condition to fly in.

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:18.797
And how does that
affect your ability

00:37:18.797 --> 00:37:21.005
to assess the other risks
that might be taking place?

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:25.740
I really would
recommend, especially

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:28.230
when you're first
getting certified,

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:31.380
you don't really make plans
anywhere near the time

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.540
that you're supposed
to be done flying.

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.540
Most flight schools will
give you a flight block

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.768
of 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:37:37.768 --> 00:37:39.810
Make sure that you don't
have to be anywhere even

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:41.610
for a few hours after that.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.335
In case the weather got bad,
you had to land somewhere else,

00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:45.960
you don't want those
external pressures

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:48.390
affecting your decision-making
when you're in the cockpit.

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:53.700
This is another way to
think about it in terms

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.970
of this 5 "P" checklist.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:01.638
So there are certain
kind of different parts

00:38:01.638 --> 00:38:02.430
through the flight.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.590
We discussed the
pre-flight, take-off,

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.800
while you're kind of cruising
along, you're descending

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:09.270
and you're flying,
and it might be

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:14.520
good to kind of look through
all of these different aspects

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:17.100
about when you're flying
and kind of checklist

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:19.327
for yourself to understand
what's happening.

00:38:19.327 --> 00:38:20.910
There are a lot of
different resources

00:38:20.910 --> 00:38:23.610
that talk about aeronautical
decision-making.

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:25.560
I think one of
the best resources

00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.920
is really talking to other
pilots about experiences

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:30.960
that they've gone
through and learning

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:33.690
after you go through an
experience reflecting

00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:35.940
afterwards whether it's
through your instructor,

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.880
with your friends.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.920
You know, what happened?

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.990
What could I have
done differently?

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:41.582
Was that the right
decision to make?

00:38:41.582 --> 00:38:43.290
So even these little
things, like Phillip

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:45.600
was talking about
flying with Oxana,

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.520
trying to avoid some weather.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.500
There was rain.

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.990
Thinking about how he evaluated
that risk of that thunderstorm.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:53.490
What could he have
done differently?

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:54.810
Was that the right decision?

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.180
And in general, making
a conservative decision

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.918
is good, because it's
your life at stake

00:38:58.918 --> 00:38:59.960
that we're talking about.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.730
All right, so I think we've
talked a lot about this.

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:09.310
Are there any specific questions
on aeronautical decision-making

00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:10.630
or human factors in general?

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:11.240
Yes.

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:12.684
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned currency.

00:39:12.684 --> 00:39:15.585
Is there like a recommended
frequency, or like rule

00:39:15.585 --> 00:39:18.640
of thumb, like how often
you should be flying

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:20.410
to be maintaining your skills?

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.910
PHILIP GREENSPUN: We're going
to cover that at the very end.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.230
There's a Cirrus that we put
together this big matrix.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.540
They don't tell you how
often to fly to practice.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:30.130
But they tell you
given how recently

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.170
you've been flying
and practicing,

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.580
here's the kind of weather
that should be challenging.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.630
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So the question
for those who couldn't hear

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:39.520
was just about the currency.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.140
So are there rules about
how often you need to fly?

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:46.480
And there are rules,
especially related

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:50.330
to carrying passengers
at night, for example.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.960
There are certain legal
currency requirements.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:56.500
But just as Philip said, there's
also just personal minimums

00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.210
that you might want
to set for yourself.

00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:00.490
If you haven't gone
flying for a month,

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.770
you may be legally
current, but may not

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.140
be a good time to take
a bunch of passengers

00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.170
to a new destination that
you haven't flown to before.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.400
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah, so
you remember from yesterday,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.440
there's that 90 day, three
takeoffs and landings

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.065
within the preceding
90 days before you

00:40:13.065 --> 00:40:14.450
can carry passengers.

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.580
That's a good minimum.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.510
A lot depends on
the type of aircraft

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.110
and how familiar
you are with it.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:24.160
So if you have 500 hours in
a very logically designed

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.310
airplane like the
Cirrus, you know,

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:29.710
then you're going
to be safe probably

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:31.460
without flying too often.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.620
In a more complicated
aircraft, you know,

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.460
that has buttons and
levers just randomly strewn

00:40:36.460 --> 00:40:40.210
across the panel, which seems
to be the industry standard, you

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.010
know, if you haven't
flown it for a month,

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:43.780
you may actually be
a little bit at sea

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.060
as to where are the flaps?

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:47.660
Where is the gear?

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:50.650
So a lot depends on how
many hours of experience

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:52.990
you have in the type of
aircraft you're going to fly

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:56.770
and just how inherently
challenging it is to fly.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:41:00.520
The practical
currency requirements

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.650
for a multi-engine
piston airplane

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:05.500
are going to be very
different from those

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:07.530
that you might use
in the Piper cub.

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.300
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, when
we polled the class earlier,

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.300
I think there were
70 of you have really

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.700
only flown once or not at all.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.740
And so that's a
lot of people that

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:19.670
don't have flying experience.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:22.270
So I would say, you know,
back before I had 200 hours,

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:25.160
or even before I had 100
hours of flying experience,

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.760
I actually set very strict
currency requirements.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.850
I had to fly, you know, two
times a week before I really

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:33.390
felt comfortable
taking up a passenger,

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:36.850
when I wanted to fly relatively
frequently with an instructor

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.890
and practice stall recovery,
these types of things.

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:40.960
And I think that's good.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.242
Make it as much as you need
to in order to be safe.

00:41:44.242 --> 00:41:45.200
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:48.040
You could also decide again, if
you haven't flown for a while,

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.840
are you going to fly
an IFR approach down

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:54.610
to minimums, down at 200 feet
above the runway in the clouds

00:41:54.610 --> 00:41:59.290
by yourself in an airplane with
no autopilot, would be legal?

00:41:59.290 --> 00:42:01.690
Or you're going to say,
look, I'm a little bit rusty,

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:05.980
so I'm going to only fly
on a fairly calm VFR day

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.300
and get back into it?

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.380
So a lot depends on the
challenge of the flight

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.772
that you're considering.

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:15.570
Who else has a question?

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.930
I'll tell you one
more little story.

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:23.550
A friend of mine had a twin
engine airplane, a Cessna 340,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.410
which is a very
complicated airplane with--

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:29.380
I think it has six fuel tanks
and all kinds of levers.

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.700
It's pressurized off
the turbo chargers.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:35.430
Anyway, one engine
caught on fire.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:37.020
So an engine caught on fire.

00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.280
He's got four or five people
from his family in the back.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.640
And he manages to get the fire
out by cutting off the fuel,

00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:46.800
I guess, to the burning engine.

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.140
He's right above Bradley
Field in Connecticut.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.320
So that's one of the largest
airports actually in the world.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.240
It's probably among
the top few percent

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:58.193
of big airports in the world
in terms of physical size.

00:42:58.193 --> 00:42:59.610
They have regular
airline service.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.193
They have a full-time
fire department.

00:43:01.193 --> 00:43:02.430
They have a control tower.

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:04.972
They have a runway that's about
as long as Logan's, you know,

00:43:04.972 --> 00:43:08.760
like close to 1
miles long runway.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.290
So he decides, well,
I've got one engine.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.915
It's nighttime.

00:43:12.915 --> 00:43:14.518
It was night.

00:43:14.518 --> 00:43:15.810
The controllers are right here.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.460
Should I just, you know,
spiral down and land

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.410
on one of these huge
runways at Bradley

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:24.660
and the fire department come
up and meet the airplane?

00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.850
Or-- that's option 1.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:28.860
Let's see what you guys think.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:31.770
Option 2, let me continue
to my home airport

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:34.490
at Fitchburg, which
is unattended.

00:43:34.490 --> 00:43:37.800
I don't think there's a fire
department that's there.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.390
There's no control tower.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.853
The runway is pretty
short, 4,500 feet.

00:43:41.853 --> 00:43:43.770
But on the other hand,
it is the home airport.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:45.030
So it's very familiar.

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:47.610
And he's got one engine left.

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.210
You only need one
engine to descend.

00:43:51.210 --> 00:43:53.194
So what do you
guys think, A or B?

00:43:53.194 --> 00:43:57.702
Land it at Bradley
or go to Pittsburgh?

00:43:57.702 --> 00:43:59.160
OK, what do you
think this guy did?

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.570
AUDIENCE: He went to Fitchburg.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.700
PHILIP GREENSPUN: He
went to Fitchburg.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.030
And he wrecked the airplane.

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.900
You know, he landed.

00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.555
But I don't know-- it's
twins with one engine.

00:44:06.555 --> 00:44:08.430
They always say the
second engine carries you

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:09.638
to the scene of the accident.

00:44:09.638 --> 00:44:12.030
We'll talk about that tomorrow.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.070
So they just are hard--
it's hard to maintain--

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.070
it's hard to keep them
going perfectly straight.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.987
So, of course, he didn't
go perfectly straight

00:44:18.987 --> 00:44:21.540
down the runway, went off
the side of the runway,

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.250
did some damage to the airplane.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:24.690
Nobody was hurt, fortunately.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.690
The punchline of the story
is he doesn't tell this

00:44:27.690 --> 00:44:31.140
as an example of bad
aeronautical decision-making he

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:35.070
tells this as a story
of good decisions

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:37.020
and making good
decisions as a pilot.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.970
And I'm not really sure why.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.680
But anyway, I just
wanted to tell you,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.720
like despite all
those checklists,

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.960
people can have very
different perspectives on what

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.030
constitutes a wise decision.

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:51.240
But personally, I try to
do-- you know, I have an ATP.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.480
But I try to do flights whenever
possible that require only

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.470
a student pilot level of skill.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.000
And that gives me a nice margin.

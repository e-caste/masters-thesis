00:00:03.896 --> 00:00:05.844
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.898 --> 00:00:13.440
GARY GENSLER: We're going to go
through payment systems, what

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.890
is a payment system, in fact,
some trends around the payment

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.920
system, which is a little
bit of a statistical review,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.970
and then critically think
about the pain points, a list

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.850
that I've been keeping
as I teach FinTech

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.340
and also as I think
about cryptocurrencies

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.910
and how they might insert
themselves in this space.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
Some trends around
the globe with nations

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.030
trying to move forward with
real-time gross settlement,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.200
the idea that you could
settle payment transactions

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.710
instantaneously, 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week,

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.650
which many nations don't do yet.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:50.280
Some do.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.910
We'll get into that.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.300
And then the landscape itself.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.980
What are the companies
doing and so forth?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.140
Harkening back to
last discussion,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.790
what are we seeing in the crypto
projects and tokenization?

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.370
And then close out
on Facebook Libra

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.510
and China's Digital Currency
Electronic Payment project.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.590
So a lot to cover.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.820
But please, as I had
said, video's on.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.160
So we can keep this sense
of community and audio off.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.800
But anytime you have a
question, raise the blue hand

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.650
in the participant area.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.130
Engage in the chat room
amongst yourselves,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.590
or Romain would be
good enough just

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.270
to interrupt me when
he sees something

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.250
interesting in the chat.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.695
Or for that matter,
even if you're a student

00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:37.570
and you see something
interesting in the chat

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.610
that Romain's not raising, you
can raise your hand and say,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.430
I see three things
in the chat room,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.290
and I want to capture that
for the class and so forth.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.950
So the readings
today, I thought it

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.310
was interesting to take a
speech by Lael Brainard.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.210
Lael is on the US
Federal Reserve Board.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.620
And as they do in many
commissions and boards

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.040
of central banks
around the globe,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.600
they allocate
different projects.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.040
Now, Lael is part of the
Federal Open Market Committee

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.080
and helps set interest
rates, but she also

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.570
is that key player on the
Reserve Board around payments.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.880
So she gave a speech
about the updating

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.920
and where we stand, and I
hope you found that helpful.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.200
Along with Neha Narula, we did
a cryptocurrency online course

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.270
last summer.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.170
And the payment system
space was something

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.340
we wrote just as a background,
as a primer in this area,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.370
and then some payment
innovations in the FinTech

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.230
space, and a little map
about nine payment track.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.160
So I hope that was helpful.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.480
If you haven't dug into it, I
do think that Lael's speech is

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.430
a good update as to where we
are and particularly as the US

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.160
Federal Reserve is thinking
about things like Facebook's

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.050
Libra, thinking about going
to real-time gross settlement

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.530
in something called FedNow
that won't be rolled out now

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.420
for three or four years.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.240
But I think Lael gives a good
sense of where things are.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.380
So just if we can have a little
bit of conversation here,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.480
and Romain will help facilitate.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.090
But what are the key
challenges and opportunities

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.750
in the current system, just
from your own perspective?

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.330
In essence, what do
you think I will later

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.040
have on that list
of pain points,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.380
if you've not yet
downloaded the slides?

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.586
But Romain.

00:03:42.586 --> 00:03:46.572
ROMAIN: Let's see who will be
the first volunteer for today.

00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:51.322
GARY GENSLER: Just to get
it a little bit interesting.

00:03:51.322 --> 00:03:53.350
ROMAIN: Still waiting
for a blue hand.

00:03:58.718 --> 00:03:59.218
Hassan.

00:03:59.218 --> 00:04:00.510
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE] page.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.820
You might have to get one.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.950
What did you have, Romain?

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.200
ROMAIN: Hassan,
the floor is yours.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.990
Yeah, about the
payment system, I've

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.030
noticed that there is kind of
a monopoly, especially here

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.930
in the Middle East.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.690
All the payments
are, or I would say

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.450
almost all payments are through
Visa, and Mastercard, and AMEX.

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.120
And if you can see
that, these companies

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.670
take a percentage
of the merchants.

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.670
And I don't if you guys
have this in the States,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.500
but sometimes, for instance,
in my country in Bahrain,

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.730
if I would go and buy something,
if I know the owner person,

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.270
he would say, hey, listen,
if you would pay me in cash,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.560
I could give you a discount.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.840
So I think that there are many
opportunities for companies

00:04:50.840 --> 00:05:00.570
that could maybe take less money
and exploit this opportunity.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.090
GARY GENSLER: So this
captured two themes

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.890
that you picked up there,
and there were many others.

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.540
And I see Andrea's hand up.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.630
So we'll have some
other good discussions.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.530
Cost, you're saying that
the current payment rails--

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.750
my word-- that the
current payment rails

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.700
have a significant cost.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.030
And you also mentioned
the concentration.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.860
You said monopoly.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.490
Some might say oligopolies,
but there's a concentration

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.380
usually in the payment systems.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.740
And this comes by
and large not only

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.270
because of the
history of payments

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.420
but also the significant
network effects,

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.500
that if you have one central
payment mechanism, whether it's

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.260
a clearing house in days of
old or, in the last 40 years,

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.250
the credit card companies became
very significant in the payment

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.180
space.

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.910
They had network
effects, scale, bringing

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.810
merchants on the one side, the
store owners on the one side,

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.400
and the consumers on
the other side together.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.930
And the platform economics
create a significant network

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:04.450
effect.

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:06.360
So there's a lot
of concentration.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.275
But Andrea or others?

00:06:08.275 --> 00:06:09.766
ROMAIN: Andrea?

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:10.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.980
So I'm not fully sure
if this is related

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.650
or if you count it
also as payment.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.890
But I think one of the
biggest opportunities

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.860
and also challenges
is still to resolve

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.410
the international
payments, so basically

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.540
how you send the money
across the borders.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.080
There are many startups, like
everyone knows TransferWise

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.820
who are doing a great job.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.800
But when you think
about it, it's still--

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.690
the way their business
model or how it works,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.290
it's still not basically
instant sending of money,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:40.150
and there are a
couple of limitations.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.720
For example, you
also need to do it--

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.840
you also need to
or you're allowed

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.550
to send the money
internationally

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.060
if you have a bank account.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.240
But I, for example, know I
was working in the Middle East

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.470
where, for example,
there is a lot of people,

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:59.280
a lot of international people
coming and working there.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.250
And they are sending
a lot of money

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.040
back to their families home.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.860
And, for example, a lot of them
don't have a banking account.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.715
So they're using services
such as Western Union.

00:07:10.715 --> 00:07:12.090
GARY GENSLER: So let's--

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:13.230
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.813
GARY GENSLER: I think
Andrea was good.

00:07:14.813 --> 00:07:16.770
She raised three
points in there.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.730
I see Ivy's hand,
and then we'll close.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.440
But the three points I heard,
cross-border, sending payments

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.090
from one nation to another.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.340
Now that could be because
it's moving from one currency

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.670
to another, or even if
it's in the same currency,

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:35.410
if you're using US dollars
and sending it cross-border

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:39.230
or using Euro or yen and
sending it cross-border,

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.510
you're jumping between two
different payment systems, two

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.740
different banking systems.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.360
And so cross-border same
currency or cross-border

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:50.970
cross currency, there's
a significant amount

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.160
of cost embedded in that.

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.380
There is time delays that
Andrea mentioned until you

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.380
can have settled money.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.920
Final settled money means
that you can actually use it

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.610
in your commercial daily lives.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.490
And then thirdly, I think
Andrea raised inclusion,

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.680
whether everybody has
access to that system.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.570
So I thank you.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.152
And then Ivy, and
then we'll move on.

00:08:18.152 --> 00:08:18.892
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:08:18.892 --> 00:08:20.350
I actually had some
earlier points.

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.160
But I think just building up
off of that, things like Plaid,

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.460
I think, are quite interesting
because you really need this--

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:34.470
I guess I think about it as the
plumbing of the payment system,

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.440
if you will, because
they really need

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.700
to plug into so many different
types, the payment systems, all

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.530
these different
financial institutions.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:47.270
And just even thinking about
inclusion and consumer--

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:50.120
customer behavior and
consumer credit behavior

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.820
or cross-countries,
it's entirely different.

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.520
Like people in the UK don't,
or in Europe in general,

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.340
I don't think, use credit
cards as much as Americans do.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.820
People in Asia are really
used to using Alipay, WeChat.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.270
QR codes have
become a big thing.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.650
And in Canada, people
pay down their debt

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:14.425
much faster than we do.

00:09:14.425 --> 00:09:15.800
So just trying to
think about how

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:18.950
all these different players,
both on the consumer side

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.030
as well as on the supply
side, if you will,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.320
will fit into the entire
system in the future.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.680
GARY GENSLER: So Ivy's
mentioned a bunch

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.380
of cultural and
geographic differences.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.290
Country by country,
we have differences

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.180
in our payment systems.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.520
We have different cultural
behaviors about paying down

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.410
our debt and so forth.

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:43.520
And you mentioned one company,
Plaid, that helps the plumbing.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.650
And what's interesting is
that the word "plumbing"

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:54.170
in banking or plumbing and
payment is an age old thought.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.510
Actually, when
Alexander Hamilton,

00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:00.590
our nation's first
Secretary of the Treasury,

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.860
helped found one of the
first banks in the nation,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.160
the Bank of New York-- it still
is part of the Bank of New York

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:12.110
Mellon-- this was in the 1780s,
they took as their logo--

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:13.640
logo is a modern word.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.370
But they took as
their symbol something

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:19.160
that looked like
plumbing, literally

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.620
that they thought of
banking as like waterworks

00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:26.810
or a central utility, sending
money around rather than

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:29.090
sending water around.

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:30.340
So I thank you for that.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.570
But yes, Plaid is
part of that plumbing.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.580
And as Andrea said,
TransferWise is

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.490
trying to find a gap
in the cross-border.

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:38.440
They're not alone.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:43.610
There's Remitly and WorldRemit,
and many other companies also.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:45.950
And so this is a long question.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.230
But just anybody want to
say, what lessons can you

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.160
take from Big Tech in
this space, Alipay,

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.670
WeChat Pay, M-Pesa, et
cetera, just Big Tech?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:59.790
And secondly, any lessons
from all the startups.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:03.320
So it's two buckets,
but it's what can you

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.780
take from the competitive
landscape, either Big

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.460
Tech or the disruptors?

00:11:12.564 --> 00:11:13.510
ROMAIN: Anyone?

00:11:17.956 --> 00:11:20.890
GARY GENSLER: I'm sure that
some of you use these companies,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.480
whether you're from Asia, and
you use many of the Big Tech

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.490
ones, or even in
the US if you do,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:32.640
or you're bound to use Venmo,
which is owned by PayPal,

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.940
or something.

00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:37.740
ROMAIN: So we have
Luke and then Yi.

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.040
AUDIENCE: So one of the--

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.957
GARY GENSLER: Which side
are you [INAUDIBLE],,

00:11:40.957 --> 00:11:42.465
Big Tech or disruptors?

00:11:42.465 --> 00:11:43.315
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:11:43.315 --> 00:11:43.940
Say that again.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.732
Say that again now.

00:11:44.732 --> 00:11:49.336
GARY GENSLER: Are you addressing
Big Tech or the disruptors?

00:11:49.336 --> 00:11:51.410
AUDIENCE: So let's
go with Big Tech,

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:53.910
but I guess it's not to
easy when I talk about,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.310
for example, KakaoPay, which
is the payment platform made

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.850
by Kakao Group, which
is the largest--

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.730
the tech company in Korea.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.680
And basically, it's
WhatsApp of Korea.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:12.200
So whether it be KakaoPay, or
WeChat Pay, Alipay, Apple Pay,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.210
the key thing is it's very,
very easy compared to the bank.

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:19.610
Now, the banks are trying to
catch up with the API Open

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.320
Banking system and all that.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.250
But basically, the
UI user interface

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.030
is pretty easy to use.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.750
And if you have a problem, if
you contact customer service,

00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.140
they'll contact you
right away, versus banks

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.140
make you wait 20 minutes,
blah, blah, blah.

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.040
Sad to say it as a banker,
but it is what it is.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.457
GARY GENSLER: So I think that
the key lesson you're saying

00:12:41.457 --> 00:12:44.240
is it's easier, it's
got a user interface

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.720
that's quite convenient.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.350
And while you didn't use the
word, it's also ubiquitous.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:56.800
And so KakaoPay in Korea,
LINE Pay in Japan and Taiwan,

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.990
WeChat Pay, Alipay,
M-Pesa really

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:01.850
leapfrog the banking system.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.730
But there is a very established
banking system in Korea.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.960
And yet still,
KakaoPay leaped over.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.090
Not as much so in the US.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:12.860
I mean, yes, Google
Wallet is there.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.650
Yes, Apple Pay is there,
and they're significant.

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.452
Less so for Facebook actually.

00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:19.160
AUDIENCE: I think
that's because of the--

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.050
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] we're weaker,

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:26.210
in a sense, adoption, Google,
Apple, Facebook in the US,

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:30.595
than we find in Korea or China.

00:13:30.595 --> 00:13:31.970
AUDIENCE: But I
think that's more

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.820
because of-- not
because of overbanking

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.080
or the power of bank.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.200
It's more because of
the telecom services,

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.950
how reachable,
approachable you are

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.870
with the LTE speed or
3G speed you have here

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:47.725
in big land of America.

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:49.790
GARY GENSLER: So
what Luke's raising

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:53.600
is there's also facts on the
ground about how developed

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.780
the technology is, whether
it was already at 3G or 4G

00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:00.660
or how developed the
technology was on the ground.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.810
So it's not just about
how developed the banking

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.050
system is but also technology.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.010
Romain, we had
somebody else that

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.780
might take the disrupter side.

00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:09.480
Thank you, Luke.

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:09.880
ROMAIN: Yes.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:10.672
GARY GENSLER: Good.

00:14:10.672 --> 00:14:11.594
ROMAIN: Yi, go ahead.

00:14:11.594 --> 00:14:12.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.370
I just want to raise a trend,
the loss of the payments

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:16.900
this time.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.960
GARY GENSLER: And then,
Yi, do we have a video?

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.275
Do we have your face?

00:14:21.275 --> 00:14:22.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.370
I'm just very ugly
this morning, but--

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:26.731
GARY GENSLER: Oh, I'm
sure you look fine.

00:14:26.731 --> 00:14:27.356
You look great.

00:14:27.356 --> 00:14:28.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.240
So I just feel like there's
a key trend between the--

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.390
even including the Big Tech
payment firms as well as like

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:41.530
the FinTech firm
is social media.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.620
People want to pay
via the social media.

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.220
This happened between
the Alipay, WeChat Pay,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.990
the KakaoPay, and
also the Venmo.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:51.470
You can connect with friends.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.800
You can send stickers.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.320
You can send--
express your emotions.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.230
You can make your
transactions available

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.820
to your social network.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:04.700
And I think there's also
similar to M-Pesa in Kenya.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.460
So I feel like this
is a huge trend

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:11.030
that people don't
want to only make

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:14.050
the transaction
with banks, which is

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:16.880
very separate and individual.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.110
They want to make transactions
with their social network.

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:22.030
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.960
I think that's right.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.860
I think that's probably a
larger factor with regard

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:29.650
to the Big Tech companies,
but it is also true

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:34.390
that it's a factor
with the startups.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:38.800
And then lastly, a
question is, do you

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.740
think stable value
coins, tokenized assets,

00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.030
even the initiative of Libra--

00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:49.360
what will that do on
this payment space?

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.835
In essence, are they
hype or a passing fad,

00:15:51.835 --> 00:15:53.460
or are they going to
do something here?

00:15:58.410 --> 00:15:58.910
Romain?

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.270
ROMAIN: Any opinions on this?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.750
I'm still waiting.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.590
GARY GENSLER: We're
going to help out.

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.590
We're going to help out.

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:08.280
We have a poll.

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:12.750
This is exactly when we can
ask a poll to tease this out.

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:16.160
You've done terrific, but no one
answer, because now, Romain's

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.190
going to pull up a poll.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:21.430
And this is more broadly-- this
is about blockchain technology,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.430
but curious what
everyone thinks here.

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.243
ROMAIN: So you
should now see a poll

00:16:27.243 --> 00:16:29.160
with three different
questions on your screen.

00:16:32.088 --> 00:16:34.610
GARY GENSLER: This is a
little bit more broadly as

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.160
to whether financial
firms will incorporate

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.730
blockchain technology into
their business models.

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:44.780
As they've already incorporated
AI and machine learning,

00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:47.810
as they've been
incorporating open API,

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.380
will this be a fundamental
feature in the next 2,

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:53.480
5, or 10 years, or not at all?

00:16:57.304 --> 00:17:00.220
ROMAIN: 20% of the
class voted so far.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.810
Please check the
window and vote.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.319
GARY GENSLER: Romain,
I like your ability

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.609
to pull in the votes.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:16.500
You might have a job
to do come November

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.780
in our next general
election here.

00:17:23.091 --> 00:17:26.160
ROMAIN: Are you confident
it's going to take place?

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.030
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:30.210
I am confident under our
constitutional system

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:31.815
that we will have an election.

00:17:31.815 --> 00:17:34.010
ROMAIN: Excellent.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.530
OK.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.170
We have 70% of the
class that has voted.

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:39.810
I'm going to let
5 more seconds--

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:41.520
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] 10 seconds.

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.460
ROMAIN: Yeah.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.680
And we reached 80%.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.205
Thank you, everyone, for
sharing your thoughts.

00:17:52.205 --> 00:17:53.580
I'm sharing the
results with you.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.790
You should now be
able to see them.

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:59.120
GARY GENSLER: So let's
see, that the class tends

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.150
to be optimistic that blockchain
technology will be incorporated

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:07.310
in, even though it might
take 5 to 10 years.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:15.250
It looks like the mode is
5 years or 5 or 10 years.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:20.810
In terms of, what
will it have will be--

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.560
beyond speculative digital
store valuable Bitcoin

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.716
become the currency of choice
in some part of the economy,

00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:33.140
that generally 60-some% say no.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.270
And then, who is
Satoshi Nakamoto?

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.440
Well, that was just
my one little question

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.860
because, of course, we don't
know who Satoshi Nakamoto is,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.900
this woman or man who wrote
the eight-page white paper

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.890
and put it out on the
internet 12 years ago.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:51.530
But it looks like
a third of you said

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.900
maybe it was a
foreign state actor,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.210
or 20% said US intelligence.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:00.050
OK.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:05.090
So let's get back to payments,
I like this thought there.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:08.000
If you want to take that
window, you have to, I think,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.410
get rid of the
poll individually,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:12.130
which I'm about to do now--

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.690
ROMAIN: Yes, thank you.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:16.530
GARY GENSLER: --as well.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:20.040
So what is a payment system?

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:23.450
Let's just dive in and
talk about what it is.

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.760
And it's been around a century.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.830
So it's not a new thing.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:32.760
But in a digital world,
in a ledger-based world,

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.170
it's a method to
change a ledger.

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:38.670
Now, this isn't an
accounting class.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:40.420
I'm not going to bore
you with accounting.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.480
But basically, if I'm
moving money to you,

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.910
somebody has to lower my
account, credit my account.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.680
Remember assets or debits.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.970
So credit means it's
going down, a little bit

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:55.680
of accounting here.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:59.040
And then somebody else's
account has to be debited.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.350
So one debit, one credit.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:04.590
One account goes down,
one account goes up.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.630
It's also about authorizing
those movements and then

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.270
what's called clearing
and final settlement.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.050
And earlier we discussed that--

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.960
and sometimes final
settlement doesn't

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.080
happen for a couple of days.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.660
And a long time ago, if
you wrote a physical check,

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:23.610
you might not have
it settled, meaning

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:29.310
having money in your account
for five days or longer even.

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:32.270
Now it's closer to two days.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.000
But it's basically amending
and recording those ledgers.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.920
That's what it is in
an accounting system.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.780
And so how did we do this?

00:20:40.780 --> 00:20:43.550
This is just some
fun background,

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.230
but Thomas Jefferson, the
writer of the Declaration

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:49.680
of Independence, actually
you can find online a check

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.890
he wrote to himself.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.370
I'm not quite sure why he did.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:56.420
This would have been the
year after he was president,

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.230
but he wrote a check to himself.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:02.020
So physical personal checks
have been around a long time,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.540
but they are basically
an instruction

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:06.930
called negotiable
orders of withdrawal,

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:10.180
but an instruction to a
bank to amend the ledger.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.590
Lower my ledger, and
give me maybe paper cash,

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.320
or lower my ledger,
raise somebody else's.

00:21:18.925 --> 00:21:20.800
All of the sudden, the
telegraph comes along.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.710
And a company, Western
Union, which still exists--

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:28.210
Western Union comes along,
and it's a telegram company.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.260
But they figure out how to
send money by telegraph,

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:34.450
the FinTech of its time.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.970
And yes, there were
machines that looked

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.710
like this, telex machines.

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.000
These were ubiquitous across
financial firms in the 1950s

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.590
to the 1970s.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:47.830
I will admit I saw one or two of
these when I was on Wall Street

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.020
still in the 1980s.

00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:53.710
But a telex machine
existed basically

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:59.212
to send instructions on
payments around to another bank.

00:21:59.212 --> 00:22:01.680
But what's it look like today?

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.170
Well, first, the
important thing is

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:08.010
central banks sit in the
middle of payment systems.

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:12.180
This was not as true
in terms of the--

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.900
I'm just trying to move
a window out of the way.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:21.270
This was not as true in the
physical coin and currency

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.170
world.

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.830
But here, this little chart puts
the central bank at the top.

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.370
And we have central banks around
the globe, 180 different Fiat

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.780
currencies.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:35.730
The central banks are
central to commercial banks.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:41.490
And what's important to
remember is our money system

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:47.670
has moved on from being
paper money to basically

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:49.050
digital money.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:51.360
And so today in the
US, if you think

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.450
about the total
stock of currency,

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.690
the total stock
of paper currency

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:02.100
prior to this coronavirus
crisis was about $1.8 trillion.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.610
It's actually gone
up in the last month.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:08.310
It seems that there are people
that want to take cash out

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:13.300
of the bank, out of the
ATM as a store of value

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.200
around the globe.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.640
We're not using it.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.440
It's a disease vector, but
it seems that the growth--

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.460
and it might be
now $1.9 trillion.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:27.070
So it's gone up $100
billion or approximately.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.850
But the digital money, all the
people's bank accounts, bank

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.990
deposits, money market funds
is multiples of that, $15

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.300
or so trillion.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.350
So about 90% of the
money in the US,

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.680
depending upon your definition
of money, is digital.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.950
And most of that digital money
is commercial bank money.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:49.870
You and I, when we
go into Starbucks,

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:55.270
we're basically spending Bank
America dollars, or Citibank

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:58.660
dollars, or Wells Fargo
dollars, or SunTrust dollars,

00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:00.580
or Community Bank dollar.

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:03.740
That's what we're spending
when we walk into Starbucks.

00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.010
It might have some implicit
or explicit guarantee

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.440
of a government here in the US,
deposit insurance and the like.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.140
But we're in essence saying
to Bank of America, please

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.110
change my ledger
balance and move

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.570
something to somebody
else's ledger balance,

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:24.460
maybe a Community Bank
for that local Starbucks.

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:27.550
So in between has to be
some electronic means,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.210
some payments system, a
deferred net settlement system.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:34.390
And this chart lists
the number of them.

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:40.830
These payment systems are
the domain of central banks.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.200
Some central banks
actually run them,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.640
like the US Federal Reserve runs
something called the Fedwire.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:55.180
But some are run by a consortium
of the commercial banks.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:57.090
Some are private.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.920
And in some countries, they
can even be for-profit.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.040
But all of them
have some regulation

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.160
from the central bank.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.150
So either the central bank
owns them or the central bank

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:08.900
oversees them.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.540
And usually then
the commercial banks

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:14.650
might run these
single purpose payment

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:16.210
systems around the globe.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.100
Some countries have
multiple systems.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.340
The US, we have the
Fed system, and we also

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:24.410
have something called the
automated clearing house.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.820
The clearing house was
founded in the 1850s

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.450
to give you a sense of its
history, a long history.

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.668
Questions, Romain, any?

00:25:34.668 --> 00:25:35.970
ROMAIN: None so far, Gary.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:36.310
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.030
So you'll see how
this fits together.

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:44.300
But let me say what the modern
payment system looks like when

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:49.250
I think of it in terms
of you go into Starbucks,

00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:52.280
and you want to make a payment.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.700
You're the consumer.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:54.920
We're going to go across.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.240
You have an issuing bank.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.710
Let's use Bank of
America just to say.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.340
And you're giving that
bank, Bank of America,

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.150
a payment instruction.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:06.700
Now, in an earlier day, you
could write a physical check,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.430
like Thomas Jefferson's check.

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:13.780
You could use a credit card, a
debit card, some prepaid card.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.020
But you have to give
some payment instruction.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.285
Even that QR code
that you pass--

00:26:19.285 --> 00:26:23.860
and we'll get to Alipay and
WeChat Pay in a moment--

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.290
there is a payment
instruction somewhere,

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.710
digital payment instruction.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.840
And then at the heart in
the middle is a network.

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.290
Now, these payment
service providers, PSPs,

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:38.890
in the middle or networks could
be associated with a credit

00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:42.370
card company, the Visa
credit card network

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.865
founded in the late
1950s by Bank of America,

00:26:45.865 --> 00:26:47.800
a California bank at the time.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.700
And it became ubiquitous
by the late 1960s.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.920
Visa, Mastercard,
UnionPay in China

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.310
can both be credit
cards and networks,

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.610
or there could be a network
that services the credit cards.

00:27:03.610 --> 00:27:07.250
But you need something
in the middle

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.890
because on the other side,
there's tens of thousands

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:14.900
of merchants or millions of
merchants if you go to China.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.130
And on their side,
they have another bank.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:22.870
But they need some way to access
this network, a point of sale--

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:24.850
POS is point of sale--

00:27:24.850 --> 00:27:28.570
or by phone or by some
modern mechanism to access

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:30.350
that network.

00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:34.430
And then the merchant
on the other side.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:38.830
So you have consumer
all the way to merchant.

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.740
You have banks,
the issuing bank.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:44.880
The issuing bank is that
party that says, all right,

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:48.250
I'm going to take a
payment instruction.

00:27:48.250 --> 00:27:50.650
And you have the merchant
bank on the other side

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:53.310
or acquire a bank,
sometimes it's called.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:56.860
But in the middle,
there's some network.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.830
And it leads to a
lot of concentration

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.710
because there's such
significant economic and network

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:07.850
effects in a modern
digital payment system.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:08.350
Questions.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:08.800
ROMAIN: Yes.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.633
We have questions from
Carlos and then Jose.

00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:12.540
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:13.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.100
So I wanted to ask, I know in
a lot of developing markets

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.010
now making the-- since
you mentioned the ACH,

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:22.620
making it real-time
is a big focus

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.780
and using different
technologies, right?

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:29.160
So could you explain, I guess,
the magnitude of difference

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:33.120
that having a real-time ACH
system versus not makes?

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.900
GARY GENSLER: We're going to
dive into this in about a half

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.240
an hour, but let me try
it very quickly, Carlos.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.577
And then remind me
as we get back to it.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.000
As a merchant, there's
a value to getting

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.830
final settlement when
you sell your coffee

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.520
or sell your produce or
a big machine, whatever

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.660
you're selling.

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.320
And there's the value
because there's certainty,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.790
and there's also timing.

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:07.640
So if you can get your cash on
Monday rather than Wednesday,

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.140
there's a value to it.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.830
Payment systems around
the globe historically

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:16.670
could give you final settlement
if you used physical cash.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:20.720
And physical cash under the
laws of the developed world

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:24.980
became final settlement
from the earliest days.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.740
There's a famous lawsuit
from the Crawford case,

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.770
if you ever want to look it up,
about final settlement using

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.670
physical cash.

00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:36.800
It's from the days of
King George II, I think.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.690
But digitally, it was harder
to get final settlement,

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.830
and we still have delays.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.760
So what's happened
in the last 25

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:49.100
years is many nations
have said, can we

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.790
get to real-time
settlement rather

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.760
than delayed settlement
of one day, two days,

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.830
or, in the old days, five days?

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:00.110
And trying to get to
that real-time settlement

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:01.130
has been a challenge.

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:03.660
And we'll go through different
countries in about a half

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.160
an hour.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.450
Let me hold that.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:07.940
But a lot of countries,
central banks around the globe

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.130
are trying to get to
real-time settlement.

00:30:10.130 --> 00:30:14.810
But the value is to the merchant
that they have finality,

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:18.120
that they can then use
those funds in some way.

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:21.210
And I can tell you, even when I
was the chief financial officer

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:24.530
of the Hillary Clinton
campaign in 2016,

00:30:24.530 --> 00:30:25.490
we had to deal with it.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:28.760
We were the merchant
on the right-hand side.

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.680
We might get a donation.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.690
But until that donation
actually settled,

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.840
sometimes several days later,
sometimes a day later--

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.120
it was different
settlement cycles--

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.490
but until that settled,
we couldn't actually

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:46.630
use it to buy advertisements
on, let's say,

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.850
Facebook or Google Ads.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.790
So we needed-- even
in that instance,

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:54.580
particularly when you get down
to the last six or 10 days

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.150
before election time,
those days matter.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.580
So I lived this as a--

00:31:00.580 --> 00:31:02.296
other questions?

00:31:02.296 --> 00:31:04.895
ROMAIN: Yes, Jose?

00:31:04.895 --> 00:31:05.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:08.400
So I'm not sure if this is a bit
out of the scope of the class,

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.560
but I've always been
very curious on,

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.540
why are checks so
prevalent in the US?

00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:17.805
So, for example, in Spain, I've
never used a check in my life.

00:31:17.805 --> 00:31:19.680
And I think it
doesn't seem to be

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:21.180
a very efficient
way of transferring

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.360
money versus, for
example, a wire transfer.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:25.830
But in the US, it seems like
banks sometimes charge more

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:29.515
for wire transfers, and
they require more security,

00:31:29.515 --> 00:31:31.890
passwords and things for a
wire transfer than for checks.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:32.220
GARY GENSLER: So it's--

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:33.420
AUDIENCE: And I don't
really understand why.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.060
GARY GENSLER: --very much part--
it's part of the pain points,

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:40.770
and each country has a little
bit different heritage.

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:43.710
Of course, through the
1960s, physical checks

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:48.240
were very a important dominant
part of many payment systems.

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.260
It was only in the 1990s
that the US government

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.910
said by an Act of Congress
that the US government should

00:31:56.910 --> 00:32:02.400
move to electronic
payment of social security

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.190
and other important parts
that government pays money.

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.550
But even then, the
adoption was supposed

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:12.390
to be by the late 1990s, and
there was various exemptions

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:14.280
and so forth installed.

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.080
And so we even see
now, in the middle

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.430
of the corona crisis, that you
can read in today's newspapers

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:23.400
that the $1,200
that's moving out

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.980
of our tax authority, the IRS,
to individuals, while the bulk

00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.270
of that's electronic--

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.070
80 or 90 million
of those will be

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:34.050
electronic-- it's estimated
that there's still

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:39.150
millions of people that will
get physical checks in the US.

00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:42.240
So we still have this
legacy that's probably

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.500
a little bit more dominant.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:44.890
I'm going to show
some statistics

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:48.330
on check uses in a moment.

00:32:48.330 --> 00:32:49.770
Some of it's cultural.

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:52.320
Some of it's
actually commercial.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.890
At the middle of
all this are banks.

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:58.890
And in the middle is these
networks in the middle.

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:01.260
So it's not only
cultural, but it's

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.790
also sometimes hard
for a merchant to say,

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.290
I want to pay--

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:11.440
the merchant, remember,
has to pay the 2 and 1/2%

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.430
cost if you're going
to be accepting Visa.

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:19.110
So the cost of interchange
fees, the cost the credit card

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:24.504
companies are taking here in the
US average around 2 and 3/4%,

00:33:24.504 --> 00:33:26.580
2.75%.

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:28.710
So a lot of merchants
still would prefer

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:32.500
to take a check than that 2.75.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.770
You go over to China,
and you say, well,

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:37.290
within the Alipay,
WeChat Pay systems,

00:33:37.290 --> 00:33:40.540
the costs are
significantly lower.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:45.150
In fact, if you're all within
service, within system,

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.950
it's 0%.

00:33:46.950 --> 00:33:49.690
In India, I think it's
around 10 basis points.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:52.800
So there's a lot of
reasons a merchant might

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.380
say, all right, I might
prefer if you can give me

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:57.850
an ACH or a check.

00:33:57.850 --> 00:34:00.630
So gives you a
little background.

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.300
But layered on
top of this system

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:06.480
is all these digital
wallets, an invention really

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.920
just of the last 20 years.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:15.130
And whether it's here in the
US or overseas, a lot of these

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.770
are related to Big
Tech, not only,

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.719
but a lot are
related to Big Tech.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:24.550
And then the question is, will
cryptocurrency play some role?

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:31.179
Can crypto skip some of these
inefficiencies and play a role?

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:34.840
And so with that, some of the
trends, just a quick look.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.630
And this goes to the--
this is from a report.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.929
Worldpay, which is a
big payment company,

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.690
puts out an annual
report each year.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.570
And this is their most
recent report that

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:49.960
came out in February of 2020.

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.330
But around the
globe, mobile wallets

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:56.622
are estimated to already be
42% of global e-commerce.

00:34:56.622 --> 00:34:57.580
Now, this is important.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:59.080
This is e-commerce.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.450
If you go off to the
big wholesale payments

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.220
or large value payments,
different story.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.410
But this is electronic payments
in the e-commerce space

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:10.960
and then point of sale payments.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:15.370
Cash is still a pretty big
piece of the worldwide global

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:19.240
environment for point of
sale, whereas e-commerce,

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:23.170
basically online using your
mobile phone or your laptop--

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.330
can't really use cash much--

00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.560
cash on delivery is still 4 and
1/2%, though, interestingly.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.440
That's Worldpay's
overall view, but they

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:36.510
say credit card will
decline, debit cards

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.980
decline, bank
transfers about even.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.570
And so what's increasing?

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:44.070
Digital mobile wallets.

00:35:44.070 --> 00:35:47.340
And then, of course, at point
of sale, cash declining.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.450
And there you will see
increases in their estimation.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.650
But the US is a
little different.

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.210
The US or North America,
which is the best statistics

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.060
I can grab off the
Worldpay, we still

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.670
have a significant
amount of credit card.

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:03.690
Look at that.

00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:06.030
Credit card's still a third.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:09.040
Digital mobile wallet's 23%.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.690
And from a merchant's
point of view,

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:13.560
they would prefer actually
to have something that

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.170
takes the less bite out of it.

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:19.410
Here in the US,
debit cards by an Act

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:23.980
of Congress after
the 2008 crisis--

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:25.960
Carl Levin, a Senator
from Illinois,

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.010
said, we should make sure
that debit cards do not--

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:35.230
and banks issuing debit cards
can't charge more than the cost

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.090
of actually issuing
that debit card.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.070
And after a series
of rule makings

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.340
by the central bank, the Federal
Reserve, that settled out.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.680
But debit cards are
a little less costly

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:49.450
than credit cards for the banks.

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.780
And in terms of trends just
in the US specifically,

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:56.530
this is from the Federal Reserve
in December of this past year.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:01.550
But this just gives you
a sense, 20 year history.

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:03.610
And this is overall
payment trends.

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:05.090
This is not just e-commerce.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.160
Checks were 45% 20 years ago.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.730
And you can see that line just
decline, decline, decline.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:13.250
So to Jose's point, we're
not quite there yet.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:17.330
Spain might be down to 5%
on checks or something,

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.740
but you can see where we are.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.690
And this is the number
of payment instructions.

00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:25.770
This is dollar amounts.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.150
So in terms of dollars,
checks only went--

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:36.640
lost this parade
eight years ago.

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.280
So one is volume of payments.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.610
One is the actual
checks and so forth.

00:37:41.610 --> 00:37:44.490
And large value payments
are included here.

00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:47.010
The other charts did not.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:50.580
And just one last thing in terms
of the e-commerce side of it

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.860
and card payments,
this just gives you

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:57.120
a sense of remote
and in-person, that I

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.580
like this right-hand chart.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.160
But the trillions
of dollars we move,

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.520
we are moving on
our physical cards

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:09.030
more remote than
we are in person.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.030
This gives an
opportunity to startups.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:17.180
Startups can say, wait, Visa,
Mastercard in many countries

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.055
has this 2 and 3/4%.

00:38:20.055 --> 00:38:22.740
Maybe we can get
inside that pricing.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:25.020
Maybe we can get
inside especially

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:28.290
as we move from in-person
to remote payments

00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:31.480
as an opportunity.

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.233
So that brings us to
a list of pain points.

00:38:35.233 --> 00:38:35.900
What point are--

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:36.250
ROMAIN: Gary?

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:37.667
GARY GENSLER:
--these pain points?

00:38:37.667 --> 00:38:38.421
ROMAIN: Perhaps--

00:38:38.421 --> 00:38:39.630
GARY GENSLER: Please, Romain.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:41.070
ROMAIN: Actually,
before we move there,

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.210
I think Hassan had a question.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.470
GARY GENSLER: Please, Hassan.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.472
Hassan, you might need
to take your mute off.

00:38:51.472 --> 00:38:54.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.810
About payments,
so, for instance,

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:01.750
you could see we have the
bank transfers and e-wallets.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.200
So my question is,
for instance, I

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.860
was trying to pay my landlord
while I was in Bahrain,

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:12.250
because I still have my
apartment in Cambridge.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:16.390
And if the amount
exceeds a certain number,

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:21.050
they have to send me a
message, which can be annoying

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:24.740
because if my mobile
isn't working,

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.870
they would not send me an email.

00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:31.400
So is it like the
system, the whole system,

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.660
the whole payment system
supports bank transfers

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:39.050
when it comes to big
payments and small transfers

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:44.656
when it comes to e-wallets
and mobile payments?

00:39:44.656 --> 00:39:48.600
GARY GENSLER: Well, I'm
not sure of your question.

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:54.240
It is true that ultimately
sitting in the midst of this,

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:57.000
with the risk of going
back a bunch of slides,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.370
there has to be something--

00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.140
well, I'll just stay here.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:06.480
There has to be an instruction
that moves it from an issuing

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.170
bank to an acquiring bank.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.430
So your landlord would
be the merchant here.

00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:16.080
Your landlord's bank has to
get an instruction somehow.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:19.375
So even if it's in this orange
box, the digital wallets

00:40:19.375 --> 00:40:24.440
at the top, you have to send
an instruction somewhere

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:29.090
that takes funds from your
bank, which is called an issuing

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:35.060
bank, and somehow moves those
funds to the landlord's bank.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:41.030
And what you're finding
is that your merchant

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.900
bank, the acquiring bank
on behalf of your landlord,

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.540
is saying, listen, if it's
greater than a certain dollar

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.500
amount, we need a
second security check.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:58.170
And the mobile wallet companies
basically inserted that check,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:00.305
I think is what
you're telling me.

00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:01.930
You could have that
same similar thing.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.120
Venmo has a limit.

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.330
I don't think you could move $1
million on Venmo, for instance.

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:11.640
Venmo is a PayPal subsidiary,
and Venmo is actually--

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.620
avoids those credit card fees.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.530
Venmo is a form of
account to account

00:41:16.530 --> 00:41:19.800
transfer, your
account at your bank

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.150
to somebody else's account.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.170
And account to account transfers
are a very important feature

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:26.730
of the competition.

00:41:26.730 --> 00:41:28.980
But still, Venmo is not
going to move $1 million

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.070
without having additional
security checks.

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:37.655
So that's probably what's
happening here, I fear to say.

00:41:37.655 --> 00:41:38.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:43.620
I, mean my point is it's a
bit annoying because I would--

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.580
for instance, because my
mobile is a prepaid mobile.

00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.310
So I could not receive
a message from my bank.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:54.360
GARY GENSLER: Oh, well, I
can't solve that for you here,

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:57.030
but I think that's part
of what you're saying.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:42:02.850
That's part of these pain
points is that fraud.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:07.260
Basically, when you think
of all the pain points,

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:14.250
you and I, as users, we want
something that's easy to use,

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:15.540
nearly costless.

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:17.250
We're willing to
spend something,

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.670
but we'd prefer not to spend
2% to 3% of our purchases

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.650
on the payment system.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.310
And we want it not
to have complexity,

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:30.210
the cross-border payments
that we talked about earlier.

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:32.880
We kind of know that
they're tracking us,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.130
they're getting our data,
but we're a little concerned

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:36.940
about data privacy.

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:41.370
And so you're capturing one of
the pain points around fraud.

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:43.510
And that's from
the merchant side.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.150
The merchant doesn't
want the fraud,

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.500
but also you don't want it.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.460
You don't want somebody to be
able to tap into your account

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.110
and move your money out.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.080
And the pain point sounds
like the fraud detection

00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:59.070
system that your bank is using
is requiring your mobile phone

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:02.220
in a way that's friction.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.650
It's frankly friction.

00:43:04.650 --> 00:43:06.570
It's similar to a pain point--

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.810
it used to be until
very recently,

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:15.780
if you traveled overseas, you
were better to tell your bank

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.620
that you were going to be using
your credit card in Spain,

00:43:19.620 --> 00:43:23.790
or France, or Asia, or Bahrain.

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:27.890
But now no longer
because now they have--

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:30.270
they use our mobile
phones to say--

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:31.500
they track us.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:35.340
They know that we're in Spain,
or France, or Asia, or Bahrain.

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:39.400
That's part of the reason we
don't need to call any longer,

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.720
but that's part of their
fraud detection programs.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.710
Let me keep moving on if I can.

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:48.630
So there's a series
of pain points.

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:51.990
And I don't necessarily have all
of them, but these are also--

00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:55.270
you can think of them
as opportunities.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:58.350
These are opportunities
for disruptors to say,

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:01.230
maybe we can provide
a better service.

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:06.480
Maybe we can provide
something at a lower

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:11.370
cost and more inclusive.

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:16.090
These are the possibilities
for any startup in a sense.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:19.810
So I talked a little
about the cost.

00:44:19.810 --> 00:44:23.790
This is a couple of years ago,
but this Bloomberg article

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:27.970
broke down the cost, and
I find it very helpful.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.250
Often in the US and
in Europe, we think,

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.880
all right, I pay
$100 for something.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.710
You think you paid $100 for it.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:39.850
Well, actually you paid
$97 roughly for it,

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.660
and $2.75 went to
the payment system.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:47.350
And that $2.75 that went to
the payment system, most of it

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.670
goes to what's called
the issuing bank.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:54.100
And again, the issuing
bank is the purchaser.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.390
The acquiring bank
is the merchant.

00:44:57.390 --> 00:45:01.970
So that merchant bank is
only getting $0.19 on average

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:06.880
two years ago, the acquiring
bank, Bank of America,

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.550
or whomever issued
the credit card.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.100
So the dominant part
of the economics

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.660
here is on the credit card side.

00:45:14.660 --> 00:45:19.090
There's seven big companies
in America being the big four

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:23.140
banks of Bank of America,
and Wells Fargo, and Citi,

00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:25.180
and Chase.

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:29.140
But then Cap One is a
very big credit card bank.

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:32.140
And then, of course,
American Express and Discover

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:33.670
and the like.

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:37.210
Those seven big banks are
the big issuing banks.

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:42.670
But community banks, even
smaller banks across the land,

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:47.440
will issue credit cards,
and they get that roughly $2

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.542
out of $100 purchase.

00:45:50.542 --> 00:45:51.750
Now, what do they do with it?

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.680
Part of it is the
rewards program.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.670
And wrapped up inside of all
this is an incentive system

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:04.430
that issuing banks are using
part of that $2.20 on average,

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:07.160
on average about $1--

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.490
I think the national
average recently was $1.06.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:13.550
If you take all the
different rewards programs,

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.430
they come back.

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.510
So you buy something for $100.

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:21.120
$2.20 goes to your issuing bank.

00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:25.370
$1 might come back
to you as a reward.

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.940
And it makes behavioral
sciences important

00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.010
and makes this stuff sticky.

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:35.540
It makes us loyal to our cards
in a way that pure economics,

00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:37.510
you would think, that
it would be easier

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.460
to disrupt this space.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.120
So I wouldn't put aside some
of these reward programs

00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:43.870
when you're thinking
about, all right, I'm

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:44.920
going to be a disrupter.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.860
I'm going to break
into the payment space.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:52.640
The credit card companies, they
have a point of view on this,

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:53.140
too.

00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:56.770
And they're going to want to
protect their market share.

00:46:56.770 --> 00:46:58.635
Questions, Romain?

00:46:58.635 --> 00:46:59.260
Anything there?

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.882
ROMAIN: Let's give
it a few seconds

00:47:00.882 --> 00:47:02.840
just in case someone
wants to raise their hand.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:05.940
Yeah.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.230
GARY GENSLER: I'm going to--

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:07.500
ROMAIN: We have Luno.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:08.770
Luno has a question.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:09.950
GARY GENSLER: Sure.

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:12.935
And then I'm going to do
an overview of the cost.

00:47:12.935 --> 00:47:13.435
Luno?

00:47:13.435 --> 00:47:15.980
AUDIENCE: It's actually
not a question.

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.010
It's just in Europe,
it's a bit different.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.950
The interchange fee
is actually capped

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:27.290
to 0.3% if it's a credit card
and 0.2% if it's a debit card.

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.520
I'm not sure about the numbers.

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.480
And so I think this has
interesting spillovers in terms

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.170
of rewards programs in
Europe are definitely not

00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:37.880
as good as in the US.

00:47:37.880 --> 00:47:40.420
And then you can also
see that the credit card

00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:43.550
usage is much smaller.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:45.510
And that might be one
of the reasons why.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:46.218
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:47:46.218 --> 00:47:50.470
It's a very good point
because around the globe,

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:54.010
the official sector inserts
them self from time to time.

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:58.600
And because of the
natural network effects--

00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.640
remember that chart--
right in the middle,

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.860
there's powerful,
powerful economics

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.620
around network effects.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:05.800
Think of plumbing again.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.350
We only have one--

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:10.630
we usually only have
one electric company,

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:13.870
one waterworks company
per city because

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:16.630
of that incredible network
effect of the plumbing.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:18.350
Similar here.

00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:20.440
And so what some official
sectors have said

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.460
is, so now we have to put a
limit on what can be charged.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.770
In the US we did do that.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:31.700
Senator-- did I say Levin?

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:34.100
It was Senator Durbin
actually of Illinois.

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:35.120
I'm sorry.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.990
But Senator Durbin, the
Durbin Amendment, we

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:40.460
did that in debit cards.

00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.520
But credit cards, not the case.

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.140
And then in other
countries, like

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:49.880
in Asia, which really Alipay
and WeChat Pay and others

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.720
leapfrogged.

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.520
And then the official sector
is involved in a different way.

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.250
So you're absolutely right.

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:57.380
So rewards programs
would be lower.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.930
Credit card users
might be lower.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.210
If you're going to be
starting something,

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.480
you have to think of those
separate dynamics country

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.450
by country, very much so.

00:49:08.450 --> 00:49:13.250
The worldwide-- an
interesting report, and this

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:18.410
is from a McKinsey report
from September of last year.

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:23.570
McKinsey puts out an
annual report of payments.

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:25.190
If you're interested
in the area,

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:26.540
I didn't assign it as a reading.

00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:29.420
It's a remarkable
report once a year.

00:49:29.420 --> 00:49:32.780
But this is one chart that
I pulled from this McKinsey

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:33.740
report.

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:36.950
The worldwide revenues
in the payment system

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:41.825
add up to about $1.8
trillion, $1.9 trillion.

00:49:41.825 --> 00:49:46.130
Now, I should caution,
McKinsey includes what they

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:49.040
call account-related liquidity.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.270
And this quote,
"account-related liquidity,"

00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:59.010
is earning interest for the
banks on your credit card

00:49:59.010 --> 00:50:00.300
balances.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:04.020
Earlier World Bank statistics
would say the payment system

00:50:04.020 --> 00:50:06.300
around the globe takes
about a 1/2 a percent

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.280
to 1% of the economy.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:11.310
The worldwide economy
before the corona crisis

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.620
was hovering just
short of $100 trillion,

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.770
the US economy
about $22 trillion,

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:20.260
the world economy
about $95 trillion.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:24.750
But of that $95 trillion,
we've probably been spending,

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:30.370
McKinsey would say, nearly
2% on our payment system.

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:31.830
World Bank would say this--

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:34.930
the figure is more like a
quarter to a half of that

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:38.410
because McKinsey includes
all the interest that we're

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.250
paying on our balances.

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.140
So this is the opportunity.

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:43.270
This is the opportunity.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:46.600
If you're saying, aha, what did
Stripe, what did TransferWise,

00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:48.910
what did Plaid see?

00:50:48.910 --> 00:50:53.170
This is anywhere from a half a
trillion dollars at the low end

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:56.190
to $2 trillion at the high end.

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:59.530
1/2% to 2% of the
world economy relates

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:04.240
to just moving these digital
payments back and forth

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:07.030
plus the
account-related activity

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:10.630
liquidity, the
starting, the lending

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:13.440
balances on top of that.

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:15.610
Romain, I see the
chat room seems

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.940
to be lighting up quite a bit.

00:51:17.940 --> 00:51:20.215
Are there questions
there, or do I keep going?

00:51:20.215 --> 00:51:21.340
ROMAIN: You can keep going.

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:24.100
It's mainly students sharing
additional resources.

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:26.230
GARY GENSLER: All right, great.

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:28.460
So I was asked earlier--

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:32.320
I'm sorry, I can't
remember now who asked it.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.160
Was it Carlos?

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:37.690
But I apologize-- about
real-time gross settlements.

00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:41.890
Real-time gross settlements
is this conceptual framework

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.400
that we are all familiar
with in one way or the other.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:53.180
Can I move a digital
instruction to move money

00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:58.400
and to have the settlement
be relatively fast,

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:01.730
real-time gross settlement?

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.090
What's the word "gross" mean?

00:52:03.090 --> 00:52:05.750
It means that we're
not net settling.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:09.290
If you run a settlement system
with millions of checks coming

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:13.670
into a warehouse-- and that's
literally how the system

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:18.080
of check clearing used to
work in New York and elsewhere

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.840
in this country--

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.650
you can actually net settle.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.940
You can say, well, there's
these checks coming in

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.540
from Bank of America to
Wells Fargo and these checks

00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:31.640
from Wells Fargo
to Bank of America.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.690
Let's net these settlements
off against each other.

00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:37.700
But if you do
something in real-time,

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.680
if you do it almost
instantaneous,

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:40.670
it has to be gross.

00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:43.310
You can't net the
payment instructions

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:45.470
between the various banks.

00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:49.430
Real-time gross settlement is
used for large value payments

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:51.080
and has been used
for large value

00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.780
payments for quite some time.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:58.700
In fact, the early large value
model is the Fedwire, 1970.

00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.820
That's 50 years of
technology that we've

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.580
had the Fedwire,
meaning I can do

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.760
what's called a
wire instruction.

00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.950
But in the United
Kingdom, we had CHAPS.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:13.700
And in China--

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:19.700
I'm going to mispronounce
it, but C-N-A-P-S high-value

00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:22.250
payment system, the
Eurozone TARGET.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.300
2002 is actually when
the Eurozone was created.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.120
So we've had large value models.

00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.730
Coupled with that is
something called SWIFT.

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:34.400
SWIFT is just a
messaging company.

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:38.210
SWIFT, the Society for
Worldwide Interbank Financial

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:41.630
Telecommunications,
I think, it's

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:46.730
basically to send messages to
facilitate these interbank.

00:53:46.730 --> 00:53:49.310
The question in the
last 10 to 15 years

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:53.045
is, can we move from
large value to just

00:53:53.045 --> 00:53:58.640
you and me, in essence, what we
think we're doing with Venmo?

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:03.320
Can I move you money
rapidly instantaneously?

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.975
And some countries have
actually moved forward.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.010
It's called real-time retail.

00:54:11.010 --> 00:54:14.450
And the important thing is
it's retail instant payments.

00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:18.610
Now, a lot of people don't call
it real-time retail instant.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:21.150
A lot of people would just
call it 24 hours a day,

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:25.430
7 days a week, or some
people might call it RTGS.

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:27.740
But fundamentally, the
question is, can we

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:34.660
do what the Fed the Reserve
of the US did 50 years ago

00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:39.040
and the United Kingdom
did nearly 40 years ago?

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:41.900
Can we do that for
the retail public,

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.530
and can we do it 24
hours a day, 7 days

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.940
a week, every day of the year?

00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.720
And the answer is yes,
the technology exists.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.450
I'm listing here seven
or eight countries

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:56.110
that either have
instantaneous payment

00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:59.000
systems or near instantaneous.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.840
Some of these are not
literally instantaneous.

00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:05.960
A couple of them are
three cycles a day

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:08.500
where they do this
three times a day.

00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.600
And I can't remember
each country,

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:13.420
but you can see it's
relatively recent.

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:15.290
And then the US.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:19.210
With the US projects, we
have this split system.

00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:24.340
The clearing house is owned
by 24 major banks in the US,

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:28.380
and it's been around
since the 1850s.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:31.300
The clearing house
by 2017 said, we

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:34.750
want to provide a
real-time payment network.

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.560
But it's really buying
amongst these 24 major banks,

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:41.560
all the big banks in the US.

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:46.270
The Federal Reserve at first
seemed comfortable with that.

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:49.690
And then frankly, the rest
of the banking community,

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:54.740
the banks that weren't the
top 24 said, no, not really.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.170
And they went to Congress.

00:55:56.170 --> 00:56:00.190
They went to the US Congress,
and many members of Congress

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.490
got involved on behalf
of community banks.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:05.440
There's 5,000 or
6,000 banks that

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.800
are not direct members
of the clearinghouse.

00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:13.570
And so now the Federal Reserve
is standing up FedNow service.

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.070
And you can see this in
Lael Brainard's speech.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.830
Now, FedNow service
is also meant

00:56:19.830 --> 00:56:22.560
to be like a public
utility rather than

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.050
controlled by these 24 banks.

00:56:25.050 --> 00:56:27.810
And so there's some interesting
dynamics back and forth

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.140
in the competition.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.860
The clearinghouse real-time
payment network probably

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:36.420
will up its game, and FedNow
will come along as well.

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:39.420
Some said that the announcement
last year by the Federal

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.970
Reserve was in reaction
to Facebook Libra,

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:45.120
and maybe that spurred
this a little bit,

00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:46.590
that the official
sector was then

00:56:46.590 --> 00:56:49.560
competing with Facebook
because the announcement came

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.150
just weeks after.

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.480
Now, I would imagine the Federal
Reserve was working on it

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.310
a long time beforehand.

00:56:56.310 --> 00:56:58.270
And we'll close out
this lecture today

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:03.780
on when China's digital currency
electronic payments program.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:06.120
China and the Federal
Reserve in the US

00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.350
both had major announcements
right after Facebook Libra.

00:57:10.350 --> 00:57:14.940
This project, FedNow, and
China's, both had been--

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:18.330
work had been done, but it
feels like the announcements

00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:22.140
were accelerated and
in reaction a bit.

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:25.290
We don't know for
sure, of course.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.486
Questions, Romain?

00:57:27.486 --> 00:57:28.885
ROMAIN: None so far, Gary.

00:57:28.885 --> 00:57:30.040
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:31.810
So what's the payment landscape?

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:33.010
Who are the companies?

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:34.690
Well, we've talked
about Big Tech.

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:38.670
And I'm glad, Luke,
I think I have

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:41.920
KakaoPay on there thankfully.

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.320
I should have had
LINE Pay as well.

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:48.490
But Big Tech, OK, we've chatted
a little bit about that.

00:57:48.490 --> 00:57:52.920
And then there's, of course,
a bunch of unicorn startups.

00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:55.560
I could have put another
half dozen to a dozen,

00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:00.250
unicorn being $1 billion
of value or more.

00:58:00.250 --> 00:58:03.490
But each of these startups
have a little bit different way

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.220
that they've broken
into this space.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:10.280
Plaid, which we've chatted
a little bit about,

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.860
Plaid is in this space because
they came in through open APIs

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.670
and facilitating the
software in the system.

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:23.360
Ripple is a cryptocurrency
type company.

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.900
One97 is in India.

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:28.540
It's really-- I could even
have put that in the Big Tech

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.210
because they started,
I think, Paytm.

00:58:31.210 --> 00:58:35.850
NewBank addressed it a little
bit from being a challenger

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:37.800
bank, and we're going
to be talking about that

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:38.800
in a couple of lectures.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:42.370
Toast picks a sector,
and they really

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:45.540
dominate the restaurant sector.

00:58:45.540 --> 00:58:48.280
But they initially were
getting into payments

00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.660
because they were into tablets.

00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:53.890
So each has a bit of
a different story.

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:56.650
Brex was about startups
and facilitating

00:58:56.650 --> 00:58:57.820
credit for startups.

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:02.300
TransferWise was cross-border,
as we talked about earlier.

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:06.040
So they each found a
strategy to build themselves

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.560
into this place.

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:12.160
But let's just talk about Alipay
and WeChat Pay for a moment.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.070
This is even dated because
this is nearly a year old,

00:59:15.070 --> 00:59:19.060
but this is their user base
in the last seven years,

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.200
this remarkable growth
of usage between Alipay

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:27.400
and WeChat Pay in China,
both with approximately

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.990
a billion users.

00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:31.180
It's thought that WeChat
Pay and Alipay now

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:37.310
have 92% of the retail
payment space in China.

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:41.390
And one of their
strategic approaches

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:46.100
is that if you have a store
of value on an Alipay wallet

00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.870
and you move it to somebody
else within the Alipay system,

00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:53.240
as I understand it,
it's still 0 cost.

00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:57.980
If you jump out of service,
out of system, 10 basis points.

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:01.580
But this conceptual framework--
and their pricing model

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:04.700
could change at any time,
but their pricing model

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.300
has been historically, if you
stay within the Alipay wallet

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:12.690
system, heck of a
benefit in cost.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:16.570
So merchants then start to
want to pay their vendors.

01:00:16.570 --> 01:00:20.620
And merchants and customers
want to stay within those wallet

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:23.920
systems to keep
those costs down,

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.560
significant network effects.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.345
Romain?

01:00:27.345 --> 01:00:29.840
ROMAIN: Sijin has her hand up.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.855
GARY GENSLER: Please.

01:00:30.855 --> 01:00:31.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:32.620
Hi.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.750
Just want to add one point.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:38.120
I think the social platform
base is really important,

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:41.530
but another thing that
Alipay is so successful

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:44.260
because it's working
closely with the government.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:50.170
For example, right now in China,
we can use a QR code in Alipay

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:53.910
when we try to get
on the shuttle bus

01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:55.990
or we want to get a phone.

01:00:55.990 --> 01:00:58.690
We can use the Alipay
to pay that bill.

01:00:58.690 --> 01:01:02.470
So actually, the government is
encouraging all of the citizens

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:05.758
to use this Alipay
and WeChat Pay.

01:01:05.758 --> 01:01:06.550
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.730
So there's incredible
collaboration,

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:13.450
what you're talking
about, between government

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:16.060
and these payments systems.

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:18.140
And we've seen this
in India as well.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.040
India really
encouraged the uptake.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.700
And I could have put various
statistics in for India.

01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:26.590
They're a couple or
few years behind.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:31.450
They're not as robust
and developed in India.

01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:36.010
But this encouragement by the
official sector or the banking

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:36.670
sector--

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:39.880
sometimes in other countries,
it can be by the banking sector.

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:43.330
But what's interesting in China,
and we'll close out on this,

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:47.300
is now the Chinese
government is offering

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:50.770
what one might say is a
complement or a competitor

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:54.730
to WeChat and Alipay through
the Chinese digital currency

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:57.700
electronic payment
project or DCEP.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.230
And so they've facilitated the
ramp up of Alipay and WeChat

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:07.280
Pay, but now they're going to
have an alternative as well.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.500
So it's very interesting.

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.230
And I think in part,
this is to facilitate

01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:14.560
the commercial banks were
losing a significant market

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:18.070
share to Alipay and WeChat Pay,
that the Chinese government

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:22.450
may well have been encouraged
to build their own--

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.850
they call it the central
bank digital currency--

01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:29.110
but their own wallet
system, digital wallet,

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:36.250
digital yuan that will look
a lot like Alipay and WeChat

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:37.060
wallets.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:40.750
And in fact, this is all
being rolled out in 2020.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:44.560
But in fact, the
initial pronouncements

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:48.370
say that it must be
accepted, so just

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:51.970
as we have had multiple
centuries of laws that

01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:53.800
are called legal tender laws.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.590
And the legal tender
laws go all the way

01:02:56.590 --> 01:03:00.040
back to Genghis
Khan in China, where

01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:03.350
under the coercive
power of the state,

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:07.060
you must accept in those
days the paper bark

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:10.060
currency of Genghis
Khan, or in the US,

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:13.070
you must accept the US
dollar for all debts

01:03:13.070 --> 01:03:14.440
public and private.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.360
Those are called
legal tender laws.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.970
Something similar is
happening right now in China

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:22.480
that this DCEP will
have to be accepted,

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.050
at first in certain cities.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.878
They're going to start,
I think, in two cities,

01:03:26.878 --> 01:03:28.420
and then they're
going to roll it out

01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.880
over time in other places.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.270
So now let's look
here in the US.

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:36.670
And I picked
Facebook because they

01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:38.710
haven't been as successful.

01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:44.770
This remarkable platform,
Facebook is so ubiquitous,

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:47.470
over 2 billion members
around the globe.

01:03:47.470 --> 01:03:50.130
They've tried multiple
times to get into payments

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:52.630
starting 11 years ago.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:54.850
Virtual currency
in 15 currencies

01:03:54.850 --> 01:03:58.330
terminated in four
years, Facebook credit.

01:03:58.330 --> 01:04:02.290
They came about in 2015
Facebook Messenger.

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:04.780
They started in the
US, UK, and France.

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:09.230
By 2019, they rolled out
of France and the UK.

01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:13.400
They, in India, had a pilot
that for the longest time

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:19.700
was in pilot
purgatory, in a sense.

01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:21.560
Facebook could not
get the approval

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:24.500
of the Indian government to go
beyond one million accounts.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:30.050
They only recently in the early
spring of 2020, late winter,

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:32.780
got approval that they
could move up to 10 million

01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:34.380
and so forth.

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:39.170
But it's pending further
data standardization,

01:04:39.170 --> 01:04:42.680
and it's conditional on
data standardization.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.740
And then last November,
they announced Facebook Pay.

01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:48.170
Now, that puts aside
Facebook Libra.

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:51.740
I'm just saying their
efforts to do Facebook Pay,

01:04:51.740 --> 01:04:54.080
bringing together
Facebook Messenger,

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:59.080
Instagram, WhatsApp
is their new effort.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:01.520
You can decide whether you
think they'll be successful.

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.300
But it's interesting that
in some circumstances,

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:06.940
Facebook has been very
successful, but not so much

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.140
in the payment space.

01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:13.180
And even Google Wallet and
Google Pay has more adoption,

01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:17.140
and Apple Pay has more adoption
than we've seen in Facebook,

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:18.560
as I understand it.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:21.560
It's hard to get
all the statistics.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:25.540
So it gives you a little bit
of a sense of these challenges.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.490
What's the landscape?

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.720
Going to do it a little
quickly, but this

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.970
is to give you that landscape.

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:34.660
First, commercial banks and
the bank-owned networks.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:36.970
I put here thousands of banks.

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:38.770
They've been around since 1784.

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:40.660
I like taking 1784
because that's

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:44.890
the Bank of New York here in the
US, Alexander Hamilton's bank.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.290
But the clearinghouse
literally has been around

01:05:47.290 --> 01:05:48.820
since the 1850s.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:51.880
It was a place where people
took physical checks,

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.860
negotiable orders
of withdraw, and had

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:57.290
to take them into a
warehouse and clear them.

01:05:57.290 --> 01:05:59.860
But even UnionPay
in China, which

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:03.010
was formed amongst
85 banks initially--

01:06:03.010 --> 01:06:05.710
and some say maybe the
People's Bank of China

01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:09.460
owns something of it, too--
but UnionPay, these bank

01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:12.120
consortium.

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:15.990
Next in this architecture
of the payment landscape,

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:17.460
the card companies.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.050
I would note that
Visa was a consortium.

01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:22.380
Bank of America was
a California bank.

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:24.810
It was not a national
bank at the time.

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:28.230
And Bank of America wanted to
offer its California credit

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:31.710
card across the country
and formed a consortium.

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:34.020
It later became an
independent company.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:35.700
It later went public.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:41.320
And it's got a $373 billion
market value as of last Friday.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:45.870
Now, we sometimes talk about the
Big Tech firms, the big four,

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:49.260
Microsoft, and Google,
and Amazon, and Apple.

01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:51.600
They all have market
values above this.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.930
But Visa is one of the
10 highest market cap

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:59.470
companies in the country,
maybe in the world.

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:02.130
And then, of course, Mastercard
and so forth, Discover

01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:03.000
and the Dow.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.850
So that's the base
layer, but then there's

01:07:05.850 --> 01:07:08.490
something that you and I
don't think a lot about,

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:11.040
is payments service providers.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:14.760
And these companies have gone
through a significant wave

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.170
of consolidation.

01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:18.270
These were data
companies basically,

01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:20.700
expounded around 20 years ago.

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:24.030
Fiserv is an agglomeration
of three or four

01:07:24.030 --> 01:07:26.100
different companies
that have come together

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.330
over the last few years.

01:07:27.330 --> 01:07:31.560
But these dominant
companies here in the US

01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:34.500
are the backbones of
the payment network

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.110
right in the middle of
that earlier chart that we

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.760
talked about, $45 billion to
$80 billion market value each.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:48.170
And now we get to the
startups starting with PayPal

01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:53.740
at $124 billion of value, and
Square, and then some companies

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:55.960
you might not be
as familiar with.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:08:00.380
But each one of these companies
founded usually in the 20-year

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:00.880
timeframe--

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.100
I'll put Western
Union to the side.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:08.620
Western Union was that company
that started in the 1850s.

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:12.590
These are publicly
traded companies.

01:08:12.590 --> 01:08:14.040
You can look at
their financials.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:17.500
If you were actually going to
go and compete in this space,

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.080
I'd largely recommend you've
got to pull these financials,

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.950
read their public statements,
see how they make their money.

01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:26.319
But then there's the
private companies.

01:08:26.319 --> 01:08:28.850
And all I could do to
value these companies that

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:32.649
go to Forbes and Crunchbase
and some other sources to say,

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:35.439
what was their
last funding round?

01:08:35.439 --> 01:08:38.069
Stripe has not gone public yet.

01:08:38.069 --> 01:08:41.439
Paytm in India has
not gone public yet,

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:43.210
but these are their
last funding rounds.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:49.880
Plaid was purchased for
$5.3 billion by Visa.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.120
But it gives you that
sense, putting aside

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:55.790
whether these values
will persist or not.

01:08:55.790 --> 01:08:58.520
And there's hundreds,
thousands of other companies

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:02.420
in this space competing.

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.479
As I said, there's a
lot of consolidation.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:08.960
And one of the consolidations
is around payment service

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:09.830
providers.

01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.310
Just in the last 18
months, four big mergers,

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:16.819
one in Europe, three
in the US, basically

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:21.170
consolidation in the
middle of this technology.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:24.380
First Data, which was one of
the biggest companies, that

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.830
basically was on
the merchant side,

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.840
helping merchants with
their point of sale,

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:34.240
Worldpay that does this annual
report that I talked about,

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.479
and Total Systems Services all
bought in the last 15 months.

01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:43.160
And then in Europe, Worldline
bought Ingenico, which

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.370
was like a cross-Europe merger.

01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:47.810
But we're seeing
a lot of mergers

01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:50.359
also in the data
aggregator side.

01:09:50.359 --> 01:09:52.130
Visa bought Plaid,
as we talked about.

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:56.300
And SoFi recently announced for
over $1 billion buying Galileo.

01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:59.350
Galileo is a smaller
competitor of Plaid

01:09:59.350 --> 01:10:02.890
that is in this API
data aggregators

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:06.200
space, a really important
space in payments.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.890
SoFi, which we'll talk about
in our next couple of classes,

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:15.810
started as a credit provider,
not in the payment side.

01:10:15.810 --> 01:10:19.100
But here it's interesting that
SoFi is going back and saying,

01:10:19.100 --> 01:10:20.930
we want to get to
that payment side.

01:10:20.930 --> 01:10:26.620
We want to acquire
Galileo and the API side.

01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:30.160
And so a little talk, and we've
only got a few minutes left.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.420
We already talked
about crypto projects,

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.140
but the crypto land is here.

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.910
And they're saying
maybe a digital token

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:42.710
backed by US dollars
or backed by Euro

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:47.170
or yen would be the way to
address these pain points.

01:10:47.170 --> 01:10:49.240
Some are retail projects.

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.760
Mostly tether and others
on the retail side

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.280
are about cryptocurrency
exchanges.

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.740
But the wholesale
projects are interesting.

01:10:56.740 --> 01:10:59.080
14 large banks
have come together

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:01.390
and formed this
thing called Fnality

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:04.420
without an I. It's F-nality.

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:07.300
JP Morgan has said
JP Morgan Coin.

01:11:07.300 --> 01:11:13.550
These are trying to use digital
tokens representing Fiat money

01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:15.620
to smooth out pain points.

01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:17.900
And then the messaging
companies, Telegram,

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.160
the world's largest secure or
encrypted messaging company

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.670
with 400 million
members or customers,

01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:28.490
they're trying to have a token
called GRAM, even though it's

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.650
held up in the
securities law case

01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:32.690
that they have with the
Securities and Exchange

01:11:32.690 --> 01:11:34.910
Commission here in the US.

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:36.420
And that sets the stage--

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:38.200
I'm going to skip over--

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.230
that Bitcoin and all of these
payment tokens are out there

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.360
and talk about the goals
they're trying to do.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.810
The goals they are trying
to do are the same things--

01:11:47.810 --> 01:11:50.240
addressing pain points,
extending settlement

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:54.890
to 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week, and lowering costs.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:59.000
That's why JP Morgan
has JP Morgan Coin.

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.100
It might be a
little bit of hype,

01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.930
but there's some
reality, too, that they

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:07.250
think that between their project
and this competitive project

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.620
Fnality at the
wholesale payment space,

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:14.270
they can lower cost in
the cross-border space.

01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:17.390
So Facebook comes along, and
Facebook says, well, maybe we

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:18.830
can do it.

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:22.040
Maybe we can do it with
a worldwide currency.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:24.000
They announced it was--

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.715
it didn't lack ambition.

01:12:25.715 --> 01:12:30.860
Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook
announced a new global currency

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.080
to meet the needs of
billions of people.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:35.270
They talked about
financial inclusion.

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:37.910
They talked about
cross-border pain points.

01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:41.240
And they said, this is
the wave of the future.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.360
It's run into a lot of central
bank concerns around the globe.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.590
It's run into
significant public sector

01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:50.760
concerns around the globe.

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.900
It's still uncertain
whether it will take off,

01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:56.930
but it's a significant
feature of this payment space

01:12:56.930 --> 01:13:00.290
that one needs to
understand, even if it's just

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:02.060
a catalyst for change.

01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:06.500
Both China and the US reacted
quickly with the FedNow project

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:10.490
here in the US and the
central bank digital currency

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:12.740
project in China.

01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:15.050
So I'm going to close on
just a little chart that

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:18.005
shows Libra versus central
bank digital currency

01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:21.230
and just say something
about China's project.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:25.310
China's project, not yet
lived, digital currency

01:13:25.310 --> 01:13:28.910
electronic payment
program, the issuer

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:30.650
is the People's Bank of China.

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:33.800
And this is a really
important question that

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.410
is on a lot of people's mind.

01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:40.520
If a central bank issues a
digital representation of money

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.620
directly, what's the role
of the commercial banks?

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.480
Commercial banks
in most countries

01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:51.300
are the issuer of digital money.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.480
I know we think about central
banks in the 180 countries

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:57.330
that have money, and
they're really important.

01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:00.360
But it's commercial banks
that keep those ledgers.

01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:04.080
The commercial banks with some
backing of their governments,

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.740
either implicit or explicit
with deposit insurance,

01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:11.940
you and I have a liability to
our banks, to Bank America,

01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:15.650
to Barclays, to
some bank in Asia.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:17.550
The People's Bank
of China is saying,

01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:20.730
no, we will issue this
directly, but we'll

01:14:20.730 --> 01:14:23.880
have the commercial
banks involved.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.580
And the commercial banks,
you'll get your digital wallet

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:27.780
from the commercial banks.

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:31.050
There were announcements
as of early April 2020

01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:36.330
that update us, but we don't
yet have the full picture.

01:14:36.330 --> 01:14:40.020
It looks like it's basically a
centralized private network run

01:14:40.020 --> 01:14:41.670
by the PBOC.

01:14:41.670 --> 01:14:44.550
It does look like
Alipay and WeChat Pay

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:46.840
will have to use this system.

01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:50.730
So some question is, how
different will it really be?

01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:56.070
It looks like by government Fiat
rolled out by city and region

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:59.250
that merchants will
have to accept DCEP.

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:01.620
So the QR system
on those buses will

01:15:01.620 --> 01:15:06.240
have to have DCEP,
Alipay, and WeChat Pay.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.700
Alipay has taken out
a bunch of patents

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:12.210
already on how to
interface with DCEP.

01:15:12.210 --> 01:15:14.370
So it's a work in
progress, but it's

01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:15.980
an important feature of this.

01:15:15.980 --> 01:15:18.630
And if you're thinking
about payments,

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:19.710
this is really important.

01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:22.440
And what's fascinating is
central banks around the globe

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:25.370
are then looking to
see what China's done.

01:15:25.370 --> 01:15:30.720
Sweden was already looking at an
electronic digital central bank

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:33.300
currency, the E-krona.

01:15:33.300 --> 01:15:35.520
And they were at the forefront.

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.190
But now you can go central
bank around central bank.

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:39.780
France has made announcements.

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:43.020
The United Kingdom has
made announcements in 2020,

01:15:43.020 --> 01:15:48.180
all in this milieu of, how
do we address pain points?

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:51.390
Do we as a central bank have a
responsibility to our citizens

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:55.290
to continue to offer a digital
currency when the paper

01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.060
currency is going away?

01:15:57.060 --> 01:15:59.130
And important public
policy questions of,

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:00.090
what does this do?

01:16:00.090 --> 01:16:02.950
Does it destabilize
commercial banks?

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:07.230
So I think that's
a bit of a wrap.

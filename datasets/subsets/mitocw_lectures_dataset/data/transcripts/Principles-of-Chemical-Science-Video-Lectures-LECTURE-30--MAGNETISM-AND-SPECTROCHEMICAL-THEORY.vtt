00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:23.620
PROFESSOR: OK, everyone,
pay attention

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.930
to the clicker question.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.860
If you haven't responded, now's
a good time to click in

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:46.000
your response.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:01:04.330
All right, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:13.170
OK, we can do better
than this.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.650
So, tetrahedral complexes.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.710
Do you recall tetrahedral
complexes with angles of what

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.770
between the ligands?

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.750
109 .

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.120
5.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.070
The ligands' negative point
charges aren't facing any of

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.740
the d orbitals perfectly.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.030
They're a little bit closer to
the orbitals that are 45

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.980
degrees off-axis, so those three
are the most repelled.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.210
But they're not really directly
hitting any of them.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.450
So that's in contrast with the
octahedral system or square

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.270
planar where the ligands
negative point charges are

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.950
headed directly toward some
of the d orbitals.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.750
So because the ligands in a
tetrahedral case are not

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.870
headed directly toward any of
the d orbitals, there is not a

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.870
huge amount of crystal fields
splitting, so that's small.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.960
And so, when the splitting is
small, then you tend to have

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.810
high spin systems. So you put in
all of the electrons singly

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.070
to the fullest extent
of the orbital as

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.170
possible before you pair.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.980
And so, since you put them in
singly for the fullest extent

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.690
possible before you pair them
up, that will lead to a high

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.120
spin system, which
is the maximum

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.810
number of unpaired electrons.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.490
So today is then the last
lecture on transition metals,

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.890
and we've been talking about
crystal field theory, and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.480
today we're going to talk
about colors and

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.980
crystal field theory.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.670
So, colors, there are a lot of
beautiful colors in nature,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.490
and some of the beautiful colors
you find in nature have

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.140
to do with transition metals
or other liganded states.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.350
So, we're going to start with
an example of how colors can

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.830
change, how a molecule's color
can depend on its oxidation

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.140
state, how a molecule's
color can depend on

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.970
its liganded state.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:27.440
So, Dr. Taylor is going to be
doing this for you -- should

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.426
we do it the demo and then look
at the questions or do

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:31.600
the questions first?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.790
Demo first?

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.650
PROFESSOR: So, here are some
of the reactions up on the

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.270
Powerpoint that you're going to
be looking at, and as the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.330
reaction proceeds, there's
going to be changes in

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:50.090
oxidation state, and also
changes in ligand in state,

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.550
and that will lead to
changes in color.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:04:49.460
[DEMONSTRATION]

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.530
PROFESSOR: So, how would you
describe that first color?

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.420
Any predictions?

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.100
Have any of you seen
this before, what's

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:19.000
going to happen next?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.590
[DEMONSTRATION]

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:36.350
PROFESSOR: So this is called an
oscillating clock reaction,

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.310
so as it runs through,
it cycles between

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:56.690
the different colors.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.360
So, that should happily keep
going, and we can consider

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.460
what's happening.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.430
So here's the overall reaction
here and it can be divided

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.640
into two components.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.310
So, why don't you tell me, what
is happening to iodide in

00:06:12.310 --> 00:07:08.420
that first reaction, and
there it is again.

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:23.770
All right, so let's take
10 more seconds.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.680
Very good.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.890
So, if you looked up here, you
see that you have minus 2 for

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.680
the oxygen, three of them, minus
6, and it needs to equal

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.170
minus 1, so you have plus 5.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.610
And then over here, we again
have plus 1 minus 2, and so

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:42.660
that has to be plus 1.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.800
So that was actually a quiz
question, but you score three

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.430
points if you answered, even
if you got it wrong, but we

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.840
could have had that four points,
most people got that

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.640
right anyway.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.830
But if you answered, you
get an extra few

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.770
points on that one.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.070
All right, so very good.

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:03.140
That's what's happening
to iodide.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:07.230
Now you notice that in this
reaction h o i is being

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.640
produced, and then
in the second

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.690
step it's being consumed.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.100
This later reaction can be
divided, then, into two

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.240
additional reactions.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.200
And one of the reactions, you
can tell me again what is

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:26.870
happening, what is being
oxidized and what is being

00:08:26.870 --> 00:09:09.130
reduced in this part
of the reaction.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:22.740
OK, let's take 10 more seconds.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.970
Excellent.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.230
Even a little higher
than before.

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.010
All right, so you figured out
that this was the plus 1, this

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.670
is minus 1, and they're
both going to 0.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:35.230
So you have oxidation and
reduction going on all

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:41.880
involving iodide in
that reaction.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.830
OK, so as the reaction was
proceeding, you could see that

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:49.470
it started out with clear and
then it went to sort of amber

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:53.470
color, and that was the i 2, the
clear was i minus, and the

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.760
sort of darker blue color that
you saw is the complex with

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.390
starch in the reaction.

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.850
So that both of these guys have
colors independent, but

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.240
then when they're liganded
to something else,

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:05.570
the color is different.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.050
And that's very true with
coordination complexes that

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.650
the metal by itself will be
strongly influenced by what

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.730
the ligands are.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.490
And depending on what type of
ligands it has, it can have a

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.880
really entirely different color
than it had before.

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.770
So, today we're going to talk
about why that's true, and how

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.630
you can predict colors based
on what type of ligand is

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.880
bound to a transition metal.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.290
So, a lot of transition metals
have really beautiful colors,

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:38.360
and my laboratory studies metals
bound to proteins, and

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.130
often the proteins will have
really beautiful colors

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.900
because of the metal cofactor
involved, and that's one of

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.550
the things that I liked about
that particular area of study

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.940
is just how beautiful these
proteins can be.

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:55.800
So, the color given off depends
on the nature of the

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.860
metal, and depends on the
nature of the ligand.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.300
And so we can use crystal field
theory, which again, is

00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:06.800
a very simplified theory, to try
to predict or explain the

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:08.320
observed colors.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.420
And so again, this is not
always very precise, but

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.050
given, if you're told
information out of color, you

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:19.460
can rationalize why that would
be true, and you can also

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.060
predict at least a range of
color that you would have

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.960
under certain circumstances.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.100
So, let's take a look
at this more.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.220
So the ligands again,
have the ability to

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.130
split those d orbitals.

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.960
And when we're talking about for
metals, it's all about the

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.100
d orbitals.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.770
And we talked already about
strong field ligands and weak

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.410
field ligands, and we're going
to talk more about that today,

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.530
but this time in
terms of color.

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.190
So a strong field ligand, as
we discussed, creates a big

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:51.070
splitting in the d orbital
energy, whereas weak field

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.540
ligand, like the first question
you had today with

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.730
tetrahedral complexes, there's
usually a weak field there, so

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.040
we have a small energy
separation

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.050
between the d orbitals.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.940
So here is something that you
actually have to memorize --

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:10.890
there's not much memorization
in this course, but you do

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.620
need to memorize these six
ligands in terms of their

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:18.050
ability to split d orbitals.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.190
So, on the side, we have three
that are strong field ligands,

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:27.630
cyanide, c o, and ammonia, and
so those are going to be

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.610
strong field, so they're going
to have big splitting energy,

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:32.960
and so they'll tend
to be low spin.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.070
Then we have three that are sort
of in between that are

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:40.710
intermediate field -- water,
hydroxide and f minus.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:45.330
And so, in comparing, those are
intermediate, so you're

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:48.640
going to be asked questions such
as how does that compare

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.940
to a weak field, how does that
compare to a strong field.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.640
And then our weak field ligands
or a lot of our

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.750
halides down here, i minus,
b r minus, c l minus.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:02.130
And so those are weak field
ligands, so you'll have a

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.760
small splitting, so
they'll tend to be

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.110
in high spin complexes.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:16.930
So let's take a look
at some examples.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.430
So we talked about iron before
in complexes, and now we can

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:26.960
consider two cases where we have
iron plus 3, so the same

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.090
metal in the same oxidation
state, but it

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:30.950
has different ligands.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.570
It So in one case you have a
high spin system with six

00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:38.680
water ligands, and then the
other in a low spin system

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.930
with six cyanide ligands.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:43.290
So first, before you do anything
else with this, you

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.180
always have to think about
what the d count is.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.320
So, to do the d count, we're
going to look at where iron is

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.690
in the periodic table, and
we're going to see

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:56.270
it's in group 8.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:14:01.290
And then, we'll have 8 minus
3, the oxidation

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:08.070
number is d 5 system.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:12.290
So now we have two diagrams
here, one has a big splitting,

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.510
one has a small splitting, and
why don't you fill in for me

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.590
in a clicker question,
what the high spin

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:19.370
system would look like.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:15:15.890
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:17.540
Very good.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.720
I think that's one of our
highest numbers in a while.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.810
That's right, so we're going to
fill to the fullest extent

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:30.510
possible before we pair
any of the electrons.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:34.460
So again, here we put in
electrons down here, and then

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.310
go up here, because the
splitting is small, so it

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.830
doesn't take that much energy
to put an electron in the

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.730
upper orbitals, it takes more
energy to pair the electrons

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.800
for this weak field system.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.180
And so, this is a high spin
case, we have a maximum number

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.060
of unpaired electrons.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:55.520
So, over here when we have a
much bigger splitting energy,

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.340
it's going to take a lot more
energy to put electrons up

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.350
there, and so we're going to
fill up all of these orbitals

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:05.110
down here until we have to
put an electron up there.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:09.680
So, if we do that, put in the
three, and now we're going to

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.590
pair, because it takes less
energy to pair than it does to

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:16.280
put an electron up there,
so we do four and five.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:22.670
And so then here is our system
where we have a strong field,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.230
and so here's a weak field and
it's going to be high spin,

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.640
maximum number of unpaired
electrons, here we have the

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.510
strong field and it'll be low
spin, the minimum number of

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.570
unpaired electrons.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:39.330
And we're doing this, again,
because we know that cyanide

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.910
is a strong field ligand,
whereas water is an

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:45.840
intermediate field
ligand, it's a

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.090
lot weaker than cyanide.

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:51.980
OK, now we can continue doing
some of the things that we've

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:52.950
done before.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.520
So just to review this material,
we can write the d n

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.460
electron configurations.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.920
What are the orbitals called
that are down here?

00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.340
Yup, t 2 g.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.620
And how many electrons do
we have there? three.

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:14.110
And then the e g system up
here with two electrons.

00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:17.800
And over here what do we have?

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.520
Yup, t 2 g to the 5.

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.990
So, a review, electron
configurations, these are just

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.210
shorthand notations, which
tell people what these

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:32.400
diagrams look like.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.520
Then, we also talked
about this before.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:42.620
So, what does this
term stand for?

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:47.550
Crystal field stabilization
energy, right.

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:49.610
So now why don't you tell
me what it is for

00:17:49.610 --> 00:18:15.260
the high spin system.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:29.100
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:34.790
Yup, zero.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:40.020
So if we look at that, we have
three electrons down here, so

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.340
that's minus 2/5, two electrons
up here, which is

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:49.260
plus 3/5, so 3 times minus
2/5 is minus 6/5, plus

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.440
6/5 gives you 0.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:56.540
So here is a case where you
really don't have much

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.200
stabilization.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.160
It would be equivalent then, so
there's zero stabilization

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:06.800
because you have three electrons
down and two up.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.220
All right, so what about the
low spin system now?

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:14.290
So if we can look at that, what
are we going to have for

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.100
this system?

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:24.580
So, we have 5 times minus 2/5
or minus 10/5, and we also

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:29.160
have two pairing energy terms
there, which we can write in,

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.940
because there are two sets
that are paired.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.490
So this is mostly review on what
we've had before, and we

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.420
haven't talked about some of
these things in a little

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.340
while, so we go over it again,
and now we're going to take it

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:47.270
a next step and think about what
sort of wavelength would

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:50.120
be absorbed if you're going
to promote some of these

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.390
electrons to unfilled
orbitals.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.930
So what about the light absorbed
by these octahedral

00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:00.280
coordination complexes?

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.670
So, if you remember back to the
beginning of the course, a

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:07.560
physics course or high school, a
substance absorbs photons of

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:11.330
light if the energy of the
photons match the energy

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:13.730
required to excite those
electrons to a

00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.820
higher energy level.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.580
And so now we are doing some
review from the first part of

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.940
the course, which
is always good.

00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.370
As I mentioned, everything kind
of comes together and we

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.490
need to go over everything for
the final, but there's also

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:30.270
connections between
all the different

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.010
parts of the semester.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.330
So this should look
familiar to you.

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.870
So, the energy of the absorbed
light equals Planck's constant

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.450
times the frequency
of that light.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.140
But now we can make that equal
to another term, a term we've

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.020
been talking about in this
unit, and that is our

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.470
octahedral crystal field
splitting energy.

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.450
Because the energy that's going
to be required to bump

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:56.960
an electron from here to
here is that energy,

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.860
that splitting energy.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:04.040
So that's going to be equal
to this term here.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:08.240
OK, so what does this mean in
terms of the wavelengths of

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:14.640
lights absorbed by different
coordination complexes.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.760
So we can think about that.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.550
So if you have high frequency
of light is absorbed, the

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:25.200
wavelength of the absorbed light
is going to be short.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.210
And we know that relationship
-- again, think back to the

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.820
beginning of the course and also
probably to physics and

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.700
to high school, we know a very
handy equation for telling us

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:38.050
about the relationship of
frequency and wavelength of

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.420
light, so we have the speed of
light equals the wavelength

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.250
times the frequency.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.220
So if you have a high frequency
of light absorbed,

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:51.560
the absorbed wavelength
is going to be short.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:54.310
So, let's look at a couple of
examples, the example here,

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.140
going back to our example.

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.740
So we had this high spin system
with water, and now I'm

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:03.700
telling you that the splitting
energy is 171 kilojoules per

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:09.280
mole, and when you have cyanide
as your ligand, your

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:13.300
splitting energy is 392
kilojoules per mole.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.930
Again, this was a stronger field
ligand, so we have a

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.520
bigger splitting energy.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.250
And this was an intermediate
field ligand, certainly weaker

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:25.710
than cyanide, so this has a
smaller splitting energy.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:29.590
So, from these values now, we
can calculate the wavelength

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:32.710
of absorbed light.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:36.590
So for the high spin system
first, we can rearrange these

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:40.370
equations, which you know well,
to come up with the

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:43.080
rearranged equation, the
wavelength equals Planck's

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.870
constant times the speed of
light, and divided by e, and

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:49.090
this time our e is that crystal

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:51.750
field splitting energy.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:57.210
So we can put in these terms.
So we have Planck's constant

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:01.700
times the speed of light over
our octahedral field splitting

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.920
energy, oh, but then we have
some other terms here.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.970
Now one thing that you have to
pay attention to in this unit

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:09.930
is your units.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.510
So, splitting energies are often
given in kilojoules per

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:18.090
mole, whereas you often see
Planck's constant in joules,

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:20.870
so we want to make sure that we
convert one or the other,

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:22.880
and here it's set up
to convert the

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.160
kilojoules to joules.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:28.600
And also, we want our final
unit, we're talking about

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:32.340
wavelengths, in meters or
nanometers, so we need to get

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:35.630
rid of this mole term,
and we use Avagadro's

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.210
number to do that.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.970
So now we should be able to
cancel our units and get the

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:42.100
correct units.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:47.080
So we should be able to cancel
the seconds over here, and we

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.700
should also be able to go
in and cancel our moles.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.980
We should be able to cancel the
joules and the kilojoules

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:59.010
out, and that should leave us
just with this over here,

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.470
which is meters.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:02.690
So this is 7 .

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:06.540
0 0 times 10 to the
minus 7 meters.

00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.810
Does that make sense in terms
of a wavelength of light?

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:16.260
Because that would convert
to what nanometers?

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:18.850
700 nanometers.

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:22.260
So if you do something strange
and you forget Avagadro's

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.970
number, you're going to come
up with a very interesting

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:25.910
wavelength.

00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.900
So that's a good way to check to
make sure that you've done

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.250
the problem correctly.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:35.650
So, 700 nanometers, anyone
remember what light that is,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.020
what color that corresponds
to?

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.030
Red, so it's absorbing
red light.

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:43.930
All right, so now let's just do
the same thing for the low

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.700
spin system with the cyanide
ligand, and we're going to

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:55.160
plug in our 392 here, and
we get 305 over here.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:25:03.420
And so, that is a much shorter
wavelength of light.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.710
So again, light absorbed for the
compound with water, 700

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:13.080
nanometers, and the compound of
iron with cyanide, 305, and

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:18.580
so we're absorbing a red light
over with the water compound,

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:24.760
and sort of purple or violet
light is being absorbed in the

00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.480
cyanide complex.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.460
And we're talk in a minute about
the light that is being

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:32.460
transmitted, which is
complementary to the color of

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:35.220
the light absorbed.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.370
So by knowing something about
splitting energies, by knowing

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:42.170
something about the types of
ligands, then you can know

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:45.880
something about colors.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.500
So now, for another example,
we're going to look at the

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:55.890
different colors of two
chromium complexes.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:26:00.370
So first, what is the oxidation
number of chromium

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:06.680
in the water complex here?

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.470
What is it?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:12.760
And what about over here
with n h 3 ligands.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:14.850
Plus 3.

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:18.070
So, plus 3 and plus 3.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.660
And what is our d count?

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.900
You know where chromium
is, in what group?

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:24.710
Six.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.790
6 minus 3 is 3, so we
have a d 3 system.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.890
What does c n mean again?

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:37.360
Coordination number, so what
is that for both of these?

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:39.400
Six.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.590
So there's Six things
coordinated to the chromium,

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:48.310
and so we have, again,
an octahedral system.

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:55.960
And what type of ligand
is water?

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.990
Intermediate.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.310
And what about n h 3?

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:01.830
Strong.

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:06.600
So this is strong, and water
is and intermediate ligand,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.580
and certainly, it is
weaker than n h 3.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.220
So, we expect one system over
here for a strong ligand, and

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.480
then something that's weaker
than that strong ligand.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:26.580
All right, so here are two
diagrams, one with a big

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.820
splitting energy, and one with
a smaller splitting energy.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:34.640
Are the diagrams going to
look same or different?

00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.200
The same.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.370
Because we only have three
electrons, so they're going to

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.270
be the same.

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.720
In both cases, we put in the
three electrons in the lowest

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.760
orbitals, and then there's no
decision to be made, because

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.755
there isn't that fourth
electron, so we don't have to

00:27:50.755 --> 00:27:53.220
decide which place
to put this.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:56.490
So these diagrams are going to
look the same, and before when

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.660
we were doing this in this unit,
we said OK, we're done,

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.880
they look the same.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.450
But now, we realize that these
are really not the same

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.690
compounds and that they're
going to have different

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.920
properties, even though
their diagrams are

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.280
going to look the same.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.460
Because the energy that it's
going to take to excite an

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:17.540
electron here is much smaller
than over here, and that's

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:20.540
going to result in a different
wavelength of light being

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:23.240
absorbed in these two different
cases, which will

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:28.540
mean a different wavelength of
light being transmitted.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.370
So, again, here we have a weaker
field and here we have

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.730
a stronger field.

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.980
So again, we can go
through and think

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:40.770
about these two cases.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.760
So when we have a smaller term
here, that means a lower

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.940
energy -- this is a splitting
energy, and so we'll have a

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:49.610
lower frequency.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:54.060
When we have a larger case or
higher energy, we have a

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.950
higher frequency.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:02.000
Again, if you have a lower
frequency absorbed, we have a

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.370
longer wavelength absorbed, and
in this case, the higher

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:12.300
frequency translates into a
shorter wavelength absorbed.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:15.500
The color of the transmitted
light is complementary to the

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.940
color of the absorbed light.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.600
So now we can think about --

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.180
I always want to ask, when
do people learn about

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.520
complementary colors?

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:33.650
Is that 6th grade, earlier?

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:38.410
I don't really remember, but I
think it's pretty early on.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.080
And people always ask me, are
you going to have that on the

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.190
equation sheet, or do I have
to actually remember my

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.900
complementary colors?

00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.210
And I tell people that I will
put some version of this on,

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:58.480
so you don't have to review your
kindergarten notes for

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.400
this class, if that's
when you learned it.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.220
It's pretty early, I don't
know when it is exactly.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.950
So, the color of the light is
going to be complementary

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:14.090
about -- this is very
approximate.

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:19.190
So here, if the transmitted
light is shorter because we

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:24.000
have this weaker splitting, then
we are expecting we're

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.360
going to have this shorter
wavelength, the transmitted

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.080
light, and experimentally, if
you make this compound you'll

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.620
see it's violet.

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.080
In this other case, we have a
stronger field ligand, and so

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.850
you have a larger energy, higher
frequency absorbed,

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.780
shorter wavelength absorbed,
then you're going to have a

00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:44.740
longer wavelength from your
transmitted light.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:48.780
And that this compound, if you
make it, is actually yellow.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.990
So if we go back to our colors
for a minute, you see that

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.540
when you have the shorter
wavelength, we have a violet,

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.170
and that is a short
wavelength.

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:03.060
And in this case for the strong
field ligand, we are

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.510
going to have transmitted light
of a longer wavelength

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:07.030
and it's yellow.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.230
So it's the same oxidation state
of chromium, it's the

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.460
same -- it's an octahedral
complex, six ligands in both

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.590
cases, same octahedral crystal
field diagrams, but yet one

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.400
compound has a violet color,
and the other one

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:30.220
has a yellow color.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:35.250
All right, so one can also be
asked to calculate a crystal

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.100
field splitting energy in
kilojoules per mole, given the

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:41.030
appropriate information.

00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:45.070
So we've looked at when a
splitting energy is given, and

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:48.570
we've been asked to calculate
wavelength absorbed, you can

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.190
also be asked to go in
the other direction.

00:31:52.190 --> 00:31:55.670
And so here we have another
chromium complex to work with.

00:31:55.670 --> 00:31:57.990
And we're told that the
wavelength of the most

00:31:57.990 --> 00:32:04.660
intensely absorbed light is
740, and so what would you

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:10.170
predict the color
of this to be?

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:12.560
It would be greenish.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.230
So that would be what
you would predict.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.870
Again, chemistry is an
experimental science, but

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.350
based on having a complementary
color to the one

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:22.990
absorbed, that would
be a guess.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:32.000
All right, so we can actually
calculate the frequency of the

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.790
light absorbed.

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:38.060
So we were given the wavelength,
and use speed of

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.070
light, and plug in your
wavelength and you can come up

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:48.570
with a frequency, 4.05 times
10 to the 14 per second.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:51.340
Then we can calculate from
that the crystal field

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.490
splitting energy, and so we use
Planck's constant, and we

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.080
have our frequency, and
we calculate 2 .

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:02.460
6 8 times 10 to the
minus 19 joules.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:07.580
Am I done with the problem?

00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.110
What does the problem ask for?

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:15.470
It asks for it in kilojoules
per mole, and so, we're not

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:18.010
done, we need to convert
to kilojoules per mole.

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:20.680
And I'm making this point,
because often this is where

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:24.070
people lose points on the final
exam, and that's not

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.370
where you want to lose points.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.210
You want to lose them on a
really hard problem, not on

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:29.570
something like this.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:33.160
So, most of the time you're
asked for kilojoules per mole,

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.190
so make sure that if that's what
asked for, that's what

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:37.490
you provide.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:41.730
So here, we can just do the
conversion of units, and then

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.790
we're going to use Avagadro's
number to

00:33:43.790 --> 00:33:45.770
give us that per mole.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:49.880
And so, this translates into a
160 kilojoules per mole, which

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.840
you might recognize is more
similar to the other numbers

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.090
that you saw for octahedral
crystal

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:00.050
field splitting energy.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.990
All right.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:07.130
Sadly, there are some
coordination complexes that do

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.710
not have colors.

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:19.290
Why would that be?

00:34:19.290 --> 00:34:21.960
Why would something
not have a color?

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:32.050
It has d orbitals, it's
a transition metal.

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.390
So what would be true about
all of the d orbitals?

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:43.170
Yeah, so one example, is if
they're all full, and that is

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:46.200
the most common thing that we
see, so it's not possible to

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:51.500
have a d to d transition
in the visible range.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:54.140
So there are a number of
examples of metals who have

00:34:54.140 --> 00:34:56.590
this situation.

00:34:56.590 --> 00:35:01.960
Zinc and cadmium are two of the
most common that give you

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.210
problems in biological systems.
So why is this?

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:11.160
Well, that's because they're
over here in group twelve.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:15.470
But their most common oxidation
states are plus 2.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:21.300
So, if you have 12 minus 2 you
have a d 10 system, and that's

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:24.310
the case for both of
these systems here.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.080
And so all the d orbitals
are filled.

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:31.280
Now, zinc is a really important
metal in biological

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:37.620
systems, and because it has all
these d orbitals filled,

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:38.950
it doesn't have a color.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:43.670
And so it's very hard to tell
if an enzyme molecule has

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:47.100
zinc. And I think one of the
problems that you have on this

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.160
problem-set talks about how
zinc is important in a

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:54.700
biological system by altering
the p k a of a residue that

00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:56.140
coordinates to it.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:36:01.130
And that's often its job, and so
biochemists are often faced

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:03.820
with the problem of trying to
figure out if their protein

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:07.890
has zinc, but they have no color
of the protein, also

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:10.590
they might try to look
for a paramagnetic

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:12.460
or diamagnetic system.

00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:14.960
They're not -- you know if
they see a paramagnetic

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.980
system, they say oh, unpaired
electrons, we know we must

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:20.820
have metal involved, but
there's no sort of

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.120
spectroscopic probe for zinc.

00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.720
And so, often someone will
determine a crystal structure,

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.160
and it'll be a huge surprise
that there's zinc associated

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.760
with this protein.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.400
Do you think there's a lot of
proteins that use cadmium as

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.860
of part of their mechanism?

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.210
What do you know
about cadmium?

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.260
Yeah, cadmium is poisonous.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.560
Old barbecue grills were
sometimes, they used to coat

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:50.570
things with cadmium on
a barbecue grill.

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.060
Yeah, that was not very smart.

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:56.690
So, cadmium poisoning is a
problem, and people have been

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.010
trying to figure out the
mechanism of that, but again,

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.570
it's hard to study cadmium
because it has no

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:07.050
spectroscopic signal.

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:13.170
All right, so getting back now
to just kind of review over

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:16.640
what we've talked about
in terms of colors.

00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.120
So we have our weak field
ligands, again, you need to

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.790
memorize what they are.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:23.140
You have your intermediate field
ligands, which you need

00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:27.270
to memorize, and also your
strong field ligands.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:29.860
So these weak field ligands
are going to have a small

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:33.700
splitting energy, and that means
that in terms of how the

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.510
complex absorbs, low energy,
low frequency, long

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:40.780
wavelength, and that the color
transmitted will be

00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:41.950
complementary.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:48.180
And usually what this means is
that it'll be sort of in the

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:51.360
end of the spectra, so it's
often hard to say well, red

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.740
will definitely be green.

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.530
So it's not a perfect agreement,
but you can usually

00:37:57.530 --> 00:37:59.090
say well, it's probably
going to be in the

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.920
blue-violet or green end.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:05.540
So in sort of one part
of the spectra.

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.760
Strong field ligands, again,
have a huge splitting energy.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:11.200
So you're going to have big
energy, high frequency, short

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.930
wavelength, and so it's going
to transmit, then, in the

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:17.360
complementary, so it should
be in the yellow,

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.380
orange or red end.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.250
And you will be asked in some
of the problems, in again,

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:25.330
problem-set 9 due Wednesday,
and you should be able to

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:28.250
finish that up pretty quickly
tonight after this lecture,

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.980
and there are some
problems on this.

00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:37.200
So, for cobalt complexes, you
get pretty much the entire

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:39.270
range of colors.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:44.330
So I'm just going to end with
one more biological example.

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:49.910
And here are some pictures of
actual colors, and so this is

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.870
cobalt coordinated
to vitamin B12.

00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:57.570
So one ligand gives you this
brilliant red color, another

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:01.140
gives you an orange color, and
a third ligand gives you a

00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.300
pink color.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.910
So you can tell the oxidation
state of vitamin B12 by the

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.840
colors of the molecule.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.100
All right.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.890
Now you have all the information
to finish your

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:18.950
problem-set, and that's the
end of transition metals.

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:21.620
On Wednesday we start
kinetics.

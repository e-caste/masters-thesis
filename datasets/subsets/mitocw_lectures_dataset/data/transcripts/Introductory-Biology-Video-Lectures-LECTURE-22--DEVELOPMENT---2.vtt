00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.750
HAZEL SIVE: All
right, moving along,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.975
I want to talk about
three things today.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:48.340
The first is breaking
symmetry in the embryo,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.380
leading to the first
differences that then go on

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.060
to amplify into many differences
in a multicellular organism.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:05.120
And then I'm going to talk
about organic genesis and then

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.670
about morphogenesis.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.250
And we'll define these
terms as we go along.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.755
Let's start with this
question of breaking symmetry.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.260
And I'm going to
start by going back

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.390
to the last handout
of last lecture

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.740
that you should have looked at--

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.100
hm, I wonder if our AV
expert could do something

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.950
to the screen.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.320
I don't think it's the computer.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.520
I think it's the screens.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.780
Let's see if we can do this.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.790
The last handout I gave
you was a consideration

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.732
of how different parts of
the embryo become different.

00:01:57.732 --> 00:02:00.190
And I started off-- and you
might have this in front of you

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.690
still--

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.000
I started off with an
embryo, a fertilized egg,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.335
that's got some kind
of asymmetry to it.

00:02:08.335 --> 00:02:12.320
And I've called
it a determinant.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.770
And at the first
cell division, look,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.710
I've put that
determinant into one cell

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.020
and not the other cell.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.500
One cell and not the other cell.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.040
Now, let's say that
that determinant has

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.370
some effect on changing
the secreted factors--

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.350
oh, fantastic,
thank you very much.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.970
It's like magic-- that
determinant has an effect.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.090
And it actually elicits signals
to be secreted from the cell.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.010
Then look what happens
at the next stage,

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.760
at the four cell stage,
here is a cell that's

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.440
secreting a signal.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.850
And it's doing something to the
cell that receives the signal.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.900
It's making it brown.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.010
And that signal in turn
then elicits other signals.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.990
So the brown cells
start signaling

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.280
to the cell next door.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.810
And as cell division precedes,
you now get gray cell.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.840
And this is a
theoretical, but a real,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.760
demonstration of how the embryo
becomes different over time,

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.250
starting with an
initial asymmetry.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.550
That is then built
upon due to segregation

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.990
of localized factors and also
due to cell-cell signaling.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.420
And all of this comes
together to make

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.630
these different regions, which
I've cool territories, which

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.460
eventually will
go on to give rise

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.750
to different kinds of cells
or different groups of kinds

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.140
of cells.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.180
If you look in a real embryo--

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.729
this is a fruit fly
embryo, Drosophila embryo.

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.770
You don't have a handout.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.100
Just look on the screen.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.670
You can see the
sequential division.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.970
And you can see this by looking
at changes in gene expression

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:57.640
patterns.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.890
And it's really spectacular.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.320
This is a drawing.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.740
But you can actually
look at this

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.810
in terms of in
situ hybridization,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.090
that technique I
mentioned last time,

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.190
where one can look at
where RNAs or proteins,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.100
and in the case of in
situ hybridization,

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.610
it's RNA, where
RNAs are localized.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.459
And in the very
early embryo, there

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.810
is an asymmetry of
a protein called

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.930
bicoid, where there's more
on one side than the other.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.760
A little later,
after fertilization,

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.500
you start to see literally
these stripes of RNA

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.870
or protein across the embryo.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.080
And then the stripes of
different proteins and RNA

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.600
get narrower as the embryo is
divided up into its segments

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.440
and so on.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.460
And so what you see out of this
is the embryo being divided up

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.610
from one large territory
into smaller and smaller

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.720
territories.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.225
But the question is,
where does it all start?

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:06.210
And so the first asymmetry
has got something

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.770
to do with fertilization.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:27.130
It can either occur before,
at, or after fertilization,

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:36.010
where the haploid egg and
sperm fuse to become a zygote.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:41.930
And somewhere in this process,
this asymmetry develops.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.640
In the case of frogs,
the first asymmetries

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.591
are formed before fertilization,
and also in Drosophila, fruit

00:05:49.591 --> 00:05:50.090
flies.

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:58.820
In the case of
Caenorhabditis, also

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.430
known as the worm, asymmetry
forms at fertilization.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.840
And in the case of mammals,
like ourselves, the asymmetries

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.010
appear to form of
to fertilization.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.690
And these asymmetries
eventually build up

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.110
to give rise to a system
of positional coordinates,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.140
kind of like the lines
of latitude and longitude

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.280
on the globe.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:47.710
And these are called the axes,
which are positional values.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.020
And there are three of them.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.540
I'm just going to put the
initials on the board.

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:55.720
And then I'll show you a slide,
and you can get these later.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:07:01.360
They're called a
A/P, D/V, and L/R.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.450
And if you look on
the screen, you'll

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.230
see my diagram of a mouse,
the same in ourselves,

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.710
where there is this
A/P coordinate, which

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:16.420
stands for anteroposterior,
where antero is the head

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.950
and posterior is the tail, or
as far back as your body goes.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:25.870
Then there's dorsal which refers
to back and ventral, belly.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.330
And then there's left and right.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.290
And these values are
kind of like north,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.530
south, east, west,
and then degrees

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.570
on either side of the meridian.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.910
They help the embryo
figure out where

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.030
to put different organs
in different cell types.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.550
And I'm not going to dwell on
them in the interest of time,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.110
but there are a
whole sets of genes

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.890
that are involved in setting
up these coordinates.

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:54.890
The one thing that
I will dwell on more

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:57.050
is a specific
example of setting up

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:15.210
the first asymmetry
in Caenorhabditis,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:18.990
where this first asymmetry
is set up at fertilization.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.480
And the bottom line-- we'll
look on it on your hand out

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.620
in a moment--

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:33.419
is that the sperm entry and
particularly the centriole

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:42.010
brought in by the sperm
causes a massive rearrangement

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:46.750
of the cytoskeleton in
the egg or in the zygote.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.710
The cytoskeleton we mentioned
way back in Lecture 2.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.930
It is the system of actin,
filaments, and microtubule

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.440
tubules that give the
cell shape and allow it,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.890
as we'll discuss later
on, to move and to help

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:05.800
build the animal or the plant.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:15.050
So this the sperm entry causes
cytoskeletal re-arrangement.

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:29.730
And this particularly pertains
to actin and tubulin, where

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:36.620
the tubulin forms
microtubules and the actin

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.605
forms microfilaments.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.760
And with the cytoskeletal
re-arrangement,

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.240
a protein called Par
6, that is firmly

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:57.170
attached to the
cytoskeleton, is pulled

00:09:57.170 --> 00:10:02.200
to one side of the zygote,
leaving one side of the zygote

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.240
with lots of par-6 on
the other side with none.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.360
And at the first cell division,
one cell gets lots of Par 6,

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.920
and the other gets none.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.290
And that gives you
your first asymmetry

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.810
upon which the embryo
builds to give rise

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:19.850
to all its different
cell types and organs.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:25.480
So the cytoskeletal
re-arrangement pulls

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:31.708
the attached Par 6 protein--

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.960
and this is a
regulatory protein.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.695
It doesn't matter
exactly what it does--

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:54.060
to the future anterior
side of the embryo.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:57.900
And in doing so, it actually
sets up the anterior side

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.860
of the embryo.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:02.550
Let's look at your first
slide or your first handout.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.130
This is a diagram of
the early worm egg,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.260
actually the very
early worm zygote,

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.510
because here is the egg
nucleus, called a pronucleus.

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.200
It's haploid.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.370
The sperm pronucleus
has just entered.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.160
And the cytoskeleton I've
represented by this grid.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.050
And Par 6 protein is
represented by the red

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:31.910
that you can see on
the screen surrounding

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:36.170
the outside of the zygote.

00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:41.120
Here's the sperm entry, causing
cytoskeletal contraction.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.260
And with it, because par-6 is
attached to the cytoskeleton,

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.090
Par 6 is moved to
one side of the cell.

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:52.100
That's the most important thing.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:55.760
Later on, the first
cell division along this

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.630
dotted line here.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.040
And you can see that the
first cell, in the first cell

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.280
division, one of the cells
would get most of the Par 6

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.650
and the other cell
would get very little.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.360
This is a very
beautiful mechanism

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:13.020
that's been worked out
really beautifully in worms.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:19.190
Here's a movie that I
guess isn't going to work.

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.020
You know what, it
was working great

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.310
before I walked in this room.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.490
But it's not going to work.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:25.870
So I'm going to
post it as a movie.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.710
And you can go to the
URL and you can get it.

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.590
And you'll see what
this movie does

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:33.680
will show you fluorescently
labeled Par protein.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.350
It's actually a different
protein than Par 6.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.900
And you'll be able to
see it moving beautifully

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.350
to one side of the
embryo and not the other.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:56.410
Number 2, organogenesis.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.060
An organ, as I've
written on the screen,

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:17.570
is a functional unit
of many cell types

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:22.490
that are arranged
obligatorily in

00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:24.710
a three-dimensional
structure that allows

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.260
them to function together.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:32.900
So the problem we have here
is that an organ is many cell

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:46.940
types, arranged in
3-D, such that there

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:51.830
is a specific
functional outcome,

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:55.940
like the heart pumps blood,
the kidney filters blood,

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.280
the eyes see.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.360
All of these things require
both of these correct cell

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.670
types and 3-D organization.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.600
And just this sentence
or just this phrase

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:12.350
raises two questions.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:15.200
How do you get all the cell
types to the correct place?

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:34.200
And how are they put into
the correct structure?

00:14:56.180 --> 00:15:00.080
Let's phrase the problem
by looking at the kidney.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:05.690
The kidney is one of
the most complex organs.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.050
It does two things.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.400
It filters the blood and
gets waste products out

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.860
of the blood,
particularly products

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.810
of amino acid metabolism.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.830
And it also maintains
water balance.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.780
Both of those things
are crucial functions

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:25.220
of that kidney, which consists
of about 15 different cell

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.210
types, which are connected
into several types of tubes

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.010
that lead on fluidly
from one to the next.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.730
You have one type of
tube that does one thing.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:36.560
It's connected to
the next tube, which

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.220
does the next thing, connected
to the next tube and so on.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:42.020
The tubes are very long.

00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:44.120
They form a 3-D organization.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:46.760
And they form filtration
units, called nephrons.

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.890
Here are part of the nephrons.

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.860
And you just have to look at
this without any knowledge

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.080
to see that this is
a complex structure.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:01.120
This is a distant view, so
you can't see the cells here.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.450
Low magnification structure.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:05.460
This is a really complex organ.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.810
And it takes a moment's
thought to wonder how something

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.830
like this gets put together.

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.360
And, of course, this is not
only important for developments.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.160
It's important for thinking
about how you would replace

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.510
someone's kidney with
something that was artificial,

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.130
and not just using
donated organs.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.460
Could you build
something like a kidney

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.640
and use it in place
of donated organs?

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.960
So the question of organogenesis
is of huge importance

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.130
both to basic researches,
to physicians trying

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:41.100
to understand what goes
wrong when organs fail,

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.310
and to bioengineers who are
trying to build organs that

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:45.660
would replace human versions.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:51.510
Let's start by tackling
the first question.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:56.520
How do you put different cell
types in the correct place?

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.860
And there are three
possibilities, all of which

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.080
are used by the body.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.460
OK, so one, they can move there.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.500
There can be all these cell
types all over the body.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.490
And they can say, oh, OK,
we need to go move over here

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.630
to build a kidney.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.780
OK, it seems unlikely,
but in fact, it's true.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:40.240
And that process
would be migration,

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:43.090
where the cells come
from all over the place

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:44.800
to build the organ.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.645
The cells need to
know where to go.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:57.090
And that just pushes
the problem back one.

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:01.650
But the great example of
cell migration is the limb.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.500
Most of the cells in
your limbs and mine

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.800
did not come right from
where the limb grew.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.380
They migrated there
from the spinal cord.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.360
They migrated there
from the muscles

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.880
on the sides of the body.

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.360
And the blood vessels also
grew in from the cells

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:20.450
that were distant.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:28.030
So the limb puts it all
together by moving cells around.

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:30.480
How else could you get
cells to the right place?

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.710
See, it's not so easy.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.710
OK, so here's another one.

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:45.240
Well, you could in one place
tell a bunch of different cells

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.710
to form at the same time.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.080
You could have your
organ and say, all right,

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.790
we need cell types 1 to 10.

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:54.710
Form.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:55.780
Here's some signals.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.730
You will form in this one place.

00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.620
And in fact that happens.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:06.340
This is called
co-induction, where

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:17.040
many cell types or several
cell types form in one place,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.550
often because one signal can
act at different concentrations

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.010
to give rise to
different cell types.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.980
So many cell types
form in one place,

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:37.980
often due to a concentration
gradient of an inducer,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.505
of a signal.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:56.400
And the great example of this is
the spinal cord, and the nerves

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.260
in the spinal cord, which arise
by co-induction of actually

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.060
about two different inducers.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:10.580
And the third one is called
sequential induction.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:19.540
And this is how
the kidneys forms,

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:22.180
where the idea with
sequential induction

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.760
is that a cell type forms.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.780
And it says, OK, I need this
other cell type to work with.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.670
And it instructs
the cells around

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.680
to become another cell type.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.890
And those cells in turn might
instruct some cells around them

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.690
to become another cell type.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:39.370
And there's this
conversation going

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.870
on sequentially in the place
where the organ will form.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:56.590
So cell type 1
induces or signals

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:07.390
to type 2, which
induces type 3, etc.

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:12.730
And a great example
of this is the kidney,

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:17.470
where I will say it is still not
known how you build a kidney.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.970
Some of the steps
are understood.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.920
But there's no
organ where we can

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.080
say these are all the
steps that build the organ.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.160
It's incredibly complex.

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.460
Good.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:33.340
That's all I'm going to say
about organogenesis, to throw

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.860
out at your this
complex problem.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.920
And you can explore it
more in later courses.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.460
I am going to talk more, though,
about this question of 3D

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.150
structure.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:50.772
And that is the question
of morphogenesis.

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.740
Oranogenesis,
morphogenesis, you might

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:06.220
have heard of histogenesis,
which means building tissues.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.160
The genesis part
refers to building.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.700
That's what it means,
building of something.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:21.040
Morphogenesis, building a
three-dimensional structure,

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:31.570
or the generation of
form is what you'll see.

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:37.320
And what that really means
is building 3D structure.

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.880
And this relates
to organogenesis

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:49.400
because in organogenesis
one of the things that's

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.670
hidden on the board
above was the question

00:22:52.670 --> 00:23:01.453
of getting cells of an organ
into the correct 3D structure.

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:16.380
And, of course, this
question of 3D structure

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.930
is intuitively quite clear.

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.740
You can imagine a
human heart or having

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.260
some kind of animal's
heart in front of you.

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:27.210
It's an extraordinary structure.

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:29.930
It's actually a folded tube,
where the walls of the tube

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.780
have become very muscular.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.100
And the heart will pump
with great regularity.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:38.700
It's a controlled pump that can
speed up or slow down depending

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.320
on the how the animal is doing.

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.240
And that heart contains about
10 different kinds of cells.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:49.940
And you can imagine having
one in front of you.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:51.860
And you can imagine
my coming along

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.890
with some kind of
protease or calcium

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:58.010
free medium that will cause
the cells of the heart

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:02.490
to leave one
another, deconstruct

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:03.760
the structure of the heart.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.510
Now you've got a heart
that's not this pump looking

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:07.920
tube structure.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.840
It's a pile of cells.

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.552
The same cells that were in
the organ of the heart, but,

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:14.510
of course, they're not.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:16.110
They're just a pile of cells.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.950
They're all there.

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.780
They might all be alive.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.370
But they're not acting.

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:22.780
And that's really an
engineering problem,

00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.790
which is what
morphogenesis is all about.

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.390
And I want to just discuss
morphogenesis with you

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:33.180
because I think as a science
and engineering problem,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.100
it's really an extraordinary
one to think about.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.880
And it's extraordinary to think
about because really there's

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.550
only one building
material by which all

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.440
the structures of all organisms
are built. And that's cells.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.650
You can't find different
plastics or different metals

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.410
or different alloys
to build things with,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.420
it's just one building material.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:56.940
And it's really
amazing what life

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.130
has managed to do with cells.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:02.290
And that's what we'll explore
for the rest of the lecture.

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.540
So getting cells in organs
into the correct 3D structure.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:16.500
This is a great example of
3D structure, another one,

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.540
the lungs, which are about a
20-fold iteration of branching.

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.470
You start off with one
tube, the trachea, which

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.200
branches into the two bronchi.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.470
And those branch and they
branch and they branch.

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:33.900
It's about a 20-fold branching.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.020
And you end up with
many, many little tubes.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:39.850
In this rendition,
the ends of the tubes,

00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:42.660
which are sacs of cells,
have been taken away.

00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.870
But it's through these tubes
that oxygen moves or air moves.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:49.140
The oxygen is extracted
from the air, moves

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.090
into the bloodstream, and
then the waste air is exhaled.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.530
And the same thing starts again.

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:59.190
How do you build these lungs
with this branching arrangement

00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.774
of cells?

00:25:59.774 --> 00:26:01.440
And indeed, how do
you build the kidney?

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.910
You know, the problem
really phrases like this--

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:15.290
and if we had more time today,
I would sit and challenge you

00:26:15.290 --> 00:26:17.630
for five or 10 minutes
to go and think

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.800
about how you take a pile of
cells from the early embryo

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.660
and build that
structure, which could

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.150
be what it is or
could be something

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:28.450
that represents an organ.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.370
And while I'm moving
the boards, you

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:33.520
can think about how you
would take those cells

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.830
and turn them into
a 3D structure.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.571
And we'll see if we have
concordance in our thinking

00:26:38.571 --> 00:26:39.070
here.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.400
All right, so let's
turn this pile of cells

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.140
into a 3D structure.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.940
And let's pull
out some processes

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:02.570
that we can talk about in lay
terms, no scientific terms.

00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:04.370
And then I'll put
some molecular labels

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.880
on that will help you understand
what we're talking about.

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.450
And process indeed has two s's.

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.990
There we go.

00:27:13.990 --> 00:27:16.160
Well, one thing you
know if you look

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:19.040
at my pile of cells
in the 3D structure

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.160
is that those cells
have been sorted out.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:23.810
I've put them in
different colors,

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:26.240
in groups of different colors.

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.530
So I'm going to write
that the cells sort out.

00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:36.470
And there is a molecular
basis for that.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.370
It's called homotypic
adhesion, where

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:41.960
like cells tend to
bind to one another,

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.655
so that they can
function as a unit.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:57.240
But, of course, in order to
get the cells to sort out,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.130
they actually had to move.

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:02.260
Yes?

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.015
Say, yes.

00:28:04.015 --> 00:28:04.515
OK.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.550
And they moved because
of their cytoskeleton,

00:28:11.550 --> 00:28:14.550
which was rearranging
and changing and allowing

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:15.760
them to do so.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.390
So the molecular
basis for movement

00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:26.430
is cytoskeletal change
or rearrangement.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:28.680
What else is on my list?

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.300
You know, the pile of
cells that I've got there,

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.380
it's meant to look
loose, like it

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.240
would be a pile of
cells that would just

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.840
spread out all over the
table if I dumped it out.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.650
But the organ that I drew
is meant to look tight.

00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:45.990
Those cells are stuck together.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.100
And that is one of the
things that happens.

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.295
The cells stick together.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.130
And they do so because of
cellular junctions, which

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.920
are particular
collections of proteins

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:03.940
that cause cells
to stick together,

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.920
often in a really
waterproof kind of a way.

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.300
The cells change shape.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:12.120
They've gone from balls
to triangles to columns.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:22.135
And that is also driven
by cytoskeletal changes.

00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.500
And then the two lost
processes on my list

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:35.360
I'm not going to
explore more because we

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.180
had a whole lecture on them.

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.350
Cells can divide,
and they can die.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.210
You can get rid of
the excess cells.

00:29:41.210 --> 00:29:43.040
And you can generate
more cells to build

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:52.130
your organ by the processes of
cell division and cell death.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:54.440
And we've had those
before, so we aren't going

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.850
to talk about those again.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:30:03.380
But I will just put up cell
cycle control and apoptosis.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:08.640
Good.

00:30:14.592 --> 00:30:17.324
I-- yes?

00:30:17.324 --> 00:30:21.752
STUDENT: What about the
[INAUDIBLE] the organ,

00:30:21.752 --> 00:30:26.690
[INAUDIBLE]

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.890
HAZEL SIVE: Ah, great question.

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.970
The question is, how do
the cells know where to go?

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.340
How do they know that
the dark blue ones

00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:37.670
are on the left and the columna
brown ones are on the right?

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:38.990
It's a great question.

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.070
And you know, if
we had more time,

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.620
I think that the
thing would come up

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.621
with was the notion
of some kind of plan,

00:30:45.621 --> 00:30:47.870
that there are instructions
somewhere that are telling

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.460
the cells where to go.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.990
What are those instructions?

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:53.660
Well, they're
somehow in the genes.

00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:55.910
But it's more than that.

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.680
I don't think that
there is actually

00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:00.170
a set of instructions
in the genes

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:03.930
that says build this organ or
the kidney or anything else.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:08.030
There's a set of
instructions that unfolds

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.110
as the organ is being built.

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:12.740
And I think what's in the
genes are the first steps

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:14.390
of those instructions.

00:31:14.390 --> 00:31:17.180
And then they kind
of unfold bit by bit.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.250
So the outcome is the organ.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:21.770
And there is some
kind of a plan.

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:25.760
But we don't have any evidence
that there's any kind of plan

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:27.980
actually written in the genes.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.730
OK, it's a fascinating question.

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:30.230
Good.

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.700
Back to the toolkit.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.900
This toolkit to build
all organs of cells.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.210
But cells, you
know, are not just

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:57.000
equivalent to bricks one shape.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.500
They can actually change.

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.910
So it's not quite fair
that I said to you

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:02.460
this is different
than engineering

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:04.440
where you've only
got one material.

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.850
It's true you've only
got one material.

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.860
But it can change.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.130
It can change its shape,
and it can move around.

00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.640
And the two kinds of things
you really need to know

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:21.935
are involved are single
cells and cell sheets.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.905
And single cells and cell sheets
are interchangeable from one

00:32:29.905 --> 00:32:30.405
another.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:35.875
Single cells are also
called mesenchyme.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.320
[INAUDIBLE] [? they ?] are.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.190
Single cell.

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:52.920
And groups of mesenchymal
cells can associate

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.215
to become sheets of cells.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.590
And these sheets are
called epithelia,

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:06.480
or singular is epithelium.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:13.570
Single cells migrate.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:14.095
They move.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.600
And there are no junctions
between the cells that

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:23.930
allows them to be single cells.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.650
Epithelia, cell sheets,
can change shape.

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.890
But they don't move
around that much.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:38.570
So they change shape as sheets.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:47.115
And what that allows them to do
is to form coverings and tubes.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.110
I should say one
very important thing.

00:33:58.110 --> 00:34:00.330
The process is reversible.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:04.050
If you look at the next handout,
there is more information

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:05.414
that you'll get.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:14.530
Here's your epithelial sheet.

00:34:14.530 --> 00:34:16.320
It's joined together
by junctions.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.020
Let me make a note
that there are

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:21.690
junctions between the cells.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:25.093
That's what sticks the
cells together is a sheet.

00:34:25.093 --> 00:34:26.469
Here are the junctions.

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:28.020
There are two kind.

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.420
There's top ones
called tight junctions,

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.014
which are waterproof junctions.

00:34:32.014 --> 00:34:33.389
And then they
these are the ones,

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:35.535
called adhesion junctions,
which aren't so strong.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:44.100
Both epithelia and mesenchyme
sit on the extracellular

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:48.900
matrix, or ECM, which
we mentioned way back,

00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:53.340
glycoproteins that are involved
in giving support and also

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:56.800
carrying signaling
molecules to cells.

00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.840
And here is the conversion of
the sheet to the single cells,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.480
and the single cells
back to the sheet.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.950
This process of epithelial
mesenchymal transition

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.920
or mesenchymal
epithelial transition

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.260
is very important in cancer.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:15.480
Tumors usually start
off as epithelia.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:18.030
The And they become metastatic.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:20.140
They disperse
throughout the body

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.290
when they become mesenchymal,
or when they give off

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:25.230
single cells, which can
migrate and establish

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.430
the tumor somewhere else.

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:30.120
So this process is crucial
both in building organs

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.700
and in cancer biology.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.410
The other thing that
you should note--

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:36.510
we're not going to
dwell on it very much--

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:40.500
is that the cells in a
sheet have got orientation.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.590
They've got an axis of
asymmetry along one side,

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:47.730
call the apical basal axis
and an axis of asymmetry

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:50.550
along the top, called
the planar axis.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.900
But we're not going to
dwell on that very much.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:36:03.950
All right, let's look
what epithelial sheets

00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:06.390
do in a little more detail.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:18.420
So epithelial sheets or
epithelial form waterproof

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:20.070
coverings, as I've noted.

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:30.210
And through cell shape changes,
they'll also bend a cell sheet

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.710
or turn it into a tube.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.460
And they do this by a series
of stereotypical changes,

00:36:48.460 --> 00:37:01.220
where cells can change shape,
so that kind of a square cell

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:09.410
can become an elongated cell in
one direction or a cell that's

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:12.320
elongated in a
different direction.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:19.230
Or it can become a
wedge shaped cell.

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:21.720
And the names of these
different kinds of cells

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.130
don't really matter.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.330
And they're not sequential.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:28.080
So this cell can
become this cell.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:34.240
It can also become this wedge
shaped cell in one fell swoop.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:37.500
But if you think about it,
these changes in cell shape

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:38.950
can do lots of things.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.462
For example, if cells
get long and thin,

00:37:42.462 --> 00:37:45.630
then the cell sheet
will lengthen.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.390
If cells get wedge shaped,
and you've got a whole bunch

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.240
of them getting wedge shaped--
you can draw this out--

00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:53.820
you'll actually
bend the cell sheet.

00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:54.450
Draw it out.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.721
Put a whole bunch of wedge
shaped cells next to one

00:37:56.721 --> 00:37:57.220
another.

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.180
And you'll see there's no
way you can get a flat sheet.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.400
The cell sheet bends.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.500
And that is one of
the things which

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.630
drives building the
structure of organs.

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.860
There are a lot of different
ways to make tubes.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.970
I've diagrammed them
on the next few slides.

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:21.220
You don't have these.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.280
Cell sheets can roll
up to form a tube.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:27.670
Mesenchymal cells can
condense, can come together,

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.580
to form a tube.

00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.810
And here's a really
extraordinary one.

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:33.880
Single cells can form tubes.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.300
Tiny, single cells with
a 10 micron diameter

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:39.960
can roll up on their
cell themselves

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.250
or actually hollow
out their middles

00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:44.050
to become tiny, tiny tubes.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.070
What about single cells?

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.380
Single cells move.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.540
And this allows
things to sort out

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:02.720
and cells to get to
where they need to go.

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:04.970
But we're also going
to use this property

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:07.790
to understand the
molecular principles that

00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:09.590
underlies cell shape change.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.100
And that you should know.

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:20.220
Let's make a note
that single cells move

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:33.520
and that this allows cells to
sort and tissues and organs

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.180
to form.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.615
And then what I'm going to tell
you over the next few slides

00:39:40.615 --> 00:39:44.920
and on your handouts is that
all of the movement and all

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:48.130
of these shape changes
that I drew on the board

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:52.330
have got to do with changing
the cytoskeleton of the cell.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:55.090
But what I'll tell
you is that it's

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:58.450
about locally changing
the cytoskeleton,

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:01.300
where you have to stop
viewing the cell as something

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.540
huge, where independent
things can happen

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.610
in different parts of the cell.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.270
And those independent
changes in the structure,

00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:13.150
in the skeleton of the
cell will get the cell

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:19.880
to become long or squat
or wedge shaped or moved.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:30.800
So shape and movement of
both sheets and single cells

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.050
is controlled by changing
the cytoskeleton.

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:53.620
But it's done so locally, which
means in one part of the cell.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:03.010
And a most important change
that occurs as the cytoskeleton

00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.400
changes or with cytoskeletal
changes or is cytoskeletal

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:16.130
change is a polymerization
of actin from G-actin,

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:26.120
which is unpolymerized,
to F-actin--

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:28.610
and this is reversible--

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:33.530
which is polymerized,
non-covalently.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:39.590
And this F-actin
will stretch the cell

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.900
and help the cell to move.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.200
And let's explore
that in this movie

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.330
and in the rest
of your handouts.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:51.530
This is a movie of a
cell, where the actin has

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:54.650
been labeled fluorescently.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:57.470
And what you can see
as the cell is moving

00:41:57.470 --> 00:42:01.080
are these little
filaments of bright green.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:04.050
Those are the
polymerized F-actin.

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:07.620
And you can see if you just
focus on one, over the course

00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:10.920
of minutes, it goes away.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.960
And new ones form.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:15.960
And the new ones are
forming in the direction

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.330
that the cell is moving.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.850
And this movie really
illustrates the principles

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:26.760
underlying how the
cytoskeleton is controlled.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:28.410
Let's draw something
on the board

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:30.600
or let's write a few
things on the board

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:33.330
and then look at your
last two handouts.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:37.120
And what you'll understand is
that the principles governing

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.890
actin polymerization are really
the same for both single cells

00:42:41.890 --> 00:42:44.450
and for cell sheets.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:59.710
The idea here is that the
extracellular matrix, the ECM,

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:16.245
connects to the plasma membrane
via receptors on the plasma

00:43:16.245 --> 00:43:16.745
membrane.

00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:26.150
When ligands bind
these receptors,

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:27.710
you know what happens now.

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.150
Signal transduction
is activated.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:37.880
So the ligands plus
the receptors--

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:46.690
and there are many
different signaling pathways

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:49.270
that can be involved--

00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:53.170
go and activate a
cascade of things,

00:43:53.170 --> 00:44:10.070
which involve kinases, a
signal cascade via kinases

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:12.980
and via special GTPase.

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:18.095
Remember Ras was a GTPase,
but this one is called Rho.

00:44:26.770 --> 00:44:33.540
And Rho GPTase it's
critical in telling G-actin

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:36.920
to polymerize and form F-actin.

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:41.710
And so out of this
the Rho GPTase

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:47.510
tells G-actin to form F actin.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:50.370
And with that,
various things happen.

00:44:50.370 --> 00:44:57.440
So let's look at
your last handouts.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.250
Here's the cell migrating.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:02.590
And the thing that
I want you to see

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:05.990
is that in the
direction of migration,

00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:10.660
there are receptors that
are bound to ligands.

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.030
Signal transduction
has occurred.

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:15.360
I've diagrammed it down here.

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:17.620
And F-actin, these
little filaments,

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:22.060
have formed in the direction
in which the cell is moving.

00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.110
And where the cell is
detaching so that the cell can

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.720
move forwards-- you have to
lift up your foot in order

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:29.500
to move forward.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.480
It's the same thing
with the cell--

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:35.110
where the cell is moving
forward, they're no ligands.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.720
And there's no F-actin.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:43.120
That principle is
crucial also in changing

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:44.410
cell shape and sheets.

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.420
It's a little more complicated.

00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:53.650
But, again, there are receptors
that interact with Rho GPTases,

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.560
change the cytoskeleton
and cell sheets

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.540
and change the shape
of the cell sheets.

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:02.050
And this is really the
molecular underpinning

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:07.210
that will get those single cells
to form tubes and bench sheets

00:46:07.210 --> 00:46:10.480
and all of the materials that
are needed to build organs.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.660
And we'll stop there.

JOHN ESSIGMANN: We're
now at storyboard 19,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
panel B. In the last
lecture, I mentioned

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.320
that we're going to be looking
at several special cases

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.750
with regard to the
metabolism of fatty acids.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.710
The first special case concerns
the metabolism of fatty acids

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.200
that already
contain double bond.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.510
You remember from last
time that a double bond

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.420
with a trans configuration
forms naturally

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.550
during beta oxidation.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.160
In the special case we're
going to look at now,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.340
the double bond has
a Cis configuration.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.170
Fatty acids with
a Cis-double bond

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.150
typically come from membranes.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.280
One of the ways
nature plasticizes

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.620
our membranes is to
make them more fluid

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.740
by putting in Cis-double
bonds that bend the fatty acid

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.470
molecule and reduce stacking.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.870
Ultimately, this
reduction in stacking

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.930
results in a lowering of the
overall melting temperature

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.460
of that part of the membrane.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.910
The example I'm going to
use is oleyl Coenzyme A.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.140
This fatty acyl Coenzyme A
comes from Oleic acid, which

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.070
also has the shorthand
notation (18:1) delta 9.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.220
That is, there is a double
bond nine carbons in

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.960
from the carboxylate.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.360
The reaction I've
shown in panel B

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.970
goes through three
rounds of beta oxidation

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.410
resulting in a Cis delta
three enoyl Coenzyme A.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.620
The enzyme oleyl
Coenzyme A isomerase

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.980
will then remove the acidic
hydrogen from the 2 carbon,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.530
repositioning the
double bond, and then

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.770
putting that double bond into
trans configuration, which

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.700
is now amenable to further
hydration and beta oxidation.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.330
Overall, the isomerase has
taken the Cis-double bond

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.470
and repositioned it to make it
a trans double bond that is now

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.420
able to undergo
further oxidation

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.615
by the classical beta
oxidation pathway.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.620
Let's turn now to panel
C of storyboard 19.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.390
The second special
case that I'd like

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.730
to deal with concerns the
way that we metabolize

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.490
fatty acids that have
an uneven, that is odd,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.620
number of carbons in them.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.000
One example would be the C15
fatty acid Pentadecanoic acid,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.730
which we get from milk fat.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.660
In this case, six rounds of
beta oxidation will release six

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.400
acetyl Coenzyme A's.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.640
But note that we're left
with a 3 carbon residue,

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.540
or carboxylic acid called
propionyl Coenzyme A.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.210
Nature doesn't like to
throw anything away.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.490
It's going to take this
three-carbon molecule,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.100
propionyl CoA,
that doesn't easily

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.700
integrate into any other
biochemical pathways.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.980
Nature's going to
add a carbon to it,

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.470
hence making it into a
four-carbon molecule.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.410
As we'll see, that
four-carbon molecule

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.080
will integrate seamlessly
into the TCA cycle.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.390
The conversion of the
three-carbon compound

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.460
into a four-carbon
compound begins

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.010
with the enzyme propionyl
Coenzyme A carboxylase.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.010
In a few minutes, we'll
look at the fine details

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.630
of how this enzyme works.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.720
For now, however, what it
does is use the cofactor

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.440
biotin in order to introduce
a carbon dioxide, or CO2,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.560
into the 2 carbon of the
propionyl Coenzyme A.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.920
The 2 carbon is the middle
carbon of the propionyl group.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.140
This is now a branched
molecule that's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.230
called methylmalonyl Coenzyme A.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.150
Next, the molecule is subjected
to a carbon chain rearrangement

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.600
that takes the branched
molecule and linearizes

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.720
it to form succinyl Coenzyme A.
Succinyl Coenzyme A will then

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.540
integrate directly
into the TCA cycle

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:52.010
to allow its carbons to be
metabolized fully to CO2.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.680
In summary, nature
puts a CO2 into

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.300
the three-carbon propionyl CoA,
forming a four-carbon branch

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.380
structure.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.060
Then, in an amazing
rearrangement

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.190
that we'll look at later,
the branched molecule

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.040
is made linear, forming
succinyl CoA, which

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.360
is a TCA cycle intermediate.

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.230
So the otherwise useless C-3
molecule, propionyl Coenzyme A

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.360
is converted to
something of value.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.870
Lastly, let's turn
to panel D. I'm

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.630
going to deal more with the
details of this reaction

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.960
in a few minutes.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.480
But for now, what
I'd like to say

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.790
is that there are many
sources of propionyl CoA,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.030
not just from odd chain
fatty acids in the diet.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.180
Secondly, the introduction of
succinate into the TCA cycle

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.460
results in an increase
in the amount of carbon

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.200
going through the TCA cycle.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.270
That is, this is truly
an anapleurotic reaction.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.940
This is a reaction
that we can use

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.180
to increase the overall
rate of carbon metabolism

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.750
in the TCA cycle.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.300
We're now going to
turn to storyboard 20.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.970
Let's look at panel
A. In the last lecture

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.210
on fatty acid metabolism, I
talked about propionyl CoA

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.740
carboxylase, which
uses biotin to add

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.830
a CO2 moiety to the middle
carbon of propionyl Coenzyme

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.050
A. This lecture is a chemical
interlude, in which we're going

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.620
to look at propionyl
CoA carboxylase

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.390
and several other carboxylases
that are used in biochemistry.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.060
One of these is acetate
CoA carboxylase.

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.400
This carboxylase
puts the CO2 group

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.180
onto acetyl CoA to make malonyl
CoA, which is the precursor

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.000
to fatty acids during the fatty
acid biosynthesis reactions.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.450
Let's also look at
panel B. We're also

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.300
going to be looking at
pyruvate carboxylase, which

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.710
adds a carbonyl group to the
pyruvic acid molecule in order

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.450
to make oxaloacetate.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.030
This is one of the
anaplerotic enzymes that

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.760
can increase the quantity of
carbon going through the TCA

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.450
cycle.

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.820
That is, it facilitates
anapleurosis

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.340
in the biological system.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.270
Let's now look at
storyboard 21, panel A. The

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.580
carboxylases all
use carbon dioxide

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.070
as their carboxylating reagent.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.950
CO2 itself is not
very soluble in water,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.620
so cells use carbonic
anhydrase in order

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.440
to hydrate it to
form carbonic acid.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.840
The biotin carboxylase
subunit will then

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.030
phosphorylate the
carbonic acid in order

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:13.310
to form a chemically-reactive
intermediate

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.150
known as carbonyl phosphate
or carboxy phosphate.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.600
Now, carbon dioxide by virtue
of its structure-- that is,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.870
a carbon with two
electronegative oxygens pulling

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.530
on it--

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.650
is pre-activated for
nucleophilic attack.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.900
And as I said a few
minutes ago, CO2

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.290
is just not present at
high enough concentration

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.690
in the cell for it to be
able to add effectively

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.190
to nucleophiles.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.280
A nucleophile such as the
amide nitrogen of biotin

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.300
would be an example.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.440
So what the cell does
is use ATP to make

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.890
carbonyl phosphate, which is
a very water-soluble molecule.

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.940
It's a very efficient delivery
vehicle for carbon dioxide

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:55.490
into the active
site of an enzyme.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.610
Now let's look at panel
B. The biotin carboxylase

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.980
subunit of pyruvate
carboxylase has

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.790
a biotin cofactor at the end
of a 14-Angstrom-long swinging

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.810
arm.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.670
This subunit of
the enzyme breaks

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:11.490
the bicarbonate phosphate bond
and releases carbon dioxide

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.080
in high concentration
in the active site.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.200
Biotin on the swinging arm then
attacks the high concentration

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.130
of carbon dioxide in order
to become N-carboxy biotin

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.120
as shown in this figure.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.130
The N-carboxy biotin takes
advantage of its swinging arm

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:31.010
to move away from the active
site at which it acquired

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.980
the CO2 and then
move to a second site

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.610
on the enzyme at which the arm
releases carbon dioxide, once

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.890
again at high concentration.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:43.220
But this time CO2 is released
at high concentration

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.400
in the vicinity of the
substrate, pyruvate.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.090
Pyruvate, in order to be a good
nucleophile to acquire the CO2,

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.920
probably exists as shown in the
figure as the pyruvate enolate.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.470
Let me review panel
B at this point.

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.600
Overall, this
reaction has resulted

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.240
in putting a
carboxylic acid residue

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.370
on the 3-carbon of pyruvate.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.340
And this results in the
formation of oxaloacetate.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.890
Thus, activation of
pyruvate carboxylase

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.770
will result in taking
a molecule of pyruvate

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.110
and converting it
to oxaloacetate.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.840
This anaplerotic reaction
gives the ability

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.880
to increase the volume
of carbon that's

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.430
cycling in the TCA
cycle, thus allowing

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:26.420
you to be able to increase their
overall rate of respiration.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.700
And as I've said several
times in the past,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.910
oxaloacetate is present at
rather limiting concentrations

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.780
within the mitochondrial matrix.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:37.820
So this is a very useful
biochemical reaction.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.580
At this point, let's
move on to story board 22

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:44.360
and look at panel A. Let me loop
back now and give some bigger

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.690
picture points with regard
to carboxylase chemistry.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.520
Pyruvate carboxylase and the
other enzymes of this class

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:52.310
have two active sites.

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.370
One of them is the biotin
carboxylase domain,

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:58.340
where a biotin moiety covalently
attached to the enzyme

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.930
will acquire CO2.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:03.080
Let's call this step 1
of the reaction scheme.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.480
Once the biotin on
the swinging arm

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.510
has been N-carboxylated
as in step 1,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.730
the N-carboxy biotin moves to
site 2, where the substrate is.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:17.390
The second site is the
biotin transferase domain.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.680
In the example I just used,
the substrate was pyruvate.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.460
But it just as easily
could have been

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.070
another quote unquote
"carboxylation substrate,"

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.100
for example propionyl CoA.

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.430
In the case of pyruvate,
as we just saw,

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.550
it's the pyruvate enolate that
becomes carboxylated in site 2

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.820
in order to form the final
product oxaloacetate.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:41.360
This carboxylation of substrate
is the second and final step

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.680
of the overall reaction.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.150
Take a look at panel B. Now let
me give you a second example

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:49.160
of carboxylase chemistry.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.140
In this case, our
substrate will acetyl

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.160
Coenzyme A. We're going to use
the same chemistry we described

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.440
a minute ago for
pyruvate, but in this case

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.650
it is another carboxylate--
acetyl CoA carboxylate--

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.450
that picks up the CO2 residue at
its carboxy transferase domain.

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:10.010
In step 2, which occurs in the
carboxy transferase domain,

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:14.030
the substrate acetyl CoA
picks up CO2 on its 2-carbon--

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.070
the one distal to the
Coenzyme A group--

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.690
to form the three-carbon
product malonyl Coenzyme A.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.000
We'll see later that the
carbon dioxide that's

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.420
been added to acetyl
CoA to form malonyl CoA

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.310
is an excellent leaving group.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.690
Malonyl CoA is the fundamental
precursor to all fatty acids

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.660
through the fatty acid
biosynthesis pathway.

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.270
Again, we'll see the details
of this reaction scheme

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.490
later, but keep in
mind now that this

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.510
is a biotin-requiring reaction,
just as the one we just looked

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.630
at with pyruvate carboxylase.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.660
Let's look now a panel
C. My last example

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.260
of carboxylase chemistry
will be propionyl

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.370
Coenzyme A carboxylase.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.370
I mentioned earlier that the
breakdown of odd chain number

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.980
fatty acids results
in the formation

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.270
of a 3-carbon linear fatty
acid called propionyl CoA.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:07.130
I also said that
nature doesn't want

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.060
to waste any of the carbons.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.160
What she is going to do is
add a carbon dioxide or a CO2

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.520
to the central carbon
of the propionyl group.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.360
As well as fatty acids with
odd numbers of carbons,

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.290
certain amino acids--

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:26.180
such as isoleucine, methionine,
valine, and threonine,

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.260
for example--

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.500
also break down to
form propionyl CoA.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.390
So what I'm going to
do now is describe

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:34.310
a fairly general
method of metabolism

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.890
that involves restructuring
of the carbon chain

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.530
subsequent to the
carboxylase reaction.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:41.280
In this overall
reaction, a carboxylase

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.730
is going to carboxylate
the middle carbon

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.260
of the propionyl group.

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.930
Then, following the
carboxylase reaction,

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.300
there's going to be a
skeletal rearrangement

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.160
to form succinyl CoA, which
will then enter the TCA cycle.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.340
As shown in the reaction
scheme, propionyl Coenzyme A

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.810
carboxylase carboxylates
propionyl CoA to form a very

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:08.480
specific stereoisomer,
(S)-methylmalonyl Coenzyme A.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.030
Please note the position
of the carbonyl group

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.010
that's highlighted in blue.

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:15.290
This carboxylate
in blue is attached

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:19.070
to a methylene carbon that has
an inverted triangle on top

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.770
of it.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:23.000
Epimerization about the
carbon with the triangle

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.930
results in the blue
carboxylate pointed down

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.200
the way I've drawn it.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.460
The resulting epimer is
(R)-methylmalonyl Coenzyme A.

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.580
In the (R)-methylmalonyl
Coenzyme A molecule,

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:41.110
I put a little lasso around the
hydrogen atom at the methylene

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.760
moiety of the molecule.

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.250
I've also lassoed
an electron in some

00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:48.780
of the atoms of the
Coenzyme A moiety.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:52.810
A vitamin B12-dependent enzyme
called methylmalonyl Coenzyme

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:57.580
A mutase, which contains an
adenosylcobalamin functional

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:00.850
group, will now act
on this molecule.

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.340
In this enzyme, a
cobalt residue is

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:07.030
going to enable the formation
of an adenosyl radical.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.610
Look at the book for
the detailed mechanism.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.600
But for now, it's sufficient to
say that this adenosyl radical

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:17.110
is going to facilitate the
homolytic scission of the bond

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:20.570
between the carbon and hydrogen
of the (R)-methylmalonyl

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.160
Coenzyme A. That is, you're
going to get a free radical

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.150
formed at the carbon that has
the small blue o written over

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.140
it.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.260
That molecule will
lose its hydrogen atom.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.020
That hydrogen atom will
migrate to the carbon that

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.680
has the small blue triangle.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.320
Coordinately, the carbon
with the small box

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.730
that's part of the
Coenzyme A carbonyl group

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.310
will migrate to the
position originally occupied

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:47.380
by the hydrogen
atom on the carbon

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:49.180
with the small o over it.

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:53.230
The skeletal re-arrangement
is shown here in panel C,

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.240
and it results in
a linearization

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.690
of the original
methylmalonyl Coenzyme A.

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:00.790
If we redraw it as
in the box, you'll

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:05.230
see that you form succinyl
Coenzyme A. Succinyl Coenzyme

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.500
A will then feed directly
into the TCA cycle.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.300
This is an anaplerotic reaction.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:13.180
That is, it will increase
the volume of carbon that's

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.300
rotating in the TCA cycle.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.540
Overall, in the way of a review,
the three-carbon compound

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:24.410
propionyl Coenzyme A, by way
of the carboxylase reaction,

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:27.445
is converted to a four-carbon
branched molecule called

00:14:27.445 --> 00:14:31.850
(S)-methylmalonyl Coenzyme
A. It's epimerization forms

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.760
the (R)-methylmalonyl
Coenzyme A,

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.220
which is the substrate
for a third enzyme,

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:42.390
methylmalonyl Coenzyme A
mutase, a vitamin B12 enzyme.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.920
This enzyme catalyzes a free
radical-mediated rearrangement

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.150
of the side change.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.070
Specifically, one
hydrogen and one

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:53.090
Coenzyme A functionality
switch positions.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:55.640
This rearrangement
linearizes the molecule

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.940
forming, ultimately,
succinyl Coenzyme A, which

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.960
then flows into the TCA cycle.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.160
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.280
What I'd like to do today is
to continue where we left off

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.510
last time in talking about this
risk-reward trade-off, which

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.170
ultimately will allow us
to be able to figure out

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.310
how to calculate the proper
discount rate for any project

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.480
under the sun.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.220
Now, where we left off last time
was this equation and the one

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.240
after it.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.910
This equation we
actually derived.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.950
I showed you how to
get this equation

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.140
from this particular bullet
and the tangency line.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.690
And today I am going to
give you names for them.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.680
The bullet, as we've said
before, is the frontier.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.450
It's the set of
frontier portfolios.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.910
And the upper arc
of that bullet is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.740
called the efficient frontier.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.590
Now the tangency line
has a special name too.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.140
That tangency line is known
as the capital market line

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.220
because it represents what
all efficient capital markets

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.160
should represent in terms
of risk-reward trade-off.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.100
So if you are an efficient
portfolio manager,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.190
you want to be on that line.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.650
OK?

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.340
So the capital market
line, the equation

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.020
for that tangency
line, is given by this.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.030
The expected rate of return
is equal to the risk-free rate

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.090
plus some kind of risk
premium, where the risk premium

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.800
is given by a multiple of
the market's risk premium,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.310
or the market excess return.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.250
And the multiple
is simply the ratio

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.420
of the riskiness of
your efficient portfolio

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.880
relative to the
market portfolio,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.940
or the tangency portfolio.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.650
If it's twice as
risky, you're going

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.040
to get twice the risk premium.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.680
If it's half as
risky, you're going

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.639
to get half the risk premium.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.460
And we said last
time that, while this

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.110
is helpful and interesting
and even possibly useful,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.970
it's going to be of
limited applicability

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.020
because not everything is
an efficient portfolio.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.480
What we mean by an
efficient portfolio,

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.410
the intuition for what an
efficient portfolio is,

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.470
is a portfolio where
you cannot do better.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.580
By cannot do better, I mean you
can't get less risk for that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.070
same level of return, or you
can't get more expected return

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.990
for that same level of risk.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.550
That's what we mean by
an efficient portfolio.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.030
It's the best you can do.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.440
Now, most investments are,
frankly, not efficient.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.040
If you pick an arbitrary
stock, like IBM, that's

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.510
not an efficient portfolio.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.100
It doesn't mean it's no good.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.970
It doesn't mean you
don't want to hold it.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.820
But it means that
you would never

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.900
want to hold just IBM because if
you mixed IBM with other stuff,

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.820
you can always do better.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.070
By do better, again
I'm going to reiterate,

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.160
I mean you can have
higher expected return

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.630
for the same level of risk or
lower risk for the same level

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.540
of expected return.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.970
That's what I mean by do better.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.450
So you would never want
to hold IBM just by itself

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.890
because you can
do better, right?

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.780
You can do better in getting
up to that Northwest quadrant

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.150
from the IBM point.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.130
But even though IBM
is not efficient,

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.200
you might still want to hold it.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.910
And more importantly,
you might still

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.760
want to know what the
appropriate discount

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.090
rate is for companies
that are like IBM.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.800
That's what we're
going to do next.

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.660
Where I left off last time was
not the capital market line,

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.130
but this equation, which I did
not derive, but which I argued

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.640
comes from the
equilibrium argument

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.990
that Bill Sharpe
made 50 years ago.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.440
And this really
relies on the fact

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.079
that, if markets
are in equilibrium,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.660
there is a relationship
between risk

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.980
and expected return for
all securities, not just

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.900
efficient portfolios.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.610
But any arbitrary security
has to satisfy this equation

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.090
if supply equals demand,
if there's an equilibrium.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.580
If everybody holds the
tangency portfolio,

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.590
and the tangency
portfolio therefore

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.860
is the market portfolio,
in that situation,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.660
this equation has to hold.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.120
So where we left off was to
try to interpret this equation.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.510
This equation is almost
identical to the capital market

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.034
line.

00:04:54.034 --> 00:04:55.200
There's only one difference.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.910
The only difference is that
the multiplier, the thing that

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.520
multiplies the
market risk premium,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.785
is not sigma p over sigma m.

00:05:03.785 --> 00:05:05.420
It is beta.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.620
And beta, we said, was the
ratio of the covariance

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.550
of an asset with
the market divided

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.800
by the variance of the market.

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.920
It is a measure of that
particular asset's riskiness.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.720
It's not variance anymore,
or standard deviation,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.990
it's something else.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.140
And so I want to spend
this class talking

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.880
about what that something else
is and why it makes sense.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.910
First of all, let's make sure
we understand the equation.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.920
I want to do a
few special cases,

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.070
and then I'm going to take
apart this notion of beta

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.400
as being the right measure
of risk in all circumstances.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.480
So the first thing I want to
do is to look at some examples.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.262
Let's take an example where
the beta is equal to 1.

00:05:48.262 --> 00:05:51.260
If the beta is equal to
1, what that's saying

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.320
is that the covariance between
the asset and the market

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.570
divided by the
variance of the market,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.970
that number is equal to 1.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.460
If that's the case,
then it turns out

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.660
that the expected rate of return
of this asset with a beta of 1

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.457
is going to be just equal
to the market risk premium.

00:06:11.457 --> 00:06:13.790
Or the expected return is
equal to the market's expected

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.410
rate of return.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.807
When beta is equal to
1, the Rf's cancel out,

00:06:17.807 --> 00:06:19.640
and the expected rate
of return of the asset

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.570
is equal to the expected
rate of return on the market.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.520
Now, what about if the
beta is equal to 0?

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.590
If the beta is equal to 0, then
you get the risk-free rate.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.010
It's important to realize
that if the beta of an asset

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:35.620
is equal to 0, it doesn't
mean that the asset has

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.670
no volatility.

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.490
In the past, when
we've looked at mixing

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.360
the risk-free asset,
T-bills, with the market,

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.990
we know that when the
risk-free asset is included,

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.130
you get that straight line.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:54.150
And it's because the risk-free
asset has no covariance.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.200
It has no risk at all.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.050
But now, with an asset
that has a beta of 0,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.850
you're getting the
risk-free return,

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.990
even though an asset
with a beta of 0

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.430
still may have some volatility.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.040
It's not the risk-free asset.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.960
It's any asset with a 0 beta.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.290
The third observation
that I want to make

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.230
is when a beta is negative.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.770
With the beta that's negative,
the expected rate of return

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.350
is actually less than
the risk-free rate.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:30.260
Now that's really odd.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.130
I've got an asset that is risky.

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:37.810
But just because it
has a negative beta,

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.360
the expected rate of return is
less than the risk-free rate.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.740
That means that you are willing
to take a lower expected rate

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.920
of return than the risk-free
rate for an asset that

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.757
has this weird property
of negative beta.

00:07:52.757 --> 00:07:55.090
And the question I want to
answer today is, why is that?

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.240
Why is it the case
that you might

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:01.540
be willing to take such
a low rate of return?

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.420
And actually, if the
beta is negative enough,

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.280
if this beta is
negative enough, it

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:10.560
could be the case that the
expected rate of return

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.060
is negative.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:16.920
In other words, you might
be willing to pay somebody

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.300
for the privilege of
bearing that risk.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.190
That seems completely
counterintuitive.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.760
Why would you be willing
to pay to take risk?

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.610
You should be getting
paid to take risk, right?

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.690
That's the standard
hypothesis that we

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.700
come into the
financial markets with.

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.695
So yeah, Leah?

00:08:38.695 --> 00:08:40.514
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:40.514 --> 00:08:41.514
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:08:41.514 --> 00:08:43.789
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:44.810
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.070
That's exactly the intuition
for all three of these cases.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.240
It turns out that the
beta, remember, has

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:56.400
this covariance term in there.

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.900
And it is going to
turn out that, if you

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.910
can find an asset that
is negatively correlated

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:09.050
to the tangency portfolio,
that is going to be

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.080
of tremendous value to you.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.580
It's very, very valuable.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.310
Now, OK.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.280
Let me try to explain
the logic behind it.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.420
And we're going to
do a few examples.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:23.270
So let's go through the basic
logic of what's going on.

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:26.810
The tangency portfolio
plays a central role

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:28.760
in that everybody
in the world is

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.280
going to want to have
a portfolio that's

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.020
a combination of
the risk-free asset

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.360
and the tangency portfolio.

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.490
That's fact number one.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:44.720
Fact number two, the tangency
portfolio is a portfolio that

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:50.300
has the aggregate measure
of the total amount of risk

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:55.140
in the economy that cannot be
diversified beyond that point.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:59.360
In other words, in
order to get lower risk

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.730
than this particular
portfolio, you

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:06.540
have to decrease your
expected rate of return.

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.040
There's no way to get lower
risk and keep that same level

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:10.940
of expected return.

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:11.856
You can't go this way.

00:10:11.856 --> 00:10:13.660
You have to go down this line.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.480
OK?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:19.610
So if you're going to
hold a portfolio of purely

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.970
risky securities,
then basically this

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.220
is the best that you can do.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:27.380
This is the best
trade-off that you can

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:31.140
get in terms of risk-reward.

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.210
So right away you know
that this market portfolio

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:37.850
plays a very special role.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:44.630
It is really the representation
of the aggregate risk

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.680
in the stock market.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.600
And that's why it can serve as
a kind of a benchmark for what

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.042
the stock market is doing.

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:54.000
We're going to come back
to that benchmark idea

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.590
in a few minutes.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:11:00.890
So, if you have a security
that is very highly

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.740
correlated to that
market return,

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:05.660
then that's not going
to help you in terms

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.690
of your own diversification.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:11.930
If, on the other hand, you have
a security that is negatively

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:14.510
correlated with that
market portfolio,

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.290
that's going to help you a lot.

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.080
And if it's going
to help you a lot,

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.929
you're willing to pay for it.

00:11:21.929 --> 00:11:24.220
When you're willing to pay
for it, what does that mean?

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.370
You drive the price today high.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.230
And therefore, the
expected rate of return,

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.360
which is the return between
today and next period, that

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.690
becomes lower.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:41.470
So an asset that
helps you hedge what

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:45.550
is essentially unhedgedgeable,
in other words, the market

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:49.504
portfolio, that can
benefit you a great deal.

00:11:49.504 --> 00:11:50.920
As a result, it's
going to be very

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.740
hard to find negative
beta securities or assets.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.470
But in any case, this
relationship really

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:04.240
tells you that, given a
particular covariance,

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.210
you can measure the
expected rate of return

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.250
that you ought to be getting.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:11.200
And this relationship
is so important

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.590
that we give it a separate name.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:16.780
It's called the security market
line, not the capital market

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:19.000
line, but the
security market line

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.290
because this applies to
every single security

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.960
in your entire universe.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960
Yeah, Dennis?

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:27.210
AUDIENCE: You say it's
hard to find something

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.085
with a negative beta.

00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:30.082
But when you short
something, does

00:12:30.082 --> 00:12:31.790
that mean you're
getting a negative beta?

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.090
ANDREW LO: It is.

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.120
You do.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.250
But the problem with
shorting something

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.410
where you get a
negative beta, you also

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.470
get a negative expected
rate of return typically.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.560
So what you want to
have is an asset that's

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.630
got a positive beta--
or negative beta,

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.550
but a positive expected
rate of return.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.500
That's what's very rare.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.870
But you can manufacture a
negative beta security very

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.480
easily by just shorting it.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.460
The problem is that
when you short a stock,

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.710
you're going to also get a
very negative expected rate

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:00.364
of return.

00:13:00.364 --> 00:13:01.780
And that doesn't
help you in terms

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.190
of producing an attractive
investment opportunity.

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:07.660
Ken, question?

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:12.160
AUDIENCE: So, what's an example
of a negative beta security?

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.550
ANDREW LO: Well, it's
very hard to come by.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.540
But the closest thing that
exists in markets today

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:26.770
is stocks that are involved in
gold production, gold mining

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:27.970
stocks.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.620
That has a beta of around 0,
but sometimes it's negative.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:32.620
Sometimes it's positive.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:34.150
But it's small.

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.510
So that's an example, but
that's about the only example

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.330
that we can come up
with in the data that

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.520
looks slightly negative.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:47.920
By and large, most of the betas
in the data sets are positive.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.130
And they're actually
clustered around 1.

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:57.521
So the typical beta is in the
neighborhood of 0.5 to 1.5.

00:13:57.521 --> 00:13:58.020
All right.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.350
Now, before we start
looking at the data--

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.225
I'm going to show you
some data in a minute--

00:14:01.225 --> 00:14:05.930
I want to take the security
market line and apply it.

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.130
So the security market
line I did not derive.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:09.550
I want to make that clear.

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.966
And for those of you who are
interested in the derivation,

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:14.200
you can take a look at the
appendix in the Brealey,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.950
Meyers, and Allen.

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:16.720
They provide the derivation.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.600
It's a little bit messy,
but with a little bit

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.230
of matrix algebra you
can work through it.

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:26.720
But the implications
are extremely important,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.390
so I want all of you
to know how to use it.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:32.050
So it may look pretty
simple, but I'll

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.110
show you a few applications that
you might not have thought of.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:41.970
For example, suppose this is
true for every single security.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.880
Well, if it's true for
every single security,

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.980
it turns out that this works
for portfolios as well.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.650
And let me show you why.

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.510
Suppose you've got
a portfolio that's

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.150
a weighted average
of the returns

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:57.680
for the individual
components securities.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.960
Then if I calculate
the covariance

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.920
between the portfolio return
and the tangency portfolio,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.110
or the market, the
covariance is going

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.590
to look like this,
which is actually

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.340
just going to look
like a weighted average

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.800
of the covariances.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.060
This is a mathematical identity,
from here down to here.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:22.360
And therefore, when
I divide both sides

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.170
by the variance of the market,
I get something pretty neat,

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:29.800
which is that the
beta of my portfolio--

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.050
where beta is defined
as the covariance

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:36.430
between the portfolio
and the market divided

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.190
by the variance-- the
beta of the portfolio

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:41.710
is just equal to the
weighted average of the betas

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.440
of my component securities.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.340
That's really neat
because what that says

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.910
is that, when I want to measure
the risk of a collection

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:54.510
of securities, as long
as I know the betas

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:58.350
of each individual
security, I can

00:15:58.350 --> 00:16:00.810
calculate a weighted
average of those betas.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:03.800
And that is the beta
of my portfolio.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.200
So if you think of beta
as a measure of risk,

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.570
this measure of risk
is actually linear,

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:17.330
unlike volatility,
which is not linear.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:21.140
The variance of a
portfolio is not simply

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.020
equal to the sum of
the variances weighted

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.370
by their portfolio weights.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.650
It's that complicated
expression where

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.500
you're adding up all of
those cross products as well.

00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.370
So we get an enormous
simplification

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.960
with the security market line.

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.890
It says that we can measure
the risk of a portfolio using

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:41.630
this concept called beta.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.090
And beta happens to
be linear in the sense

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.610
that, when you take
a weighted average,

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.590
the beta is equal to
the weighted average

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.160
of the individual asset betas.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.910
So therefore, if you
know that the betas are

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.660
going to be a weighted
average, then, in fact,

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.020
the expected rate of
return on the portfolio

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:05.210
now is equal to
the risk-free rate

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:12.470
plus this weighted average beta
times the market risk premium.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:13.800
Do you see the power of this?

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:17.730
This now allows you to
analyze the expected return

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:21.210
on anything, any
collection of assets.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.940
If you know what the betas are
for the individual components,

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.939
you know what the betas
are for the whole thing.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:32.560
So now you can calculate the
appropriate rate of return

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:35.260
for virtually anything.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.400
And this is not just
limited to stocks.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.650
You can apply this to projects.

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:41.320
For example, if you
want to know what

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:44.620
the expected rate of return
is on an oil drilling project,

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.720
well, measure the beta of oil
drilling stocks, use that beta,

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.670
and that will be
appropriate discount

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:55.260
rate for that particular
oil drilling project.

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.260
It's a really remarkable result.

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.740
So we have an expression for
the required rate of return,

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.560
opportunity cost of capital,
risk-adjusted discount rate,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.130
for all the various different
kind of examples and cases

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.220
that we looked at up until now.

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:14.980
And the last point I want
to make about this equation

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.640
is, how do you actually
take it out for a spin?

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.680
How do you estimate the
expected rate of return

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.250
on the market and
the risk-free rate?

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.520
Well, that comes from the data.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.440
That comes from the marketplace.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.720
We observe it in
the marketplace.

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.870
And we can actually see it.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:31.480
OK.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.240
So let's do some examples, just
to make sure that we all get

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.790
this and know how to apply it.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.880
Using returns from
1990 to 2001, we

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.690
estimate that Microsoft's beta
during that period of time

00:18:43.690 --> 00:18:46.180
is 1.49.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.090
And if you do the same
thing for Gillette,

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.930
you get that Gillette's
beta is 0.81.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:57.430
Now, let's not even look
at the next set of numbers

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:00.790
for a moment, and just talk
about those two numbers, 1.49

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:01.780
and 0.81.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:03.310
Does that make sense to you?

00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:05.240
Let's think about
what that's saying.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.820
1.49 says that the
covariance between Microsoft

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.510
and the market
portfolio is actually

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:20.210
a lot higher than the
variance of the market itself.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:24.210
So let me ask you to
think about whether or not

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.820
adding Microsoft
to your portfolio

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.760
is going to make it less
risky or more risky.

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.790
And here's how I want
you to think about it.

00:19:32.790 --> 00:19:35.550
Remember what we said
about diversification.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.920
When you hold a
collection of securities,

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.322
what matters more, the
variances or the covariances?

00:19:41.322 --> 00:19:42.352
AUDIENCE: Covariances.

00:19:42.352 --> 00:19:43.060
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:47.590
Why are the covariances
more important?

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:51.700
What's a quick and dirty way
of arguing that the covariances

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.362
matter more?

00:19:53.362 --> 00:19:55.290
AUDIENCE: Because there
are n squared minus n.

00:19:55.290 --> 00:19:55.750
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.550
There are a heck of a
lot more covariances

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.591
than there are variances.

00:19:58.591 --> 00:20:01.040
You only got n variances
to worry about,

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.030
but you got n squared
minus n covariances.

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:07.150
And if they all line up
in the same direction,

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:10.570
you get the subprime
crisis problem, right?

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:13.630
So covariances matter
more than variances.

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:17.980
Well, if that's the case,
then when we look at a stock

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.810
and think about bringing
it into our portfolio,

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:23.080
we want to ask
the question, what

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:29.070
is it doing in terms of adding
or subtracting covariances

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.690
to our portfolio?

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.850
And one way to
measure whether or not

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:36.600
it's adding or subtracting
is to ask the question, what

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:42.870
is the covariance between
Microsoft and my stock

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:43.800
holdings?

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.170
Now what are your
stock holdings?

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.750
If everybody is a
rational investor--

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.020
by rational I mean
you like return

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:53.700
and you don't like risk--

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:56.550
then you know you're going to
be holding the risk-free rate

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.690
and the market portfolio.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:00.396
You're going to be on
that capital market line.

00:21:00.396 --> 00:21:01.770
So if you're a
rational investor,

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.565
the only stock holding you
have is that mutual fund,

00:21:04.565 --> 00:21:07.230
m, the tangency portfolio.

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.269
So therefore, the most
important thing in your mind

00:21:10.269 --> 00:21:12.060
is, when you think
about buying a new stock

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.880
and putting into your
portfolio, is this

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.520
going to be highly correlated
with my market portfolio?

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.530
Well, that's what beta measures.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:27.180
Beta is a relative measure that
says, OK, the total variance

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.390
that you're holding in
risky securities, that's

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:30.750
sigma m squared.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:35.070
That's the variance of
the market portfolio.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:39.200
How does Microsoft
compare to that

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.230
in terms of what
it will contribute,

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:45.260
in terms of its covariance
with your holding?

00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:47.039
So you're holding
one mutual fund,

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.830
and you're thinking
about adding Microsoft.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:50.750
The only covariance that
you should care about

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.700
is the covariance
between Microsoft

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:54.810
and what you're holding.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.380
Well, that's what beta measures.

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:58.570
If the number is greater
than 1, what it's saying

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:01.750
is that, when you bring
Microsoft into your portfolio,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.480
you're going to be
increasing the variance

00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.470
because the covariance,
which is what we care about,

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:12.580
is greater than the variance
of what you're holding.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.970
If, on the other hand,
the beta is less than 1,

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.120
then, presumably,
that's helping you

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.260
because that's lowering the
variance relative to what

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.280
you're holding.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.550
But helping or
hurting, that only

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.340
can be answered
directly if you explain

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:34.130
what you're getting in terms
of the expected rate of return.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:37.540
So looking at beta by
itself is not enough.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.880
Beta is a measure of risk.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.860
It measures this
covariance divided

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:45.280
by the variance, or
covariance per unit

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.732
variance in the marketplace.

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.940
But you want to know what
the expected rate of return

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:49.440
is as well.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.070
That's what the security
market line gives you.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.570
OK.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.490
Now let's get back
to the example.

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.180
Microsoft is a lot more
risky than the market.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.120
It's about 49% more risky
according to this measure.

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.120
On the other hand,
Gillette is actually

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.950
less risky than the market.

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:09.050
Now do you guys buy that?

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:10.935
Does that pass the smell test?

00:23:10.935 --> 00:23:11.810
Does that make sense?

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.180
Why?

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.125
What's the intuition for that?

00:23:17.125 --> 00:23:17.625
Courtney?

00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.958
AUDIENCE: Well, people don't
necessarily need computers.

00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:23.970
And the technology is variable,
but Gillette sells razor

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:26.949
products and deodorant, which
is kind of a staple in a lot

00:23:26.949 --> 00:23:27.490
of people's--

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.281
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:28.880
That's right.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:34.080
If you make the argument that,
from 1990 to 2001, if there

00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.660
are economic downturns,
what's the first

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.840
to go, razorblades or Windows?

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.800
Thankfully Windows.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.390
Nowadays, I don't know the
answer to that actually.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:49.470
Because nowadays, we depend
so much on the internet,

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.210
that actually it
could be different.

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:52.680
So I haven't updated
this analysis

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.940
to see what the beta
is from 2001 to 2008,

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.170
but it could be different.

00:23:59.170 --> 00:24:00.900
So now we may have
unshaven geeks

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.090
that, you know,
during downturns--

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.770
and maybe it's flipped around.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.592
Eduard?

00:24:06.592 --> 00:24:08.300
AUDIENCE: Could you
give us an intuition?

00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:11.040
Because beta allows
us to compute

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:15.890
the appropriate return
for a certain risk.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:16.840
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.010
AUDIENCE: But what
is the intuition of,

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.147
how far away am I from
the efficiency portfolio?

00:24:23.147 --> 00:24:28.380
So, how bad is this portfolio
compared to the efficient one?

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.450
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:31.401
So, that's a good question.

00:24:31.401 --> 00:24:33.650
Let me go back to this
equation and take a look at it,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.020
and try to provide even
more intuition for this

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.490
before we go on.

00:24:37.490 --> 00:24:39.800
So the idea behind
this equation is

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.200
that it tells you that
this is the rate of return

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:46.570
that you should have if
you have a certain beta.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.130
Now you can actually measure
the deviation from that

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.050
very simply by
asking the question.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.066
For a portfolio manager
or an investment project

00:24:55.066 --> 00:24:56.940
that yields an expected
rate of return that's

00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.220
different from this,
that difference

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:03.260
is actually what we call alpha.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:05.550
And alpha could be
positive or negative.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:09.890
So when you say, how far
away are you from efficiency?

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.487
This gives you a direct measure
of how far away you are.

00:25:12.487 --> 00:25:14.570
It's basically the difference
between the expected

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.760
rate of return you
have versus what

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:20.900
you're supposed to have given
the beta of the security.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.740
But let me add one
more thing to that,

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:28.010
which is that beta is a measure
of a particular kind of risk

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.520
that a particular security has.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.310
And the kind of risk,
as I said before,

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:36.410
is this covariance
between the rate

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:41.240
of return on a particular
asset and the rate of return

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.190
on the market portfolio.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:46.760
This kind of risk is
not the total risk

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:48.770
of a particular security.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:52.990
In fact, it is called
the systematic risk.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.730
The systematic
risk is the portion

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.790
of the risk that is related
to the market portfolio.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:03.470
So how far away you are
from efficiency really

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:08.660
depends upon how much
risk you have that is not

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:11.270
necessarily systematic risk.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.504
Now, I don't expect you
to understand all of it

00:26:13.504 --> 00:26:15.920
yet because I need to develop
a little bit more machinery.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:17.720
But I'm going to get
back to that intuition

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.190
in just a few minutes, OK?

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.060
So I'm going to
give you a better

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.490
answer to your question than
what I just did because I'll

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:25.220
explain the difference
between systematic risk

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.790
and idiosyncratic risk.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.780
And I think then it'll make
this completely transparent.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:31.650
So give me another 15 minutes.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:32.180
Yeah?

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:34.820
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that gold stocks

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:36.496
can reduce the volatility.

00:26:36.496 --> 00:26:37.339
They may have--

00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:38.630
ANDREW LO: Historically it has.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:40.880
So there are some
currencies that

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.250
are indexed to gold prices.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.730
So let's say you're company x.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:48.480
If you are listed in the Dow
Jones versus this country,

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.930
whose currency is
indexed to gold,

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.080
do you expect the company
that's listed in the gold index

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.407
currency to have a lower beta?

00:26:57.407 --> 00:26:58.490
ANDREW LO: Well, it could.

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:00.140
But on the other
hand, the question

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:02.900
is, what are they doing to
try to hedge that currency

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.990
exposure?

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.530
In other words, if they end up
hedging all of that exposure,

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:09.260
then it doesn't
matter anymore, right?

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.700
So it depends.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:15.740
But the idea is that, if it
has exposure to a 0 beta asset,

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:18.770
then you will find that the
ultimate fluctuations are

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:21.830
going to have less correlation
to the market portfolio.

00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:22.760
Slomi?

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.620
AUDIENCE: Maybe Microsoft
has a bigger beta

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:28.370
because during this
period, the 10 years,

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.410
Microsoft was a [? growth ?]
company, and [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.819
So this is the reason
why it has a bigger beta.

00:27:35.819 --> 00:27:37.360
ANDREW LO: You know,
that's possible.

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.700
But remember that when
we estimate the beta,

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.370
we're estimating it
using monthly returns.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.050
And so we're measuring
the covariance

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.570
on a month-to-month
basis, not just the trend.

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.240
We're measuring fluctuations
around that trend.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:53.710
So the trend alone won't
necessarily explain all of it.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:56.980
It has to also be the
fluctuations are actually

00:27:56.980 --> 00:28:01.570
going both up and down,
higher than the variability

00:28:01.570 --> 00:28:04.540
of the market portfolio.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.100
Let me continue on
with the example.

00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:06.810
And we're going to come back.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:08.435
I'm going to show
how to estimate this,

00:28:08.435 --> 00:28:10.570
and then you'll develop
more intuition from it.

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:14.170
So this makes sense from
the smell test in the sense

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.226
that Microsoft, at least
during that period of time,

00:28:17.226 --> 00:28:19.600
was not necessarily something
that you would expect would

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.610
do well in good times and bad.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:25.000
But something like razor
blades and shaving cream

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.650
we need to use regardless.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:31.020
So that sort of tells us that
these betas look about right.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:31.600
OK.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.030
If you agree with
the betas, then it

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.460
turns out that we can
actually calculate

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.070
the required rate of return
for each of these two stocks.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:43.820
So if you assume that
the risk-free rate is 5%,

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.170
which is what it was
about in that period--

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.520
not today obviously, but back
in that period, so about 5%.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:53.560
And if, historically,
the risk premium,

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.930
as I told you last
time, is about 6%,

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.810
then when you do the
calculations using the security

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.570
market line, you get
a very sharp answer

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.480
to the question, what are the
appropriate discount rates

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.940
or costs of capital for
these two companies?

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:11.560
The answer, for Gillette, it's
about 9.86%, for Microsoft,

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.620
13.94%.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:18.329
So now if you're sitting
in these companies

00:29:18.329 --> 00:29:19.870
and you're asking
the question, we're

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.450
going to expand our operations,
but in order to do that,

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:26.800
we have to do an NPV calculation
to see whether it's worthwhile.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.937
We have to compute the expected
net present value of expansion.

00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:32.770
And in order to do that,
we've got estimates

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:36.040
of what our cash flows are
going to be for our expansion,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.559
but we don't know what
the cost of capital is.

00:29:38.559 --> 00:29:39.850
Well here's the answer for you.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.000
You've actually got hard
numbers to plug in to your NPV

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
calculations now.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.375
Now, there are a bunch of
assumptions that we've made.

00:29:49.375 --> 00:29:51.250
So we're going to have
to go back and justify

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:55.810
those assumptions each and every
time you use this technology.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.400
It's not physics.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.110
This is not mathematics.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.930
You're applying a set of
theories and approximations

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.952
to a much, much more
complex reality.

00:30:03.952 --> 00:30:05.410
Every time you
apply it, you've got

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:08.800
to go back and ask the
question, does it make sense?

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.510
Do these assumptions hold?

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.380
And if so, great,
go ahead and use it.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:15.430
If not, you've got to
go back and rederive

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.470
some of these analytics.

00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:21.220
OK, so the security
market line is now

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.230
a line that describes
the expected return,

00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:27.880
or required rate of return,
on an asset or a project

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.180
as a function of the riskiness,
where the riskiness is now

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:33.640
measured by beta, not by sigma.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.550
It's not variance or
standard deviation

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:42.510
that measures the appropriate
risk for most projects.

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:45.390
Most projects, the way
you measure their risk

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.900
is not by sigma.

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.180
It turns out that the way
you measure their risk,

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:54.410
for the purposes of calculating
the required rate of return,

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:58.010
you measure it by beta.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.240
OK?

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.970
That's a very deep insight.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.580
It changes the way
we think about risk

00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:05.900
and expected rate of return.

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.175
It's not to say that risk,
in terms of volatility,

00:31:09.175 --> 00:31:09.800
doesn't matter.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.000
Of course it does.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.460
That is the basis of
this entire framework.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.400
We started out by saying
that people don't like sigma,

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.350
and they do like mu.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.400
They don't like variants.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.320
They do like expected
rate of return.

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:22.850
That still holds.

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:26.900
But in doing so, when we derive
all of these implications, what

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.680
we find is that,
as an investor, you

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:34.970
don't get rewarded for taking
larger and larger amounts

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:38.000
of volatility necessarily.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.260
You do get rewarded for taking
larger and larger amounts

00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.700
of beta.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.200
That's the sense in which beta
is a better measure of risk.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.010
For the purposes of computing
the required rate of return,

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:54.980
beta is the right
measurement, not sigma.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.120
The only cases where sigma is
the right measure of risk--

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:03.620
when I say right, I mean where
increases in sigma must imply

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.020
increases in the
required rate of return--

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.580
is when?

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.990
When is sigma the
right measure of risk

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:16.920
for the purposes of computing
the required rate of return?

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.620
For what kind of
securities or portfolios?

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:22.962
Yeah?

00:32:22.962 --> 00:32:24.670
AUDIENCE: Is it for
efficient portfolios?

00:32:24.670 --> 00:32:25.461
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:32:25.461 --> 00:32:28.000
For efficient portfolios only.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.130
Efficient portfolios meaning
these guys, meaning these guys.

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:37.600
Anything on this line, then
sigma is the right measure.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:44.700
Sigma p over sigma m, that is
the right measure for any kind

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.640
of portfolio that is efficient.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.760
But we know that the
typical security,

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:54.650
the typical project, the typical
division, is not efficient.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.870
Efficient, again,
meaning you can get the--

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:00.660
you can't get any better
expected rate of return

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:04.320
for the same risk, or you can't
get a lower amount of risk

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.460
for the same expected
rate of return.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.740
So for all of the inefficient
securities, portfolios,

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.770
or projects, you've got
to use this relationship,

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.690
and this relationship tells
you beta is what matters,

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:17.700
not sigma.

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.000
Sigma is not the same as
beta, except if you happen

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.910
to be an efficient portfolio.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:25.654
OK.

00:33:25.654 --> 00:33:27.070
Question-- do you
have a question?

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.569
No?

00:33:27.569 --> 00:33:28.520
OK.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.820
All right.

00:33:29.820 --> 00:33:34.470
So here's an example of the
security market line at work.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:37.530
And the slope of this
security market line

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:40.050
is, of course, the expected
rate of return on the market

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.640
minus the risk-free rate.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.160
And the idea behind the
security market line

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:48.480
is that, no matter
what your beta is,

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.790
you've got a required
rate of return that's

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.740
determined by this slope.

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:56.670
And now, to answer Eduard's
question about deviations

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.610
and how far away you
are from efficiency

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:04.320
if you deviate from this line,
then the vertical distance

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:10.699
is the alpha of your portfolio
or project or investment

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:12.260
opportunity.

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.920
If markets are working
exactly the way they should,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.600
then you're on this line.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.900
You're always on this line.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:23.800
And if you're Warren Buffett,
you're off of this line.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.449
You've got a very
large, positive alpha.

00:34:26.449 --> 00:34:29.650
So if you've got skill, if
you can forecast markets,

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:32.449
then you will do
better than this.

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.650
But what this framework tells
you is that even if you cannot

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:38.230
forecast markets, even if
you don't know what's going

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:41.900
to happen next year
to stock prices,

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:47.980
you should still do as well as
what this line suggests that

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:48.980
you can do.

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:49.480
OK?

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:54.489
On average, this line should
be achievable by everybody

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:58.190
that understands the
basics of portfolio theory.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:03.290
Now, as I said, the
performance evaluation approach

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:05.720
to using the
security market line

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:07.760
is just a measure of
the vertical distances.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:11.100
And it can lead to some
interesting results.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:14.480
For example, here
are three managers.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.900
All three of these managers have
a 15% expected rate of return.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.130
But they have different betas.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.900
And so the question
is, if you had

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.680
money to put into
these managers,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.240
which would you choose?

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.010
Well, clearly you
would choose manager A

00:35:34.010 --> 00:35:35.720
because the manager
is only supposed

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:40.790
to have a 6% rate of return,
but, in fact, he's offering 15

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:42.350
for that level of risk.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:46.370
Manager B is just
basically doing

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:49.310
what you would expect the
manager should be doing.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:53.180
And manager C is
actually underperforming.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.720
Given the risk that manager
C is exposing you to,

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:59.570
manager C should be doing
much better than he is.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:06.070
And by the way, notice that
I've said that the same--

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:10.030
all three managers have
the same volatility, 20%.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.290
You can have the same volatility
but have different betas.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:19.390
Betas and volatilities do not
necessarily go hand in hand.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:23.110
There is actually a relationship
between beta and volatility.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:25.580
We'll talk about that
in a little while.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.279
But that relationship is not
nearly as straightforward

00:36:29.279 --> 00:36:30.070
as you might think.

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:30.570
Ingrid?

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:37.750
AUDIENCE: Can you estimate a
future return of a mutual fund

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.484
by [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:40.484 --> 00:36:42.400
I mean, I understand
it's the best you can do,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.260
but how realistic is it?

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:48.430
ANDREW LO: Well, so it
depends on who you are.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:52.900
If you are a typical
index fund manager,

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:56.590
you would argue that
mutual funds are basically

00:36:56.590 --> 00:37:02.200
going to provide you with a
relatively stable expected rate

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.644
of return over time.

00:37:03.644 --> 00:37:05.560
So in other words, it'll
fluctuate up and down

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:07.390
because it's got some
variance, but there

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:09.760
is a baseline expected
rate of return

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:11.620
that a mutual fund offers you.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.300
And that's what
people are buying.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.640
When you put your money
in an emerging market

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:18.040
equity mutual fund, you're
going to have a higher

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.660
return on average, on average,
than if you put your money

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.659
in a S&P 500 index fund.

00:37:25.659 --> 00:37:27.700
Why are you going to have
a higher rate of return

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.270
on average?

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:31.810
Because you're going be
bearing more risk on average.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:34.750
The only way to convince you to
put your money in an emerging

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.500
market fund is if it does
have that higher expected rate

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.660
of return on average.

00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:45.190
So what you're basing these
kinds of calculations on

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:48.370
is not that I can forecast
what mutual funds are going

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:50.860
to do next year, but
rather, mutual funds

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.440
offer expected rate of returns
that are stable over time.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.920
So what happened last year and
the year before and the year

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.210
before that, when you
average it all together,

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:03.300
it's about what you're going to
get over the next five years.

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:03.800
That's it.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.580
That's the argument.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:05.454
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:05.454 --> 00:38:06.139
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:38:06.139 --> 00:38:07.430
We don't know-- right, exactly.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:12.440
So there is a very large
idiosyncratic component

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:15.950
that fluctuates year
by year, and who

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.510
knows what that could be.

00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.050
OK.

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:20.777
Yes?

00:38:20.777 --> 00:38:22.685
AUDIENCE: Last
time, when you were

00:38:22.685 --> 00:38:24.600
describing more [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.230
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:29.810
AUDIENCE: You had mentioned
that for more risk people

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.880
will expect more return,
but not necessarily

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.930
proportional to the--

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:40.634
so you end up having a line
that just goes up exponentially,

00:38:40.634 --> 00:38:41.134
right?

00:38:41.134 --> 00:38:45.060
Because you had given
the analogy that, OK,

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.480
now to get investors
to be in more risk,

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:52.310
to take on more risk, you have
to offer a lot more than just

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:54.050
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:55.520
ANDREW LO: Well, you may.

00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:58.760
But the equilibrium
theory that we've argued

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:03.050
has to hold actually says
that the risk-reward trade-off

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:06.410
is, in fact, linear for
efficient portfolios.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:11.010
If it's not for efficient
portfolios, then who knows?

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.640
But the theory of the
capital asset pricing

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:15.830
model, or the security
market line, which

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:18.920
is what we derive-- what we
what we talked about today,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.150
this says that, in
fact, it is linear.

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.070
So in other words, this
result, as I told you,

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:26.640
we didn't derive it,
but it's a major result

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.150
that shows that the relationship
between risk and expected

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:37.170
return, where risk is measured
by beta now, is linear.

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:39.370
This is a linear relationship.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:43.440
So this is a major advance
that we didn't expect.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:47.410
And, in fact, so what I showed
before was the preferences.

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.880
So in other words, we talked
last time about the situation

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.630
where, suppose that
you're an investor,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:57.990
and I start you off
at a point like this.

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:00.570
And I ask the
question, if I want

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:05.580
you to tell me where
you're going to be such

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.580
that you're just as well off.

00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.250
You have the same
level of utility.

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:12.270
That curve, that
indifference curve,

00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:15.870
is going to look
something like this.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.520
That's going to be curved.

00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.580
That's what you're
talking about.

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.720
But that's the behavior
of one individual.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.380
The point about the
CAPM is that if you

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.820
aggregate all of the individuals
together and ask the question,

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:33.120
what does the expected rate
of return and volatility

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.850
or expected rate of
return and beta look like?

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.270
How are they related?

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:41.280
In fact, it's magical that
it actually is linear.

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:45.360
So it's exactly the fact that
we didn't expect linearity.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.120
Given that there are
diminishing marginal returns

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.930
to risk and reward, you
wouldn't expect linearity.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:53.850
But, in fact, it drops out.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:58.320
I mean, this drops out of this
tangency portfolio argument,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.660
right?

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.410
Nothing up my sleeve,
this was an argument

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:02.460
that we all did together.

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.790
And we derived this curve
from first principles.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:10.230
So this is really an
astounding result,

00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:12.180
but it's even more
astonishing that you

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.370
get this result
for all securities,

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.570
not just for
efficient portfolios.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.170
OK, other questions?

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:22.980
All right.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.970
Let's do another example.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:30.010
So here I want to show you how
you can use the security market

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.950
line, also called
the CAPM, C-A-P-M,

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.339
for Capital Asset Pricing Model.

00:41:36.339 --> 00:41:37.880
I want to show you
how you can use it

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.900
to do performance attribution.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.460
This is the data from
a real live hedge fund

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.250
manager, who will go nameless
since I don't want to get

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:48.680
sued by him for any reason.

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:52.520
Hedge fund managers are both
very wealthy, typically,

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.610
and also very
litigious, so you want

00:41:55.610 --> 00:41:58.520
to be careful when you
talk about them in public.

00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.960
Hedge fund XYZ had an average
annualized return of 12.5%

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.080
and a return standard
deviation of 5.5% from January

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:11.660
'85 to December 2002, and the
estimated beta over this period

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:13.840
was minus 0.028.

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:15.590
Now, somebody asked
about a negative beta.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.540
Well here's an example
of a negative beta asset.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:23.960
Positive expected rate
of return, negative beta.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.900
So if it's got a
positive expected return

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.270
and a negative beta, you
know something can't exactly

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:31.840
be right because that doesn't
sound like it makes sense

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.440
in terms of the CAPM framework.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:35.940
And, in fact, it doesn't.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.390
It doesn't make sense.

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:39.510
Well, let's do the math.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.370
The expected the
rate of return is

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:45.000
equal to Rf plus beta times
the market risk premium.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.300
Market risk premium of
6%, risk-free rate of 5%,

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.430
plug that in with the
beta of minus 0.028,

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.730
and you get that
this manager should

00:42:53.730 --> 00:42:57.940
have earned 4.83% per year.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.560
That's what the manager
should have earned.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.380
In fact, the manager earned
a rate of return of 12.%

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.040
per year.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.590
So that's an alpha.

00:43:10.590 --> 00:43:14.880
If you define the alpha as
what the manager did earn minus

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.520
what the manager
should have earned,

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:23.230
you've got an alpha of
771 basis points per year.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.470
That's a humongous alpha.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:31.420
Very, very big amount
of excess performance.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.010
This is why people are
excited about hedge funds.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:37.120
Now, we're not going to talk
in great detail about it

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:40.780
in this course because it goes
beyond the scope of Finance

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:42.520
401.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.999
But in an investments
course, the next level

00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:48.040
of sophistication would
be to take a look at this

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:51.940
and say, OK, is this
alpha really alpha,

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:57.331
or is it due to other factors,
other risks that we're not

00:43:57.331 --> 00:43:57.830
measuring?

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.200
Right now the only
risk we're measuring

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:06.070
is this tangency portfolio
risk, this beta risk.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:08.360
But maybe there are
multiple betas out there.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.360
We're not going to talk
about it in this course,

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.960
but in 433 you will discuss it.

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.940
And it will turn out
that hedge funds actually

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.719
do have multiple betas.

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:18.260
So you shouldn't go out and put
all your money in hedge funds

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:21.320
right away because this
extra performance, some of it

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:28.207
is due to true genius and
insight and unique skill.

00:44:28.207 --> 00:44:29.790
But part of it is
also due to the fact

00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:33.570
that you're bearing risks that
you had no idea you're bearing.

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:36.360
And so you've got to be careful
about getting on the bandwagon

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.190
and saying, yeah, give
me some hedge funds.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.670
I want some of this alpha.

00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:41.439
Anon?

00:44:41.439 --> 00:44:46.891
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
But how do we know

00:44:46.891 --> 00:44:48.210
this is good for the investor?

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.174
Because they could have invested
in the asset [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:52.174 --> 00:44:53.840
ANDREW LO: So the
question is, how do we

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.120
know that this is actually
good for the investor?

00:44:56.120 --> 00:45:00.470
Because they could have gotten
some returns from the S&P.

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:03.210
The way we know that
is because we're

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:08.860
measuring the expected rate
of return relative to the S&P.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.310
So in other words, the
way I got this number,

00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:14.190
this is the excess
return on the S&P.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.440
That's what the market
risk premium is.

00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.790
So in fact, given the
beta of this manager,

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:25.960
it should have only
given you 4.83%

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:29.590
return relative to what the
S&P would have given you,

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:33.290
which is a 6% excess
rate of return.

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:37.820
And, in fact, what we see is
that this manager produced

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.450
a 12% rate of
return, or 7% above

00:45:41.450 --> 00:45:44.990
and beyond what it was
supposed to have done.

00:45:44.990 --> 00:45:46.796
So this takes that into account.

00:45:46.796 --> 00:45:48.170
What it doesn't
take into account

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:51.650
is how much liquidity risk the
hedge fund manager is taking,

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:55.770
how much currency risk,
how much commodity risk,

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.530
and a bunch of other risks
that are not represented

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.060
by the tangency portfolio.

00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.771
Megan?

00:46:02.771 --> 00:46:05.256
AUDIENCE:
[? When you hear about ?]

00:46:05.256 --> 00:46:07.490
looking out for beta
dressed up as alpha,

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.877
it's really because there
are multiple sources of beta

00:46:10.877 --> 00:46:12.460
that aren't getting
wrapped into that.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:13.330
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:14.440
That's exactly right.

00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:16.570
Recently, a lot of
institutional investors

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.220
have become skeptical
of hedge funds

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:21.760
because they say,
hedge funds alpha

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.110
is really dressed up data.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:25.870
In other words,
hedge fund managers

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:27.820
are taking risks
that are not captured

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:29.546
by this very simple framework.

00:46:29.546 --> 00:46:31.420
And so when you run
these kind of regressions

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.210
and do this analysis, you're
getting tremendous alpha,

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:36.630
but in fact, it's not all alpha.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:40.040
There's other kinds
of betas in there.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.620
And so there's a
whole literature

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.020
that has developed
about multiple,

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.020
what are called exotic,
betas or alternative betas.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.750
Again, not part of the
scope of introductory

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:53.193
finance, but it is something
that's covered in investments.

00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.950
Just another illustration of
what this hedge fund has done.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.950
Take a look at the
growth of $1 invested

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.760
in the hedge fund over
the last 20 years,

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.130
and you'll see that the
blue line is the hedge fund.

00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:13.270
The red line is the S&P 500.

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:18.224
So to your point, Anon, the
S&P 500 gave you a wild ride.

00:47:18.224 --> 00:47:19.890
And so for a while
you were doing better

00:47:19.890 --> 00:47:23.100
than the hedge fund, but,
in fact, now this hedge fund

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.660
has done quite a bit better.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:27.744
Now this ends in 2002.

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.410
I'll give you a little
bit of an update.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.400
I don't have it
here in the graph,

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.420
but you can use
your imagination.

00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:38.290
It turns out that up
to 2007, the blue line

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.030
is way ahead of the red line.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:45.870
That's actually changed in 2008.

00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:49.160
This hedge fund has done
very badly this year.

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:52.620
Of course, the S&P
has done even worse.

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.130
So the gap is not as
wide as it used to be.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:59.110
There's still a gap, but the
gap is actually narrowed a bit.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.060
Yeah?

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.335
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] The
risk-free rate is changing.

00:48:04.335 --> 00:48:07.737
The market rate
is changing, so--

00:48:07.737 --> 00:48:08.320
ANDREW LO: No.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:10.280
In fact, everything is changing.

00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:12.931
So if you want to
take seriously change,

00:48:12.931 --> 00:48:15.430
you've basically got to figure
out how the risk-free rate is

00:48:15.430 --> 00:48:17.920
changing, the expected
rate of return is changing,

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:21.424
and the betas actually
are also changing.

00:48:21.424 --> 00:48:23.590
But what I'm trying to do
with a simple illustration

00:48:23.590 --> 00:48:26.850
is use a long period and
say, over that entire period,

00:48:26.850 --> 00:48:29.270
let's average across
all of these changes.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:30.008
Justin?

00:48:30.008 --> 00:48:35.424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
If you look at the graph

00:48:35.424 --> 00:48:38.612
and it seems like the
differences of the graph

00:48:38.612 --> 00:48:40.540
were just higher
with the market.

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:43.660
ANDREW LO: It is, but you
don't adjust for the beta.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:45.460
That's the key, right?

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:47.930
The S&P has a beta of 1.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.910
This guy, this
hedge fund manager,

00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:53.150
has a beta of 0 or
slightly negative.

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:54.680
That's the difference.

00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:58.190
That's why looking at
volatility can be misleading.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:59.750
If you look at
volatility, you'd say,

00:48:59.750 --> 00:49:03.000
well, you know, obviously
the S&P has done better.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:08.750
But keep in mind that look
how smooth the blue line is.

00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:13.670
And the lesson of the
CAPM is that investors

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:17.930
pay for smoothness, but only
a certain kind of smoothness.

00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:21.290
In other words, smoothness
means low volatility, right?

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.690
The smoothest line,
of course, is T-bills.

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:24.830
That's a straight line.

00:49:24.830 --> 00:49:28.340
That will go sort of like this.

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.680
And investors are not
going to pay a lot for that

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.280
because that doesn't
really help them generate

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:36.020
expected rate of return.

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:39.290
If you've got expected rate of
return and smoothness together,

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:42.270
you get a really big, big alpha.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.620
And that's exactly what we see
here, an alpha of 771 basis

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.120
points.

00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:51.580
Now, here I talk about
these multiple sources

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.410
of systematic risk.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:55.630
I don't want to focus
on that for this course

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.360
because, as I said, it's going
to be much more complicated

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.710
and requires more machinery.

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:03.730
But the basic
intuition is the same.

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:08.270
Instead of just one
source of systematic risk,

00:50:08.270 --> 00:50:09.554
you may have multiple sources.

00:50:09.554 --> 00:50:11.720
And so therefore, you're
going to have multiple risk

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.550
premia as opposed to just one.

00:50:14.550 --> 00:50:17.450
But for now, let's
not focus on that.

00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:19.310
And we're going to
focus our attention just

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:22.289
on this simple equation, and
make sure we understand it

00:50:22.289 --> 00:50:23.330
and know how to apply it.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.690
Now, I want to go--

00:50:27.690 --> 00:50:32.320
I want to give you one
more intuition for why

00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:36.670
it is that beta is the
appropriate measure of risk,

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:41.500
and not sigma, for arbitrary
inefficient portfolios.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.470
And the idea is
actually pretty simple.

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:46.990
When you think of an
investment like Microsoft

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:51.280
or like Gillette, you can think
of the risk of that portfolio

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:52.270
as being--

00:50:52.270 --> 00:50:55.690
the risk of that investment
in those individual securities

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:57.650
as having two components.

00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:00.580
So when you think of the
volatility of Gillette,

00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:02.890
you can think of the
volatility of Gillette

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:05.730
coming from two sources.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:15.340
One source is the aggregate
risk that affects all companies.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.380
And the second source
of risk is the risk

00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.630
unique to Gillette,
the fact that they've

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.750
got a particular manufacturing
plant in a particular location

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.310
of the country, the
fact that they've

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:27.880
got a specific set of managers
that are either good or bad,

00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:29.680
the fact that they
are subject to a very

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:33.310
specific set of requirements
for producing their blades,

00:51:33.310 --> 00:51:37.100
who knows, but very
specific to that company.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.900
When you think about
that kind of risk,

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.620
let me ask you a question from
a purely business perspective.

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:46.790
You're the investor.

00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:48.500
I'm a representative
of Gillette.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.810
I'm trying to sell you
my company's stock.

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:54.600
I want you to invest
in my company.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:52:00.850
And therefore, I have to pay you
to take the risk of Gillette.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:04.490
If I tell you that Gillette
has these two pieces of risk--

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:08.380
so I'm the representative from
Gillette and I tell you that

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:12.190
our company is subject to
economy-wide fluctuations that

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:17.350
will help or hurt our business
and unique fluctuations that

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:22.490
are specific and
special to Gillette--

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.100
which of these two
risks are you going

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.000
to be more concerned about
from your investment portfolio

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.050
perspective?

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:31.550
Rami?

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.310
AUDIENCE: I think you'd
be more concerned about--

00:52:34.310 --> 00:52:36.610
as a portfolio as a whole,
you look at the economy,

00:52:36.610 --> 00:52:38.611
but I think, for this
specific purpose,

00:52:38.611 --> 00:52:41.710
[INAUDIBLE] you obviously
will pick Gillette-specific--

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:42.640
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.110
But I want-- you hurried
through the first point,

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.180
and I want you to expand
on that a little bit.

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:50.480
You said that if you're worried
about your portfolio, then

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.190
obviously the economy-wide risk.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:53.162
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:52:53.162 --> 00:52:56.564
If you're worried about
the economy-wide risk,

00:52:56.564 --> 00:52:58.994
and for example, over the
next two, three years,

00:52:58.994 --> 00:53:01.157
you don't think the economy
is going to recover,

00:53:01.157 --> 00:53:03.900
then you're going to just
avoid that type of investment

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.440
as a whole.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.790
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:53:05.790 --> 00:53:06.834
OK, fine.

00:53:06.834 --> 00:53:09.000
But on the other hand, you
also said something else,

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.730
which is that if you're
comparing between two stocks,

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.950
then what you're focusing
on is the risks that

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:15.756
are unique to Gillette.

00:53:15.756 --> 00:53:20.193
AUDIENCE: You also might look at
how much the economic downturn

00:53:20.193 --> 00:53:22.350
would affect a
company like Gillette.

00:53:22.350 --> 00:53:23.066
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:25.482
AUDIENCE: So if the economic
downturn, as you said before,

00:53:25.482 --> 00:53:28.815
affects Microsoft greater
than it would Gillette,

00:53:28.815 --> 00:53:30.689
and you suspect something
is going to happen,

00:53:30.689 --> 00:53:32.154
you'd go for Gillette.

00:53:32.154 --> 00:53:34.112
If, on the other hand,
you didn't suspect that,

00:53:34.112 --> 00:53:35.590
you might go for--

00:53:35.590 --> 00:53:36.210
ANDREW LO: OK.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.670
But let's now talk
about the negotiations

00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:39.780
between you and me.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:41.160
I'm a representative
of Gillette.

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:43.370
I'm trying to get you
to invest with us.

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:45.330
And I've got two
sources of risk that you

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:51.500
might be concerned about, market
risk or Gillette-specific risk.

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:53.990
From your portfolio
perspective, since you just

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:57.271
care about maximizing the
value of your portfolio,

00:53:57.271 --> 00:53:59.270
you're not worried about
Gillette in particular.

00:53:59.270 --> 00:54:00.290
You're not management.

00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:01.250
You're an investor.

00:54:01.250 --> 00:54:02.210
I'm management.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:03.410
I'm worried about Gillette.

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:06.380
I couldn't care less about your
portfolio, I'm sorry to say.

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:09.680
What I care about is my
company, but what you care about

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.910
is your portfolio.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.340
From your portfolio
perspective, what

00:54:13.340 --> 00:54:17.030
are you going to care more
about, Gillette-specific risk

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:22.495
or the macroeconomic risk that
I represent to your portfolio?

00:54:22.495 --> 00:54:23.950
AUDIENCE: When I'm
talking to you,

00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:26.380
I care more about
your specific risks.

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.840
ANDREW LO: Well, I'm
asking a question though

00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:29.927
about your portfolio.

00:54:29.927 --> 00:54:31.510
What you care about
is your portfolio.

00:54:31.510 --> 00:54:33.070
I understand that when
you're talking to me,

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.528
you're going to be asking me
about my company-specific risk

00:54:35.528 --> 00:54:36.940
to try to get a handle on it.

00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.920
But is that what
you ultimately are

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.151
going to be concerned about?

00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:42.150
AUDIENCE: I would be
concerned about, obviously,

00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:46.237
the macro portion of it
and how you fit into that.

00:54:46.237 --> 00:54:49.109
But I'd look at
your beta and see--

00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:50.900
ANDREW LO: You don't
know the CAPM, though.

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:55.460
So now you're cheating
because you now know the CAPM.

00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.630
But suppose you didn't.

00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.450
What I'm trying to get
at is the intuition,

00:54:58.450 --> 00:55:00.890
a businessman's
intuition, for what

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.110
you would care
about more in terms

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.810
of what I do to your portfolio.

00:55:05.810 --> 00:55:06.530
Yeah, Sema?

00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:08.362
AUDIENCE: Didn't you
say, two lectures ago,

00:55:08.362 --> 00:55:11.570
that the idiosyncratic risk
is [? their survival? ?]

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:12.305
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:55:12.305 --> 00:55:14.430
AUDIENCE: So, you care more
about systematic risk--

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.790
ANDREW LO: Why?

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:16.910
AUDIENCE: Because only one
[INAUDIBLE] in my portfolio.

00:55:16.910 --> 00:55:18.350
ANDREW LO: That's exactly right.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:21.860
The idea is that if
it's Gillette-specific

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:24.980
risk, then by
definition, if you're

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:28.150
holding a well-diversified
portfolio,

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:30.760
then you're not going to care
about that because that's going

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.100
to average out to nothing.

00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:36.040
Now, of course, we have
to think about the case

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.260
where you're not holding
a diversified portfolio,

00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.390
but let me get back
to that in a minute.

00:55:40.390 --> 00:55:42.849
I'm assuming that all of you
are good business folks, which

00:55:42.849 --> 00:55:44.390
means that you're
going to be holding

00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:45.500
a diversified portfolio.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.770
You're not going to
concentrate all your bets

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:52.150
on one particular kind
of investment, right?

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:55.060
So if you are already holding
a very well-diversified

00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:57.970
portfolio, then when
you interview me

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:01.960
as a potential
investment opportunity,

00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:04.870
do you really care about
the idiosyncratic risk?

00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:07.360
Because that risk is going
to be diversified away.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.760
What you care about from a
portfolio perspective is,

00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:12.250
how much am I going
to be contributing

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:14.140
to your overall risk?

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:18.520
And now that you know the CAPM,
you understand the logic of it.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.080
It says, you care about my beta
because my beta is a measure

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:26.320
of the amount of risk I'm going
to be adding to your portfolio

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:28.180
that you cannot get rid of.

00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.910
How do you know you
cannot get rid of it?

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:33.840
Well, by definition it's
the market portfolio.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:34.950
Everybody's holding it.

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:37.480
Nobody wants to get
rid of it completely.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.170
You're on the capital
market's line.

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:41.910
That's the best you can do.

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:47.100
So this notion of
firm-specific risk

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.100
versus economy-wide
risk, that distinction

00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:51.690
is a really important one.

00:56:51.690 --> 00:56:54.190
And I'll show you the
mathematics of it in a minute,

00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:56.410
but I want to give
you the intuition.

00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:59.490
As a result, think
about this conversation

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:02.100
happening not just for
Gillette, but for every company

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.720
in the economy.

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:07.680
If it's the case that portfolio
managers that are buying stocks

00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:12.490
only care about the systematic
risk, about the market risk,

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:15.640
about the risk that they cannot
get rid of, and then you have

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:18.850
to reward them for that, then
what that means is that you

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:23.850
don't have to reward them
for idiosyncratic risk.

00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:24.480
Why?

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.934
Because that's not risk
that you are forced to bear.

00:57:26.934 --> 00:57:28.350
There's nothing
that says you have

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.672
to bear idiosyncratic risk.

00:57:30.672 --> 00:57:32.130
How do you get rid
of idiosyncratic

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:35.160
risk if you don't
want to bear it?

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:35.790
Diversify.

00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:36.660
Exactly.

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:38.610
Just buy 10 stocks
instead of one,

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:39.830
and then you're diversified.

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:41.940
20 stocks is better than 10.

00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:45.390
And mathematically,
after 50 stocks,

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:47.040
you're basically diversified.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:48.600
You're done.

00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:53.190
So nobody should be holding
two or three stocks.

00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:58.855
Or if they do, they are bearing
risk that they need not bear.

00:57:58.855 --> 00:58:00.730
And they may want to do
it for other reasons.

00:58:00.730 --> 00:58:03.900
For example, as a
manager of Gillette,

00:58:03.900 --> 00:58:05.730
I believe in the company.

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.530
I want to demonstrate
to my shareholders

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:09.600
that I'm tied to
the company, so I'm

00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:12.090
going to hold a lot of my
wealth in Gillette stock.

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:13.740
That's not well diversified.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:17.310
I'm holding a lot of
Gillette-specific risk.

00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:19.530
That's not a smart thing
to do from an investment

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.300
point of view, but
that is a smart thing

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.430
to do from a management
point of view

00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:28.480
because I'm tying my fate
to the fate of the company.

00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:32.130
It's definitely not a smart
thing from an investments

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.330
perspective.

00:58:33.330 --> 00:58:35.100
If you're in a financial
services sector,

00:58:35.100 --> 00:58:38.096
you should not be buying
financial services stocks.

00:58:38.096 --> 00:58:39.720
If you're in the
pharmaceutical sector,

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.090
you should not be
buying biotech stocks.

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:47.220
And yet we do that for
reasons other than portfolio

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.600
management.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:51.454
But given that I'm teaching
you about portfolio management,

00:58:51.454 --> 00:58:53.370
I'm not going to focus
on those other reasons.

00:58:53.370 --> 00:58:56.062
If this were an
organizational studies course,

00:58:56.062 --> 00:58:57.770
you'd be getting a
different perspective.

00:58:57.770 --> 00:58:59.740
And you should get a
different perspective.

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:02.250
But for the purposes of
building financial wealth, what

00:59:02.250 --> 00:59:04.500
you want to do is
to focus on how

00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:07.950
much the systematic component
is contributing to your risk,

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:10.290
because the
idiosyncratic component

00:59:10.290 --> 00:59:11.970
you don't have to bear.

00:59:11.970 --> 00:59:12.977
Yeah?

00:59:12.977 --> 00:59:15.101
AUDIENCE: So like an employee
purchase plan, where,

00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:15.737
if you're in financial
services, you're

00:59:15.737 --> 00:59:17.153
working for a
mutual fund company,

00:59:17.153 --> 00:59:19.800
and they offer you 10%,
15% you put your salary in,

00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.855
and you can buy stock--

00:59:20.855 --> 00:59:21.480
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:59:21.480 --> 00:59:23.040
AUDIENCE: Would you
recommend not doing that?

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.748
ANDREW LO: Well, I
recommend not doing it

00:59:24.748 --> 00:59:26.760
from the financial
perspective, but I

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:28.620
may recommend doing it
from the management,

00:59:28.620 --> 00:59:30.600
or managerial
incentives, perspective.

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.370
The reason that companies
do that is very simple.

00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:35.964
They're trying to suck you in.

00:59:35.964 --> 00:59:38.130
They're trying to get you
to be more intimately tied

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:41.670
to the company so you'll act
like an owner of the company,

00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:43.880
as opposed to an employee.

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.950
And if you act
like an owner, you

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:48.350
will engage in behavior
that is much more

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.990
productive for building
the company's wealth,

00:59:50.990 --> 00:59:52.830
rather than as an employee.

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:55.010
But from your
personal perspective,

00:59:55.010 --> 00:59:59.030
you're bearing risk
that you don't need to.

00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:01.810
So you know, the
analogy that I give--

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:03.940
I've given before-- it
may work for some of you.

01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:04.510
It may not.

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:07.000
Let me explain.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:13.300
Anybody know how much window
washers in midtown Manhattan

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:14.877
get paid on an annual basis?

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.210
You know what I'm talking about?

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:19.810
These are the folks that climb
up on these two-foot catwalks

01:00:19.810 --> 01:00:22.480
that are 40 stories high,
and they wash the windows

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:23.860
of these skyscrapers.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.079
That's a pretty risky job.

01:00:26.079 --> 01:00:27.620
Anybody know what
their annual salary

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:28.760
is, when you annualize it?

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.496
I actually decided
to find out one day.

01:00:31.496 --> 01:00:33.620
I was kind of curious about
that because, you know,

01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:35.210
there's a trade-off
of risk and return.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:36.060
And that's really risky.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.476
You know, there was one day
when I was staying at a hotel.

01:00:38.476 --> 01:00:41.780
I think it was the Millennium,
and I was on the 30th floor,

01:00:41.780 --> 01:00:43.622
and it was a windy winter day.

01:00:43.622 --> 01:00:45.830
And, sure enough, there was
somebody there pulling up

01:00:45.830 --> 01:00:48.950
the thing, cleaning the window,
and looked happy as can be.

01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:50.420
You know, no problem.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.600
And I was thinking, boy, this
guy's taking a lot of risk,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.740
you know?

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:59.070
And I hope he's
getting paid for it.

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:01.700
And these salaries
are determined

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:02.740
by supply and demand.

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:03.420
What do you think it would be?

01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:04.410
Anybody have a guess?

01:01:04.410 --> 01:01:05.464
Yeah?

01:01:05.464 --> 01:01:06.730
AUDIENCE: About $70,000.

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:09.860
ANDREW LO: $70,000, OK.

01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:10.500
Anybody else?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.176
Justin?

01:01:11.176 --> 01:01:12.170
AUDIENCE: $125,000.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:13.250
ANDREW LO: $125,000?

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.709
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:14.709 --> 01:01:16.625
That's higher than some
NBA starting salaries.

01:01:16.625 --> 01:01:17.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:18.710
OK.

01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:19.540
Leah?

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:20.290
AUDIENCE: $30,000.

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:21.081
ANDREW LO: $30,000.

01:01:21.081 --> 01:01:22.550
AUDIENCE: Do they take interns?

01:01:22.550 --> 01:01:23.620
ANDREW LO: Insurance?

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:24.560
Interns.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:25.061
Interns.

01:01:25.061 --> 01:01:26.060
I don't know about that.

01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:26.620
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:29.120
Well, so when I looked
last time, which

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:31.610
is about four years
ago, it turns out

01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:35.300
that the typical window
washer for these skyscrapers

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.430
gets paid about $60,000
a year, annual salary.

01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:42.040
$60,000.

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:44.950
Now, you know, I
don't know whether you

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:46.810
think that's a lot or a little.

01:01:46.810 --> 01:01:51.520
But, seems to me that
that compensation reflects

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:54.220
the kind of risk that
we're talking about.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.860
And you know, you have no
educational requirements,

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.450
no degrees, no certifications.

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:01.510
You just show up and,
you know, up you go.

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:03.670
Now let me ask you a question.

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:07.450
Suppose that a
window washer comes

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:11.560
to the job who happens
to really enjoy dancing

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:13.404
while he washes windows.

01:02:13.404 --> 01:02:15.070
In particular, he
dances that, you know,

01:02:15.070 --> 01:02:16.330
the Irish jig or whatever.

01:02:16.330 --> 01:02:17.710
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:19.204
You know what I'm talking about?

01:02:19.204 --> 01:02:20.620
You know, that
dancing, the very--

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:23.590
and he just likes to do that
while he's washing windows

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:25.750
on the 40th floor.

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:28.899
You agree that that's
more risky, right?

01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:30.940
Do you think that that
particular individual gets

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:34.850
paid more than $60,000 a year?

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:35.350
Why?

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:37.821
He's taking more risk.

01:02:37.821 --> 01:02:38.320
Why not?

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.611
Why isn't he getting paid more?

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.240
Exactly.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.830
He doesn't have
to take that risk.

01:02:44.830 --> 01:02:46.780
That's not part of the job.

01:02:46.780 --> 01:02:49.420
He can choose to take
that risk, but he's not

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:52.840
going to get compensated for
it because it's not necessary.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.960
And there are 100,000 people
behind him waiting in line

01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.150
to get that job that
won't necessarily

01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:59.826
need to take that risk.

01:02:59.826 --> 01:03:00.522
Yeah?

01:03:00.522 --> 01:03:02.380
AUDIENCE: I thought
of it differently.

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:04.006
If you had a long,
short portfolio,

01:03:04.006 --> 01:03:05.380
would it be the
other way around?

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:07.380
Because you wouldn't care
about the market risk.

01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:08.590
You can hedge that out.

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:10.442
You're thinking only
about specific risk.

01:03:10.442 --> 01:03:13.800
So like in that case, I would
short the guy who likes to jig.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.602
And I would invest in
the guy who didn't.

01:03:15.602 --> 01:03:17.560
ANDREW LO: Well, that
depends on whether or not

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.510
doing the Irish
jig actually makes

01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:21.580
you wash windows
better or worse,

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:24.190
in other words, where there's
an alpha to that risk.

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:26.260
It may be the case that
dancing the Irish jig

01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:28.270
actually helps you
scrape off dirt

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:29.470
that much more effectively.

01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:31.303
In which case, you may
not want to short him

01:03:31.303 --> 01:03:34.240
because then he will earn a
premium in certain markets.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:37.177
Those with lots of pigeon
poop on the windows.

01:03:37.177 --> 01:03:38.430
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:41.020
So we can get into this analogy
more deeply than we should.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.190
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:44.770
But the point is that, when
you think about the CAPM,

01:03:44.770 --> 01:03:48.560
all it's saying is that
you get what you pay for.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:50.150
And you pay for what you get.

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.810
In other words, if there
is a certain amount of risk

01:03:52.810 --> 01:03:57.550
in a particular investment
that is risk that nobody

01:03:57.550 --> 01:03:59.560
can get rid of easily--

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.780
in other words, you
have to bear it--

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.430
then you have to pay for it.

01:04:03.430 --> 01:04:05.840
Because otherwise people
aren't going to do it.

01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.990
However, if there's risk
in a particular company

01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:12.280
that you don't have to pay for,
that you don't have to take,

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.030
then you don't
have to pay for it.

01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:16.810
That's all that
the CAPM is saying.

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:21.370
Beta is a measure of that
hard little pellet of risk

01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:23.080
that you can't get rid of.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.920
And the variance is the
measure of the entire risk

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.570
in a particular portfolio.

01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:34.710
The only case where variance
and beta are the same

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:38.050
is for what kind of portfolio?

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:39.209
An efficient portfolio.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.500
What is an efficient portfolio?

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.990
It's one that is already
maximally diversified.

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:46.330
By adding more
securities, you are not

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:49.960
going to do any better
than that straight line.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:55.090
All of these portfolios have
been completely diversified.

01:04:55.090 --> 01:04:56.000
How do I know that?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.510
Because you're at the
tangency portfolio.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:05:00.700
There is nowhere to
go in the Northwest

01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.900
region off of that line.

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:08.260
So for all of these securities,
the sigma and the beta

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.450
are literally numerically
identical because there

01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:13.690
is no more extra risk
in the portfolio.

01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:15.540
It's been diversified away.

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:19.190
But for Gillette, for Microsoft,
for IBM, General Motors,

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:22.940
and Motorola, each of these
contain both beta risk

01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:25.580
and non-beta risk.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.500
The non-beta risk
is that Irish jig

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:29.844
that you don't have to do
while you're washing windows.

01:05:29.844 --> 01:05:32.260
And you're not going to get
paid for it, I'm sorry to say.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:36.170
So the relationship that
you want to focus on

01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:39.950
is the capital asset pricing
model's security market line.

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.200
Measure the stuff that
you're going to get paid for.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.710
And this is what you're
going to get paid for it.

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:47.335
Yeah, Ingrid?

01:05:47.335 --> 01:05:50.185
AUDIENCE: When you go back
into the sort of the real world

01:05:50.185 --> 01:05:54.000
and include transaction
costs, how do they enter here?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.750
ANDREW LO: Well, so there
have been versions of the CAPM

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.610
with transactions cost.

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:02.150
And it turns out that it
doesn't change things too much.

01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:06.680
If you impose transactions
cost on all securities,

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.760
and say that
there's a percentage

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.790
cost for going in and
out, you can derive a net

01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:13.670
of fee transactions costs.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.040
It won't affect the
pricing necessarily.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:19.010
What it will affect is
the dynamics, the trading.

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.620
What it will mean is that you
will rebalance your portfolios

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:23.676
less frequently than
you otherwise might.

01:06:23.676 --> 01:06:25.550
But there is still going
to be a relationship

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:28.190
between the net of
fee transactions

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:29.940
costs of these securities.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:32.450
So you can actually look
at the transactions cost

01:06:32.450 --> 01:06:35.600
as a way to deduct the
expected rate of return

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.444
from each of these securities.

01:06:38.444 --> 01:06:40.110
So transactions cost
is not a big issue,

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.610
but there are other
issues that I'll

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:43.662
come to that will be
a problem for this.

01:06:43.662 --> 01:06:47.064
AUDIENCE: Looking at this,
[INAUDIBLE] one of the best,

01:06:47.064 --> 01:06:50.466
efficient portfolio that I can
have is basically the index.

01:06:50.466 --> 01:06:53.870
If I want to allocate
my money globally,

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:57.008
should I buy indexes
according to the market

01:06:57.008 --> 01:06:57.970
capital of the market?

01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:58.765
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:03.026
AUDIENCE: This is the most
efficient portfolio I would--

01:07:03.026 --> 01:07:04.900
ANDREW LO: Right, so
that's a great question.

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:07.530
And we actually have a separate
course on international finance

01:07:07.530 --> 01:07:09.238
that deals just with
those kind of issues

01:07:09.238 --> 01:07:10.410
because they're so tricky.

01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:12.270
But I'll give you
the short answer.

01:07:12.270 --> 01:07:16.590
According to the theory,
this tangency portfolio

01:07:16.590 --> 01:07:19.950
is not just for the
US stock market.

01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:23.560
It should be for the world
stock market, everything.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.740
So this tangency
portfolio should not

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:28.020
be the S&P 500 or
the Russell 2000,

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.230
it should be the
MSCI, or EAFE, index

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:35.460
that has all of the assets
in the world weighted

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.490
relative to their market cap
in that particular currency

01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:41.200
of the investor that
you happen to be.

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.830
So if you're a US investor,
it'll be in dollars.

01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:46.680
If you're a Brazilian
investor, it'll be in real.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.073
It'll be in whatever
currency you trade in.

01:07:50.073 --> 01:07:54.590
But that presupposes
that there's

01:07:54.590 --> 01:07:57.960
capital market integration
throughout the world.

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.910
So in other words, if I call
this the world portfolio,

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:04.700
implicitly I'm
assuming that you're

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:09.440
free to trade stocks in any
part of the world freely.

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.809
There are no
barriers to trading.

01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:13.350
And we know that
that's not the case.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:14.930
There are barriers, in fact.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:17.569
So what that means is
that the CAPM, applied

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:21.020
to international stocks, is an
approximation that may actually

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.990
be worse than applying
it country by country

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:28.220
and then looking to see
whether there are any distances

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:31.556
or discrepancies across
those different countries.

01:08:31.556 --> 01:08:33.680
But people have come up
with international versions

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:34.939
of the CAPM.

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:36.410
And they don't work very well.

01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:39.300
At least, they didn't
as of 10 years ago.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:41.510
Within the last 10
years, a lot has changed.

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:44.000
So it could be that
capital market integration

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.029
has made the world
CAPM look a lot better

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:49.237
in terms of the data.

01:08:49.237 --> 01:08:50.649
OK.

01:08:50.649 --> 01:08:54.221
Other questions?

01:08:54.221 --> 01:08:54.720
All right.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.580
So now I'm going to talk
about implementing it.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.920
And we're going to deal
with all of the messy issues

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:05.250
that I tried to put
off a lecture ago.

01:09:05.250 --> 01:09:07.340
How do you take this
thing out for a spin?

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:10.189
Well, one thing you
could do is to try

01:09:10.189 --> 01:09:13.200
to test the CAPM
to see if it works.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.740
And one way to test it
is to ask the question,

01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:20.180
if we assume that all
securities are priced according

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:25.479
to this equation, then another
way to write the equation that

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:28.540
doesn't rely on expected
returns, but relies

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:33.130
on realized returns, is to write
it as a regression equation,

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:35.710
as you did in DMD.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:39.670
The regression equation is the
return, the actual realized

01:09:39.670 --> 01:09:45.640
return on security i, is
given by the risk-free rate

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.510
plus beta times the realized
return on the market

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:54.149
minus the risk-free
rate plus epsilon.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:10:01.380
Epsilon is the error term,
the disturbance, the residual,

01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:04.230
that is giving you
the fluctuations

01:10:04.230 --> 01:10:06.700
around the expected value.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.690
So when we remove the expected
values from this equation,

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:12.120
we have to stick in
this epsilon term that

01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.290
sort of bounces around.

01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.960
By the way, when you
look at this equation,

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:21.690
you now have an
explicit representation

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:27.990
for systematic risk
and idiosyncratic risk.

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:30.960
For a given return,
it's comprised

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.480
of three pieces, the risk-free
rate, beta times the market

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:42.050
return that bounces around, and
this epsilon is the Irish jig.

01:10:42.050 --> 01:10:45.890
That is the idiosyncratic
bouncing around

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:47.491
that you don't get
any reward for.

01:10:47.491 --> 01:10:49.490
How do you know you don't
get any reward for it?

01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:53.570
Because on average, the expected
value of this is equal to 0.

01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:54.680
How do I know that?

01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:58.550
By definition that's how I got
from this equation down here.

01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.250
If you take the expected
value of this equation,

01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:03.560
the only way that the
expected value of this

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.480
gives you this
equation on the top

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:08.240
is if that epsilon has a 0 mean.

01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:13.520
So you don't get paid
for bearing epsilon risk.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.480
It's there.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.582
And for some stocks it's huge.

01:11:18.582 --> 01:11:20.290
But you don't get paid
for it because you

01:11:20.290 --> 01:11:21.520
don't have to bear it.

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.750
And the reason you
don't have to bear it

01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:24.220
is, if you take
50 of these stocks

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:28.400
and stick them in a portfolio,
the epsilons average out to 0.

01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.730
How do I know that?

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:32.650
Well, this relies on
a piece of mathematics

01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:34.470
that's known as the
law of large numbers.

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.160
You may have heard that term
used in casual conversation,

01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:38.750
but it's actually
a real theorem.

01:11:38.750 --> 01:11:40.670
What it says is that
when you have large,

01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:43.730
large numbers of
fluctuations that are not

01:11:43.730 --> 01:11:45.890
correlated with each other--

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:48.680
and by definition,
idiosyncratic risks

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.349
for Gillette and Microsoft
and other companies

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:53.390
are not correlated because
they're idiosyncratic.

01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:55.131
They're unique to those firms.

01:11:55.131 --> 01:11:57.380
That when you get a large
number of these uncorrelated

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:01.970
fluctuations, that in the
limit, they actually go to 0.

01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:04.250
You can disregard them.

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:06.140
So the law of large
numbers is what

01:12:06.140 --> 01:12:09.380
tells you that this
idiosyncratic risk is not

01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.380
going to be something
you will get paid for.

01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:18.050
So this is the CAPM
relationship using actual data.

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:23.420
And if we stick in an alpha term
to represent deviations from

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:26.480
the CAPM, and I subtract the
risk-free rate from both sides,

01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:29.030
just to have everything
in excess returns,

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:35.960
then the CAPM reduces to the
hypothesis that the alpha--

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.680
across all stocks, all
managers, all projects,

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.190
the alpha is equal to 0.

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:44.662
That's what the CAPM says.

01:12:44.662 --> 01:12:48.380
And if you want to
formulate it strictly

01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:51.410
in terms of total
rates of return,

01:12:51.410 --> 01:12:54.560
it says that the alpha has to
be equal to the risk-free rate

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.800
times 1 minus beta.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.920
This is a different
alpha than this alpha.

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.290
This alpha represents the
excess rate of return.

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:05.290
OK, so let's do it.

01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:07.700
Let's see whether
or not it's true.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:10.600
Let's take a bunch of stocks,
subtract the risk-free rate

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:15.510
from the stock returns, run
a regression of that stock's

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:21.660
return on a constant and
the market excess return,

01:13:21.660 --> 01:13:24.940
and let's see whether the
intercept is equal to 0.

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:32.760
Well, if you do this for two
stocks, Biogen and Motorola--

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:40.940
I've done this from
1988 to I think 2006.

01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:44.210
When you run that regression,
here's what you get.

01:13:44.210 --> 01:13:54.130
For Biogen, the beta is
1.43, the intercept 1.61%,

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:57.850
and the standard error is 1.1%.

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:02.440
And then Rf times 1
minus beta is minus 2.1%.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:08.020
This should be equal to the
alpha in that previous equation

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.180
that I gave you.

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:15.280
So in other words, the alpha
that we've estimated for Biogen

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.640
using this CAPM
regression is 3.7%,

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:24.940
or on a monthly basis 45% alpha.

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.620
Biogen is an incredibly good
buy according to the CAPM,

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:31.330
if you believe the CAPM.

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:32.700
All right.

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.760
Now that's Biogen.
What about Motorola?

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.040
During the same period,
when you estimate Motorola,

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.500
it's got a beta of 1.42.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:45.630
And we're estimating an alpha
not quite as big, but 23.5%

01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:47.550
percent on an annualized basis.

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:50.560
That's still pretty big.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:54.310
So if you run this
regression and analyze it,

01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:58.120
this is what you would
conclude, that these two stocks

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.410
are wonderful buys.

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:02.260
What we're going to
talk about next time

01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:04.990
is whether this interpretation
really makes sense,

01:15:04.990 --> 01:15:07.076
or whether we've got
some missing factors,

01:15:07.076 --> 01:15:08.950
or whether we're measuring
things improperly.

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:10.700
We're going to need
to do a bit more work.

01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:13.180
But we're very close to
being able to figure out

01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:15.340
exactly how all of
these pricing models

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:19.360
work in tandem with the kinds
of risk budgeting calculations

01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:22.100
that we're going to need to
do for the rest of the course.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.120
So I'll see you on Monday.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.167
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20 Special Relativity.

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.500
So we're starting a new chapter.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.290
In this chapter, we
talk about some aspects

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.650
of special relativity,
which are not crucially

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.510
important to understand
the concepts,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.760
but they help you to
go a little bit deeper

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.030
in your understanding.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.400
I hope this is
going to be useful.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.980
So we want to talk
about the algebra

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.090
of known transformations.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.580
So we have seen that our gamma
factor is 1 over square root

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.780
1 minus beta squared with beta
equal the relativistic velocity

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.640
v/c.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.790
And thus, this we can rewrite
it as gamma squared minus beta

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.090
squared gamma squared
is equal to 1, OK?

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.960
So now, I would like you to
recall hyperbolic functions

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.370
sinh and cosh and cosh
squared minus sinh

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.630
squared is equal to 1.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:09.420
So the form here and here
are pretty much the same.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.520
And something squared minus
something else squared

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.200
equal to 1, OK?

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.040
Good.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.050
So let's see how
this looks like.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.140
As a reminder for us, the
hyperbolic functions as

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.840
defined as 1/2 e to
the x power minus

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:32.520
e to minus x and cosh equal to
1/2 e to x plus e to minus x.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.020
OK?

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.205
The tangent is then
defined as a ratio.

00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:37.580
And you can plot
those functions,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.680
and you can see the
functional form as

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.290
given in these two diagrams.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.200
Well, we want to come back to
those two equations looking

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.170
very much the same.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.570
So we can define now
eta, the rapidity,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.280
as gamma equal to hyperbolic
function cosh eta and beta

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.190
gamma equals sinh eta.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.170
So basically, we
have this rapidity,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.510
which is a measure on
how much the system is

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:12.180
boosted as being equal to
this kind of hyperbolic angle,

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.680
right?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.630
You can then
process again, where

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.010
beta is equal to the tangents
of this hyperbolic angle.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:26.630
And just remember that the
slope in our space time diagram

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.920
is 1 over the velocity.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:36.970
We find that angle again now
is being called rapidity, OK?

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.050
And just as a reminder,
beta goes from minus 1 to 1,

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.850
depending on the direction
and the speed of it

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.820
is less than the speed of light.

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:53.190
And then eta goes from
minus infinity to infinity.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.680
OK, so then we can rewrite
our Lorentz transformation.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.070
Instead of writing gamma and
beta gamma and minus beta

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.220
gamma and so on,
we can write this

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.470
through the hyperbolic angle.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.970
OK?

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.360
So you should always
ask why is this useful.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.070
The first part is that
when we add velocities,

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.580
we found this complicated
transformation

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.570
where the new velocity is
equal to the first velocity

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.990
times the second velocity over
1 plus the product of the two

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.520
velocities.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.150
And this is much easier now as
we can just add the velocities.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.960
So the third velocity is equal
to the first plus the second.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.600
This is much, much easier
to actually calculate.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.370
And the proof of this
is coming directly

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.190
from the proof of those
hyperbolic functions here.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.530
The second part where
this becomes useful

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.040
is when you think about the
angle in your space time

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.000
diagram.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.130
How does this now compare
to a normal rotation?

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.780
So let's start here.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.210
So we have a normal rotation.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:02.820
We have a rotation at a angle,
and our coordinate system just

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.040
rotates by specific angle.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.840
Let's call it phi here.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.940
And what we do now,
we have a similar

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.610
but a hyperbolic
rotation in which

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.370
the coordinate system in our
space time diagram rotates.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.329
All right?

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.060
In the normal rotational
case, x squared

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.820
plus y squared is invariant.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.860
And in our Lorentz
transformation,

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.110
c squared t squared
minus x squared.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.850
All right?

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.460
If you then have a more general
transformation, a rotation,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.960
and Lorentz
transformation, you find

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.710
x squared plus y squared plus
z squared minus c squared

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.460
t squared [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.970
OK, so we have just
relabeled things,

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.730
but now we can make
use of everything

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.360
we know about
hyperbolic functions

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.140
when we think about
adding velocities.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.340
Because the rapidity-- the
relative distance and speed

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.160
between two reference frames
is basically the angle

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.300
of the hyperbolic angle.

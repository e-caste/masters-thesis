00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:22.110
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.160
Let's get started.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.700
Why doesn't everyone go ahead
and take ten more seconds on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:37.260
the clicker question.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.580
All right, and let's
see how we did.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.970
Alright, excellent job, 86%
of you, that's right.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.890
What we had just done a
clicker question on is

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.080
discussing light as a particle
and the photoelectric effect,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.250
so we're going to finish up with
a few points about the

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.550
photoelectric effect today.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.940
And then we're going to try a
demo to see if we can convince

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.790
ourselves that the kind of
calculations we make work out

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.060
perfectly, and we'll do
a test up here about

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.510
half way through class.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.640
And we'll also talk about photon
momentum as another

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.010
example of light behaving
up as a particle.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.850
After that, we'll move on to
matter as a wave, and then the

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.580
Schrodinger equation, which is
actually a wave equation that

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.280
describes the behavior of
particles by taking into

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.490
account the fact that matter
also has these wave-like

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.490
properties.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.440
So, starting back with the
photoelectric effect -- yes.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] class last
time [INAUDIBLE] notes.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.130
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.018
Can one of the TAs maybe come up
and hand around anyone that

00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:37.660
didn't get notes?

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.650
We have not yet perfected the
art of entering and exiting

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.490
this classroom yet, we're
still working on that.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.380
Raise your hand if you need
notes and we'll make sure we

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.650
get those to you.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.470
All right, so where we left
off with the photoelectric

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.090
effect was when we first
introduced the effect, we were

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.190
talking about it in terms
of frequencies.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.870
So, for example, we were talking
about a threshold

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.780
frequency as in a minimum
frequency of light that you

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.120
need in order to eject an
electron from a metal surface.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.160
What Einstein then clarified for
us was that we could also

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.320
be talking about energies, and
he described the relationship

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.810
between frequency and energy
that they're proportional, if

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.440
you want to know the energy,
you just multiply the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.470
frequency by Planck's
constant.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.650
So, now we can talk about it
in different terms, for

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
example, talking about e sub
i, which is the incident

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.310
energy or the energy of the
light that comes in, or

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.100
talking about work function
here, and that's just another

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.910
way to say threshold energy.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.510
So, the work function's the
minimum amount of energy

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.300
that's required in order to
eject an electron, and most of

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.280
you understand this relationship
here, which is a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.260
little bit cut off, but it is
all the way on in your notes,

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.470
and that is what you saw the
clicker question on -- how you

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.890
can figure out, for example,
the kinetic energy of the

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.950
ejected electron by looking at
the difference between how

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.890
much energy you put in and how
much energy is required to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.210
eject that electron in
the first place.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.720
So, in this class we'll be
talking about energy a lot,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.433
and it's often useful to draw
some sort of energy diagram to

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:09.940
visualize the differences in
energy that we're discussing.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.360
So, we do this here for the
photoelectric effect, and in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.600
terms of the photoelectric
effect, what we know the

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.290
important point is that the
incoming photon has to be

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.230
equal or greater in energy
then the work

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.660
function of the metal.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.810
So here we have energy
increasing on the y-axis, and

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.710
you see this straight line at
the bottom here is lower down

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.854
on the graph, and that's the
energy of a bound electron, so

00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:37.110
that's going to be a
low stable energy.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.510
But we see if we have a free
electron, as we do in this

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.910
dotted line here, that's going
to be a higher energy that's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:44.860
less stable.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.930
So, if we want to go from that
stable state to that less

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.630
stable state, we need to put in
a certain amount of energy

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.090
to our system, and that's what
we define as the work function

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.930
here -- that difference between
the free electron and

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.150
the electron bound
to the metal.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.140
So, the most basic case to
understand, which is what we

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.740
just saw is a case where we
have the incident energy

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.880
coming in, and that incident
energy is greater than the

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.230
work function, and in that case
what we see is that we

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.680
have an electron that
is ejected.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.200
That makes sense and it also
makes sense that this little

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.130
extra bit here, that's the
amount of energy that we have

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.410
that goes into the kinetic
energy of the electrons.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.370
So, that's how we could
also graph figuring

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.410
out the kinetic energy.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.120
So, in the second case what we
have is what happens if we

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.800
have the incident energy at some
amount that's less than

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.550
the work function, and in this
case we're showing 1/2 of the

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.810
work function.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.610
So in this case, we don't have
enough energy to eject an

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.590
electron, so, an electron
is not ejected.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.120
And that's pretty clear, too,
and the question I want to

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.250
pose to you is instead
the third case here.

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.620
So in the third case what I'm
showing is that we have -- now

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.630
we're not just talking about 1
photon, we're talking about 3

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.380
photons -- let's say we shoot
them all at the same time at

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.200
our metal, each of them having
some energy that's let's say

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.170
1/2 the work function.

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.570
So, just to take a little bit
of an informal survey, who

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.320
thinks here that we will have
an electron that is

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.890
ejected in this case?

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.230
So a couple hands, all right.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.950
And what about who thinks
that we will not have

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.710
enough energy here?

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.230
All right.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.760
We've got a big majority, and
both are logical ways of

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.450
thinking, but it turns out that
the majority is correct,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.220
which is not always the case,
but the electron is not

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.610
ejected in this case.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.510
And the reason for this, and
this is a very important point

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.000
about the photoelectric effect,
and the point here is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.660
that the electrons here are
acting as particles, you can't

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.640
just add those energies
together.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.975
One individual particle is being
absorbed by the metal

00:05:48.975 --> 00:05:50.680
and exciting an electron.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.000
So, having other particles
around that have the same

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.900
energy that you could
technically add up if you were

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.160
adding them up like a wave, you
can't do the same thing

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.020
with particles, they're
all separate.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.340
So, the take-home message is
whether you have three photons

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.560
or 3,000,000 photons that you're
shooting at your metal,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.880
if you're not at that minimum
frequency or that minimum

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.450
energy that you need, nothing
is going to happen.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.960
So, you might ask then well what
is the significance of

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.260
shooting different amounts
of photons at a metal?

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.130
Is there any significance at
all, for example, in the

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.220
number of photons that are
hitting the metal or being

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.160
absorbed by the metal.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.170
And there is a relationship
here, and that is that the

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.970
number of photons absorbed by
the metal are related to the

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.320
number of electrons ejected
from the metal.

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.530
So, in this figure here what I'm
actually showing is these

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.800
little sunshines, which
let's say are each

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.430
one individual photon.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.220
So we had six photons going in,
so the maximum number of

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.280
electrons that we're going to
have coming out is also six

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.810
because the maximum scenario
that we could have that would

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.160
maximize the number of electrons
is that each one of

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.800
those photons comes in, excites
an electron, ejects it

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.530
from the surface of the metal.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.160
It's important to note, of
course though, it's not just

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.250
the number, it's really
important that the energy of

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.710
each one of these individual
photons is, of course, greater

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.390
than the work function
of the metal.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.850
So, that's, in fact, it's that
number of photons that we're

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.380
talking about when we refer to
the intensity of light, and

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.160
the intensity of light is
proportional to that number,

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.120
because when we talk about
intensity, really we're

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.520
talking about the amount of
energy that a stream of

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.550
particles, a stream of photons,
has per second.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.470
So, if we have a high intensity,
we're talking about

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:45.740
having more photons per second,
and it's important to

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:48.370
know also what that
does not mean.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:52.950
So it does not mean that we have
more energy per photon.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.690
This is a really important
difference.

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.220
Intensity, if we increase
the intensity, we're not

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.500
increasing the energy in each
photon, we're just increasing

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.480
the number of photons that
we're shooting out of our

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.910
laser, whatever our
light source is.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.280
And when we talk about intensity
in terms of units,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.700
we usually talk about watts,
so if you change your

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.450
lightbulb, usually you see the
intensity in terms of watts.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.560
But in terms of SI units, which
become much more useful

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.230
if you're actually trying to use
intensity in a problem and

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.690
cancel out your units, we're
just talking about joules per

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.230
second is what intensity is.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.950
So at this point, you should
be able to have all the

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:32.900
background you need on the
photoelectric effect to solve

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:36.380
any type of problem that we
throw at you, and you see

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.950
three on this problem set, and
we'll probably give you one

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.560
more on your next problem set,
and the reason we ask you so

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:44.900
many questions about the
photoelectric effect is

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.870
because it actually is very
similar to ionization energy

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.030
that we'll talk about later,
also problems dealing with

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.600
photoelectron spectroscopy.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.340
So, we want to make sure that
this is something the entire

00:08:57.340 --> 00:08:59.590
class is 100% solid on.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:02.200
Sometimes the questions are
worded quite differently, so I

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.000
just want to sum up here
the different ways

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.220
they could be worded.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:08.270
For example, if we talk about
photons, of course, we also

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.950
just mean light, sometimes
we refer to this as

00:09:11.950 --> 00:09:15.410
electromagnetic radiation, and
there's several ways that you

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.830
might be asked this in a problem
or that you might be

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.180
asked to answer.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:22.210
Sometimes we might just directly
tell you the energy

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:25.670
of the photon -- that's probably
the easiest scenario,

00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:27.860
because when we think about
work functions those are

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.830
usually reported in energy.

00:09:30.830 --> 00:09:33.780
So since that's the easiest
scenario, you can probably be

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.170
sure it's not going to be too
frequently that you're just

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.710
given the energy, right,
that might be too easy.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:42.740
So really what we'll probably do
is instead either give you

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.590
the wavelength or the frequency
and you'll go ahead

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.640
and calculate the energy
from there.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.760
In terms of talking about the
electrons, I wanted to point

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.500
out that in the book and other
places you might see electrons

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.190
referred to as photoelectrons.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.030
That's sometimes confusing for
people, because it seems like

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.260
okay, is it a photon or
is it an electron.

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.820
I just want to clarify that
it is an electron.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:07.520
It's called this just because
it's an electron that results

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.510
when an electron absorbs a
photon's worth of energy, so

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.460
thus it's a photoelectron.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:16.650
And if we talk about electrons
or photoelectrons, again we

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.650
can describe it in terms of
energy, we can talk about

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.740
velocity, and from there, of
course, you can figure out the

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.580
energy from 1/2 m v squared,
and actually we can also

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.380
describe the electron in
terms of wavelength.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.610
So you don't actually know
this yet from this class,

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.350
you'll know it by the end of the
class that electrons can,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:36.700
in fact, have a wavelength.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.870
So once we cover it, it will
then be fair game to ask these

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:43.920
photoelectron spectroscopy or
these photoelectric effect

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.250
questions using the wavelength
of the electron.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.460
Also to point out, a lot of
times you'll see electron

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:54.560
volts instead of joules, this is
the conversion factor here

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.210
just so you all have
it in your notes.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:10:58.460
All right.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.590
So let's test what we, in
fact, know about the

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.050
photoelectric effect, and before
we do that actually,

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:07.630
we're going to calculate what
we would predict, so when we

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.770
do the demo it will be
meaningful and we can tell

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:11.290
whether we're successful
or not.

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:13.860
So hopefully we will
be successful.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.590
And as I point this out, we now
know how to do any kind of

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:20.450
photoelectric effect problem,
also this means you should be

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.450
able to go back to Monday's
notes where we filled in all

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.600
those graphs, which were what
different scientists were

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.750
observing when they were
measuring either the frequency

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:35.450
or the intensity of light that
was irradiating different

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.940
types of metals, and also the
number of electrons ejected,

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.400
and the kinetic energy of
those electrons ejected.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.980
You should be able to maybe
print out a blank copy of

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.435
those notes from the website and
fill in all those graphs

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:49.440
-- not for memorizing them, but
now just understanding how

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.620
the photoelectric effect works.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:51.820
All right.

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:54.910
So let's do an in-class problem,
and this will be done

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.980
with zinc. We have a zinc plate
up here, and we're going

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.760
to -- in a minute I'll describe
how we can probe if

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.580
electrons are coming
off of it.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.210
But we're going to irradiate
it with two

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.290
different light sources.

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:09.490
We have a UV lamp right here,
which is centered at a

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.580
wavelength of 254 nanometers.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.860
And then since we have my red
laser pointer, we will also

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:19.310
try with the red laser pointer,
which is centered at

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.330
wavelength of 700 nanometers.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.320
So, there are a few questions
that we need to answer first.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.010
So we want to see, do we expect
to eject electrons off

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.400
of this metal surface, or do we
expect that we don't have

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.450
enough energy?

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:35.980
So that means we're going to
need to figure out what is the

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:38.840
energy per photon that's emitted
by that UV light.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:41.750
Also, what's the energy per
photon of this red laser

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:45.010
pointer, and then it's also
worth trying a calculation

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:46.420
dealing with intensity.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:49.480
So let's also try calculating
the numbers of photons that

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.430
would be emitted by this laser
pointer, if, for example, we

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:56.310
were to use it for 60 seconds
and this were a

00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:58.380
one milliwatt laser.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:03.130
So, let's do some of these
calculations starting first

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.330
with what is the energy per
photon, and let's start with

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.480
the UV lamp.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.370
So we know that energy is equal
to Planck's constant

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.490
times nu, but what we know
about the lamp is its

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:21.100
wavelength, or the light
that's emitted.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:25.120
We know that nu is equal
to c over wavelength.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:30.130
So we can figure out the energy
of each photon emitted

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:39.250
by our UV lamp by saying e is
equal to h c over wavelength.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.870
So let's just plug in
these numbers here.

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:50.160
That means our energy is equal
to 6.626 times 10 to the -34

00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.810
joules times seconds.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:59.970
And then we have c, the speed
of light, 2.998 times 10 to

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:02.660
the 8 meters per second.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:06.270
And we want to divide all of
that by our wavelength, and to

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:08.750
keep our units the same
we'll do meters.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:18.740
So that's 254 times 10
to the -9 meters.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.420
So hopefully if some of you
have your calculators with

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:25.250
you, you can confirm the answer
that I got, which is

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:31.410
that the energy is 7.82 times
10 to the -19 joules.

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:33.940
So, remember what we're talking
about here is the

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.120
amount of energy that's
in each photon.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.400
So if we think about the work
function for zinc, and the

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.180
work function for zinc is 6.9
times 10 to the -19 joules, do

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.250
we expect that when we shine
our UV light on the zinc,

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.050
we'll be able to eject
electrons?

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.760
What do you think?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.100
Yes.

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:55.790
Good.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:15:00.210
OK, anyone disagree?

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.700
No, OK and that's correct,
because each photon of light

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.020
actually has more
energy than is

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.860
needed to eject an electron.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.380
So, we would expect to see
electrons ejected with the UV

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:17.450
light source.

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:25.890
So let's now think about using
instead the amount of energy

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.580
per photon in that red
laser pointer.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.510
So again, we know that energy
is equal to h c divided by

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:37.160
wavelength, and energy is equal
to -- you have written

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.440
out in your notes what the
actual value for h c is, but

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:48.610
now our wavelength is 700 times
10 to the -9 meters.

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:54.640
And what we end up with for the
energy then is 2.84 times

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.880
10 to the -19 joules.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:15:59.140
All right.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.460
So please raise your hand now
if you think there'll be

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:05.220
sufficient energy to
eject electrons

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.480
from the metal surface?

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.130
And raise your hands if you
think there won't be.

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:11.770
OK.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.740
Good hand raising technique.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.380
Yes.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.090
In fact, there is not enough
energy in a single photon to

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:23.780
go ahead and eject an electron
from this zinc surface.

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:31.260
So our last question we ask is
what's the total number of

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.330
photons emitted if we
give this given

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.770
intensity for 60 seconds?

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.750
So, keep in mind that one
milliwatt is just the same as

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:44.660
saying 1 times 10 to the
-3 joules per second.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:52.250
So we have 1 times 10 to the -3
joules per second, and we

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:57.300
want to multiply that by -- or
cancel out how much energy we

00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:01.020
have per photon, first of all,
so how much energy do we have

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.360
per photon if we're talking
about the red laser pointer?

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.720
Right.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.910
So this value right here.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:15.860
So for every photon
we have 2.84 times

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.440
10 to the -19 joules.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.130
We're saying let's do
this for 60 seconds.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.780
So what we end up with for the
number of photons in this

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:34.980
laser beam of light is 2.1 times
10 to the 17 photons.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.900
So this gives you a little bit
of an idea of just how many

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.390
individual photons there are
in a laser beam of light.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.200
This is a huge number
of photons.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.290
So the question is
does this matter?

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:48.990
How about if we shoot
this many photons?

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:51.190
Does it make any difference at
all in terms of whether we can

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.220
eject an electron?

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.720
No, it actually doesn't.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.610
It is an impressive number, it
is very, very large, but it

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.990
doesn't make a difference.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.810
So we see that we do not eject
electrons in the case of the

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:07.050
laser pointer, even if we have
this intensity, even for 60

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.090
seconds -- it is still not
related to the energy of an

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.930
individual photon, so we
won't see an effect.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:14.670
All right.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:18.780
So let's hope that we can
confirm our predictions here

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.100
by actually doing it, and
Professor Drennen well help me

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.370
out by loading up our device
with electrons, and I'll

00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:32.580
explain exactly what our set up
here is as she does that.

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:35.880
So basically what we have
is this zinc plate here.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.570
So that's what we want to load
up with electrons, and then

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.960
see if we can remove some.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.020
But that's a little bit hard,
we aren't all that good at

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:46.520
seeing electrons with our eyes,
so we need to think of a

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:47.920
way to do this.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.790
So what she's going to do
is start loading up the

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:53.320
electrons, and you see this wand
here move slowly, and it

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.850
takes a while to do it, start
become perpendicular.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:19:01.600
The reason for that is because
all of this is connected, so

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.610
we're moving electrons
everywhere in the system.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.450
And since we have two bars that
are together like this,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.160
once they're both loaded up with
electrons there's going

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:14.260
to be negative charges that
repel, so the electrons will

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.120
want to get as far away as
possible, and they're on their

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.950
slow way to doing that, to
getting as far away from each

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:22.700
other as possible.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.590
And if we do, in fact, hit
it with light to get the

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:30.120
electrons off, it will go back
to the straight up in

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.370
position, or if it gets
knocked hard enough

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:34.240
it does that, too.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:41.280
Sometimes it's easier actually
not touch it to the metal, I

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.030
should have--

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:48.470
TA: It's hard to see if
it's moving or not.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:53.130
PROFESSOR: So, our technology
TA is also our paper TA.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.340
Darcy will hold up
the yellow paper.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.170
Right, there we go, now we're
making a little progress.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:20:00.760
TA: It was moving before, you
just couldn't see it.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.170
PROFESSOR: So, does anyone have
any questions about the

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.860
set up here, does it make sense
what we're looking for

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:08.250
the bar to go back once
we make some progress.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.520
This demo works wonderfully in
the winter months in Boston

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.340
when we will all be full
of static at all times.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.370
We're still close enough to the
summer that the air is not

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:22.110
just filling us up with extra
static electricity, so it's a

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.600
little more challenging here.

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.270
We'll try to make this
happen only once.

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:50.760
I think that's probably,
if we can get one more.

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.410
So, it works, I think it's
just getting too much

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:52.680
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:52.680 --> 00:21:09.430
Sometimes it helps to not
actually hit the metal, just

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.970
put it next to the
-- there we go.

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:13.090
I wonder if there's some UV
light out of this new lighting

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:16.510
set up in our classroom here.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:29.020
That would be a little tricky.

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.290
All right.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.830
I think this -- if
this sticks.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.750
Yeah, it's the pressure
of the paper.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.250
I think that's good enough,
we'll be able to see.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:38.560
If you can keep showing that,
though, Darcy, we'll try

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.980
different scenarios and
I'll try not to put

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.970
laser in your eye.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:47.050
Actually you can look down as
well as an added precaution.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.190
OK, let's try it with that.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.930
That's enough then.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:51.970
So, the first thing we're going
to try is with the red

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.440
laser pointer, because that we
are expecting not to have an

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.930
effect, and that will prevent
Professor Drennen from having

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:00.220
to charge up our apparatus
again.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:03.180
So, Darcy will look down at this
moment and we will hit

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.930
this with the laser pointer, and
what we see is nothing is

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.570
happening at all.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:10.130
OK, good.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.220
Control one working.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.410
So now very carefully take
our UV light source --

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.550
Darcy again will divert
her eyes and her skin.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:37.230
Let me make sure this
is actually on.

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:42.660
OK, so we've got UV light here,
and let's see what we

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.140
can see, and we lose
electrons, if

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:47.340
that's what's happening.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.310
And it often doesn't go all the
way, because actually this

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:52.190
device gets stuck right there.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.830
So let's charge it up again and
see if we can check again.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.170
But did you see movement?

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:08.510
Are you buying our story here?

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:10.560
This is actually very
representative of when you do

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:14.420
research in the laboratory, you
will find often things do

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.550
not work quite exactly as they
worked 20 minutes ago when you

00:23:17.550 --> 00:23:20.610
just checked it in your
office, for example.

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:23.100
And sometimes it's a matter of
factors that you need to

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.860
figure out what it is, and maybe
it's that there's extra

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.980
light in the room we
don't know about.

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:32.460
It might just be -- so,
we did get it back to

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.540
the starting position.

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:40.510
Next time maybe we'll charge
it up before class.

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:41.120
All right.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.460
So we kind of saw what was
happening here, you saw it

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.710
move a little bit.

00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.920
They'll keep trying to get it
going, but maybe we should

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.860
move on with our lives here
while this is happening, and

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.220
we'll click it back at the end,
and if we have a nice set

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.280
up at any point, I'll just stop
and we'll go back and

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.100
we'll look at it again.

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:05.480
Since, I think that's just not
going to happen right now.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:16.070
So let's switch, actually,
back to our notes.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:20.170
So, ideally what we did see
was, in fact, it does have

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:22.490
enough energy with the UV lamp,
it wasn't a dramatic

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:24.690
shift you saw because we didn't
start very high and

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:26.270
then it went to that
stuck point.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:29.310
But luckily we had the control
of the red laser pointer where

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.750
nothing moved at all.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.800
So hopefully you're convinced
that your predictions worked

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.600
well and you are able to predict
what's going on when

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:43.890
you're looking at the
photoelectric effect.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:46.850
So, it turns out that the
photoelectric effect is not

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.850
the only evidence for the fact
that light has these

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.740
particle-like characteristics.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.810
And one thing that Einstein
put forth is he figured if

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:59.450
well, what we're saying is
that light is, in fact, a

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:03.330
stream of particles, each one of
those particles or photons

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.410
must, therefore, have
a momentum.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:08.520
And that's really neat to think
about, because photons,

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.080
of course, are massless
particles, they have no mass,

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.240
so it's neat to think about
something that has no mass,

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.080
but that actually does
have a momentum.

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:19.080
And the relationship that he put
forth is that the momentum

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.530
is equal to Planck's constant
times nu divided by the speed

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.790
of light, or it's often more
useful for us to think about

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.300
it in terms of wavelength.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:30.190
So, since the speed of light
equals lambda nu, we can say

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:34.210
that momentum is equal to
h divided by lambda.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.940
And there was experimental
evidence that came along that

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.410
supported this, and this is
called the Compton scattering

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:42.470
experiment, and this was done
by Arthur Compton, and

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:47.450
basically what he did was he
took x-ray light, which had

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:49.990
some frequency, which was a very
high frequency because it

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:53.450
was x-rays, and he shot it
at a stationary electron.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:56.880
And what he was able to observe
was that the electrons

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.960
scattered and now had some
momentum, and that both the

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:06.420
frequency, and therefore, the
momentum of the light that he

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.090
shot in, went down once
it was scattered.

00:26:09.090 --> 00:26:13.500
So what he's showing here is,
first of all, that the light

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.402
has some momentum and when it
hits an electron it can

00:26:16.402 --> 00:26:20.050
actually transfer some of that
momentum to the electron.

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:24.170
So the transfer of momentum from
a photon to an electron

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:27.740
is what was being observed, and
it was seen as completely

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.590
separate evidence to the
photoelectric effect that,

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:33.780
yes, in fact, light is
behaving in these

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:37.090
particle-like ways.

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:40.940
So up to this point, before it
was really established that

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:44.950
yes, light is like a particle
sometimes, there was this very

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:48.090
strong distinction
between what is

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.620
light and what is matter.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.450
And the distinction was when
we're talking about light,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.560
light is a wave, and when we're
talking about matter,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.100
well, matter is a particle.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.120
And these behave completely
separate, they don't overlap

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.370
at all in terms of behavior, but
then, of course, with the

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.260
photoelectric effect with
Compton's scattering, what we

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:10.270
see is that, oh actually,
sometimes photons behave as if

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.410
they're particles.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.150
So now this relationship's
beginning to get a little bit

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:17.640
fuzzy in terms of what is the
difference between how we

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.650
treat light and matter.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:23.905
And actually, this was taken
a step further by Louis de

00:27:23.905 --> 00:27:28.410
Broglie who in his PhD thesis,
as part of his work as a

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:32.970
graduate student, put forth the
idea that, OK, Einstein

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.620
says, and everyone agrees
that, in fact, light is

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:40.960
particle-like at times, and
light, in fact, of course has

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.170
a wavelength, and if it has a
wavelength we're saying that

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.920
it can have momentum.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.290
And what de Broglie said is
well, if it's true that light,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.590
which has a wavelength can have
momentum, then it must

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:56.650
also be true that matter, which
has momentum, also has a

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.090
wavelength.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:01.460
And you can look at this
in two different ways.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.370
One is that he's just
re-arranged an equation here

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:09.600
and gotten both his PhD thesis
and a Nobel Prize, but I think

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.170
the more representative way to
think about this is the real

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:15.510
revolutionary idea that he put
forth, which is that matter

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:19.840
can actually behave as a wave.
And in terms of equations that

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.670
we use, it's sometimes easier
to plug in the fact, since

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:26.050
momentum is equal to mass
times velocity.

00:28:26.050 --> 00:28:29.610
We can know the wavelength of
any matter -- and he's not

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:31.720
limiting this, for example,
to electrons.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.140
What de Broglie is saying we can
know the wavelength of any

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.560
matter at all, as long
as we know its

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.690
mass and it's velocity.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:41.670
And Einstein credited de
Broglie, which is a fair

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:44.350
statement of lifting a corner
of the great veil, because

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.540
really there was this
fundamental misunderstanding

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:50.490
about what the difference was
between matter and light, and

00:28:50.490 --> 00:28:54.170
the reality is that they can
both be like-particles and

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:57.420
they can both show
characteristics of waves.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.900
So I mentioned, however, that in
terms of de Broglie's work.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.400
This was Nobel Prize worthy,
absolutely, but it was also

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.000
his PhD thesis.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.600
So, we can think about what
would happen if we're on his

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.710
thesis defense, we're on his
thesis committee, we would

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:15.970
need to think of some pretty
mean, hard, nasty questions to

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.190
be asking de Broglie about this
theory -- that's what

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.540
happens when you defend
your thesis.

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:23.620
This is necessary, it's hard to
find holes in a Nobel Prize

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:24.580
worthy idea.

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.330
But let's just try maybe one
of the basic questions they

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.980
could ask, and they can say, all
right, de Broglie, so you

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.180
say that all matter, absolutely
all matter has

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:34.350
wave-like behavior.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:36.920
Why is it that we're never
observing this, for example,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.820
why is it the table doesn't
defract as we bring

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.740
it through the door?

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:45.230
Why don't we see the influence
of the wave-like behavior on

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.510
every day matter?

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.280
So it turns out that he could
have picked anything to

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:53.705
explain this, and hopefully done
out the calculation, and

00:29:53.705 --> 00:29:55.050
we'll do this ourselves.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:58.830
And the example we'll pick is
considering, for example, a

00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:59.170
Matsuzaka fastball.

00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:05.670
So, many of you are new to the
Boston area, now I still

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:08.800
realize, and I want to let you
know it's not required that

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.180
you be a Red Sox fan
to be at MIT.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:18.020
We do encourage it, however,
and in general, I find you

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.160
don't have to give up that old
team, you can keep your old

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.950
team, even if it's teams
I won't name, just

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.670
keep them to the side.

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.690
And you can join on to the Red
Sox nation on top of that, and

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:31.210
part of being a good Red Sox fan
is knowing the statistics

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.300
of your team.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.410
For example, if we're talking
about a pitcher, like

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:37.090
Matsuzaka, we might want
to know the speed

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.950
of his average fastball.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:39.960
We might want to know his ERA.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.758
If you're really into it and
you're at MIT, maybe you want

00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:47.490
to know the wavelength of
these average fastballs.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.780
So, let's go ahead
and look at that.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:52.920
So, if we're trying to figure
out the wavelength of a

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.790
Matsuzaka fastball, we need to
consider the velocity first,

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.890
which is 42 miles per hour.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:01.510
We don't usually do our
chemistry calculations in

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:05.220
miles per hour, so let's switch
that to 42 meters per

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.330
second, so it's -- sorry,
it's 94 miles per hour.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:11.580
And we can use the de Broglie
relationship that wavelength

00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:15.210
should be equal to h over
mass times volume.

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:19.120
And we can put up here Planck's
constant -- and I

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.870
want to make note that instead
of writing joules per second,

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.400
I actually wrote out
with a joule is.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.640
A joule is a kilogram meter
squared per second squared.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.360
Occasionally, you'll find you
need to cancel out units,

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.970
because, of course, you're
always doing unit analysis as

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:36.550
you solve your problems, and
sometimes you'll need to

00:31:36.550 --> 00:31:38.130
convert joules to
kilogram meters

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:40.950
square per second squared.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.220
We divide that by the mass, so
0.12 kilograms, that's the

00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:49.450
mass of a regulation baseball
for the major leagues, and the

00:31:49.450 --> 00:31:53.780
velocity of the baseball is
42 meters per second.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.860
So, we can cross out our units
doing our unit analysis.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.500
The seconds cross out, the
kilograms cross out, one of

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:03.000
the meters crosses out from the
top, so we're left with an

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.480
answer in meters.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.650
It's always good when we're
looking for a wavelength that

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.970
our answer is in a
unit of length,

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:10.510
that's a good sign already.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.860
And what we find out is the
wavelength of a Matsuzaka

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:20.230
fastball is 1.1 times 10
to the -31 meters.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.640
So, this is really small, this
is undetectably small.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.750
And especially when we consider
it, what tends to be

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:31.150
important is the size of
wavelength in relationship to

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.500
its environment.

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.240
So 1.1 times 10 to the -31
meters is not, in fact, a

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.380
significant number when we're
comparing it, for example, to

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:43.790
the length of a ball, or the
size of the baseball field.

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.940
So that would probably be de
Broglie's answer for why, in

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.000
fact, we're not observing the
wavelength behavior of

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.880
material on a day-to-day life.

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:59.920
So, that's for Matsuzaka, and
even if you don't memorize all

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.690
the wavelengths for
all the pitchers.

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.360
I would expect, whether you're
a Red Sox fan or not, you to

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.810
be able to look at a list of
different pitchers and their

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.370
average velocity for their
fastball, and tell me who has

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.160
the longest or the shortest
wavelength.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.290
You should all be able to
know that relationship.

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:19.050
So why don't we go to a clicker
question here, and see

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:22.360
if you can tell us this.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.850
So we have 4 different pitchers
we're showing here --

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:27.740
they all have different
strengths.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:30.430
It's not always how fast you
throw the fastball, sometimes

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:35.060
it's your different styles or
the different ways that you

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.510
decide when to throw what.

00:33:36.510 --> 00:33:41.020
So, first we have Matsuzaka
at 94 miles per hour.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:43.830
So, click one if you think that
he's going to have the

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:44.770
longest wavelength.

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:48.790
Tim Wakefield on the DL right
now throws a lot slower,

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.460
because he has that tricky
knuckle ball, he doesn't need

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.220
to throw as fast. Then we have
Beckett who can get up 96 just

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.690
on a regular old day.

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.460
And Timlin who is about
91 miles per

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.050
hour, one of our relievers.

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.700
So, why don't you take ten
seconds to do that.

00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.040
If you can't decide, Timlin is
my favorite ever, so that

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:14.750
would be a good back up choice
if you forgot the relationship

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:23.540
between wavelength and the
relationship between speed.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.920
It looks like, in fact, people
did not forget that

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:29.910
relationship, and only
1% of you humored me.

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:33.730
So, let's see what the correct
answer is, and it is, in fact,

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.380
Wakefield, right, because
there's an inverse

00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:40.160
relationship between how fast
a particle is going and what

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.110
its wavelength is.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:46.420
So, in terms of wavelength,
Wakefield has the largest

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:49.770
wavelength, but in terms of
being significant, we're still

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:51.030
not even close.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:52.550
It's still undetectably small.

00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.830
Yes.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:59.890
STUDENT: Why doesn't wavelength
go to infinity as

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:05.740
it stops, like a standing
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:06.610
PROFESSOR: As it stops.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:07.670
So, let's think.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.320
I would think that it would
approach inifinity, and I

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.720
would need to think about it and
get back to you in terms

00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:15.990
of why we don't actually hit it
and see something with an

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.230
infinite wavelength.

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.660
I'm sure there's some upper
limit as there are to most

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.470
things, like if we think of
wavelengths and different

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:27.700
types of light, there is so
large that you can get, but

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.870
you would be approaching
that level.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:32.220
All right.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.300
So we can switch back actually
to our notes here --

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.910
oh, do we have--?

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.390
OK.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.496
We're going to just try this
one more time just

00:35:40.496 --> 00:35:41.850
so you can see it.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.260
It'll still likely get stuck in
that spot, but we'll just

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:51.400
show you one more time the
effects of the UV light, and

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.970
actually we'll throw in an
extra trick here, too.

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:57.080
We know that UV light gets
absorbed by glass, so it

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.620
shouldn't be able to go
through the glass.

00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:03.130
So first if Professor Drennen
can try it through the glass,

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:05.180
and we see nothing's
happening.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:11.320
Let's move the glass away.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.450
All right.

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:13.650
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:20.910
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:21.210
Good.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.120
So we can fully believe what
our calculations were now,

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:26.600
which is a nice thing to do.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:28.650
Let's go back to considering
the wavelengths

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:30.300
of different objects.

00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:33.500
We considered a baseball,
but let's also think

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:35.590
about now an electron.

00:36:35.590 --> 00:36:39.470
And an electron is something
where, in fact, we might be

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:43.100
able to, if we calculate it and
see how that works out,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.560
actually observe some of its
wave-like properties.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.450
So, if we do this calculation
for an electron, saying it

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.910
moves at 10 to the 5 meters per
second, then what we end

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:59.170
up with for a wavelength is 7
times 10 to the -9 meters.

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:02.700
A lot of times we talk about
these kind of distances either

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:05.820
in nanometers or in angstroms
so we can say this is 70

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:09.060
angstroms. So this is, first
of all, even just on an

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.290
absolute scale, this is way,
way larger than the

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:15.310
wavelengths we're talking
about for baseball.

00:37:15.310 --> 00:37:18.560
In addition, if we compare this
to the diameter of an

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.720
atom, which is on the order of
somewhere between one and ten

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:25.230
angstroms, now we're seeing
that, in fact, this wavelength

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.850
is significantly larger
than its environment.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:34.150
So certainly we would expect to
see that it has an effect

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:38.050
in terms of seeing its
wave-like properties.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.140
And this was experimentally
validated, hopefully, even

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.380
more clearly than our
experiment here.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.740
And at first this was done by
Davidson and Germer, and they

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:53.050
were American scientists who
tried defracting electrons

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:54.290
from a nickel crystal.

00:37:54.290 --> 00:37:57.570
They did this in Bell
Laboratories, and they found

00:37:57.570 --> 00:37:59.930
that, in fact, the electronis
did defract.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:02.390
And G.P. Thompson showed
a similar thing.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:05.740
What he did was he defracted
electrons through a very thin

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:14.210
gold foil, and this is a picture
-- oops, that is not.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:14.700
OK.

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:19.890
It is a picture from your book
here showing the defraction

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:22.780
pattern of an electron going
through that gold foil.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:27.090
So, you can see that, in fact,
it's confirmed that an

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.010
electron can have both
wavelength and

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.740
particle-like behavior.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.360
And it turns out that Davidson
and Thompson shared a Nobel

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.470
Prize for this discovery of
seeing the wave-like behavior

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.560
of electrons.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:44.110
So, this is actually kind of
neat to point out, because we

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.100
all remember J.J. Thomson from
our second lecture, and J.J.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:52.200
Thomson got a Nobel Prize
in 1906 for showing that

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.480
electrons exist in that
they are particles.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.180
And it turns out that G.P.
Thompson, well, that's his

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:00.330
son, so we can actually think
of this -- and I'm sure this

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.670
wasn't the case, but I like to
think of it as a little bit of

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.450
child rebelling against
the father.

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.190
So, the father gets a Nobel
Prize for showing that an

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.430
electron is a particle, and the
son says, well, what can I

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:12.570
do to top that?

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.870
I'm going to show the
exact opposite.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.420
I'm going to say that an
electron's a wave no matter

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.710
how much my father says
differently, and I'm going to

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:22.530
get a Nobel Prize for
that, and he does.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.380
But the nice part of the
story is, it turns out

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:26.110
they're both right.

00:39:26.110 --> 00:39:30.390
An electron is a particle, but
an electron's also a wave. So,

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.410
father and son, happy
ending, they both

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.380
have their Noble prizes.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.870
So, what happens now that
we, in fact, know

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:40.270
that matter is a wave?

00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:43.940
Well, this allows us to try to
go back and explain some

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.830
phenomena that over the years,
mounting evidence was building

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.740
that couldn't be explained.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.720
So, for example, when people,
and we'll talk about this next

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.570
class, were looking at different
characteristics

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.890
spectra of different atoms, what
they were seeing is that

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.740
it appeared to be these very
discreet lines that were

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:05.430
allowed or not allowed for the
different atoms to emit, but

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:07.790
they had no way to explain this
using classical physics.

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:13.330
And it turns out that the
Schrodinger equation is an

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:17.870
equation of motion in which
you're describing a particle

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:21.930
by describing it as a wave. So
you're basically having a wave

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:25.180
equation for a particle, and for
our purposes we're talking

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.890
about a very particular
particle.

00:40:26.890 --> 00:40:29.390
What we're interested
in is the electron.

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.310
So basically describing
electrons by their wave-like

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:35.050
properties.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.540
And this is Erwin Schrodinger,
and this is the equation that

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:43.750
he put forth where we have h hat
psi being equal to e psi.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:47.370
So, let's explain
what these are.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:49.820
So this symbol here
is actually what

00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:52.080
we call a wave function.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.050
That doesn't mean a whole lot
in itself, it will mean more

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:57.120
in about two lectures
from now.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:59.910
But right now, what I want you
to be thinking of a wave

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.290
function as is just some
representation of an electron.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:06.140
So, it's some way of describing
an electron.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:09.180
Specifically, we'll talk more
about this, it's talking about

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.350
different orbitals, it's the
spatial part of an orbital.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:15.100
But before we get to that, in
terms of thinking just think,

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.690
OK, this is representing my
particle, this is representing

00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:20.580
my electron that's what
the wave function is.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:24.400
This e term here is the energy,
or in our case when we

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.660
talk about an electron in a
hydrogen atom, for example,

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.000
the binding energy of that
electron to the nucleus.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.110
So, e is binding energy.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:38.980
And h with the carrot or the hat
here, well, that carrot or

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.580
hat tell us it must be an
operator, and this is called

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.300
the Hamiltonian operator.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:48.140
So when you operate on the wave
function, what you end up

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.870
with is getting the binding
energy of the electron, and

00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:55.780
the wave function back out.

00:41:55.780 --> 00:41:59.270
When we need to describe the
wave function term a little

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:02.620
bit more specifically so we can
describe, for example, the

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.680
position of the electron, and I
just want to mention that we

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.230
do have two choices if we're
trying to describe this, we

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.460
could use cartesian coordinates,
or we could use

00:42:11.460 --> 00:42:15.870
polar coordinates where we're
either talking about x y z or

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.950
r theta and phi.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.310
So, I just want to point out
that when you look at wave

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:23.270
functions, we are going to be
using those spherical polar

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.390
coordinates, and the reason is
because a very important

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:28.750
interaction here is the
interaction between the

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:31.250
electron and the nucleus, which
we want to describe the

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:33.800
distance of in terms of r.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.580
So, you can see, it's much
easier to describe that as one

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:40.180
term, r here, instead of
using both y and z.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:43.660
Another reason I wanted to point
this out in terms of the

00:42:43.660 --> 00:42:46.450
polar coordinates that we're
using, is I think they're

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.170
actually flipped from
what you're used

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.530
to seeing in physics.

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.990
Sometimes different disciplines
have different

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:55.410
conventions, which can be very
confusing because the whole

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:58.190
point of what's happening now
is there's so much interplay

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:01.090
between different disciplines,
but still I think this might

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:04.980
be one remaining one where
in our case theta is that

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.530
distance from z, that angle
there, where phi is this

00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:11.880
distance or angle
from the x-axis.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.930
So just keep it in mind
that it's flipped.

00:43:13.930 --> 00:43:17.890
It turns out we won't really
using it, needing to identify

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:20.080
it on the graph so much
in chemistry.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.510
We'll be using the solutions,
so you shouldn't have a

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:25.390
problem, but I wanted to point
it out so it does not look too

00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:27.130
strange to you.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.640
In terms of the Schrodinger
equation, we now can write it

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.570
in terms of our polar
coordinates here.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.830
So we have the operation on the
wave function in terms of

00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:41.880
r, theta, and phi and remember
this e is just our binding

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:44.080
energy for the electron,
and we get back

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.730
out this wave function.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:50.470
So, you might ask, this looks
pretty simple up here, right,

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:52.060
just with that h hat.

00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:54.300
It turns out, we can
write it out fully.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.510
It's three different second
derivatives in terms of the

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.100
three different parameters.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.800
It's a little bit complicated.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:05.440
You won't have to solve it in
this class, you can wait till

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.850
you get to 18.03 to start
solving these types of

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.450
differential equations, and
hopefully, you'll all want the

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:14.260
pleasure of actually solving
the Schrodinger equation at

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:15.170
some point.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:18.380
So, just keep taking chemistry,
you'll already have

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.650
had 18.03 by that point
and you'll have the

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:22.500
opportunity to do that.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.170
What I want to point out also
is that this h hat, the

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:29.630
Hamiltonian operator written out
for the simplest case we

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:32.760
can even imagine, which is a
hydrogen atom where we only

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.720
have one electron that we're
dealing with, and of course,

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:36.480
one nucleus.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.520
So you can imagine it's just
going to get more and more

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:43.100
complicated as we get to other
types of atoms, and of course,

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.620
molecules from there.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.830
So, we just want to appreciate
that what we'll be using in

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.520
this class is, in fact, the
solutions to the Schrodinger

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.580
equation, and just so you can
be fully thankful for not

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.210
having to necessarily solve
these as we jump into the

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:59.300
solutions and just knowing that
they're out there and

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:00.860
you'll get to solve
it at some point,

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:02.260
hopefully, in your careers.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:04.860
So, we'll pick up with that,
with some of the solutions and

00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.730
starting to talk about
energies on Friday.

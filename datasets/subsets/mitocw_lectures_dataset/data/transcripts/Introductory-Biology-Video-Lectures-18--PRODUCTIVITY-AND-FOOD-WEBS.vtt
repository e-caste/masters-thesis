WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000
All righty.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So we've been talking about,
the last time we talked about the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
different ways that this
extraordinary process called

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
evolution has resulted in different
ways that organisms exploit the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
carbon and energy sources that are
available on earth.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And as we talked about that we find
that whatever is thermodynamically

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
possible in terms of redox gradients
in the environment you will find an

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
organism that has evolved to exploit
it.  And one thing I haven't

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
mentioned to you guys yet --
Maybe I've mentioned it but I

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
haven't driven it home is that in
the microbial world right now 99.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
% of the microbes that life on earth
have never been cultivated.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So it's a vastly unknown universe,
the details.  So the metabolic

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
pathways that I'm describing here
are just the tip of the iceberg in

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
terms of what's possible.
So last time we were talking at the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
biochemical scale.
This time we're now going to scale

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
up and think of these biochemical
processes on a global level.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And we're going to talk about
primary productivity which is really

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
just another word for the collective
photosynthesis of all of the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
photosynthesizers on earth.
So who are the dominant primary

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
producers?  Well,
we've already talked about this.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And just to get ourselves oriented
let's think of in water the primary

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
photosynthetic organisms,
the primary producers are

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
phytoplankton.
And let's just look at one

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
phytoplankton cell,
OK?  This is a single cell so this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
would be maybe ten microns in size.
And inside that cell we have a

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
chloroplast, and you've learned all
this in other lectures and including

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.000
my lectures, which takes up CO2 and
evolves oxygen and makes sugars

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000
which go to, what's the organelle
where respiration takes place?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Mitochondria.  Which goes to the
mitochondrion and is respired.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.000
CO2 is evolved and oxygen is taken
up.  So this little single cell gets

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
through life through photosynthesis
primarily, but it also takes the

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
products of photosynthesis and burns
them inside the cell.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So this is what we call respiration.
And it's important to remember that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
even photosynthetic organisms
respire, OK?  But then there's this

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
whole other group of organisms that
last time we called heterotrophs

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that can only respire.
They rely on the photosynthetic

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
product from photosynthetic
organisms.  So that's in water.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And then on land the main primary
producers, productivity are plants.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And we'll just symbolize these as a
tree.  And we all know that the tree

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
takes up CO2, evolves oxygen.
If you blow this up, you just take

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.000
a leaf, OK?  That's a blowup.
And then you blowup again and take

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
a cell from the leaf.
This cell is identical in function

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to the single microscopic
phytoplankton cell, OK?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So the process in both of these
ecosystems, this could be grass,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
it could be moss, it could be
anything else,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the process is the same in terms of
what's involved in productivity.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
OK.  Now, you have a handout for
this lecture that has a lot of the

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
definitions that I'm going to now
very briefly put on the board.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Oh, I should tell you also that in
the last ten minutes of the lecture

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I'm going to show you another
incredible clip from the Blue Planet

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
series that I showed you last time
so you have something to look

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
forward to.  So let's
define some terms.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Biomass we're going to call B.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And as I said this is all in the
handout.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So I'm just going to give you the
short version here.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the units of this can be of
course anything,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
but normally it's something like
grams carbon per meter squared.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And what does that mean?  Well,
it means if you have, in a

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
terrestrial ecosystem,
OK, where you have trees,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
it would mean that you would
calculate the biomass.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You'd take a square meter and you'd
integrate up and collect all of the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
biomass in that surface area,
OK?  So that's what that means.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So grams carbon in that square
meter.  For an aquatic ecosystem

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
it's the opposite.
You take a square meter of the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:30.000
surface water,
let's put some waves on here,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and you integrate all the way down.
How far?  When will you not have

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
anymore primary,
oh, no, biomass?  When will you no

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
longer have any more photosynthetic
biomass in the oceans or in a lake?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Pycnocline.  Oh,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that's a good answer.
Not necessarily, though.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But it often corresponds to that.
The pycnocline is a density gradient

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in aquatic ecosystems.
But what is absolutely essential

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
for photosynthesis?
Light.  Light.  So you go down

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
until there's no light.
Absolutely.  There won't be any

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
photosynthesis where there's no
light.  This is the one thing we

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
know for sure,
OK?  And that's usually in the

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
oceans around 200 meters.
And in lakes it depends on how rich

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
they are.  In the Charles River it's
about one meter because

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it's such a mess.
In fact, well,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I shouldn't say a mess,
but it's very productive.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
In fact, legend has it, and I don't
know if this is true,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that it's actually safe to swim in
the Charles in terms of the water

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
quality, but the reason you're not
supposed to swim is because the

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
visibility is so bad that if
anything happened they'd never find

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
you.  But I don't know if that is
true.  That could be

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
an urban legend.
OK, so we're going to define gross

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:13.000
primary productivity.
GPP, gross primary productivity is

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the rate of photosynthesis --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
-- and grams carbon per meter
squared per year.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And of course the units here are not,
the absolute units,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000
this could be per day and this could
be per square millimeter if you

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
wanted, but the units are amount per
unit area per unit time,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
OK?  And then we're going to define
the respiration rate,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
the respiration of the autotrophs.
So this would be the respiration

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
rate of the photosynthetic organisms,
which is why we call them R sub A.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And that's going to have the same
units, OK?  So it's grams carbon per

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000
meter squared per unit respired.
And net primary productivity is

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:24.000
then gross primary productivity
minus, so net primary productivity

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.000
of an ecosystem is the amount of
carbon, CO2 that's drawn into the

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000
system through photosynthesis minus
the amount that was respired by the

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
plants, by the organisms that did
the photosynthesis.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
In a sense, you can think of it as
the amount of carbon that actually

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
goes into a plant growing,
OK, that goes into the biomass of a

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
tree or that goes into the division
of a single celled phytoplankton

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
into two phytoplankton.
And then a lot of that is lost

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
through respiration.  OK.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We can also define mean
resonance time --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:28.000
-- as MRT, which is the biomass

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000
divided by the net primary
productivity.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So what are the units of the mean
resonance time?  It should

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.000
be obvious but --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Years, right, or time.
Mean resonance time is time.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And that's really, if you want to
think about it,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
if you think of yourself as a carbon
atom that's drawn into a tree

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
through photosynthesis,
it's the average amount of time you

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:04.000
will spend, your one
atom in that tree.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
OK?  It's the average resonance,
the mean resonance time.  Well,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
actually, that's wrong,
right?  It's not the amount of time

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that you, that one atom will spend,
but it's on average the amount of

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
time that atoms will spend in the
tree.  OK.  And then the

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000
fractional turnover --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
-- is equal to one over the mean
resonance time.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And it has the units of obviously
years to the minus one.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it's the fraction, if you think
of a tree again,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
it's the fraction of the carbon in
that tree that is renewed by new

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
carbon every year.
Now, these two concepts will become

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
very important again when we start
to talk about global biogeochemical

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.000
cycles.
And we'll talk about the resonance

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
time, the various elements in
various components in the earth

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000
system.  OK.  So now let's go on and
look at, first of all,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I should have shown this slide last
time.  I'm trying to not walk around

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.000
too much because this fellow is
filming me or filming

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
these classes.
But we should briefly take a look at

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the absorption spectrum of all of
the plants in the biosphere.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Could we turn the lights down a
little?  Or I guess I'm

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:01.000
in charge of that.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There.  A little bit better maybe.
This is the absorption spectrum of

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
the pigment chlorophyll,
chlorophyll A that is the pigment

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that all green plants have and they
use to absorb sunlight.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And you'll notice that over the
course of evolution all of these

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
white bands are accessory pigments.
That different organisms have

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
evolved to also capture light.
And they pass on that energy to the

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
chlorophyll molecule.
And the point is that if you look

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
across all of the visible light and
even beyond there are pigments that

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
have evolved to capture that solar
energy collectively in the ecosystem.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
OK, so let's look at,
now we're going to look at world net

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
primary productivity.
So essentially photosynthesis on a

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
global scale.  And I'm going to tell
you right up front.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
These numbers are extremely
approximated.  And I've taken these

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
numbers from various textbooks.
Your textbook doesn't even have a

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
table like this in it.
In fact, your textbook is very weak

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
in this section of biology.
But there are always tradeoffs in

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
choosing textbooks.
So I've taken this from textbooks

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and I've rounded off these numbers.
And so I just want you to go

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
through and understand the structure
of the table.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
The idea is not to memorize
particular numbers but understand

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and have a feeling for the relative
amounts of productivity in different

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
ecosystems.  So,
first of all, here's our units of

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
grams per year,
world net primary productivity.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:57.000
These are grams of carbon, OK?  And
if we first look at the total amount

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:03.000
on land, in this particular table is
177 versus the marine total is 54.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But the new estimates,
I've taken this out of sort of more

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
primarily literature than textbooks,
really show these numbers to be more

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.000
like this.  That shows you how
variable this is.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
It changes every decade.
Showing that the amount of

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
photosynthesis in the oceans is
roughly on par with the amount on

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
land.  And to remind you of our
units here, weight-wise this is 50

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to 70 billion Volkswagen's
worth of carbon.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I mean that's a lot of carbon every
year that is going into these

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
ecosystems.  OK,
so let's look and dissect the table

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
a little bit.  Looking at tropical
forests like the rainforest in the

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Amazon that are some of the most
productive ecosystems in the world.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
You can see that over here their net
primary productivity per meter

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
squared is 2,000.
And then you look down here at the

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000
open ocean which on a per meter
squared basis,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
a very unproductive ecosystem,
there are tiny little phytoplankton,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
is 100.  But looking further, before
I get to the but which

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
is the punch line.
That's the trouble with animation.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The biomass in the tropical forest
is enormous, obviously trees,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
whereas the biomass in the open
ocean is very tiny.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But if we look at the percent of
the surface of the earth that is

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
covered by these two different
ecosystems the open ocean is huge

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
compared to the tropical forest.
So on a global scale, because of

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.000
the aerial coverage here these two
ecosystems contribute equally, OK?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So it's a combination of net primary
productivity and the coverage of the

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
global ocean.  OK.
Let's go back to that for a minute.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
So let's --

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
-- talk about turnover times or mean
resonance times.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Just eyeballing it,
can you give me an estimate in terms

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000
of days, months,
years, decades, centuries,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
order of magnitude for the mean
resonance time of carbon in all the

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000
phytoplankton in a
marine ecosystem?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Is it days, months, years,
centuries, decades?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Well, don't guess.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Well, you can guess but minutes is
wrong.  So having guessed minutes is

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
wrong now you use your analytical
brain and you look at this,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
mean resonance time, which is
biomass divided by net primary

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
productivity.  Here's the biomass.
Round that off.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And here's the net primary
productivity.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And the units here is years.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Like a month did I hear?  I didn't
hear.  Right.  It's about one-tenth

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:02.000
of year which is about a month.
About a month.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Does everybody follow that?
It's just to round this off,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
five over 50 is 0.1, biomass over
MPP.  How about for the terrestrial

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
ecosystem, what's the average amount
of time a carbon atom spends

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000
in the average tree?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Years, right?  Decades.
Many years.  Maybe decades to

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
centuries.  This is a way we think
about these things.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
We don't have an exact number.
But you want to get an order of

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
magnitude feeling.
So carbon is turning over very,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
very fast in the marine ecosystem
but very slowly in the terrestrial

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
ecosystem.  And the simple way to
think about that is that

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:52.000
phytoplankton don't have trunks,
but there's a more complicated way

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
to think about it.
OK, so now, all of this primary

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
productivity that we've made,
all of this photosynthesis, as we

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
talked about, is the base of the
food webs in all ecosystems.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
And so we're going to start to
dissect this.  This is a marine food

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
web showing phytoplankton that are
eaten by zooplankton.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
We used to talk about food chains,
but we well now that it's not a

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
chain.  It's really a very complex
web and very hard to put organisms

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and assign them to particular
sections.  Phytoplankton are eaten

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
by zooplankton.
Zooplankton are eaten by worms.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
You've got blue crabs, barnacles,
and the top predators shore birds

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
and sea bass.  Now,
an important part of these food webs

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
is also all of the carbon,
the primary productivity that is not

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
eaten while it's alive.
So some things just die,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
right?  You have dead carbon lying
around.  And that dead carbon falls

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000
into what's called a different food
web, the detritus food web.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
And we're going to talk about that.
And it comes from all of these

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
different components in the food web.
So now we're going to more

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
analytically look at the flow of
carbon.  And when we talk about

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
carbon we are also talking about
energy, right?

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Carbon and energy are the same
thing.  I mean they're

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
interconvertable.
So we're going to look at the flow

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000
of carbon from the phytoplankton to
the zooplankton through that trophic

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
level.  And to do this we have to
talk about some definitions.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And again this is in your handout
so I'm not going to write all this

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.000
on the board but we'll just walk
through this.  The flow of carbon or

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
energy through a trophic level,
which is one of these links, OK?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
This is one trophic level.
This is the next trophic level.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Or you can also think of this as an
organism.  This type of analysis

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
applies to both.
And we start out with the

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
productivity at trophic level and
minus one, OK?

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And so the first would be primary
productivity coming into the system.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Some of that productivity, some of
that carbon is not ingested by the

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
next trophic level.
That's lost as dead organic matter,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000
detritus, whatever we want to call
it.  So that's D sub n the portion

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
not consumed.  Then some of it is
ingested by the organism,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I sub n.  And then some fraction of
that is assimilated by the organism.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
That means it's taken into its
biochemistry and goes toward

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
building biomass.
And some of it is lost as fecal

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
matter produced,
that's F sub n.  And urine would

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000
also be a part of this,
waste products.  And then some of it

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
is then, the rest of it is then
available, oh,

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
some of it, this is important,
is lost as respiration.  And then

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
the rest is available as
productivity for the next

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
trophic level.  OK.
So different types of organisms.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
First, before we get to that, using
this analysis we can start to define

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
efficiencies of energy conversion
through this system.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.000
And this is because different types
of organisms assimilate carbon with

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
different efficiencies.
And that is important in the flow

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
of carbon through different
types of ecosystems.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
So let's look at the first
efficiency that would be I,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
ingested, reflecting the amount
that's ingested relative to the

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
amount that's available.
And this is called the exploitation

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
efficiency, OK?
I sub n divided by P sub n minus

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
one.  The next one similarly would
be A sub n, the amount that's

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
assimilated relative to the amount
that's ingested.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And that is the assimilation
efficiency.  And finally the amount

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000
that goes to the next trophic level
divided by the amount that's

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
assimilated, which is the production
efficiency, the amount that actually

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
goes to productivity that is
assimilated.  And these all

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
multiplied together give you the
ecological efficiency.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And that is sometimes called the
trophic transfer efficiency.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.000
That's the amount of carbon that is
basically lost as you go through one

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
trophic level.
And usually, and we'll talk about

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
this in a minute,
this is 10% to 20% actually makes it

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:27.000
through the system,
and the rest is lost to respiration

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.000
or detritus or fecal matter.
OK, so let's talk about now how

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:42.000
different organisms vary in terms of
efficiencies.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:50.000
We have, in terms of the

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:58.000
exploitation efficiency,
if you're talking about, for example,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:06.000
tree insects.
So insects feeding on trees is about

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:15.000
1% to 10%.  They don't take that
much of the tree.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:24.000
If it's grass to animals it's more
like 20%.  And if it's phytoplankton

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:33.000
to zooplankton it's more
like 20% to 40%.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
In other words,
zooplankton harvests much of the

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
primary productivity,
no, almost half of the productivity

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
that the phytoplankton have made.
OK.  What about assimilation

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000
efficiency?  How does this vary
between organisms?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Well, this one, you can think about
it as if you eat food that is,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
I was going to say not you, but it
is true, we are all animals so it

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
applies to us, too.
If you eat food that is similar in

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
composition to your own bodily
composition you're more efficient at

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
assimilating it because you don't
have to break it down as much and

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000
reorganize it.
So herbivores,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.000
organisms that eat plant matter are
20% to 50% efficient in

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
their assimilation.
But carnivores is more like 80%.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Because you are meat and if you eat
meat you don't have as much waste

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:49.000
than if you eat a lot of fiber.
So there are big differences there.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And then in terms of, that is not a
value judgment on whether you should

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:03.000
eat meat or not.
I just want to make that very clear.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
What?  OK.  But later on we'll talk
about the difference between eating

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
meat globally and being vegetarians
in terms of utilizing primary

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
productivity on the earth.
But in terms of production

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
efficiency you have warm-blooded
organisms having a 2% production

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:35.000
efficiency.
Whereas cold-blooded have a 40%

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:45.000
production efficiency.
Why would that be?

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Yes.  If you're warm-blooded,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
does anybody know the technical term
for that?  It is if you

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
are homeotherm.
Or what did you say?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Endothermic.  I'm not sure.
I think that's chemistry.  It

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
sounded good, though.
So there are homeotherms and

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:19.000
heterotherms.  It doesn't matter.
The point is that these have to

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000
maintain their body temperature like
we do.  That takes a lot of energy.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Whereas, these go with the flow so
to speak, that technical term.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
But that doesn't take as much energy.
If it's cold they just let their

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
body get cold.
They don't burn,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
burn, burn to keep the temperature
constant.  OK,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
so that's how organisms differ.
Now let's move on to the next

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
chapter in which now we are
going to look at --

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
We were looking at the flow through
one trophic level.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Now we're going to connect a whole
bunch of trophic levels.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
We're going to look at the flow of
energy through this component of

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
this food web and do a more thorough
analysis.  OK,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.000
so this gets kind of messy but let's
start here.  I better use the

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
powerful one.  OK,
so each one of these is what we call

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000
a trophic level.
And these are the primary producers,

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:37.000
the photosynthetic organisms.  Here
is our gross primary production

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
absorbing sunlight.
Some of that is lost to heat.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Some of that is lost to respiration.
Here is our little R sub A,

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
remember?  Right here.  And some of
it, the net primary productivity is

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.000
available for ingestion at the next
trophic level which are

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
the herbivores.
So all we're doing here is ganging

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000
up a whole bunch of those individual
analyses.  And then the next trophic

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:11.000
levels are the carnivores and then
the second carnivores.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
And the number of links you have
here is something that is obviously

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
determined by the efficiency of
transfer from one to another and the

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
total amount of energy that comes
into the system.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So here in our ecosystem we have
carbon being lost at each

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
step to detritus.
And you have feces at each link.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
This all goes down and becomes part
of the detritus food web.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
And in that you have two forms of
carbon.  You have particulate

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
organic carbon which is pieces of
dead carbon floating around,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000
dead leaves, dead phytoplankton,
whatever.  And then you also have

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
dissolved organic carbon.
When these plants die and the

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
phytoplankton die they burst open.
And the glucose and amino acids and

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
all of that dissolve into the water
in the system.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And that becomes dissolved organic
carbon which is available for this

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000
microbial food web,
an entirely different food web

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
that's coupled to the system.
So you have the detritivore.  This

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
the grazing food web here.
The waste from that goes to the

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
detritivores and the microbes.
And then whatever is left over

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000
after that is called refractory
carbon.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
That means none of the creatures are
able to break it open and really get

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:42.000
energy out of it.
And in the big picture what is this?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
We talked about it actually last
time.  Fossil fuel,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
exactly.  This is the carbon that
actually accumulates over time that

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
when ecosystems are finished
processing all of the

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:07.000
primary production.
OK, so I'm trying to time this right

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:15.000
so that we make sure we have time
for the movie.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000
So let's look at a couple of ways
we can think about this.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Let's just compare.
If we look at the open ocean

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000
ecosystem versus the
tropical forest.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:46.000
And the average,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:56.000
oh, I forgot one thing.
OK.  If we take now the gross

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:03.000
primary productivity.
And I'm going to circle all of the

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
respirations.  See the purple here?
So this is all the carbon that's

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
being fixed.  This is that is lost
to respiration.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And we can define a new parameter
which is net ecosystem production.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
And that is gross primary
production minus the respiration of

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
all of the autotrophies,
R sub A, minus the respiration of

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
all of the heterotrophic components
of the system.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:45.000
So that would be the herbivores,
carnivores, detritivores,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
microorganisms.
That's all the carbon that's

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:58.000
respired and lost to CO2.
So you can add this to this.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000
So we'd have net ecosystem
production.  Production equals GPP

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
minus RA minus the sum of all the
heterotrophs.  Now,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:19.000
in very mature ecosystems this net
ecosystem production is essentially

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
nothing.  All right?
Everything that's produced is

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
consumed.
For example, in a tropical

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
rainforest you don't have a huge
buildup of organic carbon in a

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
tropical rainforest.
Everything that's produced is

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
basically consumed and this is zero.
But in a young forest, say a

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
plantation at the extreme where you
plant trees and they're increasing

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
in biomass, then obviously this net
ecosystem production is a positive

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
number.  What if net ecosystem
production is a negative number?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:09.000
It won't be there for long,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
right?  You've got to have things
photosynthesizing net at least

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
enough to maintain the ecosystem.
I mean you can have it for a

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:27.000
transient for not any steady state.
OK.  All right.  Talking about

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.000
ecological efficiencies again.
If we talk about the average --

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:43.000
The average ecological efficiency of

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:51.000
the open ocean is about 25% and of
the tropical rain forest is about 5%.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:59.000
So the average number of trophic
levels, that's basically the number

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:08.000
of links in the food web in these
two systems is about 7.1 and 3.2.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
In other words,
when you have more efficiency of

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:21.000
transfer from one link to another
you can have more links obviously.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:28.000
So getting back to humans again,
and this gets back to in terms of

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:35.000
what we might think about as a
global human society.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:49.000
If you go from wheat to man you lose
90% of the energy in that transfer.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:38:03.000
If you go from wheat to cows to man
you lose 90% here and

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:12.000
you lose 90% here.
So obviously in terms of feeding the

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.000
world it's much better to go
directly from wheat to humans than

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
to go from wheat to cows to humans.
You all know this but it's

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
important to remember that.
And unfortunately the trend in the

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
world is to go more from here to
here instead of the

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000
other way around.
Just something to remember in terms

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
of the application of this knowledge.
OK.  Finally very quickly I'm going

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:46.000
to skip over this and go to another
way to look at what we've been

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:51.000
talking about.
It's just another diagram of the

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
same thing.  You have the
photosynthetic organisms that the

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
entire world depends on,
this productivity for food and fiber.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
And that most of that is lost
through respiration and the rest

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
goes to the other organisms
including detritivores.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
So a big question is how much of
this global primary productivity,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
this global photosynthesis have
humans taken over?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
It's really hard to answer that
question, OK, but a lot of

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
ecologists have been working very
hard at understanding the fraction

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
of global photosynthesis that has
been what's called co-opted

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
by humans.
And the estimates range from 10% to

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
55%.  The amount that we use
directly as food or fuel or fiber or

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
timber is not that great,
but there's a lot of productivity

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:56.000
that's diverted as crop waste,
burning, et cetera.  And land

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
conversion obviously uses up a lot
of habitat and productivity.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So the significant point here is
that as we co-opt this primary

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
productivity we change dramatically
all of the food webs that rely on it,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
and that is what is part of the path
to extinction of a lot of species.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And the big question is how much
can we co-opt?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
I mean we're on the road to taking
over the primary productivity of the

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
earth, there's no question,
completely.  Unless we set up

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
reserves that's it, that's
where we're marching.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Now, when we're in charge of it,
is it going to function the way we

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
need it to function to maintain our
atmosphere and to provide us with

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
the food and fiber that we need?
That's still an open question.  OK,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
so now I'm going to show you this
really neat DVD because these

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
pictures of food webs are deadly
dull and don't represent anything at

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
all of what the reality is like.
So I'm going to show you three

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
weeks in the life of
a real food web.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
And I want you to think about two
things when you're watching it.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Don't just think you're at home in
front of your TV watching a nature

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
show and going brain dead or
something.  Think about what you've

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
learned in this class.
So think about the gigatons of

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
carbon that are flowing through this
system.  More importantly this

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
entire food web and everything
that's going on in it is

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
orchestrated by the information in
the genes of the organisms

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
in the food web.
That's the information content that

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
structures this whole thing.
And how it's all orchestrated and

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
coordinated and happens the same way
more or less every year is

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
absolutely mind blowing as far as
I'm concern and a major,

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
major challenge for ecology and for
molecular ecology.  OK.

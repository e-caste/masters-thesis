00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.650
ANDREW LO: In today's
lecture, I want

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.300
to continue where we
were last time in talking

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.310
about applications of the
net present value rule

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.210
to capital budgeting
and project financing.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.370
As promised, today
what I'm going to do

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.750
is to talk specifically
about other alternatives

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.550
to net present value
that are not recommended,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.740
but which you need
to know about simply

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.790
because they actually are used
in practice to some degree.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.880
And you have to be an
intelligent consumer

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.709
of all of these
different ideas so

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.120
that you can pick and choose.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.740
And actually, there
are some instances

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.780
where these other
alternatives can

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.050
shed some light on
the particular problem

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.030
and challenges at hand.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.120
I'll try to describe
those as we go over them.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.000
Before I do, a student
came up and asked me

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.200
about a concept called
adjusted present value.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.700
I wanted just to
make a note of that

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.670
because, so far, we've
been talking about NPV.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.400
But in fact, both the textbook,
as well as the best practices,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.380
would suggest that
you use something

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.020
called adjusted present value.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.910
Which basically
makes adjustments

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.480
for things like taxes,
project interactions,

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.880
strategic alternatives,
optionality, and so on.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.400
I want to recommend that you
first of all, keep in mind

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.490
this notion of
adjusted present value.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.030
That's what you'll be learning
about in 402, and in more

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.310
advanced courses on capital
budgeting and project

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.340
financing.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.670
So for now, NPV is
the right answer,

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.270
but when you learn more about
how to make those adjustments,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.750
you're going to
want to use them,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.780
and then we call the particular
criterion APV instead of NPF.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.479
Just terminology that
you should be aware of.

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:21.520
All right, so what I want
to do today, as I said,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.560
is to talk about three other
approaches to capital budgeting

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.190
that various professionals
have used in the past,

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.740
and which some are used to
a great extent even today.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.570
And they are payback period and
the discounted version of that

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.300
called discounted payback.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.110
Second is the IRR,
Internal Rate of Return,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.370
and the third is the
profitability index.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.800
Each of these have its
own particular uses,

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.590
and I'm going to try to describe
them to you very briefly.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.530
And then we're going to talk
about different applications.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.050
The bottom line, just
to be sure that there's

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:08.240
no misunderstanding, NPV is
always the right thing to do.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.190
So that's what we're
recommending for any capital

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.300
budgeting application.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.630
However, you should
still understand

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.610
what these three other
alternatives are so

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.010
that you can speak about
them intelligently, talk

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.020
about their advantages,
and disadvantages.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.600
All right, so let's get started.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.980
Payback period-- oh, question.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.130
Yeah?

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.558
AUDIENCE: Is this
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:03:30.558 --> 00:03:34.075
I mean you speak pretty
firmly about NPV being better.

00:03:34.075 --> 00:03:34.700
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.370
So is it people using those
other methods are wrong,

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:46.600
or less intelligent, or is there
anyway to kindly describe that?

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.689
ANDREW LO: So the
question is, why are they

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:49.980
using these other alternatives?

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.930
Let me get to that later, OK?

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.420
I mean, one could argue that
they're less intelligent.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.490
Not everybody is
able to get into MIT

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.490
and take this wonderful course.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.910
So by definition,
they're less intelligent.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.350
But no, I don't want to make
such a blanket statement.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.840
I think that,
partly, you'll find

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.880
that these other
techniques have been

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.709
used in practice both
because of cultural inertia.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.200
They were the first to
have come on the scene

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.630
before NOV was fully worked out.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.039
So people are just used
to doing things the way

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.080
they're used to doing it.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.970
People don't like
change, necessarily,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.520
when it's particularly
forced upon them.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.200
But the second reason is that
these other methods capture

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.560
other aspects of risk
that, in certain cases,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.950
may actually be more important
for the particular individual

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.730
decision makers.

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.635
For example, we've
talked about a lot

00:04:43.635 --> 00:04:44.760
of different kinds of risk.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.030
Market risk, estimation
risk, credit risk.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.580
But what's the most
important risk to all of you

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.120
once you start
working in your jobs?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.996
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:56.661
ANDREW LO: What?

00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:57.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.371
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:04:58.371 --> 00:04:59.410
Career risk.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.310
Career risk is probably
the most important risk

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:06.400
from the typical perspective
of the decision maker.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.200
And frankly, some
of these measures

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:12.010
that I'm about to describe
focus on career risk

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.590
more than they do on the
risk to the investor,

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:15.940
or the shareholder.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.450
What I'd like you all to
focus on in doing your jobs

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:22.540
is to try to maximize
the value of the company

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.700
from the perspective of
the owners of the company.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.010
You are agents of the
owners, so therefore, you

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.070
want to maximize the
value to the shareholders.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.460
But in fact, the
way people behave

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.180
is often somewhat different.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.850
So we'll talk about
that as we describe

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.230
each of these measures.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.720
In fact, let's talk about
the first measure as a way

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.460
to illustrate the point
about career risk.

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.550
Payback period is a
very simple concept.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.030
It is simply the
minimum number of years

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.420
that it requires for a
particular investment

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.800
to pay back.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.024
So if you invest a million
dollars in a project,

00:06:00.024 --> 00:06:02.440
and it's going to generate
some revenues, the question is,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.440
how long is it going to take
before the project earns

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.400
a million dollars?

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.820
Namely, it pays back
the original investment.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.620
So the definition,
here, is simple.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.490
If you assume that
cf1 through cfk

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.740
are the cash flows
to the project,

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.590
and you invest a
certain amount of cash,

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.010
cf0, initially, then the
question is, how long a period

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.360
do you need so that the sum
of the future cash flows

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.140
exceeds the initial investment?

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.670
What's the minimum number of
periods for that to happen?

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:43.470
And that minimum, k, is
called the payback period.

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.250
Now, right away you
see that there's

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.200
a problem because
we're adding cash

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.700
flows in different periods.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.050
So I hope by now, when you look
at an expression like that,

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:58.970
it causes you great
cognitive dissonance and pain

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.020
to look at that.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.730
It's like adding pounds to yen.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.950
Remember we did that the
first day of class, right?

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:07.190
Three pounds plus
25 yen is what?

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:08.150
I don't know.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.100
So when you're adding
these cash flows,

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.670
it doesn't make sense because
you're adding different units.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:15.170
But let's forget
about that for now.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.795
Let's just look at
the equation and try

00:07:16.795 --> 00:07:19.460
to divine what we mean from it.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.160
For independent
projects, a criterion

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.280
that you might
construct using payback

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.800
is to accept the project
if k is less than

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.160
or equal to some pre-specified
threshold, t star.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.480
And for mutually
exclusive projects,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.690
where you can only take
one, pick the project

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.900
that has the smallest
payback period

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.830
subject to that
threshold t star.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.370
That's the typical
approach to using payback.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.420
Clearly, this is a relatively
shortsighted approach.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.500
It doesn't take into account
scale, how much money you're

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.650
going to make from this.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:57.140
It doesn't take
into account risk,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.000
other than the risk of
not getting paid back.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.740
So it's a very,
very narrow focus

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.520
in terms of what it's
trying to accomplish.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.500
Now, we can try to fix this.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.260
And we can fix this by
using discounted payback.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.270
So now at least, the cash
flows are in the same units.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.180
So you can use
discounted payback,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:25.140
but it still ignores the cash
flows after the payback period.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.740
So in particular, you
can have a project

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:32.450
that requires cash inflow
today, that then generates

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.150
a bunch of positive
cash flows thereafter,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.179
but then after the payback
period, in some future date,

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:40.730
it generates tremendously
negative cash flows.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:43.970
Either because of some kind
of liabilities that it incurs,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.890
or some other additional
investments that it

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:47.570
requires to keep it going.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.300
All of that stuff is
ignored by payback.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.770
So in particular, this
can have a negative NPV,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.810
but you might still
want to take it

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.320
because it pays
back in a relatively

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.940
short period of time.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.500
That's a mistake.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.390
But you can understand
how something

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.290
like this ended up getting
put into practice, right?

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:11.030
Career risk.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.130
If you're a manager
of a division,

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.180
and your job when you were hired
is to turn it around and make

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.420
it profitable, then
it's very important

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.260
that you take on projects
with short payback periods.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.300
But that's not necessarily
in the best interests

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:31.010
of the company, or of the
investors, or even of yourself

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:34.370
if the incentives have
been properly calibrated.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.430
In other words, if, as part
of your compensation contract,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.340
they say, here, you get a
bunch of stock in the company.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.980
We want you to maximize the
value of the shareholders.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:45.920
Then what you ought to be
doing is maximizing NPV.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.980
You're not supposed to be
focusing on other aspects.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.220
But as a practical matter,
people look at this.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.920
People want to know how
long is it going to be

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.810
before this thing pays back.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.470
Now, I don't want to argue that
it's completely irrational.

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:04.280
Can anybody give me a rationale
for why payback is actually

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.770
a sensible thing to consider?

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.410
Yeah, David?

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.334
AUDIENCE: The main
thing that fueled

00:10:08.334 --> 00:10:10.739
this, in an NPV
calculation, you're

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:12.670
assuming that you know
what cash flow's going

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:13.840
to be way out in the future.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.350
ANDREW LO: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.379
AUDIENCE: And if
you have a big cash

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:17.003
flow way out in the
future end, there's

00:10:17.003 --> 00:10:19.440
so little certainty your
career's attached to that--

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.440
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.821
AUDIENCE: --you'd want to weight
effort more towards a calculus

00:10:23.821 --> 00:10:24.790
and--

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:25.790
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.000
So apart from the career
risk, which you mentioned,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.220
but I want to downplay
that because I

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.610
want to argue that it
is possible for payback

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:35.620
to add value to shareholders.

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.700
Simply because there is an
implicit recognition for those

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.970
who use payback that it's
really hard to estimate

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:45.160
what's going to happen
in the distant future.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.790
So if you've got a project
that pays back sooner rather

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.120
than later, that's
probably better

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.760
because there's less
certainty about what's

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.960
going to happen in the future.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.150
Now there's a lot of if's
in that statement, right?

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:03.280
If really what you're
concerned about

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:06.640
is the growing uncertainty
of the project,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.520
that ought to be reflected
in the discount rates.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.630
So I'm not saying that
you should ignore it.

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:16.390
What I'm saying is that payback
is not necessarily the best

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.190
way of capturing it.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.380
Although I think we could
acknowledge that it does

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.120
serve a useful
purpose in the sense

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:25.990
that it is focusing your
attention on the relatively

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.410
recent periods of cash flows.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:31.210
But there may be better
ways of taking care

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.412
of that, if that's the issue.

00:11:33.412 --> 00:11:34.920
A question or comment?

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.596
Yeah?

00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:36.550
AUDIENCE: Liquidity?

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:37.216
ANDREW LO: Yeah?

00:11:37.216 --> 00:11:40.605
AUDIENCE: If you have a project
that takes cash outflow up

00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:43.331
front, and then
years and years out,

00:11:43.331 --> 00:11:47.273
it gives you a big cash inflow.

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:51.060
From that time until the cash
outflow, you get nothing?

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:51.730
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.235
AUDIENCE: That could even
present some problems

00:11:53.235 --> 00:11:53.880
in finance.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:54.880
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.930
So another aspect of payback
is this liquidity issue.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:11:59.550
In other words,
projects that pay back

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.970
in a shorter period of
time require less liquidity

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.830
over longer horizons.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:08.782
However, once again I'm going to
say, if liquidity is the issue,

00:12:08.782 --> 00:12:10.740
you ought to take that
into account explicitly,

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.710
and understand what the term
structure of your borrowing

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.240
costs are over
different periods.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.821
If you factor that in, then
it should already be in there.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:19.320
If.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.270
AUDIENCE: Is that closer to a
discount rate or something--

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.603
ANDREW LO: That's right, it can.

00:12:22.603 --> 00:12:24.900
It should certainly,
because we know

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.290
that there is a yield curve.

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:28.890
The typical yield curve
is upward sloping.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.600
Typical I say, not always.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.575
But the typical yield
curve is upward sloping.

00:12:32.575 --> 00:12:34.200
What that's telling
you is that there's

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.470
a premium for borrowing longer.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.140
So that basically gets
at your liquidity issue.

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.870
But if you have additional
concerns above and beyond that,

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.910
that should be reflected
in your calculations.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.950
Payback is an inefficient
way of capturing that.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.060
It's a very zero-one kind
of an approach to dealing

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.590
with that kind of an issue.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:53.237
Yeah?

00:12:53.237 --> 00:12:55.487
AUDIENCE: Think that people
they lose the payback when

00:12:55.487 --> 00:12:58.204
they believe that
the cash flow is

00:12:58.204 --> 00:13:00.180
the same all over the period.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.662
Which really makes sense.

00:13:01.662 --> 00:13:03.649
Like in multiple.

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:05.940
ANDREW LO: So you're saying
that it doesn't make sense.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.564
AUDIENCE: It makes
sense, when the cash

00:13:07.564 --> 00:13:08.560
flow will be the same--

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.020
ANDREW LO: If the cash,
yes, that's right.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.500
If the cash flow is going to
be level, then it makes sense.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:12.780
You're right.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.686
AUDIENCE: Like multiple.

00:13:13.686 --> 00:13:15.519
You have a multiple for
industry, you use it

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:16.410
and you have it.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.030
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:20.520
There are conditions
under which payback

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.200
can give you sensible results.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.390
But think about how restrictive
those conditions are.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.270
You need to have
level cash flows,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:31.530
and moreover, you have to be
comparing projects, all of whom

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.620
have level cash flows and
have comparable risks.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.527
If they have different risks, or
different levels of cash flows,

00:13:37.527 --> 00:13:39.360
or different liquidity,
all of those things,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.770
cannot be captured by payback.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.800
So I don't want to
beat up too much on it.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.650
This is a relatively
easy target.

00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:51.230
The point is that it
provides some information,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.825
and you should know what it is.

00:13:52.825 --> 00:13:54.700
Regardless of whether
you're going to use it.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.260
You ought to be able to
have that at your fingertips

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:59.770
so when somebody says,
and undoubtedly somebody

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.830
will say to you, when
you're pushing a project,

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:05.684
they're going to say,
what's the payback period.

00:14:05.684 --> 00:14:06.850
You need to know the answer.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.380
It's not good enough
for you to say,

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.780
my 401 professor told me
it doesn't make sense.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.820
You've got to basically
have an answer,

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.240
and then argue that
while payback doesn't

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.535
summarize all of
the characteristics

00:14:18.535 --> 00:14:19.660
that we're concerned about.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.810
Second method, the
profitability index.

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:31.390
Now this one is another
easy criterion to criticize,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:36.010
but it's so close to NPV that
the only thing that really is

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.510
an issue is the scale factor.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.940
So let me explain.

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:46.652
Profitability index is simply
the gross present value, as

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:47.860
opposed to net present value.

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.380
It's the gross
present value, divided

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.120
by the initial investment.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:58.030
So the present value is
simply the present value

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:02.450
of all the cash flows, divided
by the initial investment.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.840
So you could think of it
as a gross rate of return.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.390
In other words, 1
plus the net rate

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.680
of return of your
investment in this project.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.260
If the profitability
index is greater than 1,

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:16.830
take the project.

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.550
If it's less than 1,
don't take the project.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.150
And if you've got a bunch of
mutually exclusive projects,

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.270
pick the one that has the
highest profitability index.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.980
That's the approach.

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:33.886
Now what's wrong with this?

00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:36.280
It's not that far off from NPV.

00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.550
In fact, you could show
that with a profitability

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.420
index is greater than 1, you've
got a positive NPV project.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.880
When the profitability
index is less than 1,

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.450
you've got a
negative NPV project.

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:51.640
So in terms of taking
or not taking a project,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.479
it's actually the same as NPV.

00:15:53.479 --> 00:15:54.417
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:54.417 --> 00:15:56.996
AUDIENCE: The thing it doesn't
tell you is how much they

00:15:56.996 --> 00:15:59.290
usually must have [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:01.486
It can be $1 or $1 billion.

00:16:01.486 --> 00:16:02.860
ANDREW LO: That's
right, exactly.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.651
There's nothing that
tells you about scale.

00:16:04.651 --> 00:16:09.990
So, if you guys give me
$1 and I give you back $2,

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.300
that's going to have a
profitability index of 2.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.870
Which is going to look
really good relative

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.690
to an investment in
Berkshire Hathaway

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.220
20 years ago, because that
may not have given you

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:24.170
the same profitability index.

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.090
But Warren Buffett has
made a lot more money

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.710
than just a dollar.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.930
So, this ignores
scale and that's

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:32.210
obviously something
that you can't

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:36.350
afford to do when you've got
mutually exclusive projects

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.589
where you're ranking them.

00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:40.130
You don't want to pick the one
with the highest profitability

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.629
index.

00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:42.680
What you want to do is
to pick the one that

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:45.470
is generating the
most value for you,

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.480
in terms of dollars and cents.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.190
In other words, NPV.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:53.825
So once again, NPV, although
is very close to this,

00:16:53.825 --> 00:16:55.700
is actually preferred
because you're actually

00:16:55.700 --> 00:17:01.700
getting a hard amount of dollars
and cents as the bottom line.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.420
Any questions about
profitability index?

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.688
Yes?

00:17:07.688 --> 00:17:10.108
AUDIENCE: A lot of time,
the money that you have

00:17:10.108 --> 00:17:13.788
in hand investment is limited.

00:17:13.788 --> 00:17:18.280
[INAUDIBLE] play into a role
like when you have projects.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.130
ANDREW LO: Well, it
does play a role.

00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:25.119
So the question is, if you
have a limited amount of money

00:17:25.119 --> 00:17:27.700
to invest, does
that play a role?

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.650
It absolutely does
play a role, but it

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:34.420
plays a role that is contrary
to what the profitability

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.310
index wants to do for you.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.960
The profitability
index is simply

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:41.410
telling you whether something
is a positive or negative NPV.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.219
It's not telling
you how much NPV

00:17:43.219 --> 00:17:45.010
you're going to get
for the amount of money

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:46.750
you're going to invest.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:50.260
So what you need to do is
to focus on the latter.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.390
In other words, how
much cash are you

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:55.450
going to be able to generate
from a particular project?

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:57.970
$50, or $50 million?

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.810
That really makes
a big difference.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:02.740
Particularly, if what you have
is a limited amount of cash,

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.760
scale is actually an
important concept to you.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.310
The reason that economists
and financial economists,

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:13.030
by extension, focus
on rates of return?

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:16.900
Did that ever strike
you as being rather odd?

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:19.120
In other words, when you
talk to business people,

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.000
very often they'll speak
in terms of dollar amounts.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.730
Like, a startup
costs $15 million,

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:29.320
or the profits for last quarter
was a million and a half

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:30.850
dollars.

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.190
They won't talk always
in rates of return.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:36.070
Whereas economists, particularly
financial economists,

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:38.114
they express everything
in rates of return.

00:18:38.114 --> 00:18:40.030
I mean, that's what we've
done in this course.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:44.920
We've spent most of our time
focusing on r, not on v. v

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.880
for value, r for return.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.610
Anybody know why that is?

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:49.273
Yeah?

00:18:49.273 --> 00:18:51.245
AUDIENCE: We always
look about opportunity

00:18:51.245 --> 00:18:54.696
that we miss so maybe we
can change the direction

00:18:54.696 --> 00:18:57.670
of our money [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.110
ANDREW LO: Well, that's true.

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.734
But why focus on return
as opposed to dollars?

00:19:01.734 --> 00:19:03.400
I mean, if we're
thinking about changing

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.230
the direction of
our portfolio, you

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.940
might think about
investing, instead

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:09.670
of a hundred thousand
dollars in high tech stocks,

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.370
take that money and invest
a hundred thousand dollars

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.660
in manufacturing.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.730
It's still about dollars
and cents, isn't it?

00:19:15.730 --> 00:19:18.169
When you think about your
portfolio, at some point,

00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:20.210
you've got to look at how
much money do you have,

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:22.501
how much money did you have,
and is the current greater

00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:23.230
than the latter.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.840
You want to know whether
or not you've made money.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:29.811
Why the focus on
r in this course?

00:19:29.811 --> 00:19:30.310
Yeah, Zeke?

00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:32.260
AUDIENCE: Could be to
get rid of the units.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.760
ANDREW LO: I know, it
is to get rid of units.

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.551
But why do we want to
get rid of the units?

00:19:35.551 --> 00:19:37.262
AUDIENCE: Compared
to their numbers?

00:19:37.262 --> 00:19:38.470
ANDREW LO: But wait a minute.

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:41.085
Why can't you compare
dollars to dollars?

00:19:41.085 --> 00:19:42.460
I mean, you're
right that you can

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:45.100
compare a 3% increase
in General Motors

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.320
to a 2% decline in Microsoft.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.400
But you could also
compare a hundred thousand

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.910
dollar increase in your
portfolio in General Motors,

00:19:51.910 --> 00:19:56.840
versus a $50,000
loss in Microsoft.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.520
Yeah, Courtney?

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.894
AUDIENCE: It goes back
to scale because it's

00:20:00.894 --> 00:20:04.200
a $50,000 [INAUDIBLE]
for that company,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:08.225
but it could be your
entire company's profit.

00:20:08.225 --> 00:20:12.230
So it shows a return on
an individualized basis.

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.850
ANDREW LO: It shows the return
on an individualized basis,

00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:16.070
and it gets rid of the scale.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.580
That's true.

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:21.030
So you're able to compare the
scale for different companies,

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.200
but what's wrong with
using dollars to do that?

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.490
I mean, if you're an investor.

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:27.470
So from the investor's
perspective,

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.810
if you're looking at an
investment in General Electric

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:33.230
versus Microsoft, wouldn't
dollars make more sense?

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:35.750
Rather than returns?

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:37.540
Because you can still
compare them, right?

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.040
Yeah?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.964
AUDIENCE: If you're
going to invest

00:20:39.964 --> 00:20:43.331
x amount in both companies, it
might create a greater impact

00:20:43.331 --> 00:20:44.293
on one.

00:20:44.293 --> 00:20:47.660
And you want to see where
your money is going to be or--

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:50.130
ANDREW LO: OK, you're
on the right idea.

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:53.570
You have the right elements,
but you haven't put it together.

00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:55.780
It's true that
scale is the issue,

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:58.220
so you've got your finger
on the right concept.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.230
But what about scale
is the issue here?

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.800
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.205
AUDIENCE: I think you want
to develop a theory that says

00:21:03.205 --> 00:21:06.172
[INAUDIBLE], that
basically you can tell them

00:21:06.172 --> 00:21:08.932
what's your return in
terms of percentages

00:21:08.932 --> 00:21:10.890
and then they can decide
I want to invest $100,

00:21:10.890 --> 00:21:12.770
I want to invest
a million dollars.

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.436
ANDREW LO: Good.

00:21:13.436 --> 00:21:15.140
So that's following
in Courtney's point

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:17.820
that we want to develop a
theory that suits all investors,

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.700
so it's not focused on scale.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:22.970
But implicit in not
focusing on scale,

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.176
we're making another assumption.

00:21:26.176 --> 00:21:27.050
What are we assuming?

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:27.550
Mike?

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.889
AUDIENCE: In terms of focusing
on the marginal dollar,

00:21:29.889 --> 00:21:33.826
you should actually
take the highest return.

00:21:33.826 --> 00:21:36.246
If someone's going to
triple that $3 investment,

00:21:36.246 --> 00:21:38.302
you should at least put
your first $3 in that.

00:21:38.302 --> 00:21:39.625
Give them bang for your buck.

00:21:39.625 --> 00:21:42.040
And then go down
until you're getting

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.570
to a lower marginal return
on larger investments.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:46.460
ANDREW LO: And why
should you do that?

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.624
Why should you go down
the line in that manner?

00:21:50.624 --> 00:21:53.972
AUDIENCE: Because that will
maximize your overall return.

00:21:53.972 --> 00:21:55.180
ANDREW LO: But wait a minute.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.480
I thought that if we
put our money across all

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.670
of these various different
projects in proportion

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:03.900
to the standard portfolio
theory, the tangency portfolio,

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.920
we get the biggest
bang per unit risk.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.730
So, are you saying we
ought to deviate from that?

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:14.340
What about the theory
that we developed

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:18.900
requires us to focus on
returns, rather than on dollars

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.370
invested.

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.100
You've all been very patient
in not bringing up this issue.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:26.160
You've just taken it as given
that I'm telling you the truth

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.690
about focusing on returns.

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:31.950
Why not focus on the actual
dollars that you invest?

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:32.469
Remy.

00:22:32.469 --> 00:22:34.427
AUDIENCE: Focusing on
return is the easiest way

00:22:34.427 --> 00:22:37.990
to weigh it versus the risk.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.730
ANDREW LO: That's
true, it does make

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.590
it easy to weigh it
against the risk.

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:44.440
But in the end, don't you care
about what your dollars at risk

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.135
are?

00:22:45.135 --> 00:22:46.676
AUDIENCE: You can't
check out what it

00:22:46.676 --> 00:22:50.670
is on the tangency portfolio.

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:54.180
ANDREW LO: Well, I could rewrite
the tangency portfolio in terms

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.100
of dollars, instead of return.

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.600
AUDIENCE: You don't
want to do that.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.641
ANDREW LO: I don't want
to do that, you're right.

00:22:59.641 --> 00:23:00.810
Why don't I want to do that?

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.580
Aside from the fact
that the fonts are not

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:05.190
going to fit on that axis.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.820
Well you're on the right track.

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.320
All of you.

00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:09.207
I think you sense
what I'm getting at,

00:23:09.207 --> 00:23:10.790
but you haven't put
your finger on it.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.450
Let me tie it all
together, and tell you

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.449
where you're getting,
because I think that we're

00:23:14.449 --> 00:23:16.315
going to get there eventually.

00:23:16.315 --> 00:23:18.690
The idea is that we want to
come up with a framework that

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:19.830
applies to all investors.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.070
That's true.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:23.160
And so, it would be
really convenient for us

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:26.110
to be able to use
returns and units of risk

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.350
so that whatever
dollars you have,

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:30.330
you can simply apply
the theory and find out

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.957
where you are on that frontier.

00:23:31.957 --> 00:23:34.290
And just simply multiply by
the initial amount of wealth

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:38.190
to figure out all your
dollar investments.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:43.700
Underlying that
approach is a belief.

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.720
And here's the belief.

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:51.450
The belief is that we can invest
however much money we want,

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:54.070
and get these kind of returns.

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:56.770
That's the key that all
of you are groping at.

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.180
Implicitly, I think
you understood this,

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:01.870
but you haven't articulated it.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.330
What we're assuming,
when we put down

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.640
all these equations
in returns, is

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:11.440
that scale doesn't matter
in the sense that no matter

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.550
whether we're investing
a hundred dollars,

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:17.650
or a hundred million dollars,
or a hundred billion dollars.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:20.290
We're going to get
the same returns.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.110
And the fact of the matter
is that's just not true.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:27.500
Scale absolutely does matter.

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.590
It matters because
the more money

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:32.260
you put into certain
kinds of investments,

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.560
the harder it will be
for those investments

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:38.870
to maintain the same
level of return.

00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:41.140
Now, that has a very
different impact

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.860
among different industries and
among different investments.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.760
For example, right
now, nanotechnology

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.140
is just beginning to take off.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:56.815
And so, if you end up putting a
couple of extra billion dollars

00:24:56.815 --> 00:24:59.620
in nanotechnology,
it's unlikely you're

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.650
going to really affect the
returns because the technology

00:25:02.650 --> 00:25:04.180
is still emerging.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.410
But if you take a very highly
capacity constrained strategy

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.540
and try to implement
that same idea,

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:14.800
you're going to have a
very hard time doing it.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.480
If you decide that you want to
focus on middle level software

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.220
for dealing with file
server control mechanisms,

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.090
it's a relatively narrow sector
in the technology sector.

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:28.420
And you want to put $2 billion
of extra money in that sector

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.160
this month.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.390
Good luck.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.247
You'll have a very
hard time doing it.

00:25:33.247 --> 00:25:35.080
Not to say that people
won't take the money.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:37.540
I'm sure you can find people,
yeah, sure give me the money.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:40.206
But they're not going to be able
to produce the returns that you

00:25:40.206 --> 00:25:44.020
would expect from that very
narrow slice of the economy.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.700
So all of what we've
done in this course

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.360
ignores scale from the
perspective of risk and reward,

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:56.454
but the one area where scale
absolutely matters is NPV.

00:25:56.454 --> 00:25:58.620
In other words, when you're
a project manager trying

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:02.250
to figure out should I take
Project A, or take Project B,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.840
scale matters.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:06.100
As Dee pointed out,
in certain cases,

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.270
you don't have more money to
put into a particular project.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.250
In other cases, you
have too much money

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:14.070
that is not suitable
for a certain project.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.850
But the bottom line
in both cases is NPV.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:18.570
Dollars.

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:20.524
Actual dollars and cents.

00:26:20.524 --> 00:26:23.190
That's what you want to focus on
from the perspective of capital

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.450
budgeting or corporate finance.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:24.950
Mike?

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.432
AUDIENCE: If the NPV
is really, really good,

00:26:27.432 --> 00:26:30.420
and the return is good, you
should go get more capital--

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.130
ANDREW LO: That's
right, that's right.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.950
If the NPV is really,
really good, first of all,

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:36.600
you're going to
take the project.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.280
But secondly, what
you're going to do

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.050
is you're going to try to
figure how to scale the heck out

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.870
of the project and take
as much of it as you want.

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:42.510
Why?

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.330
Because more money is
preferred to less money.

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:46.620
Simple as that.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:49.620
And again, anybody that violates
that, see me after class.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:50.940
Be happy to help you.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.568
Yeah?

00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:53.760
AUDIENCE: If you did that
it would go back to your--

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.190
ANDREW LO: Exactly, it would.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.531
AUDIENCE: Or, it would change r.

00:26:56.531 --> 00:26:58.540
ANDREW LO: It would change
r, that's the point.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.320
That's why you shouldn't focus
on r from the perspective

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:02.430
of capital budgeting.

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.650
From an investor's
point of view,

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.200
from a point of view of you and
me, investing in the market,

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.390
we're not going to affect r.

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:12.160
I mean, I hate to depress
all of you, but most of you,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.760
if you put your entire
wealth into the market,

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:18.480
you probably won't move
the market by a whole lot.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:20.340
That's not true of
everybody, and it's not

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.579
true of all assets.

00:27:21.579 --> 00:27:23.620
But it's certainly true
of the market as a whole.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.340
In other words, if we put
all of our collective wealth

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.370
into the S&P 500, we're not
going to move it by a lot.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.050
But if you're a
corporation, and you

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:37.950
put all of your corporate wealth
in one particular division

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.050
of the particular
company you're in,

00:27:40.050 --> 00:27:42.376
that could have dramatic
consequences for the rate

00:27:42.376 --> 00:27:43.500
of return for that project.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.100
So scale matters for
capital budgeting.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.070
It doesn't matter if you're
thinking about each of us

00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:51.180
as a small investor.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.660
And so what I derived for you in
the capital asset pricing model

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:58.950
is a derivation that
assumes each of us is small.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.250
We're not going to affect
prices, or therefore, returns.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:05.906
And so, we can take
returns as given.

00:28:05.906 --> 00:28:07.530
In other words,
whether we're investing

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:11.940
$100,000, or $200,000, or
$15,000, or even a million,

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:15.300
the analytics that derived
are pretty reasonable

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:16.950
approximations.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.470
That's very different
from evaluating

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:22.290
a particular investment
opportunity for a division

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:23.910
of a corporation.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.040
That's not the stock market.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:28.050
We use the stock market
as a guide for computing

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.380
the discount rate.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:33.240
But the bottom line analysis
is how much of the investment

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.490
can be supported by what
you want to put into it.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.720
And as long as the
NPV is looking good,

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.040
you want to keep doing it.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.300
And to Remy's point, the
more you do it, most likely,

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.612
the less NPV will
come out, eventually.

00:28:49.612 --> 00:28:51.070
And you're going
to drive the thing

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.736
into the ground in
the sense that you're

00:28:52.736 --> 00:28:55.900
going to keep doing it until
it stops being profitable.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.090
That's only human,
it's only natural,

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.504
it's only good business to
drive it into the ground.

00:29:00.504 --> 00:29:02.920
Which is, by the way, what we
did in the subprime mortgage

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.310
market, right?

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:06.310
That's why we're in the
current crisis we're in.

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:10.120
We basically drove that business
into the ground and then some.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.000
But it's a natural phenomenon
of business practice

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.610
to constantly be coming
up with new ideas.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.110
The ones that work
well, we're going

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.318
to keep on implementing them.

00:29:18.318 --> 00:29:20.350
We give them more
capital until they

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.210
start declining in
their rates of return,

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.680
then we take capital away.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.470
For the next year or so, we're
going to be taking capital away

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:27.678
from the real estate markets.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:32.677
Any questions about scale?

00:29:32.677 --> 00:29:35.260
That was a bit of a digression,
but a useful one, in the sense

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.170
that NPV is the right
thing to do because it

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.030
doesn't ignore scale.

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:44.500
Whereas, for the small
investor, ignoring scale

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.850
makes perfect sense.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:48.340
Because then we are able
to derive a theory that

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:49.870
applies to most everybody.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:54.160
By the way, that theory
doesn't apply to some

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.470
of the largest investors today.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:59.530
For example, certain
sovereign wealth funds,

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.510
certain public
pension funds, they

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:05.410
can't invest according to the
basics of portfolio theory.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:07.077
Because when they
put money to work,

00:30:07.077 --> 00:30:09.160
they're looking to put a
couple of billion dollars

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.410
to work in a single investment.

00:30:11.410 --> 00:30:13.810
It's not worth their
time to try to figure out

00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:16.790
how to allocate $5 million here,
$10 million here, $20 million

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.290
there.

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.030
There's not enough
hours in the day

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.400
when they're managing
a $250 billion

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.870
portfolio to be able to do that.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:27.100
And so, when you're a
large, large investor,

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.930
the theory that we developed
here in this class,

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:31.000
it doesn't apply.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.790
You need to take 15
433 to understand

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:37.390
how to deal with the issue of
price impact and large scale

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:37.990
investments.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:40.270
Fortunately, or
unfortunately, that

00:30:40.270 --> 00:30:42.520
won't be a problem
for most of us,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.620
so you have to
keep that in mind.

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.800
For most of us, the
theory of investments

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.120
that we developed in this
class is perfectly appropriate.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.830
Except when we're
talking about NPV.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.329
Yeah?

00:30:56.804 --> 00:30:59.149
AUDIENCE: Because
of this lecture,

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:02.198
will there be any
indices or variables

00:31:02.198 --> 00:31:07.470
that we can use to determine
the part of the initial returns

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.010
for those sort of cash flows?

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:12.260
ANDREW LO: In this
particular context, no.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:16.012
You're going to learn about
that in 402, as well as in 434,

00:31:16.012 --> 00:31:18.470
and some of the more advanced
courses on capital budgeting.

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:20.630
On how to scale an investment.

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.910
But the basic
principle, you, I think,

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.370
already know because you've
taken microeconomics.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.160
The basic principle
of how much to invest

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.560
is not to invest until
you start losing money.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:33.470
That's actually typically
how it's done in practice.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.800
That's not necessarily the
best way of approaching it.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:39.140
According to an economist,
the best way to invest

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:43.970
is until the point at which the
marginal benefits is actually

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.350
equal to the marginal
cost of the investment.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.540
So when you're trying
to maximize profits,

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.470
you're asking how much
money should I invest

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:53.330
in a particular division.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:55.340
You ought to keep
investing until the point

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.950
where the marginal benefit is
equated to the marginal cost.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:03.100
In other words, where the
profit maximizing point is,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:09.440
is where the marginal revenue
is equated to the marginal cost

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.400
of investment.

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.260
That's true for any
kind of an investment.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.960
The point is to be able to
measure those things accurately

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.150
enough to find that point.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:21.760
We don't do that in this
course because, again, we're

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.250
assuming that you're
relatively small relative

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:27.230
to the grand scheme of
the investment universe.

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:30.010
But as you get bigger, you need
to develop other techniques

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.280
to be able to deal with that.

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.150
And one is this marginal
benefit, marginal cost

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.480
approximation.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:39.250
Other questions?

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:42.370
So that's the
profitability index.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:43.920
I just give you a
couple of examples,

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.420
so you can take a look
at them at your leisure.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:48.260
It's pretty straightforward.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:48.760
All right.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.050
Now, let me talk about the last,
and probably most important,

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:55.575
alternative to NPV.

00:32:55.575 --> 00:32:56.950
This is something
that's actually

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.876
used in practice
pretty commonly,

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.250
and there are
certain areas where

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.450
it's used almost exclusively.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:04.180
So it's a very
important idea that I

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.360
want to go over in detail.

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.660
The idea behind the
IRR looks simple enough

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:11.710
on the surface of it.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.260
And those of you who
remember back to the lectures

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:17.590
that we did on bond
mathematics, you'll

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.580
recognize the IRR as
nothing more than the yield

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.840
to maturity of a bond.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.480
So if you pretend that this
is like a bond, where i sub 0

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:33.352
is the market price of the
bond, and the cf1 to cft

00:33:33.352 --> 00:33:36.760
are the coupons and principle
payment of the bond,

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:41.620
then the internal rate of return
is nothing more than the yield

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.180
to maturity of that bond.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:46.810
That's mathematically,
formally what it is.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:48.940
But it's got a different
interpretation here.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.170
The interpretation is that i
sub 0 is the amount of money

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:56.800
you're paying for this project.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:02.050
And cf1 through cft are
the cash flows you're

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.520
getting from the project.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:13.380
And the IRR is that yield,
or that rate of return,

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:17.810
such that it makes the
project break-even.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.980
In other words, the present
value of the future cash flows

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.409
is actually equal to
the amount of investment

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:27.860
that you put into it at
that IRR rate of return.

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:33.489
Any questions about
that definition?

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.440
Now implicit in
that definition are

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:39.790
a couple of hidden assumptions
that makes this work.

00:34:39.790 --> 00:34:42.820
One assumption is that
the only investment

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.340
that you're going to make
in the project is upfront.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.817
You're going to pay i
sub 0, and you're not

00:34:47.817 --> 00:34:49.650
going to pay anything
more for that project.

00:34:49.650 --> 00:34:55.940
It requires no more cash
inflows from you, the investor.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.710
The second assumption,
which I guess

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.480
is sort of the
same as the first,

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.660
is that all the cash
flows are non-negative.

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.520
They're either 0 or positive.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.650
You don't have any future
negative cash flows.

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:10.800
So once you invest in
your certain amount

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.040
today, then
thereafter, you simply

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.855
collect money from the project
that comes in over t periods.

00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:23.570
If those two assumptions
are satisfied,

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:28.150
then this may be a
reasonable approach.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.570
So just to be explicit,
the way that IRR is used

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.510
is for independent projects.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:39.510
Accept a project if the IRR's
greater than some hurdle rate,

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.010
some IRR star.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:44.100
You can think of that
as your internal,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.900
or your required rate of return.

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:53.730
So as long as the break-even
IRR is equal to, or greater

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.860
than that threshold,
then you're OK.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.760
Second, if you've got
mutually exclusive projects,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:06.495
then you pick the one
that has the highest IRR.

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:11.750
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:19.407
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You could have

00:36:19.407 --> 00:36:22.651
an outflow in the first
year, and you could

00:36:22.651 --> 00:36:26.050
have an increase [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.550
ANDREW LO: I'll
show you in a minute

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.980
why you need that assumption,
those two assumptions.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.504
In fact, when
people use IRR, they

00:36:31.504 --> 00:36:32.920
don't bother with
any assumptions.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.230
They just compute it.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:39.110
So the assumption is to give
them the benefit of the doubt.

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.590
I want to come up with
conditions under which it might

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.660
actually make sense to use this,
and those are the conditions.

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:48.460
But for now, let's forget
about all conditions.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:53.040
And let me tell you what
the problems are with IRR.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:58.180
There are certain
situations where using IRR

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:04.970
will lead to the same decisions
as NPV, and there they are.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:08.480
There's only one cash outflow,
which occurs at time 0.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.500
There's only one project
under consideration,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.630
so you have multiple projects
that you're comparing.

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:15.450
Third, the opportunity
cost of capital

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:18.720
is the same for all periods.

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.300
And the threshold
rate that you use

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:27.570
is set equal to the
opportunity cost of capital.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:31.560
Now, the reason that
you need all of these.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.130
I'm going to show you by
way of counterexamples.

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:36.230
But let me just tell
you right now, up front,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.150
what the shortcomings
are of IRR.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.930
Why you might want to think
twice before using it.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:49.280
One is that in certain
cases, the IRR may not exist.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.390
And in other cases, you
may have multiple IRRs.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.820
I'm going to show
you in a minute.

00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:01.550
Second, you're going to get
incorrect rankings for IRRs

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:05.540
where you're looking at
loans, loans meaning you've

00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:08.330
got a negative cash
flow starting today,

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:11.240
and then positive
cash flows tomorrow--

00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:11.900
Excuse me.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:14.160
You have a positive
cash inflow today,

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:18.060
and negative cash going out
tomorrow and the day after.

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:18.890
Like a mortgage.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:20.750
A mortgage, you
get money up front,

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.880
and you're paying
money out later on.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.530
If you do that,
then you've actually

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:28.190
got to flip around the ranking
and take projects or loans

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:31.760
with smaller IRRs,
not higher IRRs.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.080
And finally, it
also ignores scale

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:35.330
because it's a rate of return.

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:39.130
It doesn't look at
dollars and cents.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:40.940
Zeke?

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.370
AUDIENCE: I have no
professional experience

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:47.355
but there's something
that simply bothers me.

00:38:47.355 --> 00:38:49.480
You told that for, example,
that this model doesn't

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.980
work if you have
negative cash flows

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.415
and that people can make
mistakes and use negative cash

00:38:54.415 --> 00:38:55.876
flows in real life.

00:38:55.876 --> 00:38:57.824
How does this happen?

00:38:57.824 --> 00:38:59.772
Don't people have--
in this Excel sheet,

00:38:59.772 --> 00:39:01.233
it's a simple calculation.

00:39:01.233 --> 00:39:03.356
How is this allowed
in professional--

00:39:03.356 --> 00:39:05.480
ANDREW LO: Hold on for one
second, let me show you.

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:07.400
I'm going to show
you by example.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.540
It's not as easy as you think.

00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.940
Let me give you some examples
for incorrect rankings.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.820
This is one example where,
as I said, with a loan

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.520
you want to pick the project
that's got a lower IRR, not

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.960
a higher IRR.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.580
So that's one issue.

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:26.950
But let me give you an idea
of the nonexistence of an IRR.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:31.260
Project one has two
negative cash flows.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.633
One in the first period, and
another one in period two.

00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:39.800
Project two has only
one negative cash flow,

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:43.370
but it happens in period
one, not in period zero

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:45.530
or in period two.

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.280
Both of these projects are
not particularly weird.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.100
I know it's true that they don't
have negative cash flows on day

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.260
one and positive thereafter.

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.540
But I don't think you
would look at these

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.390
and say that, gee this
is really pathological,

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:01.500
or perverse, in any way.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.320
It's just a different
way of structuring

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:07.160
your particular financing,
or your cash flows.

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:09.020
It turns out that in
both of these cases,

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:13.270
the IRR doesn't actually exist.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:15.640
Now by exist, what do I mean?

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:19.480
Let's go back and look at
exactly how to compute IRR.

00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:22.480
To compute an IRR, you
have to find a number that

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:23.840
satisfies this equation.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:32.250
And so with k period
IRR calculation,

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:37.330
we've got k cash
flows over k years.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:39.140
What, in the end, are
you trying to solve?

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:40.181
What kind of an equation?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.441
Nobody on high
school math teams?

00:40:45.441 --> 00:40:45.940
Andy?

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.480
AUDIENCE: kth order polynomial.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:51.214
ANDREW LO: Yeah, a
kth order polynomial.

00:40:51.214 --> 00:40:52.630
You all know what
that is, I hope.

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:54.260
Right?

00:40:54.260 --> 00:40:56.870
Second order
polynomial's a quadratic.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.930
ax squared plus bx
plus c equals 0.

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.690
A third order polynomial
has a cubed term, and so on.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:07.460
A kth order polynomial
has powers of IRR

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.870
that are up to order k.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.060
Anybody tell me how
many solutions there

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.040
are of a kth order polynomial?

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.680
AUDIENCE: k [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.340
ANDREW LO: Up to k solutions.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.110
Do you always have solutions?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:26.962
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:26.962 --> 00:41:30.612
k is obvious.

00:41:30.612 --> 00:41:32.820
ANDREW LO: We're getting
some different theories now.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:36.352
So some says yes, some says
no, some says where k is odd.

00:41:36.352 --> 00:41:38.070
By odd I presume
you mean not even,

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:41.370
as opposed to weird, right?

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:43.320
it actually turns
out that you can

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:47.126
construct a solution for every
single kth order polynomial.

00:41:47.126 --> 00:41:48.750
But that's if you
change the definition

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:51.120
of what you mean by a solution.

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.680
Right, exactly.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.840
If you introduce a
new set of numbers

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:58.470
called complex number,
by that I mean numbers

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:01.470
where the square root of
negative 1 makes sense.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.390
If you will extend
the number system

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.790
to include these weird things
called complex numbers,

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.960
then it turns out
that all polynomials,

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.350
all kth order polynomials
have exactly k solutions.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.010
How nice.

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:16.740
The problem is that
these solutions

00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:19.380
can involve complex numbers.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.192
And as far as we
know, complex numbers

00:42:21.192 --> 00:42:22.650
don't have any
ready interpretation

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.610
in terms of interest and money.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.000
So in other words, the only
solutions that matter for you

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.130
and me, for practical
purposes, is

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:31.740
what are called real solutions.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.570
And in particular, not only
do they have to be real,

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:37.380
but it would sort of be nice
if they were positive numbers.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.380
Because interest rates, again,
although they can be negative,

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.480
it's kind of hard to
imagine what that implies

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.280
over long periods of time.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:48.990
So when I say that
a solution doesn't

00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:50.700
exist for these two
cases, I don't mean

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:52.770
that they don't exist, exist.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.050
Of course they exist,
they have to exist.

00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.820
The problem is that
the solutions-- these

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:59.510
are two period cash flows.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.650
So we're talking
about quadratics.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:05.760
We all know the solution to
the quadratic equation of ax

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.110
squared plus bx plus c equals 0.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:07.830
What's the solution?

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:08.788
Anyway tell me quickly?

00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:13.770
Negative b plus or minus
the square root of b

00:43:13.770 --> 00:43:15.120
squared minus 4ac over 2a.

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.070
Remember that?

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:22.020
It turns out that you don't get
real solutions all the time.

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:24.990
Meaning that, in certain
cases, that formula

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.825
will produce solutions that have
the square root of negative 1

00:43:27.825 --> 00:43:29.250
in there.

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.820
And that makes no sense from
an economic perspective.

00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:34.840
It just so happens that
in these two cases,

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.610
you should go home and try it,
and you'll see for yourself.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.460
When you come up with
the two solutions that

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:47.299
exist for both of these cases,
they're complex numbers.

00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:49.590
So I challenge you to tell
me what the right investment

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:53.400
decision is by looking
at those complex numbers.

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:55.440
It can't be done.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.250
Which means that IRR
doesn't always work.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:02.730
And here are two relatively
reasonable examples

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:06.020
that nobody should be
expected to look at and say,

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.930
ha, of course.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:08.820
You can't use IRR here.

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.890
These are real life examples.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.600
And by the way, this
is just two periods.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:16.770
If I had five periods, and I had
some positives, some negatives,

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.440
it gets even more complicated.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.630
So even within a
spreadsheet, where

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:23.880
you can see the positives
and the negatives,

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:25.020
and you can compute IRR--

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:26.850
you can do this in Excel.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:27.850
And you should do that.

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:30.400
You'll get these weird
symbols that come up,

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.010
that will start
spitting up blood

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.530
and say that it
can't handle this.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.150
Unfortunately, if
you did it MATLAB,

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.100
which I know a number
of you are likely to do,

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.330
you will get an answer.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.910
MATLAB has no problem
with complex numbers.

00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:45.490
So that's one problem.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:48.820
Let me illustrate to you
though, where the problem comes

00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:51.080
with multiplicity of solutions.

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.580
So this is a graph
of the polynomial.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.850
In this case, the
third order polynomial.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:00.910
And so what I'm doing
is I'm calculating

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:06.280
the NPV of project
1 and of project 2

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:10.300
as a function of the
underlying interest rate.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:12.820
And an IRR corresponds
to a situation

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.390
where the NPV is equal to
0, the break-even point.

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:19.210
What you'll notice
is that the 0's

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.547
are where this curve intersects
the y-axis, or the x-axis,

00:45:23.547 --> 00:45:24.680
sorry.

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.910
And so with the first
project, you actually

00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:29.320
get a unique solution.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.680
It only crosses the x-axis once.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.630
So you get a unique,
real solution.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:38.230
But if you take a
look at project 2,

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:44.410
project 2 crosses the x-axis
once, twice, three times.

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:45.880
You get three solutions.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.830
They're all real, by the way.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.500
You get three, real solutions.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.350
Which one would you like?

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.990
Take your pick.

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:55.610
You pick the biggest one?

00:45:55.610 --> 00:45:56.480
Or the smallest one?

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.280
Or maybe average
them, or do something?

00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.870
I don't know.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:05.570
The problem is that with IRR,
If the pattern of cash flows

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.630
is anything but
strictly positive,

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.250
you get weird results.

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:16.320
Now, I told you before that
IRR is used almost exclusively

00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:19.167
in one particular sector,
one particular segment,

00:46:19.167 --> 00:46:20.250
of the financial industry.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:22.614
Anybody know what that is?

00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:23.674
AUDIENCE: Bonds?

00:46:23.674 --> 00:46:24.340
ANDREW LO: Bond?

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.580
Well, that would be a
good answer, you're right.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:31.547
Yield to maturity is
what IRR is in bonds.

00:46:31.547 --> 00:46:33.130
That wasn't what I
was thinking about,

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:34.450
but you're absolutely right.

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:38.200
IRR, in fact, is used
all the time in bonds

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.700
because you quote
yield to maturity.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.700
And it's not surprising
because with bonds, you only

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.700
have positive cash
flows, and you only

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.620
have an initial payment upfront,
which is the price of the bond.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:52.300
So all of the criteria
that I required in order

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:58.390
to make IRR equivalent
to NPV holds for bonds.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.000
But I'm thinking
about something else.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.150
What other part of
the financial industry

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.790
uses IRR as a way of
making investments?

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:11.080
And not only that, but
of quoting performance.

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:11.650
What's that?

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:12.340
AUDIENCE: Private equity?

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:13.630
ANDREW LO: Private
equity, exactly.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.260
Private equity.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:18.550
In private equity, almost
every venture capitalist

00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:23.470
will tell you what their
IRR is of their portfolio.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:26.470
And there are a couple of
reasons for this practice.

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:31.060
One of course, is that for
most private equity ventures,

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:34.690
it is all about cash up
front, and then positive cash

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:37.590
flows thereafter.

00:47:37.590 --> 00:47:42.910
Unless of course, you
require additional financing

00:47:42.910 --> 00:47:44.440
like mezzanine financing.

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.110
In which case, now
you have a hard time

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:49.030
using IRR for the whole thing.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.510
You could use IRR for
the separate tranches

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:55.480
of investments,
and again, that's

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.370
kind of an accommodation.

00:47:57.370 --> 00:48:02.050
It's a fix for trying to deal
with the weaknesses of IRR.

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:04.120
If you focus just on
the particular tranche

00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:08.200
of an investment, you've got a
tranche of investment going in,

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.920
cash flows going out, and it
all satisfies the NPV criterion.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.170
But the other reason
for focusing on IRR

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:20.560
is because, again, this
is an issue of scale.

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.510
You want to compare
two investments,

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.612
and they may require
different dollar amounts,

00:48:25.612 --> 00:48:27.070
so you'd like to
be able to compare

00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:32.867
their performance in some way
that doesn't include the scale.

00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:34.450
Because you want to
be able to compare

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:36.250
across a bunch of
different investments

00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:42.680
and see how each manager is
doing per unit dollar invested.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:45.560
However, the bottom line
of a venture capitalist

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:47.579
is, I've got a billion
dollars to invest.

00:48:47.579 --> 00:48:49.370
I have to figure out
where to put my money.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:52.349
I can't afford to put my money
in smaller investments that

00:48:52.349 --> 00:48:54.140
are not going to give
me the kind of return

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:55.460
that I need to have.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.260
So in the end, a
venture capitalist

00:48:57.260 --> 00:48:59.960
is going to have to
look at scale anyway.

00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.080
But for historical
and cultural reasons,

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.340
you actually have the venture
capital community the only one

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:11.030
that really focuses almost
exclusively on using IRR.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:14.750
And for their applications,
like the bond pricing example,

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.980
it's generally OK,
but it may not be.

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:21.110
And so you should
understand those conditions

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:22.910
under which it may not be.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.630
So I want you to refer to
these, and if you have a moment

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:28.730
during your holiday
break and you're bored,

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.680
you might want to run a
few of these in Excel.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.910
Just literally try to compute
the appropriate IRR in Excel.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.010
And just prove to
yourself that you

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:39.680
can't, that you get some
weird results out of that.

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:48.130
Any questions about IRR?

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:50.350
By the way, again,
there are no formulas

00:49:50.350 --> 00:49:52.690
other than the quadratic
for how to compute it.

00:49:52.690 --> 00:49:55.030
So in most cases when
you want to compute IRR,

00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:56.530
you have to use
numerical methods.

00:49:56.530 --> 00:50:00.280
You have to basically solve a
non-linear equation for a 0.

00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.710
So effectively, you
have to do this.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:06.840
You have to find the
0's of these equations.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:09.610
That could be a little bit
of an exercise to do that.

00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:15.200
There are other
examples here where

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:17.090
I try to come up
with ways to fix IRR,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:19.730
maybe by looking at
incremental cash flows,

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:22.880
or looking at different
ranking methods.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:26.420
But the bottom line is use NPV.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.150
Be aware of how
to compute an IRR,

00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.670
but you should
understand that IRR,

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:36.740
in the cases where it matters,
either it agrees with NPV or it

00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:37.262
doesn't.

00:50:37.262 --> 00:50:38.720
And if it doesn't,
you can't use it

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.690
because it's going to create
all sorts of contradictions

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:42.515
and weird results.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:49.810
I want to conclude this
lecture on capital budgeting

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:53.860
by talking about what people
actually do in practice,

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.410
and give you a little bit of
a preview about what you're

00:50:56.410 --> 00:51:01.060
going to learn in 402 as well
as in 434 and other courses

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:04.300
on corporate financing
and capital budgeting.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.840
Right now, as of
maybe five years ago

00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:11.080
when this survey was
done, for large US firms,

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.870
believe it or not,
payback period

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:17.030
was probably the most popular.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.010
It's the one that people
focused on the most.

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.177
Again, not necessarily
exclusively.

00:51:21.177 --> 00:51:23.260
So it could well be that
people use payback period

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:26.720
as one criterion, but they
use many others as well.

00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:31.530
But over 80% of the companies
surveyed use payback period.

00:51:31.530 --> 00:51:34.900
65% use IRR, which
is quite a lot.

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.600
But again, a significant
fraction of that

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:40.730
is private equity.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:43.100
And by the way, for
non-financial corporations that

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.910
have private equity operations
within it, for example,

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:50.420
General Motors has a part of
their pension fund devoted

00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:51.950
to private equity investments.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.560
They will use IRR as well,
because other venture

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:56.960
capitalists use that.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.410
NPV is actually gaining ground.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.720
So it's now more
popular than IRR.

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.380
If you surveyed multinationals
and US corporations

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.110
20 years ago, it would
have been flipped around.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.500
IRR would have been way
more popular than NPV,

00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:16.200
but that's changed a lot
just in the last 20 years.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:18.500
However, when you look
at multinationals,

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.460
you see that actually,
IRR is still more popular.

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:25.250
So that's something
to keep in mind.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.140
When you're dealing
with foreign companies,

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:30.170
they may be looking
at investments

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:34.520
from a VC perspective, as
opposed to from a pure net cash

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.500
flow NPV perspective.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:39.530
So that's something that
you'll want to be wary of.

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.750
And by the way, that's
probably one area

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:46.305
where you can make real
progress in terms of an impact

00:52:46.305 --> 00:52:47.180
through your careers.

00:52:50.090 --> 00:52:51.860
Historical comparison,
this gives you

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.950
a little bit of a
time series of how

00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:56.730
things have changed over time.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:01.250
So back in 1959,
payback period, IRR,

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.020
was quite a bit more popular.

00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:06.860
Over time, that's declined,
and over time, IRR

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:08.540
has gained more ground.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:13.280
But NPV, as of 1981,
was lagging far behind.

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.060
And within the last 20 years,
we see this chart where

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.460
NPV has caught up a great deal.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.020
A large part of
that, if you want

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.103
to know where that came
from, a large part of that

00:53:23.103 --> 00:53:25.910
was thanks to Brealey and Myers.

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:27.680
The textbook that
you're using now

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:31.010
was probably the first major
corporate finance textbook ever

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:33.980
written, way back in the 1980s.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.330
And Stu Myers and Dick
Brealey wrote the book really

00:53:38.330 --> 00:53:39.980
because there was
nothing else that

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.310
was out there that corresponded
to these kind of modern finance

00:53:43.310 --> 00:53:44.390
principles.

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:47.420
And so Stu and Dick
have a lot to do

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.940
with these numbers as of today.

00:53:54.830 --> 00:53:57.570
Other issues that we were not
able to take on in this course,

00:53:57.570 --> 00:54:00.950
but which you will
see in 402 and 434,

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:06.050
is how to deal with other
aspects of the capital

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:07.100
budgeting process.

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:09.740
For example,
competitive response.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.960
When we think about making
investments in projects,

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.532
we are assuming
everything else as given.

00:54:16.532 --> 00:54:18.740
This is sort of like putting
money in a stock market.

00:54:18.740 --> 00:54:20.573
When you put your money
in the stock market,

00:54:20.573 --> 00:54:24.470
you're assuming that the means
and the variances are given.

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:26.780
That your investment
has no impact

00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.940
on the market as a whole.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:32.900
For specific kinds of projects,
that's not true at all.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.820
The perfect market's
assumption that we

00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:38.660
make from the perspective of
a small investor investing

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.880
in the entire market,
those set of assumptions

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:44.060
don't work for you
making a decision

00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.430
about whether to invest
in a new technology

00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:47.960
in your particular industry.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.510
Because most likely,
that new technology

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:54.470
will have a very significant
impact on that industry

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:55.610
if it's any good.

00:54:55.610 --> 00:54:57.026
So therefore,
you're going to have

00:54:57.026 --> 00:54:59.990
to deal with competitors and
the competitive response.

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.270
Things are going to
change because of the way

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.800
you make your investments.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:06.230
So that's something you'll
have to take into account.

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:08.600
Capital rationing,
which means you

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.249
don't have all the
money in the world.

00:55:10.249 --> 00:55:12.290
There's a limit to how
much money you can invest,

00:55:12.290 --> 00:55:15.500
so now, given that there are
limits to how much money you

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.670
have, you've got to pick your
opportunities more carefully.

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:24.290
And some of these capital
rationing requirements

00:55:24.290 --> 00:55:26.610
are implemented over
multi-year periods.

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.730
So for example, you
might have a three year

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:32.750
budget of $100 million to make
investments in new technology.

00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:35.679
Over three years, you can
use up to $100 million.

00:55:35.679 --> 00:55:37.220
So now, not only do
you have to think

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:41.840
about how to spread your money
over opportunities this year,

00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:43.670
you've got to think
about a spread it out

00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:44.817
over a three year period.

00:55:44.817 --> 00:55:47.150
And you have to think about
spreading it out to projects

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:49.430
that you don't even
know exist right now.

00:55:49.430 --> 00:55:52.500
So the problems, the
challenges, become much,

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:55.100
much more complex
as you start making

00:55:55.100 --> 00:55:57.600
the assumptions more realistic.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.600
You've got now, the very
basics to understand

00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.810
how to do this for the
very, very simple cases.

00:56:02.810 --> 00:56:05.570
But the more advanced
courses will, one by one,

00:56:05.570 --> 00:56:07.760
relax these assumptions
and give you

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.840
more tools to be able to
handle more complex situations.

00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.610
The examples that I
give in this slide

00:56:13.610 --> 00:56:18.170
are looking at short
run versus the long run,

00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:20.990
as well as dealing
with general noise.

00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:23.699
In other words, you may
be taking in lots of data,

00:56:23.699 --> 00:56:25.490
not all of that data
is equally meaningful.

00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:29.397
So you need to know what to
ignore, and what to focus on.

00:56:29.397 --> 00:56:30.980
That will be part
of those challenges.

00:56:30.980 --> 00:56:37.210
You'll get that in
402, and more in 434.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:43.720
So to summarize, we are now
done with pretty much all

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.510
of the finance
theory that we need

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:51.310
to value and to make decisions
on virtually any kind

00:56:51.310 --> 00:56:54.680
of investment that's out there.

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:56.530
The key points for
capital budgeting

00:56:56.530 --> 00:57:00.220
is use NPV, or in the case
of more advanced kinds

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.580
of concepts, APV.

00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.790
Take all projects that are
positive NPV, and if they're

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:10.090
mutually exclusive, take the
one with the biggest NPV.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:12.250
Consider project
interactions separately.

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:14.530
So consider the project
on a standalone basis,

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:17.260
then consider any
interaction effects

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.850
that may or may not exist.

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.130
You can evaluate them
separately, and add them

00:57:21.130 --> 00:57:23.230
together at the end.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:26.020
Use after tax cash flows
for the NPV calculations,

00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:27.670
not accounting earnings.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:31.881
And when you need discount rate,
use the capital asset pricing

00:57:31.881 --> 00:57:32.380
model.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:35.440
The capital asset pricing
model provides you

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:41.320
with a risk adjustment for
the required rate of return.

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.710
And be wary about risks
that change over time.

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:48.460
So every single year you
use your cost of capital,

00:57:48.460 --> 00:57:52.060
make sure you can justify the
particular risk associated

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:52.840
with that year.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.630
Remember the example
of drilling for oil

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.940
and how the risks
change dramatically

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:01.900
as you go from oil
exploration to oil production.

00:58:01.900 --> 00:58:04.660
Those are two
different activities.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:09.160
Finally, think about all the
other alternatives to NPV.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.740
And you don't have to
be a snob about it.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:14.170
Don't tell people, NPV's
the only way to go.

00:58:14.170 --> 00:58:16.150
It's either my way
or the highway.

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.900
You recognize that there
are other elements of risk

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:22.990
and reward that may be
captured by payback,

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:26.590
by internal rate of return,
by the profitability index.

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.240
But in the end,
what you're going

00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.360
to want to base your
decision on is primarily

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:34.570
NPV considerations,
with these other factors

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:37.580
thrown in as well.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:40.910
I'll conclude with one
last comment about capital

00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:44.462
budgeting, which is
something that is completely

00:58:44.462 --> 00:58:45.920
outside the purview
of this course,

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.947
but it's not outside
the purview of your MBA.

00:58:48.947 --> 00:58:50.530
And that is that why
I've been talking

00:58:50.530 --> 00:58:53.800
about for the exclusion of
everything else in this course

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.300
is the economic and
financial considerations.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:00.910
Obviously, when you're
engaged in trying

00:59:00.910 --> 00:59:06.262
to get a project approved, or
making a decision on a project,

00:59:06.262 --> 00:59:07.720
there are many
other considerations

00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:09.280
that you should
not forget about.

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:13.210
Considerations like
political, social, cultural,

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:17.440
implementation, all sorts
of practical aspects

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:19.640
that you need to put together.

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.970
And so all of the other
courses that you've been taking

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:24.580
are designed to try to get
you to think about that.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:28.180
But unfortunately,
or maybe inevitably,

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:32.470
in a curriculum like
the MBA, we pick apart

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:34.780
all of the various
aspects of a decision

00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:36.850
and then study it
to death, and try

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:40.000
to come up with the very best
possible approaches for each

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.820
of those particular silos.

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:46.276
It's your job, ultimately,
to put all of that together.

00:59:46.276 --> 00:59:47.650
And you will do
that, you will be

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:49.540
asked to do that, whether
you know it or not,

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:50.920
when you start working.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.830
So what I've been
focused on exclusively

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:56.080
is the financial and
economic considerations.

00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:58.240
And I believe you
now have the tools

00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.100
to be able to
analyze any project,

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:03.640
at least to get a starting
point for an intellectually

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.352
consistent way of looking at it.

01:00:05.352 --> 01:00:07.810
But don't for a moment think
that those are the only things

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:09.270
that are important.

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:13.090
The political, social,
cultural ramifications

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:15.460
are going to be
extraordinarily critical,

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:17.380
and only you will be
able to figure out

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.120
how to put that all together.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.670
So hopefully in this
particular course,

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:24.130
you've learned something
valuable from that one aspect.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:26.140
But just keep in mind,
it is only one aspect,

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:27.281
one perspective.

01:00:27.281 --> 01:00:29.530
And there are others that
you will have to incorporate

01:00:29.530 --> 01:00:30.910
into your way of thinking.

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:36.650
That's it for capital budgeting.

01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:38.560
Any final questions
before we move

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:42.021
on to the final
lecture of this course?

01:00:42.021 --> 01:00:42.520
Yes?

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:46.454
AUDIENCE: I just have one
small question on IRR again.

01:00:46.454 --> 01:00:50.927
In the examples you showed,
the cash flows in the out years

01:00:50.927 --> 01:00:56.269
and years [INAUDIBLE]
were more, they

01:00:56.269 --> 01:01:00.060
were the opposite direction
from the initial year cash flow,

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.290
but greater than the
[INAUDIBLE] cash flow.

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:04.900
Does it matter that that's
not the case that can happen?

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:08.110
ANDREW LO: Well, I guess
the answer is, it depends.

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:10.420
In other words,
what you detected

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.110
was not a universal pattern
that can be systematized

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:16.390
and then incorporated into IRR.

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:19.300
In other words, if I had
a longer period of time

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.520
to be able to play
with changes of sine

01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:24.807
and changes of magnitude, I
can get any kind of pattern

01:01:24.807 --> 01:01:25.390
that you want.

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.870
For example, in the
dotted line curve,

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:31.870
I can have this curve
flip around the other way

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.790
so that it starts
negative, goes positive,

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:34.870
and it goes up like that.

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:38.020
Just by changing the sign
patterns to something else.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:39.970
If I had a quartic
term in there,

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.960
I can make it even
more complicated.

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.770
So the longer the number
of periods, the more number

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.870
of periods that I have
to play with, the more

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.300
patterns that you can create
so that it would be really

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.380
impossible to reduce
it to a systematic

01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:58.440
set other than this
proscription here.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.010
If these four conditions
are satisfied,

01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:04.810
then you're OK with using
this as opposed to NPV.

01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:07.570
But that's the only
simple case where you

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.090
can say something meaningful.

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:14.350
By the way, the number of
0's and the nature of the 0's

01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:19.790
of polynomials, that turns out
to be related to a very, very,

01:02:19.790 --> 01:02:23.920
very famous and hard unsolved
problem in mathematics known

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:25.479
as the Riemann zeta hypothesis.

01:02:25.479 --> 01:02:27.520
We're not going to talk
about that in this class,

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:28.103
unfortunately.

01:02:28.103 --> 01:02:30.430
It is beyond the
scope of the school.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.430
But I just want to let you
know that there is something

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:40.180
inherently
extraordinarily deep about

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.644
the underlying contradictions
that get generated by IRR.

01:02:43.644 --> 01:02:45.310
You don't have to
solve the Riemann zeta

01:02:45.310 --> 01:02:49.510
hypothesis to understand it, but
you can get very, very complex,

01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:55.000
very quickly by looking at
these kinds of patterns.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.940
In fact, it would
be bad news for us

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:01.000
if these patterns actually
mattered for investing.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.170
The fact is they don't.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:04.330
The bottom line is NPV.

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:06.280
How much money
are you generating

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.270
from this investment, period.

01:03:08.270 --> 01:03:10.180
And if you focus
on that, you're not

01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.130
likely to make a
lot of mistakes.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:15.650
But you should at least be aware
about these other techniques.

01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:17.200
So that's why I went over them.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.054
Yeah, David?

01:03:18.054 --> 01:03:19.720
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit more

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:24.780
about social, political,
and cultural risks.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:29.346
From the perspective of the
CFO of a company for example,

01:03:29.346 --> 01:03:32.490
who has to make a decision on
whether and where to invest.

01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:37.170
It makes sense that there will
be some political implications

01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.900
that cannot be captured
by every model.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.570
But if I'm a private
investor and I

01:03:42.570 --> 01:03:45.660
invest in a company that is
listed in a stock exchange,

01:03:45.660 --> 01:03:49.320
I would expect all these
considerations to be captured

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.800
already in the stock price.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.410
ANDREW LO: Well, yes and no.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.802
Let me give you
an example that is

01:03:57.802 --> 01:03:59.010
a somewhat controversial one.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:00.660
I don't really know
the answer to it,

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.034
but at least we
can talk about it

01:04:02.034 --> 01:04:03.660
in the context of
current events.

01:04:06.022 --> 01:04:07.480
If you take a look
at what happened

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:12.340
with Bear Stearns versus what
happened with Lehman Brothers.

01:04:12.340 --> 01:04:17.560
It's kind of hard to understand
why what happened, happened.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.350
Bear Stearns was
deemed too big to fail.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:25.600
And so it was navigated to a
soft landing with JP Morgan.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:28.450
Lehman on the other hand,
which in certain respects

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:30.940
was even bigger and
even more broadly

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:37.100
intertwined in our financial
system, was allowed to fail.

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:40.140
I don't understand that from
an economic perspective.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.790
In fact, I'm not sure there is
an economic perspective to why

01:04:43.790 --> 01:04:46.100
it failed.

01:04:46.100 --> 01:04:48.530
But there may be a
political dimension.

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.950
For example, and again
this is pure speculation,

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:55.910
so asking me for my views
on political elements,

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:56.990
I'm happy to provide.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:05:00.560
But it's like asking
Roger Federer what

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.460
he thinks about the S&P 500.

01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:06.410
Not that I'm Roger
Federer, but it's

01:05:06.410 --> 01:05:08.690
asking somebody who's a
professional in one area what

01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:10.023
they think about something else.

01:05:10.023 --> 01:05:12.290
I'm not sure it's a good idea.

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:14.690
But the point is
that my conjecture

01:05:14.690 --> 01:05:18.230
is that the reason Lehman
Brothers was left to fail

01:05:18.230 --> 01:05:21.620
was because there was so
much criticism and backlash

01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:26.720
from the Bear Stearns event that
both Treasury and the Federal

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.100
Reserve thought that it was
politically untenable for them

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:32.420
to do it again.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:34.670
Because if they did
it again, then they

01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:36.290
would be expected
to do it again,

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:37.650
and again, and again, and again.

01:05:37.650 --> 01:05:40.520
In which case, all the
firms would be in line

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.520
to try to get a bailout.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.380
And they are.

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.600
However, to highlight
the complexity,

01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:51.860
to highlight the complexity
of the political dimension,

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.940
now that Lehman did
fail and it caused

01:05:55.940 --> 01:06:00.980
such disastrous consequences,
now maybe it's truly impossible

01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:02.637
to let any company fail.

01:06:02.637 --> 01:06:04.970
Because people will say, oh
you remember Lehman Brothers

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:05.970
and what happened there?

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:07.670
You better not do that again.

01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:11.060
So I don't know the answer
to the question about what

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.750
the political landscape is going
to look like a year from now,

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:17.010
or even six months from now.

01:06:17.010 --> 01:06:19.010
So I don't know
whether or not it's

01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:21.620
significant in terms
of what will happen,

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.220
but surely in the past, politics
has played a very big role,

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.714
even for private investors.

01:06:26.714 --> 01:06:29.130
But that actually wasn't the
politics I was talking about.

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:31.217
That certainly matters
a great deal now,

01:06:31.217 --> 01:06:33.050
but the kind of politics
I was talking about

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:35.070
was more within a company.

01:06:35.070 --> 01:06:37.340
So I'll give you an example.

01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.930
You're a new
division manager that

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:43.970
was specifically hired by the
CEO to turn around a division.

01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:47.270
And in your first
quarter on the job,

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:50.720
you propose a very
specific restructuring

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.210
for that division.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:56.950
Chances are the CEO is
going to agree with you.

01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:58.700
Knowing nothing about
whether the proposal

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.992
is smart, or stupid,
or good, or bad,

01:07:01.992 --> 01:07:03.950
most likely, the CEO's
going to agree with you.

01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:04.730
Why is that?

01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:05.630
You know why, right?

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:07.340
You guys agree with me.

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:10.004
If you agree with me, that means
that you understand something

01:07:10.004 --> 01:07:11.420
about the political
situation that

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.720
has nothing to do with P&L,
nothing to do with NPV, nothing

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:17.060
to do with cost of capital
or risk adjustment.

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:19.160
Somebody just hired
you to do a job

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.419
and they're going
to have to give you

01:07:21.419 --> 01:07:23.210
the benefit of the
doubt for a little while

01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:25.550
before they can
pull in the reins.

01:07:25.550 --> 01:07:27.830
That's what I mean by
political considerations.

01:07:27.830 --> 01:07:30.080
So when you're thinking
about capital budgeting,

01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:33.157
you've got to factor in all
of these considerations.

01:07:33.157 --> 01:07:33.740
Which is hard.

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:37.280
It's what makes business
both an art and a science.

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:40.220
You need to have both of
those elements represented.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.810
And I just wanted
to bring that up

01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:45.770
to remind you not to forget
about those elements.

01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:48.740
Economists have a very bad
habit, myself included.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.950
We think that
everything is economic.

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:54.840
Someone said that to a
person that owns a hammer,

01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:57.140
everything looks like a nail.

01:07:57.140 --> 01:07:57.942
And I agree.

01:07:57.942 --> 01:07:59.400
As an economist,
I have these tools

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.230
that I think apply
to everything.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.860
And there's a danger
that as an economist,

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.640
I see everything from
the economic perspective.

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.660
And it's only after
you've been hit

01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:11.591
over the head with a bunch
of failures of your theories

01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:13.340
that you'll begin to
realize maybe there's

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.950
something else out there
that's explaining behavior.

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:18.149
Which I'm going to
talk about next.

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:21.229
But the traditional
approach of economists

01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:23.490
is to assume that
everybody is rational,

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:26.510
everybody's maximizing NPV,
the markets work efficiently.

01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:28.350
And by the way, if
that's the case,

01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:30.540
then your job is really easy.

01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.100
What makes it hard, and I would
argue fun and challenging,

01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:35.810
is all the other
stuff that makes

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:38.930
this stuff not work the way
it's supposed to all the time.

01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:42.319
You have to know when
to use these methods

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.149
and when to use other
methods in order

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:47.420
to be able to advance your
particular objectives.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.640
And ultimately, you have
to understand exactly

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.200
what kind of objectives
you want to achieve.

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.200
So that's going to
actually be the topic

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.680
of the latter part of the
next lecture, is objectives.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.350
I've told you up until now
that the objective for most

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:05.000
shareholders and most corporate
managers is to maximize NPV.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.970
That is an approximation to
a much more complex reality.

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:12.500
So I'm about to change
your view of that reality

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:16.590
over the next
lecture and a half.

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:18.380
Any other questions?

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:25.490
This concludes our lecture
on capital budgeting,

01:09:25.490 --> 01:09:28.760
and what I want to turn
to now is the last lecture

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.080
of the course, which is
efficient markets, lecture 21.

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:37.529
I'm going to get started
on this just very briefly

01:09:37.529 --> 01:09:40.569
today, because we're
almost out of time.

01:09:40.569 --> 01:09:43.710
We've got about another
10 minutes or so.

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:46.890
I want to give you an
overview of where we're going

01:09:46.890 --> 01:09:49.680
and why we're going
to do this lecture.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:52.680
Typically, efficient
markets is a lecture

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:56.370
that is given in most corporate
finance and Introductory

01:09:56.370 --> 01:09:59.732
finance courses at the
beginning of the course.

01:09:59.732 --> 01:10:01.440
And the reason it's
done at the beginning

01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.550
is because actually, we
need this efficient markets

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:09.450
hypothesis to justify
most of what I taught you

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.960
over the last 13 weeks.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:16.130
Let me explain why that is.

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:18.460
For the longest time
now in this course,

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:21.860
I've kept repeating that when
we need a discount rate, when

01:10:21.860 --> 01:10:25.790
we need a price, when we
need a value, where do we go?

01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:26.510
To the market.

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:27.500
All of you, right?

01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.190
And we did that.

01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:31.310
The first day of class, I
auctioned off certain items

01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:34.770
and we engaged in
price discovery.

01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:38.190
That's an enormous benefit,
this wisdom of crowds

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.750
that we relied on.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:41.670
And that's why at the
very beginning of most

01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:44.970
of these finance courses, we
typically teach our students

01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:46.860
to trust in the market.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.480
Now I didn't do
that in this course

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.760
because I don't want
you to trust the market.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.550
I want you to learn from
experience when to trust

01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:55.710
the market, and when not to.

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:59.610
But the fact of the matter is
the theories that we rely on,

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:03.370
this notion of risk adjustment,
this cost of capital,

01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:04.770
this CAPM.

01:11:04.770 --> 01:11:07.920
All of that relies on
people being rational.

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:10.800
It relies on all of you
in this room wanting

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:13.320
to hold the tangency portfolio.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.620
It relies on supply
equaling demand.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:22.320
And unless we have that kind of
behavior, a lot of our results

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.340
go out the window.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:27.700
So I want to talk
about the justification

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.760
for that assumption in
this particular lecture.

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.920
I told you that I'm
going to tie together

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.570
all the various
different loose strands

01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:36.970
of the course in
this one lecture,

01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:38.800
and I do mean to do that.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.874
What I'm going to
do is first of all,

01:11:40.874 --> 01:11:42.540
make an argument for
why it is you ought

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.780
to trust in market prices.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:49.320
Why the wisdom of crowds is
very wise, most of the time.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.290
But then I want to spend the
bulk of this lecture telling

01:11:52.290 --> 01:11:54.079
you why it can break down.

01:11:54.079 --> 01:11:55.620
Now, I don't think
I need to tell you

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.090
that after the last 13 weeks.

01:11:57.090 --> 01:11:59.910
You've sort of seen
that in real time.

01:11:59.910 --> 01:12:04.140
But I want to give you an
understanding of what happened.

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:07.170
And actually, I'm going
to be able to provide you

01:12:07.170 --> 01:12:10.530
with a complete and
satisfactory theory that

01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:13.560
makes sense of everything that
has happened over the last 13

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.340
weeks.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:17.940
You may be skeptical about
that, but I promise you,

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:20.040
it will be true.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:23.310
I have a theory, which is
not generally accepted.

01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:25.329
So I've got to start
with that disclaimer.

01:12:25.329 --> 01:12:27.120
This is a theory that
I'm going to tell you

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.020
that is my own pet theory,
it's not in any textbook

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.514
because it's relatively new.

01:12:33.514 --> 01:12:35.430
And if you do a search
for it on the internet,

01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:38.070
my name was the only name
that's going to come up.

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.830
So that's both good and bad.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.661
You're hearing it from
the horse's mouth,

01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:43.410
but it is a horse
that's telling you this.

01:12:46.577 --> 01:12:48.660
I'm going to start by first
explaining to you what

01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:50.430
efficient markets is.

01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:51.930
I think you already know, right?

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:53.460
You can trust the market prices.

01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:57.030
The market price tells
you what you need to know.

01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:59.730
And after I make
that argument, I'm

01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:01.260
going to then turn
around and take

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:03.090
the other side of the
debate, and give you

01:13:03.090 --> 01:13:07.380
all the reasons why people are
irrational, silly, mistaken,

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:11.160
stupid, all of the reasons that
psychologists tell us markets

01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.379
are crazy, and you should
never trust in market prices.

01:13:14.379 --> 01:13:16.170
And then I'm going to
try to bring together

01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:18.240
the two sides of
the debate using

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:21.510
some recent research from
the cognitive neurosciences.

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:24.240
So I'm going to actually talk
a bit about the neurophysiology

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.312
of the brain, and it turns
out that that research

01:13:26.312 --> 01:13:28.770
is going to be directly relevant
to how we interpret what's

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:33.570
been going on over the last 13
weeks, over the last 130 years.

01:13:33.570 --> 01:13:38.010
Let me start with that argument
about efficient markets.

01:13:38.010 --> 01:13:42.300
Market efficiency says
that there's no free lunch,

01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:44.730
there's no arbitrage, you don't
get something for nothing,

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:47.370
prices fully reflect all
available information,

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:50.940
and there's no way to make
money in the marketplace.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:55.080
Active management does
not add any value.

01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:59.130
Now, if you really believe
this, why are you here?

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:00.800
Why are you taking finance?

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:03.410
Well, it turns out that there
is a reason for taking finance

01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:05.700
even if this is true,
which is that finance

01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:09.620
is the language by which you
conduct discussion and analysis

01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.570
in business negotiations.

01:14:11.570 --> 01:14:15.860
But even apart from this, I
would argue that most of you

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:18.230
are probably
thinking you can beat

01:14:18.230 --> 01:14:20.060
the market if you
work hard enough

01:14:20.060 --> 01:14:21.620
and if you're smart enough.

01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:24.170
That's not the perspective
of modern finance theory.

01:14:24.170 --> 01:14:26.420
So remember I was telling
you the difference to Warren

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.130
Buffett and modern finance.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.480
They do part company.

01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.340
Warren Buffett
literally believes

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:34.780
that he can pick stocks
better than you and I can.

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.150
And what academics
would have you believe

01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:40.060
is that nobody can pick
stocks, that it's all luck,

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:41.710
and what you ought
to do is simply buy

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.300
the tangency portfolio.

01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.550
It's going to turn out that
both of these perspectives

01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:48.610
are wrong, and they're
right in very specific ways,

01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:51.730
and I'm going to show you
how to put it together.

01:14:51.730 --> 01:14:53.230
But let me first
start by motivating

01:14:53.230 --> 01:14:54.970
this idea of efficient markets.

01:14:54.970 --> 01:14:59.320
Why you cannot make money, why
all information is incorporated

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:00.310
into market prices.

01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:02.920
And to do that, I'm going
to tell you about a research

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.550
paper that was published in
2003 by two economists, Michael

01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:10.294
Maloney and Herold Mulhearn,
titled the complexity

01:15:10.294 --> 01:15:12.460
of price discovery in an
efficient market, the stock

01:15:12.460 --> 01:15:16.891
market reaction to
the Challenger crash.

01:15:16.891 --> 01:15:19.190
Now this is a rather
somber subject.

01:15:19.190 --> 01:15:23.570
It has to do with an event that
occurred on January 28, 1986,

01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:26.270
at 11:39 AM.

01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:29.540
At that time, the
Challenger space shuttle

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:32.810
exploded before our very eyes.

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:35.570
Apparently, one of
the booster rockets

01:15:35.570 --> 01:15:39.590
ignited and destroyed
the space shuttle.

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:43.340
11: 47, the space shuttle was
reported to have exploded.

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:49.400
It came across the news
wire 12:17, Lockheed,

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.920
which is one of the contractors
that built the shuttle,

01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.390
had no comment.

01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:57.080
12:52, Rockwell International,
another one of the vendors

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.050
that built parts for the space
shuttle, they had no comment.

01:16:00.050 --> 01:16:02.820
This is all through
the news wire.

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:06.750
And over the course of
the next several months,

01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:10.620
a presidential
commission was impaneled

01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:15.270
to study what happened with
the space shuttle explosion.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:17.220
And many of you
know, the physicist

01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:19.410
Richard Feynman
was on that panel

01:16:19.410 --> 01:16:22.980
and wrote a dissenting
opinion about what happened.

01:16:22.980 --> 01:16:25.560
But the bottom line, after
all the dust settled,

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:30.120
was that in June of that year,
so about six months later,

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.280
there was a report
that was produced

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:36.570
that showed that it was an
O-ring, a piece of rubber,

01:16:36.570 --> 01:16:40.920
around a booster rocket that
ended up becoming brittle.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:43.520
And because it became
brittle in the cold weather,

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.230
there were gases that leaked
from that booster rocket,

01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:49.150
and those gases
ignited after take off.

01:16:49.150 --> 01:16:51.450
And so in the end, after
all of this analysis,

01:16:51.450 --> 01:16:55.320
it was determined that
the O-ring was at fault.

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.020
And who produced this
O-ring and the rocket?

01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.020
It was Morton Thiokol.

01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:04.920
They were the culprit, or
the weak link in all of this,

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.210
according to this study.

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:14.560
Now, this was on June 9, 1986.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:19.510
Let me show you what happened
to the stock prices of all

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:23.930
of the different vendors
for space shuttle parts,

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:27.380
right after the explosion
on January the 28th,

01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:30.580
six months earlier.

01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:32.350
Let me show you a graph.

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:34.960
There are four vendors.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:40.220
Lockheed, Martin Marietta,
Rockwell, and Martin Thiokol.

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:46.010
And these are the tick-by-tick
price changes, all normalized

01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:51.530
to start at $1 at the very
beginning of the sample, which

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:57.380
was at 11 o'clock, or 11:39,
when the shuttle exploded.

01:17:57.380 --> 01:17:58.880
So this is where
we start, we all

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:02.420
start with them at a dollar.

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.890
Within minutes of the explosion,
I'm talking minutes now,

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:08.450
not nine months or six months.

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:13.670
Within minutes, we see that
the stock price that gets

01:18:13.670 --> 01:18:18.770
hit the hardest
is Morton Thiokol.

01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:20.390
All of them get hit.

01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:23.630
But by 1 o'clock,
Morton Thiokol's price

01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:25.012
is down below all the others.

01:18:25.012 --> 01:18:27.470
And this is all normalized so
that they all start off at 1.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:30.560
So it's not difference of
scale, I've rescaled them.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:33.440
And moreover, at
the close of trading

01:18:33.440 --> 01:18:39.140
on that day, the only stock
that was down significantly,

01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:42.370
the only one, was
Morton Thiokol.

01:18:42.370 --> 01:18:44.020
They had to stop
trading in that stock

01:18:44.020 --> 01:18:45.145
because it was down so far.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:52.250
This happened in
less than six hours.

01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:55.190
It took the
commission six months

01:18:55.190 --> 01:18:57.750
to come up with the
O-ring and Morton Thiokol.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:01.910
Now, if you look at this,
you don't see an O-ring.

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:03.920
But you see Morton Thiokol.

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:06.909
Plain and simple,
like a sore thumb.

01:19:06.909 --> 01:19:08.200
This is what I'm talking about.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:11.037
This is the wisdom of crowds.

01:19:11.037 --> 01:19:12.870
This is why, when you
look at market prices,

01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:15.036
you should look at them
with a certain degree of awe

01:19:15.036 --> 01:19:16.230
and respect.

01:19:16.230 --> 01:19:18.750
It's because it
aggregates information

01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:20.340
like you wouldn't believe.

01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:21.840
It's phenomenal.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:24.240
So this is what economists
like to trot out

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.370
and say, see I told you so.

01:19:26.370 --> 01:19:28.211
This is what we're good at.

01:19:28.211 --> 01:19:30.210
What I'm going to talk
to you about on Wednesday

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:33.750
is all of the other examples
of where this fails.

01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:35.012
So this is the good news.

01:19:35.012 --> 01:19:37.220
On Wednesday, we're going
to talk about the bad news.

01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:39.360
OK, see you then.

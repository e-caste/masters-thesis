00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.840
WILL MA: So today
I promised I would

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.390
play through the second
half of the tournament

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.670
that I started last
time, so two times ago,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.320
but before Jennifer
Shahade's guest lecture.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.820
But before I start,
so remember last time

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.440
we got to the final table.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.750
This is essentially the
start of the final table.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.870
And but before I
get into the hands,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
I want to do a bit of
theory first that I've been

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.910
forgoing so far in this class.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.510
And it's essentially what's
called the independent chip

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.460
mode, or ICM theory.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.010
And essentially what it's
used for is in tournaments,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.460
essentially the value of
chips is essentially nonlinear

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.700
because you're not really trying
to just get all the chips.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.470
You are trying to last
as long as possible

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.130
and move up the payouts.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.360
So I want to now formally
quantify what this means

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.866
and how you calculate the
EV of your game rules.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:17.170
So far I think
I've just told you

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.840
everything that's done so far
in this class has been chip EV.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.050
And I've told you just
play to maximize chip EV.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.929
Maximize your expected
number of chips.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:26.720
And that's a pretty
reasonable way to play.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.350
In cash games, it's
what you want to do.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.450
And in tournaments it's
not a bad approximation.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:35.150
So I don't want everyone
after this ICM lecture

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.192
to think, you know, I've
got to completely change

00:01:37.192 --> 00:01:39.441
my playing in tournaments
because that's not the case.

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:40.900
Essentially, playing
and maximizing

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.960
expected number of chips is
a pretty good approximation

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.790
of how you actually
should be playing.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.980
But there are some
small differences

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.900
in extreme situations,
and I'd like

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.680
to highlight some of that today.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.800
So OK, yeah.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.770
So this is essentially-- so it's
this idea of minimizing risk

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.640
to stay alive and move up
to the escalating payouts.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.980
So I want to make an
important distinction, though.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.170
When I'm saying,
we're still trying

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.840
to maximize our expected
amount of money.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.780
What I'm saying, you should
be minimizing your risk

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.690
in a tournament so that you
can move up the payouts.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.500
That's different than
saying you should minimize

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.020
your monetary risk
because I'm still

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.680
assuming we're trying to
maximize our expected money

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.970
without worrying about risk.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.090
But we're only minimizing
tournament risk

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.520
to maximize your
expected amount of money.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.680
But I'm not saying
we should be overly

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.080
conservative in a
tournament and just

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.360
trying to move up the
money ladder slowly

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.110
when you should be gambling
because it's positive money

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.250
expectation.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.930
If you find yourself
in this situation,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.260
then if you're trying to
play professionally and just

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.840
maximize your expected amount
of money in every situation,

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.970
then you should probably
play smaller tournaments,

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.535
where this is not
really the case--

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:55.950
where this doesn't
occur too often.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.570
I can understand in practice,
if you play poker for fun

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.280
and you made it
far in a tournament

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.120
and it's the top,
let's say, 50K,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.810
and there's 55 left, I can
understand why you might not

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:15.120
want to make a positive money
expectation play because you've

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.170
played this tournament.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.170
You're probably not going
to be in the situation

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.930
that many times
in your lifetime.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.000
And you just really
want to cash the World

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.666
Series of Poker main
event or something.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:25.750
And I think that's a
reasonable life decision.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.625
I'm not criticizing
that life decision.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.365
But I'm going to talk about
all of these decisions

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.200
assuming we don't
care about that.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.290
We're still trying to maximize
expected amount of money.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.880
And if you are playing
professionally,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.800
where you're getting into that
situation very frequently,

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.690
then it is very important to
maximize risk in some cases

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.640
and to maximize your dollar EV
because in tournaments, you're

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.820
losing most of the time.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.060
You really have to win a lot
the times that you do win.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.360
You can't be content
because we made $30,000

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.710
if we could have made $50,000.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.379
So OK.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.670
So what is the exact formula
for ICM/ So I'm just going

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.240
to demonstrate how to
calculate the value of chips

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.980
in a tournament with an example.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.149
So ICM is essentially
a formula to calculate

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.279
how much your stack is
worth in a tournament.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:23.620
So let's suppose there's
three players left

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.480
and that payouts are 5, 3, 2.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.240
This is a common
structure in sit-and-goes

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.425
if you've played those, which
are 10-player tournaments.

00:04:30.425 --> 00:04:32.050
So this is the
statement is essentially

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.060
your chances of winning
the tournament is

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.850
proportional to your
percent of the total chips.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.570
And essentially we're
assuming this is true,

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.510
and we're going to derive
from it all the formulas.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.250
And this statement is
approximately true.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.800
There are more advanced
ICM calculators

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.900
that also take into
account your position

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.050
if the stack sizes are rather
shallow because there are

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.570
some inaccuracies
because this statement,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.520
it calculates only
based on chips.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.560
But if you're folding
and then you're

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.110
the button the next hand,
which is the best position,

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.400
then that's actually
an entire big blind

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.954
better almost than being
under the gun the next hand.

00:05:07.954 --> 00:05:09.620
But we're not going
to worry about that.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.410
We're just going to
assume your chances

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.910
of winning the tournament is
proportional to your percentage

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:14.440
of chips.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.470
So how do we calculate this?

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.380
So you can't really do
it by hand in practice.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:23.070
But for this example
with three people,

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.900
I'll show you how
to do it by hand.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.440
So let's suppose the chips
stacks are also 5, 3, 2.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.480
OK, so the payouts are 5, 3, 2.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.110
And the chip stacks
are also 5, 3, 2 ratio.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.900
If chip EV equals money EV,
then the guy with 5,000,

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:40.160
their equity from the
tournament should be $5.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.990
And the guy in third
place, their equity

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.370
should be $2, right?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.750
But this is clearly not correct
because the guy in third place

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.170
is guaranteed $2.

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.699
And clearly there's
a nonzero chance

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:50.990
of them winning the tournament.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.050
So clearly their equity
is actually more than $2.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:56.270
And then similarly
if you're player A,

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.450
your equity is clearly not $5
because you're not guaranteed

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.950
to win the tournament.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.130
So it's clear from this
example why if you just do chip

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.110
EV equals money EV,
that's clearly wrong.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.040
Is that clear to everyone?

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.900
So how do we calculate it?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.595
So let's calculate
it for player C.

00:06:13.595 --> 00:06:15.470
So essentially what it's
saying, your chances

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.700
of winning, your
chances of coming first

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.290
is 2,000 over
10,000, which is 20%.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.530
And then to calculate your
chances of coming second,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.930
you just condition on each
of the other player's way.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.580
So conditioned on
A winning, which

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:30.566
would happen 50% of
the time, we assume

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:31.940
that our chances
of coming second

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.529
is 2,000 divided by 5,000,
which is the remaining

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.820
number of chips besides player
A. Does that make sense?

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.670
So player A has 5,000 chips.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:45.310
So between you who's
player C and player D,

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.320
there's 5,000 chips in total,
and you got 2,000 of those.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.680
So it's 2,000 over
5,000, so it's 0.4.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.350
And then if player B wins, then
your chances of coming second

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.210
is 2,000 over 7,000.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.520
So overall, your chances
of coming second is 0.4--

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.820
So it says, 50% times
0.4 plus 30% times 2/7,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.470
which equals 2/7.

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:11.300
So then you can
calculate your equity

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.830
is-- you're guaranteed $2.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.600
And you have a 20% chance of
winning, which would give you

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.000
three additional dollars.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.550
And then a 29% chance of coming
second, which would give you

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.750
an additional dollar.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.870
So your equity is actually
2.89 in this case.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.522
is actually closer to second
place than third place.

00:07:28.522 --> 00:07:30.600
Does that calculation
make sense to everyone?

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.220
So if there's five
players, you just

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.820
have to recursively condition.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.160
You have to condition on
player A winning and then

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.500
go through all the possibilities
of who can come second.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.880
Then go through all
the possibilities

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.838
of who could comes third,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:42.838 --> 00:07:46.760
So it's not a calculation you
can really do in your head.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.300
But that it's quite easy to find
a calculator to do it for you.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:54.110
You just Google ICM calculator,
and you punch it in.

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:55.910
And even though it's not--

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.080
it grows exponentially.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.990
But there's only going
to be nine players.

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.300
So it's still fine.

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.246
It won't take that--

00:08:02.246 --> 00:08:03.620
the computer can
do it instantly,

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:07.550
even for 9-10 players.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:12.780
OK, so what are some cases
where ICM is easy to calculate?

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.730
So like I said, in cash games,
there is no such thing as ICM.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.400
You're just playing to maximize
expected number of chips.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.890
And your goal is
essentially, you're

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:25.650
sitting out at the cash game
looking to get into all-ins,

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.380
looking to get into
favorable all-ins,

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.510
hopefully winning the person
who you're targeting's money.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.450
And in winner-takes-all
tournaments,

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.277
it's also the same
because you're just

00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:39.360
looking at your chances
of winning the tournament.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.260
And that's always just
your number of chips.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.634
So you're just
trying to maximize

00:08:42.634 --> 00:08:44.690
expected number of chips.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.120
So as a corollary, once it
gets down to two players,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.660
there's no more
such thing as ICM.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.835
Three is the minimum
number of players you

00:08:51.835 --> 00:08:53.600
need for ICM to be relevant.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.840
Once it's two players, it's
just maximize your chip EV

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.390
because there's no sense of
trying to survive in hopes

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:01.950
that someone else busts first.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.850
Because with only two people,
for the other guy to bust,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.380
you have to take
all their chips.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.010
OK, so what are some
mathematical corollaries

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.260
of ICM formula?

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.380
So big stacks have money
EV less than chip EV.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.240
Small stacks have money
EV greater than chip EV.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.432
Small stacks also tend to have
positive chip EV in general.

00:09:24.432 --> 00:09:26.390
This is something I didn't
mention to you much.

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:28.740
But in general-- so you
might have seen this

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.900
if you guys have been to a
casino and played cash games.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:35.620
So let's say you sit down
at a table in a cash game

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.710
and everyone buys in
for 100 big blinds.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.020
At some tables, usually
they'll allow you to buy in

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.490
for as low as 20 big blinds.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.300
And if you do this,
in general, that's

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.590
going to be positive EV for
the guy with 20 big blinds

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:54.560
because there's situations
where they have to--

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.940
Where, let's say, they have
to essentially sometimes

00:09:57.940 --> 00:09:58.960
one guy will raise.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.040
One guy will call.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.510
And then you can go all in.

00:10:01.510 --> 00:10:04.210
And one guy will go
all in on top of you.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.500
And the other guy will fold.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:08.500
And then you have dead money.

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.230
So another thing is early
on in the tournament,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.454
ICM is irrelevant.

00:10:12.454 --> 00:10:13.870
You just want to
accumulate chips.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:18.160
So if you try to do this formula
early on in a tournament, what

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:23.050
you'll find is
essentially you're

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.660
so far away from the money
that none of the things

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.790
really matter to maximize
your chances of even

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.960
getting to the money.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.440
You just want to maximize
your number of chips.

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.830
So where is ICM most relevant?

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.340
It's most relevant on
the exact payout bubble

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:38.240
and on the final table.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.600
So roughly speaking, in
every poker tournament

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.680
I've seen other than strange
ones that are winner-takes-all

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.020
or satellites, the payout
looks roughly like this.

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.240
So it's 0.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.560
You go in, and once you hit
about top 20% is the bubble.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:58.180
And then there's a jump here
where suddenly you get paid.

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:01.430
This is about 80% get 0.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:03.290
So here there's a
jump, and then it

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:07.195
escalates slowly until you
get to the final table.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.420
Final-- sorry, I'll
actually switched to color--

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.650
final table.

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.780
And then it escalates
really fast.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.170
So essentially basically ICM
is most relevant at the points

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.160
where essentially,
the derivative,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:25.040
or the rate of change
the payout, is highest.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.480
And those points, as you
can see, are here and here.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.850
So essentially it matters
most at the exact money bubble

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:36.280
and in the final table.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.495
OK, let me clear this.

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.200
OK, so yeah, so
some more extreme

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.960
examples of ICM
you have one chip

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.060
left late in the tournament
when everyone else

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:48.200
has thousands of chips.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.970
So clearly this ship
is worth a lot more

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.190
than its value as a
fraction of the chips.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:54.410
And you're just trying to
survive with this one chip

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:56.690
essentially instead of
trying to win more chips.

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:01.460
Maybe I'll calculate
this in a bit.

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.507
So in satellites--
what satellites are

00:12:03.507 --> 00:12:05.090
are there are
tournaments where you're

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.430
trying to qualify for
a bigger tournament.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.380
So essentially the
important thing

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:12.020
is there will be
maybe 100 players.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.430
And there will be
10 seats, which

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.560
means the top 10 get an invite
to the bigger tournament.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.110
And then everyone
else gets nothing.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.320
So I guess the qualifiers for
the MIT Series of Poker Main

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.846
Event are kind of like this.

00:12:23.846 --> 00:12:25.220
I guess there's
other prizes, to.

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.094
But you're essentially
trying to come top 10.

00:12:27.094 --> 00:12:29.330
So this is how that works.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.860
And in that case, the
payout is essentially this.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:36.300
So there's not really
much incentive to win.

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:40.970
You're just trying to be one
of this top 10% that gets paid.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.210
So that's another case where
ICM has extreme importance.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:45.220
And you often find--

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.300
well, not often--
but you can often

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.620
make a case for folding
pocket aces preflop

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.830
even though you know it's
going to have positive chip

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.030
EV if you call because it's
the best possible hand.

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:59.310
But because you just really
don't want to bust, then

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.610
just you want to fold aces.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.014
OK, we'll talk about
this a bit more later.

00:13:05.014 --> 00:13:06.680
OK, so let's get back
to the tournament.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.290
So this is the final table.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:13.810
So ICM is going to be
quite relevant here.

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:15.980
As I'm talking through my
decisions in the hands,

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.520
I'll talk about the
ICM decisions as well.

00:13:22.415 --> 00:13:27.800
This is the first hand, or I
think maybe one orbit passed.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:29.720
We're at the final table.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:33.064
We're the second biggest stack.

00:13:33.064 --> 00:13:34.730
We should maybe look
at the stack sizes.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.450
So we look around
at the stack sizes.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.325
So what do you notice
about the stack sizes?

00:13:38.325 --> 00:13:40.560
Or specifically,
how are we doing?

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.115
How many chips do we have?

00:13:43.115 --> 00:13:43.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.021
WILL MA: Real.

00:13:46.021 --> 00:13:46.520
Right.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.590
We have quite a lot, right?

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:50.540
WILL MA: We have quite a lot,
but we're not in first place.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:52.640
There's this one
guy who covers us.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.930
So this Panpancrisy
guy who covers us.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:00.140
So specifically, the
thing I'm trying to avoid

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:04.250
is getting in a big
pot with Panpancrisy.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:07.220
Let's say he goes all in,
and I have pocket kings.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.360
I'm going to call.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.000
But I'm not going to be
that happy about calling

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.760
in a situation where otherwise
I should be very unhappy.

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.060
Just because chances are
he's going to have an ace.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.660
He's going to have 30% equity.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.900
It's still going to be
positive money EV call,

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:24.750
but it's so bad if I basically
bust right now in eighth place

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.270
against Panpancrisy.

00:14:26.270 --> 00:14:29.120
So essentially I'm
really incentivized

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.612
to avoid getting in
big pots with him.

00:14:31.612 --> 00:14:34.070
And I'm essentially hoping for
some of these smaller stacks

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:37.490
to bust so that then, even
if I lose a big pot to him,

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.130
I don't get the low
eighth place payout.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.070
So OK, so it's folded of us.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:44.720
We raise here.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.880
I think this is one
of the weakest hands I

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.260
am raising from the button.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.110
But so far players have
seemed to be reasonably tight,

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.730
so I'm going to raise.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.390
And then I get the blinds.

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:01.250
OK, so I'll skip some
hands at the beginning.

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.440
Near the end, I'll
play every hand.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.810
This hand we don't play, but
I'll try to show the hands

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:07.119
were someone busts.

00:15:07.119 --> 00:15:08.660
So this hand small
blind goes all in.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.100
Big blind calls.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.330
And so small blind
wins with 10-2

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.110
suited against ace-4, which is
basically great for everyone

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:17.240
at the table.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.310
Because someone
busted, you're always

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.120
cheering for people
who bust essentially.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.620
And I think also both
of their plays are fine.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:27.590
So I think small blinds
play-- it looks a bit silly.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.010
But realistically not only does
10-2 suited have reasonable

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.130
equity when you're
called, it's also--

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.650
the ICM is very, very relevant.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.430
This Gerardocks guy,
he's not the shortest.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.130
He is one of the shortest, so
he does need to take some risk,

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:45.270
but he's still really
very much would like

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:49.070
to bust after I show to Heap78.

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.020
So he can't call with anything.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:53.600
With ace-4, I think that's
definitely good enough to call.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.870
But let's say they
have king-2 offsuit.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.560
I think that's the situation
I'd normally call if it was not

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.000
a final table in a tournament.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.610
But at the final table,
where I'm not the shortest

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:05.150
and there's someone
shorter than me,

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.995
I would consider folding 10-2--

00:16:06.995 --> 00:16:14.740
sorry, king-2 offsuit here just
because of ICM essentially.

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:17.760
All right, so the next hand--

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.450
so the big blind busts.

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.350
And then there's no
small blind in this hand,

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:25.050
which is great because people
are less incentivized to steal.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:27.135
And indeed we get
our big blind back.

00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:28.010
AUDIENCE: That works.

00:16:28.010 --> 00:16:30.610
WILL MA: Very nice.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:32.030
OK, so not much happens here.

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.040
I'll skip forward a bit.

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.200
OK, this hand--

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.010
I guess it's quite
convenient for us.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:42.440
But this still
illustrates a point.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.540
So this guy, who
dealt a bit earlier,

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:46.550
now he goes all in
for quite a lot.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.050
This is quite a big shove.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.540
And if you play by
my recommendations,

00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:55.320
I would never recommend
shoving this many bets.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.810
It's 24.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:57.845
That's quite a lot--

00:16:57.845 --> 00:16:59.280
actually, 23, sorry.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.110
It's 23 big blinds, which
is way too much to shove.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.270
There's no need
to risk this much.

00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:08.660
But once again, I think his play
is justifiable because of ICM.

00:17:11.519 --> 00:17:12.560
So let's see what he had.

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.280
So we call.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.099
Here it's a bit
different because even

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:20.390
if I call and lose, I'm
not out of the tournament.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:23.420
Even if I would be out,
even if he had 200,000,

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.160
I'd probably still
call with queens.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:27.439
It's just too good to fold.

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.480
So we need ace-queen here,
which is great for us.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.790
But if you look at the play
from his perspective again,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:34.370
it actually seems
quite reasonable

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.160
if you think about it
because for him, ace-queen

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.840
is a great hand
from this position.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.150
It's definitely
good enough where

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:45.110
if it was between folding and
shoving for 23 big blinds,

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.900
you would definitely rather
shove for 23 big blinds.

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.520
So the main reason why normally
one would criticize his play

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.950
is because why doesn't he just
raise small with ace-queen?

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.610
Well, understandably,
he doesn't really

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:01.160
want to incentivize me
to reraise or Panpancrisy

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.910
to make a reraise.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.790
He essentially wants
to minimize the chances

00:18:04.790 --> 00:18:08.160
that he has to play for
his stack in this hand.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.520
And the way he does that is
essentially by going all in.

00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:16.310
Looking at back at it, I
think his play is fine.

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.790
The only weakness of
his play, I think,

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:23.120
is it is a bit predictable what
his hand is in this situation

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.720
because I think if he had a
hand as good as pocket aces,

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.227
then he shouldn't be doing this.

00:18:28.227 --> 00:18:30.560
He should just be raising
small because it's good enough

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.130
where he's happy getting it
in against me or Panpancrisy.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.250
Whereas also if his
hand was slightly worse,

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:40.370
like ace-jack offsuit I
think is a good example,

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:44.150
I think ace-jack offsuit
is not strong enough

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:45.550
to make this all-in play with.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.090
But you still want
to be raising.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.490
So I think there's a
small range of hands

00:18:49.490 --> 00:18:51.470
that you want to be making
this all-in play is.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.520
I think it's basically
exactly he's queen offsuit,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.040
may ace-king, maybe
ace-queen, ace-king.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:02.420
And then middle pairs, let's
say between like pocket 8s

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.760
and pocket 10s or something.

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.740
So the only downside
of this play I think

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.560
is essentially his range
here is very predictable it's

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.710
going to be ace-jack suited
plus ace-queen and pocket 8s

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.500
through 10s or
something like that.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:18.530
But nonetheless, I think,
because it's a final table,

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:21.401
because of ICM, it's fine.

00:19:21.401 --> 00:19:22.400
He gets unlucky, though.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.954
He runs into queens.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:25.370
All right, here
we've got to walk.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.400
OK, so let's see this hand.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.920
So I showed to--

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.270
raises goes all in.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.080
So we call here.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:38.680
We're deep enough where I want
to give myself the opportunity

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.680
to fold if Panpancrisy
he goes all-in.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.070
And we call.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.870
And we win.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.389
So OK, so I guess
I've been running

00:19:47.389 --> 00:19:48.680
pretty good in this tournament.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.440
But I just want to
point out, there

00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:53.434
is a lot of selection
bias here because I'm not

00:19:53.434 --> 00:19:54.850
going to play
through a tournament

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:57.300
where I get all-in on
the first hand and lose.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:00.010
So I mean I'm going to pick a
tournament that I [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.760
So it's in some sense not
the best pedagogical example

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.481
because there is a
lot of selection bias.

00:20:06.481 --> 00:20:08.980
You know that I'm going to run
very good in the tournament I

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:10.030
choose to show you guys.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:13.400
But if it's between that
and having be over in

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.100
five minutes because I lost--

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.256
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:17.256 --> 00:20:18.685
--this is the
lesser of two evils.

00:20:22.516 --> 00:20:24.830
All right, so here, yeah.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.170
So once again, this is a
pretty-- it's not that big,

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.340
but it's a 17 big blind shove.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:32.810
And once again, it's
justified by ICM prefold.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.650
OK, here, queen-7 off.

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:39.880
Yeah, I shove.

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.130
I think it's probably barely a--

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:46.210
I think it's pretty close
if chip EV equals money EV.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:49.080
It would be a borderline
shove with the smallish antes.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:53.910
But given ICM, I know he's
less incentivized to call

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.410
than usual.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:57.270
So all borderline hands I'm
going to be shoving, so I do.

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.770
OK, so this hand we get king-10.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:07.170
So once again, I just shove.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.410
Once again, I think I--

00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:13.080
basically it's hard for
them to call if I just shove

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.570
and because of ICM.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.640
So I'm essentially
bullying him, bully them.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:19.015
So when you're
the big stack, you

00:21:19.015 --> 00:21:24.180
can bully people at the
final table because of ICM.

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.770
We do get lucked
up here, though.

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.090
And we get lucked up at ace-8.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:31.360
And so he wins.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.030
I'm not going to do
an exact calculation

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.670
because I'm going to do an
exact ICM calculation later.

00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:42.710
I would guess his call
is very borderline.

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.360
It's definitely positive
chip expectancy,

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.820
but the fact that there's
this guy with only 57,000

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.710
and this guy with 70,000,
I think it's a call.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:55.194
But I think ace-6 is
definitely a fold.

00:21:55.194 --> 00:21:57.360
So I think it's probably
one of the weakest hands he

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.318
should be calling with.

00:21:58.318 --> 00:22:00.166
I think ace-8 is
probably too good.

00:22:00.166 --> 00:22:02.790
He has to call, but I think it's
very borderline in either case

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.380
because of ICM.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.020
So he does fold, though.

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:11.630
So now ICM is a bit trickier
because now we're smaller.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:14.130
We're getting it all in with
any of these guys can really

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:15.150
damage us.

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.010
And there's still
two short stacks

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.590
that everyone is
hoping will bust soon.

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:25.450
So In this situation, I
could go all in and bully

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:29.730
this Panpancrisy guy, but
ICM isn't that relevant.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:32.070
He's not going to fold
ace-queen if I go all in.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.140
So I just give this one to him.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.510
Calling is probably bad
anyway, but calling, I think,

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.310
is especially bad
because it just

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:44.780
increases the chances of
getting in a bigger pot.

00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:49.357
OK, we'll skip forward a bit.

00:22:49.357 --> 00:22:50.190
Let's see this hand.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:54.340
So ace-10 off here.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.460
So this guy makes it 12,000.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.100
And I guess I've skipped
a bunch of hands.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.890
So Nicholas Brody, I think,
has been very active.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.960
And overall, I think people
have become very active.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.540
Everyone's playing
a lot of pots.

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.380
So overall, I am going to
put people on wider ranges

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.780
than I normally do.

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:15.900
But nonetheless here,
I still fold ace-10.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.810
I think it's ace-jack I
would probably get it in.

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.080
And ace-10 suited, I
think I'd get it in.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.290
Ace-10 suited is borderline.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:30.330
Once again, when you're tied
between getting in a smaller

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:36.030
pot and getting in a bigger
pot, you want to be folding.

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.447
Yeah, so I guess
at a final table,

00:23:37.447 --> 00:23:38.488
I should make this clear.

00:23:38.488 --> 00:23:40.020
It's not like you
want to fold more.

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.540
It's you want to go all in
more when you're first to act.

00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.956
But call other
people's all-ins less.

00:23:45.956 --> 00:23:47.580
So that's exactly
what's going on here.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.200
He's already moved all in.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.920
And I'm going to
fold to his all-in

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:53.980
more often than
in a normal game.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.250
But as you can see,
I haven't really

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.350
been tighter in every sense
because when I get to go first,

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:02.310
I think actually going all
in more often and risking it

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:04.620
more often because I
know my opponents are

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.161
highly incentivized to fold.

00:24:08.161 --> 00:24:08.910
So they go all in.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:10.020
I fold here.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:12.880
So Nicholas Brody also
folds, which I guess is fine.

00:24:15.214 --> 00:24:17.130
Definitely he had pretty
odds he called there.

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.520
But once again, ICM just makes--

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.220
it changes things up a bit.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.340
Jack-7 suited, once again,
is a pretty big shove,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.099
but jack-7 suited plenty
good [INAUDIBLE]----

00:24:29.099 --> 00:24:29.640
ICM relevant.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.720
Pocket 9s here.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.750
We make it 12,000 on the button.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.090
So here I think pocket
9s is good enough

00:24:39.090 --> 00:24:42.300
where I'm happy if one of them
reraises all-in, and I call.

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.340
So essentially my
strategy here is

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:47.520
I'm going to shove all
my medium strength hands

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.020
and especially hands
that don't play

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.900
well postflop ace-2 offsuit.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:55.320
And then I'm going to raise
small with some of my hands

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.140
that are less good preflop but
better postflop, let's say,

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:02.910
10-8 suited, and also my
monster hands like pocket nines

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.250
that are also reasonable
to play postflop.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.140
So Nicholas Brody calls here.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:13.350
And the flop is ace,
jack, 7 with the hearts.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:15.120
So it's a bad flop
for our hand, but it's

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.020
a good flop for
our range because I

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.300
think, given the way the table
was going, I was opening a lot.

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.930
And Nicholas Brody
is very aggressive.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:26.620
I would guess unless
he had like pocket

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:31.670
aces, which he might slow
play, he would reraise most.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:35.180
I wasn't 100% sure-confident,
but I was reasonable--

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:39.770
I'd say maybe 85% confident
that if he had an ace preflop,

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:41.760
he would have just
went all in preflop.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:44.781
So overall, I'd still say it's
a very good flop for my range

00:25:44.781 --> 00:25:47.280
because I think he's way less
likely to have an ace than me.

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.680
There's a small
chance maybe he would

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.030
chicken out with ace-2
offsuit and just call.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.660
But given how
aggressive he's been,

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.220
I would be surprised
if he did that.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:58.770
So I decided to bet here.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.590
And I'm still not sure
how good this bet is.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:04.060
So I think at the
time I bet, because

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.620
of my logic that it's really
hard for him to have an ace,

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:10.230
and so I think the best
strategy for me on this flop

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:14.190
and in this situation is to
just bet 100% of my hands.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:16.860
And he's just forced
to fold basically

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:19.660
very often because he can't
really keep up with an ace.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.020
I can just continue betting.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:24.060
That being said,
though, I do think

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:26.550
if I do decide as
part of my strategy

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.530
to check any part
of my range here,

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.680
pocket 9s might actually be
one of the best possible hands

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.410
to check back.

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:34.530
So I think checking back
would have been fine.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.870
I guess I'd bet here
because I told myself,

00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:40.680
I want my strategy to be bet
100% of my hands, which I did.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:46.200
And he folds, which is
reasonably smart because he

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.710
knows that I can bet again.

00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:50.340
And he's going to have to make
a decision for all his chips

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:50.940
probably.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.273
And it's just going to be tough.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.680
OK, this hand--

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:01.881
BeMySponsor goes all
in, gets [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:05.318 --> 00:27:07.330
Yeah?

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.645
AUDIENCE: Why would you say,
pocket 9s is one of the best

00:27:10.645 --> 00:27:11.760
hands to check back here?

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:19.040
WILL MA: I very rarely
get called by worse,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.980
and I get called by
everything better.

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.680
I think he's always calling a
jack and usually folding a 7.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.050
Maybe he won't fold 7-8
with some back door draws,

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:29.295
but I think he'll
usually call a jack.

00:27:29.295 --> 00:27:31.020
And maybe he'll
call a 7 sometimes.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.670
But I still think mostly
it's just he'll basically

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:36.055
fold everything that beats
me and call everything that--

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:39.010
sorry, he'll fold everything
that I beat and call everything

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.672
that beats me basically.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:46.630
Yeah, but I still decide
to bet, nonetheless, just

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.310
to win the pot there
and not give him

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.037
extra outs if he happens to
have 10-6 suited or something.

00:27:54.719 --> 00:27:56.260
So OK, so we'll go
through this hand.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:57.640
So Panpancrisy raises.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.940
He doesn't go all
in, which is curious.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.230
But LPMBox calls.

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:03.430
He calls again.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.700
It's checked.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.257
And then LPMBox goes on
in the river [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.300
OK, jack-7 here?

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.094
Yes.

00:28:14.094 --> 00:28:16.010
I guess, so once again,
Nicholas Brady raises.

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:20.290
And then LPMBox goes on
over him, wins a big pot.

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.810
So I guess I do the
same for Nicholas Brady.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:29.290
He's been raising a lot,
so pockets 6s good enough

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:30.700
to risk going all in there.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.120
OK, this hand-- so we
get ace-jack suited.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.720
And I raise from cutoff.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.270
So I've been raising
to a fairly small size

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.700
because the antes are smaller.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.290
So that's one thing to
remember at a final table is

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:50.140
the pots are actually a bit
smaller because with only five

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.680
players the ante, the sum of
the antes, instead of normally

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:56.530
the 6,000, is only
3,000 in this case.

00:28:56.530 --> 00:29:00.080
So the big blind has
worse odds to call.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.860
So Nicholas Brady goes all in.

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.940
I look him up ace-jack suited--

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.320
definitely good enough.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:07.810
Also at this point,
because a number of pots

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:11.500
have gone my way, I'm big enough
where even if I call and lose

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.730
this, I won't be chip
leader, but I'll still

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.550
have a decent amount of chips.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:20.810
So unfortunately we
lose the ace-8 here.

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.750
So now we're second
place, but we're still

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.800
doing reasonably well.

00:29:29.770 --> 00:29:31.661
I could just maybe
gone all in here.

00:29:31.661 --> 00:29:33.160
I guess this guy
has a lot of chips.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.650
But I could've raised
to a bigger size

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:38.530
to disincentive Nicholas
Brody from doing this

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:40.030
with the right
wide range of hands

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:44.050
and then protecting my stack
more from an ICM point of view.

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.310
But I'm happy with--

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.200
I think ace-jack suited
is just good enough

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.147
where I'm happy
calling his all-in,

00:29:50.147 --> 00:29:51.730
which I should have
been in this case.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:52.820
I guess he had ace-6.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.270
OK, so jack-10 suited here.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.120
So yeah, here I just
decided to fold.

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.680
I mean we could consider
doing a crazy bluff all-in,

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.160
but I don't think this
guy's folding that often.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.760
They made a rather
big reraise preflop

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.492
from going three times
the initial opening.

00:30:18.492 --> 00:30:21.830
So Nicholas Brody goes all
in here, and they do fold.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.860
So Nicholas Brody picking
up a bunch of chips.

00:30:27.264 --> 00:30:28.555
So he just takes it down again.

00:30:28.555 --> 00:30:29.850
He's been raising quite a lot.

00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:39.400
Here we get a raise and a call.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.950
So LPMBox has been raising
over other people's--

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:47.020
opens quite a lot.

00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:49.490
So he gets called here,
but he holds and wins,

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:52.270
which is definitely
bad news for everyone.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:56.110
If I could pay 10,000
chips into the pot

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:58.024
to have this all-in
go the other way,

00:30:58.024 --> 00:30:59.690
it almost certainly
would be profitable.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:01.439
The amount actually
we'd be willing to pay

00:31:01.439 --> 00:31:05.810
you make this all-in go the
other way is probably 25,000.

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.590
It's a ridiculous amount
because just the value

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:10.780
of having people bust
and moving up the payouts

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.420
is so significant,
especially when I'm

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.196
not such a big stack anymore.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:22.300
OK, so now this guy,
he just doubled up.

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:24.010
So I guess we were
running pretty good.

00:31:24.010 --> 00:31:26.857
But I'd say in the last two or
three orbits, as you can see,

00:31:26.857 --> 00:31:28.690
a lot of things haven't
been that favorable.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.220
We've lost some all-ins.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:32.710
And also people
haven't really busted.

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:35.620
The chips are just being
passed around the table, which

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.130
is basically not what
you're hoping for.

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:44.090
So king-10 offsuit.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:45.134
We get a walk.

00:31:45.134 --> 00:31:47.050
So walk just means that
everyone folds to you,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.000
and the big blind.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.550
I think we've actually
gotten quite a lot of walks

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:52.380
at this final table.

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:54.150
So something we can
keep in mind if we're

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:58.855
trying to play exploitatively
later, queen-jack, go all in.

00:31:58.855 --> 00:31:59.355
He folds.

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:07.190
So at 8-7 I guess, LPMBox, after
winning that, so as you notice,

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.810
the big stacks are the ones
who win most of the pots.

00:32:09.810 --> 00:32:11.390
And this is expected.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.470
So whenever ICM is relevant,
you would expect that--

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:19.730
so although the small stacks had
a higher chip EV, then-- sorry,

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.430
had a higher money
EV than chip EV,

00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:24.687
usually the chips
get transferred

00:32:24.687 --> 00:32:26.270
from the small stack
to the big stacks

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:28.670
because the big stacks
have more license

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:34.040
to go all in first and
bully people around.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:37.520
So he takes this one down.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:39.530
Next hand, we get jacks here.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:41.600
So Panpancrisy is
actually short now even

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.950
though he started the final
table as the chip leader

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:45.980
because he's lost
a bunch of all-ins.

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:48.890
He gets an all-in here,
and we hold against a 6.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:53.800
So there's actually an
interesting play here.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.370
I don't think he
should have done it.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:58.330
But this is actually
often a good ICM play.

00:32:58.330 --> 00:33:02.157
So normally I would
say in this situation,

00:33:02.157 --> 00:33:04.240
if you have a good hand,
just go all in because he

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.470
knows I'm going to call.

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.450
So when ace-6, he
just went all in.

00:33:07.450 --> 00:33:11.110
But often there's this play
called the stop-and-go, which

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.597
is in practice not very good.

00:33:12.597 --> 00:33:14.180
I don't think it
would have been here,

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.060
but it's an interesting
theoretical concept,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.570
which is instead of going
on, he just calls, OK?

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.780
He calls, and then
he basically blindly

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:25.140
goes all in on the flop.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:26.950
He doesn't actually
have to, but this

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:28.144
is what players used to do.

00:33:28.144 --> 00:33:29.560
And you can do
this in live poker.

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.143
What you would do
in this situation is

00:33:31.143 --> 00:33:34.020
you would say, call, and before
the dealer even deals the flop,

00:33:34.020 --> 00:33:35.380
you would just say, all in.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.760
And this is a legal play.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.600
The point is
essentially-- it's an ICM.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:45.340
The justification, which I
think is mostly wrong but still

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:50.770
interesting, is he
wants to maximize

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:52.150
the chances that I fold.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.500
So essentially, OK, this
is strictly better, right?

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.170
Sorry, the fact that he would
call, let me see the flop,

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:01.570
and then I get to decide
whether to put the remaining

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:04.600
chips in sounds like it
should be better for me

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.120
than me having to put
all the chips in preflop.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.620
But the main reason
why he does this

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:13.420
is because he wants me to have
an opportunity to fold my cards

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.940
and avoid getting in a
situation where both of us

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.290
are playing for
our entire stack.

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:20.639
So this is the
justification for it.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:23.590
So even though you're giving
your opponent more information,

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:25.210
you're also
decreasing the chances

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:27.670
that they decide to
call to the river card

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.370
and have more chances
of beating you.

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.510
So that justification
is correct,

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.600
but it's just that if
you've crunched the numbers,

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.330
usually this situation
won't be favorable enough.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.730
And usually you don't want
to be giving your opponent

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:42.820
that extra information.

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.965
OK, so finally someone busts.

00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:49.860
We get jacks off again.

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.520
So here normally I think I would
often consider calling this,

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.530
but I think just avoid-- so
now the stacks are even--

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:58.770
we're the chip leader
but not by a ton--

00:34:58.770 --> 00:35:01.620
and I don't really want
to get in a big pot here.

00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:04.156
So I decide to give it to
them, even though normally I

00:35:04.156 --> 00:35:05.280
would definitely call this.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.200
King-7 suited.

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:12.660
I make a pretty big
all-in for 21 and 1/2 bets

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:14.090
from the small blind.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.180
And take it down.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:23.760
All right, we'll
see all the hands.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.220
We fold 6-3 suited here.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.890
BeMySponsor decided
to raise small, which

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:30.340
is, once again, a bit unusual.

00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:33.030
You usually just want to go
all in in a situation where

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.000
ICM is so relevant.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.250
And then Nicholas goes all in.

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:37.040
And he folds.

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.220
Jack-5 offsuit.

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:45.439
Here we fold.

00:35:45.439 --> 00:35:46.980
So once again, this
guy raises small.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:50.940
So maybe he doesn't really
want to do this ICM thing

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.799
and just he wants to play pots.

00:35:53.799 --> 00:35:55.090
He takes that one down, though.

00:35:58.381 --> 00:36:00.630
Nicholas Brody-- so as you
can see, it's a bit boring.

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:01.963
There's not too many hands here.

00:36:01.963 --> 00:36:06.330
That's what happens with there's
ICM because you don't really

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:07.260
want to splash around.

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.390
You just want to survive
in the tournament

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:11.910
by risking all your
chips once in a while

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:16.980
instead of slowly bleeding your
chips in a variety of pots.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:20.090
So once again, queen-9
suited, big all in.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.390
Plenty good enough.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:24.710
Queen-7 suited, I
decide to raise it up.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:28.770
But unfortunately, I guess, even
if just one guy went all in,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.210
I'm clearly folding.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.650
So they both go all in.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:35.340
And ace-king beats kings, which
is really bad news for everyone

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:37.300
essentially because
if kings held,

00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:38.400
then he would have busted.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.665
But unfortunately he doesn't.

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:46.544
So pocket 8s, I'm raising here.

00:36:46.544 --> 00:36:48.460
This would have been a
gross spot, by the way.

00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:52.449
I think if BeMySponsor
went on here,

00:36:52.449 --> 00:36:53.990
I don't know what
it would have done.

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:57.370
it would have been very
gross because on one hand,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.590
I definitely don't want to
be folding a hand as good

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.860
as pocket 8s.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.460
But on the other hand,
ICM is just so relevant,

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.180
I think I probably have to fold.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.805
So yeah, this is a case where
I could've made an extreme,

00:37:09.805 --> 00:37:11.290
a hero fold essentially.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.300
I folded a very good hand
if BeMySponsor went all in.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:21.130
So king-jack off--
you get another walk.

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:28.955
OK, jack-10 off.

00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:31.330
I'll tell you what happened,
and then we'll take a break.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.230
And then I'll analyze it after.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.188
This hand I want to
analyze in a bit more depth

00:37:34.188 --> 00:37:36.300
because I was actually
surprised going

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.500
through the replays looking
at how I played this.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:43.180
So LPMBox makes it 16,000.

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:50.920
And I reraise to 44,444, so
essentially I think this--

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.330
I don't have a great hand.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:56.080
But I think this hand is too
good not to make a bluff with.

00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.890
So I do that.

00:37:57.890 --> 00:37:59.470
And then he goes all in.

00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:01.480
And then I think this
is a very tough spot

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.530
because my hand isn't good.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:06.780
But when I reraise, I
definitely had the--

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.630
if this guy had
fewer chips, I would

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.880
have just went all in myself.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.025
I definitely didn't
reraise to this size

00:38:12.025 --> 00:38:16.850
thinking I would even consider
folding if he moved on.

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:18.610
So yeah, the reason
I made this size

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:21.160
is so that if this guy
went all in, I could fold.

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:25.769
But as it turns out, he
folded, and he went all in.

00:38:25.769 --> 00:38:27.560
So let's analyze this
hand after the break.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.136
We'll take a short
two-three minute break.

00:38:30.136 --> 00:38:31.611
OK, I'll get started again.

00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:33.110
So OK, so let's
calculate this hand.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.430
So I actually decided to go
back and calculate this hand

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.820
from an ICM perspective because
ICM is basically very relevant

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:40.864
here.

00:38:40.864 --> 00:38:43.030
OK, so let's see exactly
how to do this in practice.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:50.440
OK, so let's first do the
chip EV calculation, OK?

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.450
Let me first do the
chip EV calculation.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.100
You can trust that I copied
the numbers correctly.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.430
So essentially there's
three possibilities, OK?

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.377
There is if I fold, this
is the amount of chips.

00:39:03.377 --> 00:39:04.960
This is the amount
of chips I'll have.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.880
OK, so right now I'm
only caring about chips.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.400
So if I fold, this is the
amount of chips I'll have.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.947
If I call and win, this is
the number of chips I'll have.

00:39:11.947 --> 00:39:14.530
And if I call and lose, this is
the amount of chips I'll have.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:20.110
So we could basically do a
calculation here where I do

00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:22.590
essentially it's-- so let's
say my chances of winning is x.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:31.300
So it's x times how many chips
I have if I call and lose,

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:32.920
which is 107--

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.840
I'm going to not write
the last three zeros--

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:40.798
plus 1 minus x times 402.

00:39:40.798 --> 00:39:42.006
Sorry, I did this in reverse.

00:39:42.006 --> 00:39:44.415
OK, x is my chances of losing.

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:45.790
So again, I'm
basically comparing

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:49.810
this number versus how many
chips I have if I fold, OK?

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.880
And then essentially
I'm just solving for x.

00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.760
So the way I do it is I
set these to be equal,

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.320
and then I calculate x.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.600
And that's the
breakeven x, which

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.770
tells me what's the minimum
equity I need against his range

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.910
to call.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:04.670
So we can do that.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:06.440
So I think it turns out to be--

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:17.480
so this formula is equal to
fold minus call over-- hang on--

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.200
I did it before.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:20.950
OK, so this is easy.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:25.795
OK, so I Ctrl+Z, so essentially
I had 2 to 1 odds, right?

00:40:25.795 --> 00:40:27.590
I had 2 to 1 odds,
so it makes sense

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:31.370
that I needed a 33% equity call.

00:40:31.370 --> 00:40:32.945
OK, so how do we do this side?

00:40:32.945 --> 00:40:35.180
These are essentially
the ICM numbers.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.680
So essentially the
way you calculate

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:42.380
this is you Google
ICM calculator,

00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:44.360
and then you just
go to the first one.

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.920
It's usually quite easy to find.

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.840
OK, so it's a bit
tricky because you have

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.450
to put in the exact payouts.

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.720
So I think at the
time they were 18.5.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:56.040
This is all as a percentage
of the total pot.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:00.680
So I forget exactly the numbers,
but it was something like this.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.740
OK, and then you type
in the four-- you type

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:03.870
in the stack sizes.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.260
So it takes a bit
of time and even

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.560
if you're fast at this, if
you conserve your entire time

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.424
bank from the whole tournament
for this one calculation,

00:41:12.424 --> 00:41:14.090
you'd probably have
enough time to do it

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:17.330
because you'll probably have
like two or three minutes

00:41:17.330 --> 00:41:18.690
of time bank saved up.

00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:19.850
So you probably can do it.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.379
You have to essentially, right?

00:41:21.379 --> 00:41:22.670
So there's three possibilities.

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:26.159
I have to calculate if I fold,
not only how many chips I have

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:27.700
but how many chips
everyone else has.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.825
And then I take them in,
and then I can essentially

00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:33.200
calculate the value of my
stack in terms of as a fraction

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.760
of the total money in the pot.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.580
And then similarly, I do
it for the other two cases.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.320
And then I calculate
the ICM numbers.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:41.680
And roughly speaking,
this is my--

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.370
this is all normalized.

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:52.590
This is roughly my dollar EV in
each of these three scenarios.

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:54.540
If I do the same
calculation, I'll

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:59.480
find that I actually
need 39.6 equity.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.760
So far does the calculation
make sense to everyone?

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.380
I didn't do all the
steps in practice,

00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.300
but I explained how
to do all the steps.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.340
Yeah, if you're
fast, it still takes

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.270
like a minute-a minute and 1/2.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.652
But the last part is now we
have to open Poker [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:12.652 --> 00:42:15.440
And now we have to type
in jack-10 offsuit.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.450
And then we have to
put him on the range.

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:21.280
So OK, let's just put him on a--

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.450
OK, I suspect that
I'm probably going

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:30.940
to have to fold because
39.6% is quite a lot.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:36.170
I'm going to put him on the
loosest range and see a 539.6.

00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:37.810
So let's say he's pretty loose.

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:42.290
So he's willing to gamble with,
let's say, pocket 4s plus--

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:44.840
I mean, another
thing that's relevant

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.920
here is I think it looks like
he doesn't have fold equity.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.260
I don't think when
he's going all in here

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:53.390
he suspects that
I'm ever folding.

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:55.010
Or at least he
probably thinks I'm

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:58.170
calling him the overwhelming
majority of the time.

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:01.550
So I think he's rarely going to
turn up a stone bluff like 8-7

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:04.820
suited because of this.

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:06.320
I would be very
surprised if he ever

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.970
had 8-7 suited unless
he read into this

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:14.510
and realized that I could
actually fold some hands here,

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:16.390
which maybe he did.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:19.380
I should give him enough credit.

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.180
OK, let's just do
something somewhat quick.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.160
Let's say he gets ace-8
offsuit, ace-5 suited

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.030
plus, king-jack suited,
king-queen off, and pocket

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:29.100
4s plus.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.920
So that's 14.6% of hands.

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.260
So let's do this.

00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:36.736
So against this we
have 36% equity.

00:43:36.736 --> 00:43:37.610
So that's not enough.

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.110
We need 39.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.260
Let's see how wide his range
has to be for us to have 39.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:45.410
All right, let's say he
gets in with 20% of hands,

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:49.316
which is quite a lot, which
is, I think, way too much.

00:43:49.316 --> 00:43:53.490
Let's say 18.6 percent of hands.

00:43:53.490 --> 00:43:55.550
Oh, we actually have
worse against this range

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:58.174
because it has-- oops-- because
it has more hands that dominate

00:43:58.174 --> 00:44:00.630
us because I put in a
lot of hands like king-10

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:02.990
and removed a lot of
the hands like ace-4.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:07.000
So basically OK, you can play
with it however you want.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.530
But I think it's hard
to play with it in a way

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:13.350
to give yourself 39%
equity unless you

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.970
were very optimistic about
how wide his range was.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.510
So in either case, so
at the time I did fold.

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:23.240
And it looks weird to me at
first, but after analyzing it,

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:25.400
I think this is
definitely the right play

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.530
if you take into account ICM.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:29.900
So I think it's a
good example of ICM

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.260
because if you remember when
we were playing with it,

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:38.510
our equity was always
essentially between 33 and 39.

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:42.080
If we put them on a looser
range, our equity would be 37.

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.110
And if we put them on a tighter
ranger, our equity would be 34.

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:48.920
But basically it's a
situation where I would always

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:52.820
call if ICM was not
relevant and always fold

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.640
if ICM was relevant.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.980
And this isn't even a case
where it looks like ICM

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:00.315
should be that relevant.

00:45:00.315 --> 00:45:01.550
Yeah, so we do fold.

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:04.740
So with hindsight, maybe my
initial strategy was wrong.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:07.070
Maybe I should have should
not have even bluffed here.

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.250
Maybe I should have just
folded in the first place.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:10.291
That's a different story.

00:45:10.291 --> 00:45:12.569
But given that I
did bluff, I think

00:45:12.569 --> 00:45:14.110
the best thing I
can do here is fold.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:20.970
OK, let me just jump back
to the PowerPoint for a bit.

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:22.620
So I just want to
talk about a bit more

00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.700
about this theory of satellites
and going all in first.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:30.435
So in game theory, this is
called the traffic intersection

00:45:30.435 --> 00:45:31.230
game.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.200
So ICM does not
say, play tighter.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:37.140
It allows you to play looser
if you can go all in first.

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.060
So this is where
I actually think

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.430
it's very interesting
because in satellites, you

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:42.870
want to be under the gun.

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:45.530
So normally in poker, that's the
worst position because you've

00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:46.770
got to act first.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:49.260
Everyone else gets
to act after you.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:51.420
But in satellites,
basically you just

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:54.600
want to be the first person to
be able to threaten, say, look,

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.890
I'm putting all my chips in.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.320
You pretty much have to fold.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:01.260
So in satellites, let's
say there's 11 people left,

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:02.780
and 10 people get a seat.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.680
If you go on, no
one can call you

00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:08.760
even if they have aces
because to call you,

00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:10.920
they essentially need
to be more than 10/11

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.854
sure that they're
going to win the hand.

00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:14.270
And even if they
have pocket aces,

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:16.410
they're not going to be
10/11 sure that they're

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:17.460
going to win the hand.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:22.880
So basically going all in
first is very, very good.

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.930
So it's called the
traffic interception game

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:26.880
because you can imagine
the situation where

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.420
there's two cars trying to pass
each other at an intersection.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.200
And you want to save
time, get there first.

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.140
But you're worried that
the other guy might crash.

00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:38.932
Both players really
want to avoid disaster,

00:46:38.932 --> 00:46:40.681
but both players really
want to be the guy

00:46:40.681 --> 00:46:41.710
to get through first.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.850
Well, if you can act first, and
if you just tell the guy, look,

00:46:44.850 --> 00:46:46.650
I'm closing my eyes.

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:47.640
I'm tying up my hands.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.110
I cannot stop my car, OK?

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:52.770
I'm just going to go through
the intersection no matter what.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:55.050
If you're the first person
to be able to do this, then

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:56.880
the other guy, he's
like, OK, I guess

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.250
I've got to stop my car
now and let you go first.

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:00.960
That's essentially
what it's like.

00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:03.870
If you're the first person to go
all in and you've already said,

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:05.700
look, I'm all in,
and there's nothing

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:08.599
I can do to take my chips back,
then the other guy is like,

00:47:08.599 --> 00:47:09.890
all right, I guess I'll follow.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.220
And you can win the blinds.

00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:13.290
So it's sort of how it works.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.520
Of course, some opponents
are not rational.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:16.952
If you do this
enough times, they

00:47:16.952 --> 00:47:18.690
might be like, OK, screw this.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:22.220
I'm just going to kill
this guy and speed up.

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.481
So it's a bit weird, and in
practice, this happens a lot,

00:47:25.481 --> 00:47:25.980
too.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.100
I've definitely had very
bad situations where

00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.440
I'm going all in
with any two cards,

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:34.770
and I know this is a game
theoretically optimal strategy.

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:36.810
But my opponents are sped up.

00:47:36.810 --> 00:47:39.910
And then he calls me with
ace-jack or something.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:41.410
And then I'll have
jack-2 offsuited.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.201
And he looks like a
genius, and he beats me

00:47:43.201 --> 00:47:45.262
when his play is just
terrible basically.

00:47:45.262 --> 00:47:45.762
Yeah?

00:47:45.762 --> 00:47:47.053
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so interesting.

00:47:47.053 --> 00:47:49.590
So does it matter if,
say, you're under the gun,

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:50.976
and you're in the low stack.

00:47:50.976 --> 00:47:52.085
Can you do this?

00:47:52.085 --> 00:47:52.710
WILL MA: Right.

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:53.960
So the stack size does matter.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.190
So I'm assuming if everyone
had the same stack size

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:58.350
in that extreme
example, where I said

00:47:58.350 --> 00:47:59.910
other people should
fold aces, I'm

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:01.890
assuming everyone has
the same stack size.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:05.150
AUDIENCE: I guess where's the
balance between knocking you

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.850
out versus the
chips differential?

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.300
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.680
So the reason, in
that case where

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.510
it's correct to fold
aces, is because let's say

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.150
they call and knock me out.

00:48:15.150 --> 00:48:18.090
It doesn't help them that
much because first place

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:22.320
in a satellite does not get
paid any more than 10th place.

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.375
But in real tournaments,
you basically

00:48:24.375 --> 00:48:27.410
never fold aces
because even if you're

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:30.040
risking losing all your
money, just first place

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.150
will be hire than
second place by enough.

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.830
And winning with those aces
will increases your chances

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:38.740
of coming first by so much that
you should just gamble anyway.

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:40.030
So this is only in satellites.

00:48:40.030 --> 00:48:44.479
Yeah, please don't fold aces in
like a normal poker tournament.

00:48:44.479 --> 00:48:44.978
Yeah?

00:48:44.978 --> 00:48:47.705
AUDIENCE: If you're a short
stack in a satellite or one

00:48:47.705 --> 00:48:51.120
of the shorter stacks, does
going all in still make sense?

00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.530
Because people can call you
without risking a tournament.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:55.530
WILL MA: Right, exactly.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:58.380
So in that case, you actually
need a good had to go all in.

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:00.250
You actually need to
have positive chip EV

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:01.500
as well to go all in.

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:05.440
Yeah, so that's why when ICM is
relevant, the small stacks win.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.322
And the big-- sorry,
the small stacks lose.

00:49:07.322 --> 00:49:08.280
And the big stacks win.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.140
Because the big stacks
have more license

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:14.850
to bully small sacks around,
whereas the small stacks can't

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.995
because the big stacks can
call at them more often.

00:49:16.995 --> 00:49:20.250
AUDIENCE: And also does it
matter if other people have

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:21.810
raised behind you?

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:25.026
Does it just matter
who goes all in first?

00:49:25.026 --> 00:49:27.690
WILL MA: So if someone's
already raised,

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.170
then it's more likely
you going all in--

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:32.790
it's more likely
they are already

00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:35.920
committed so that if you
go all in, they won't fold.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.354
So that is relevant, yeah.

00:49:38.354 --> 00:49:41.470
OK, and cool.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:42.570
Right, so exactly.

00:49:42.570 --> 00:49:44.140
So in practice,
it's very tricky.

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.515
And in fact, it
can be beneficial

00:49:45.515 --> 00:49:47.931
if you can somehow convince
your opponents that you're not

00:49:47.931 --> 00:49:48.570
rational.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.278
I've never personally
done this, but I've

00:49:50.278 --> 00:49:53.340
heard of people making a bad
call sometimes in a satellite

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.600
just so people know not to
mess with him essentially.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.340
But I mean it's a bit weird.

00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:01.500
There is this weird
metagame with this traffic

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.660
intersection-type
game, although this

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:07.050
is only relevant in the most
extreme ICM situations, which

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.670
are satellites.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.570
Actually, I should
say, one scenario

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:15.300
where I think you could
consider folding aces

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:18.850
preflop in a normal
tournament is actually this.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:20.780
Let's say there's 55 until--

00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.070
let's say 54 get paid.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:24.290
And there's 55 left.

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:26.045
And you've got one
chip, and everyone else

00:50:26.045 --> 00:50:27.440
has thousands of chips.

00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:29.754
And you know that
someone else has already

00:50:29.754 --> 00:50:30.920
gotten eliminated that hand.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.920
So if you fold, you're
guaranteed to get in the money.

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.750
Then I would
definitely fold aces

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.450
because even if you win in
double up, congratulations,

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:40.790
you now have 10 chips
instead of one chip.

00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:43.160
Everyone still has
thousands of chips.

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.400
There are cases where you could
construct an extreme case where

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.510
you should fold aces
preflop in a tournament,

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.601
in a normal tournament as well.

00:50:51.601 --> 00:50:56.260
OK, so let's get back
to the tournament now.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.500
OK, where were we?

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.730
So we lost a bunch
of chips here.

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.205
So the next hand we
get king-8 offsuit.

00:51:05.205 --> 00:51:07.880
I raise from the button.

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.390
So we are committed here.

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:12.410
It sucks because our hand
sucks, but it's way too

00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:14.180
good odds to call.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.060
And ICM is nowhere
near that relevant

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.870
when it's against
the small stack.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.710
It's the guy you're
trying to eliminate.

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:20.210
So we call.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:23.540
We get pretty lucky here.

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.140
Good redemption for that
terrible jack-10 hand

00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:27.830
played by me.

00:51:27.830 --> 00:51:30.320
OK, so there's
three players left.

00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.300
So ICM is still very relevant.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:33.820
We're the second stack.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:38.420
So we're trying not to get in
a big all-in with this guy,

00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.020
although it's less significant
because this guy still

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:43.400
has a decent amount of chips.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.290
If this guy only
had 50,000 chips,

00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:47.930
then I would try a lot
harder to avoid getting

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:51.080
in a big pot with BeMySponsor.

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.260
So-- oops.

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:56.100
So yeah, so he raises,
and LPMBox goes all in,

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:56.960
takes it down.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:03.230
So this hand, he makes it 3x.

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:07.250
And I decide to call it here
with queen-6 suited, which

00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:08.450
is gutsy I think.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:11.810
But I think it's in position,
and it's fairly deep.

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:14.967
And being able to put ICM
pressure on him is reasonable.

00:52:14.967 --> 00:52:16.550
I think it could
have gone either way.

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:20.510
Folding is definitely
the safer play,

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:24.890
but queen-6 suited is
plenty good enough here.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:25.910
So I call.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:27.334
He just checks.

00:52:27.334 --> 00:52:29.000
He might just be
giving up on this board

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.150
where there's a decent amount
of-- it's fairly dry, right?

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:35.245
So from what I said last class,
if the board is fairly dry,

00:52:35.245 --> 00:52:38.360
where every hand has something,
if you've got absolutely

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.310
nothing, then
there's not even much

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:43.910
point to make a bluff like if
he's got ace-2 offsuit here.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:47.030
So he just checks in,
and I bet, and he folds.

00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:51.710
So he probably had ace-2
offsuit some hand like that.

00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.800
Next hand we get ace-king.

00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:56.090
I decide to raise
small here once again.

00:52:56.090 --> 00:53:00.680
So I guess this protects
that jack-10 hand.

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.180
If I'm doing this
with jack-10, I

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.970
do need to do it with good
hands as well to protect

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:07.520
the times I do have jack-10.

00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.630
Unfortunately, he
guesses correctly.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:11.560
He doesn't fold, and I
have jack-10 and folds.

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.393
And I have ace-king.

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.400
So he still take that one downs.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.890
And we win the blinds
the next hand again.

00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:22.730
So suddenly we're worried
chip leader by a decent margin

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.430
after those three hands.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:30.730
9-4 off-- I'm not going
to call, so fold to him.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:33.060
So jack-7, so once
again, because of ICM,

00:53:33.060 --> 00:53:35.690
this guy just goes all in
knowing we can't call that

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:36.670
much.

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:39.210
Takes it down.

00:53:39.210 --> 00:53:41.570
7-6 offsuit, I decide to fold.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:44.450
I think that's very reasonable
considering they can just

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:45.650
go all in on top of that.

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.830
Queen-9, queen-9
off, get a walk.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.330
So one thing I
should pay attention

00:53:52.330 --> 00:53:54.340
is I do think these guys--

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.680
by now I've collected
enough data points

00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:59.180
of getting a walk way
more often than I should,

00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.790
where I think it's not
just a coincidence.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:05.200
I'm statistically confident
enough that they're actually

00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:06.610
just giving me too many walks.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:09.120
So when they don't
give me a walk,

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.470
I should put them on a
stronger range of hands

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:14.080
than I normally do.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:16.080
Pocket 10s, we three-bet
this guy again.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:17.110
He gets away again.

00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:22.317
So 6-2 off, so we've
gotten dealt good cards

00:54:22.317 --> 00:54:24.650
even though we haven't gotten
too much action from them.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.000
We're still winning by two
chips from getting good cards.

00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:33.120
So jack-4 off, I'm going
to fold to this guy.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:34.930
So as you can see,
it's fairly boring,

00:54:34.930 --> 00:54:38.860
but I think this
is what essentially

00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:43.000
should happen in the
final couple of people

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.280
left in the tournament.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.860
Ace-10 off, so I decide
to not go all in here.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.915
I guess that would be 27 big--

00:54:52.915 --> 00:54:56.420
26 and a 1/2 big blinds,
which is a bit much.

00:54:56.420 --> 00:54:59.650
So I decided to
just raise small.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.460
If he three-bets, if he
reraises to, say, 60,000,

00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.680
I'm always going all in here.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:10.540
If he goes all in himself,
I'm basically not folding

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:13.417
even though it sucks from
an ICM point of view.

00:55:13.417 --> 00:55:15.250
I think ace-10 offsuit
is just way too good.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:19.330
So I'm essentially just raising
small looking for action here.

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:19.960
He folds.

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.540
7-2 offsuit, we raise-- no.

00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:31.820
So LPMBox gets a walk.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.620
Queen-3 off, we get another
walk, which is nice.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:42.630
Jack-5 off, I raise
here, which is definitely

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:43.930
an exploitative play.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:47.950
It's definitely not-- definitely
from a Nash equilibrium optimal

00:55:47.950 --> 00:55:50.890
play point of view,
there's no way

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.780
the optimal strategy is to
raise a fraction of hand

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.320
so big that it includes
jack-5 offsuit.

00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:59.200
But I think at the
time, I probably

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:01.985
told myself, this guy
was being overly scared.

00:56:01.985 --> 00:56:04.450
Even though he was playing
somewhat aggressive earlier on,

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:07.870
he is maybe
overadjusting for ICM

00:56:07.870 --> 00:56:10.420
and is respecting me
too much in the presence

00:56:10.420 --> 00:56:12.610
of this short stack.

00:56:12.610 --> 00:56:14.800
I can look at the HUD
stats at the time,

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:18.580
although they won't be that
accurate because they're

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.920
going to include all the hands.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:24.460
So normally I do play
with all these numbers on.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:26.270
So we can see that his--

00:56:26.270 --> 00:56:28.090
yeah, but it's
going to be biased

00:56:28.090 --> 00:56:31.870
because this includes
the hands with six

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:33.490
or seven people at the table.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:38.860
But it says that he calls
from the big blind only 20%

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:39.370
of the time.

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.882
But that's not a great--

00:56:41.882 --> 00:56:43.090
yeah, that's going to biased.

00:56:43.090 --> 00:56:46.870
So it doesn't tell us too much.

00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:48.929
But I guess at the time,
I must have told myself

00:56:48.929 --> 00:56:50.470
I'm going to try to
exploit this guy.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:53.080
That's the only way I
can see why I decided

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:55.810
to raise jack-5 offsuit here.

00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:56.740
So we get a call.

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:59.170
But I'm going to
continuation bet.

00:56:59.170 --> 00:57:01.300
We do have a
backdoor heart draw,

00:57:01.300 --> 00:57:04.300
and this is our best chance
of just winning the pot.

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.970
And I could maybe barrel on--

00:57:06.970 --> 00:57:10.790
by barrel, I mean bet again as
a bluff on a bunch of turns.

00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:13.110
So I just bet here.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:13.780
He does fold.

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:19.870
Next hand with queen-9,
we open the button,

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:21.760
but we get shoved on.

00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.440
And I guess we have to fold.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:29.010
Queen-4, we get another walk.

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.843
Yes, so this is actually
getting ridiculous.

00:57:30.843 --> 00:57:32.950
It seems like we've
literally gotten

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.510
five or six walks in a row.

00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:40.000
And I would guess probably we
should be getting a walk less--

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.940
I guess at a three-handed
table, it's more often but still

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:45.282
less than like 30% of the time.

00:57:45.282 --> 00:57:45.781
Yeah?

00:57:45.781 --> 00:57:47.406
AUDIENCE: Is it
possible you're getting

00:57:47.406 --> 00:57:51.030
walks because someone
has raised your big blind

00:57:51.030 --> 00:57:52.640
and you defended a lot?

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.005
And so they're scared
to raise your big blind?

00:57:55.005 --> 00:57:55.630
WILL MA: Maybe.

00:57:55.630 --> 00:57:57.520
I have been fairly active.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:58.960
But I did fold a bunch of--

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:02.350
I did fold some borderline
situations, though,

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:03.424
like this jack--

00:58:03.424 --> 00:58:04.840
I think it was a
different jack-7.

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:06.814
But yeah, maybe.

00:58:06.814 --> 00:58:07.480
That's possibly.

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.826
Yeah, very good point.

00:58:09.826 --> 00:58:10.805
But that's good, right?

00:58:10.805 --> 00:58:11.930
It's good that we're like--

00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:16.640
I'm not complaining that
we're getting a lot of stuff.

00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:20.470
And we are the big stack, so in
general, it is harder for them

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:22.810
to bully us around than
us to bully them around.

00:58:22.810 --> 00:58:25.870
So it does make sense from
that point of view, too.

00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:27.905
I saw that it was just too many.

00:58:27.905 --> 00:58:29.280
Anyway, so I just
continue trying

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:32.230
to raise a lot, especially
against this guy.

00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:35.420
So jack-8 offsuit,
we take it down.

00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:37.420
Jack-2, maybe we
could have folded.

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:39.940
But by now this guy was
getting short enough.

00:58:39.940 --> 00:58:42.760
He's blinded down from
15 and 1/2 big blinds,

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:44.530
I think, to 13 and 1/2.

00:58:44.530 --> 00:58:46.570
He might have had
more before, like 17.

00:58:46.570 --> 00:58:50.260
So he might be looking
for a spot to shove now.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.170
BeMySponsor actually
raises a small here

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:53.710
and gets him to fold.

00:58:57.895 --> 00:59:00.200
And jack-6 off here.

00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.040
We get another walk.

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.790
I should just skip the
hands on big blinds

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:07.660
since nothing ever happens,
which is great for us.

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:10.810
So pocket 3s here,
I just go all in.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:14.700
So I talked about this before.

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.470
What's a problem with what
this play in some sense?

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.800
AUDIENCE: Reverse implied odds?

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.860
WILL MA: Right, good.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.900
So yeah, so if I don't do
this, if I just raise small,

00:59:27.900 --> 00:59:30.890
I have bad reverse
implied odds, right?

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:34.140
But one particular issue
is every other time

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.910
we've made it 25,000.

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:38.820
And really nothing's changed,
and suddenly we go all in.

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:42.800
So it is a bit suspicious
where he basically

00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.440
knows we have a hand that has
very bad reverse implied odds.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.680
He basically knows we have
pocket 3s or ace-4 offsuit

00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:50.640
or something like that.

00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.240
But it's still hard
for him to exploit.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.570
I mean sure, you can call
ace-9 and exploit us,

00:59:57.570 --> 01:00:00.090
but ace-9 is already
a great hand.

01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:02.370
Or you can call pocket
4s and exploit us,

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:06.000
but it's not that easy to get
dealt pocket 4s or a better

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.970
pair than pocket 4s.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:13.160
So here yeah, even though
against a good player, he knows

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:15.990
my range is a very small
specific number of hands.

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.630
It's still hard for him to--

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.080
he can't really just
call jack-10 suited here.

01:00:20.080 --> 01:00:24.200
Maybe he can, but probably
jack-9 suited or queen-7

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.810
suited he can't call
because there's still

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:31.491
an off chance we have
queen-9 offsuit or something.

01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:32.750
Oops.

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:35.280
So anyway, so he does fold.

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:38.180
But it definitely
raises suspicion.

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.415
Jack-10 off, so jack-10
off, we just go all in here.

01:00:42.415 --> 01:00:44.410
So this is actually important.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.770
So normally I would just
raise from the button,

01:00:46.770 --> 01:00:49.020
but by now, the big
blind has gotten

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:51.870
so short that I'm
willing to just go

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:55.350
all in because the big blind is
short enough where even if he

01:00:55.350 --> 01:00:57.450
picks up a hand and
calls and beats me,

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.890
I'm still the chip leader,
even if that happens.

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:03.880
So the ICM doesn't hurt
me that much because--

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:07.860
yeah, and also just the
fact that I'm risking less.

01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:10.500
The other important thing of
the big blind getting short

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:14.160
is now the small blind is much
less incentivized to gamble

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.240
than before.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.840
Before, when the
big blind had 180K,

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.120
he was incentivizing
gambling against me

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.530
because it's not that easy to
wait for the big blind to bust.

01:01:25.530 --> 01:01:27.870
But now that the big
blind only has 10K,

01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:30.630
it's easier to just wait
and hope that he busts.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:34.710
So basically ICM becomes a lot
more favorable in both cases.

01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:39.060
And shoving, I think, is very
good now with the stack sizes.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:42.600
So we do shove, and
we take it down.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.690
9-2 off, so no one
usually wants our blinds,

01:01:45.690 --> 01:01:48.410
but then they both
want our blinds.

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:49.760
LPMBox takes it down.

01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:56.240
So ace-2, I just go all in here.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:00.120
Basically same justification
as the pocket 3s.

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.210
8-7 off, I think I probably
should have raised this.

01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:08.480
Even going all in honestly
might not be that bad.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:09.980
I'd have to do an
exact calculation,

01:02:09.980 --> 01:02:12.140
but I think probably--

01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.130
it's a pretty bad hand.

01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:16.010
But I think probably I
shouldn't be folding given

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:18.440
that I'm the big stack and
given that they've both

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.240
been giving me lots of respect.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.950
But I fold, which
can be a big mistake.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:26.500
But I think probably I
shouldn't have folded.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:29.370
The next hand, LPMBox
goes all in, and we fold.

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.150
Next hand, we 8-7
suited, so by now,

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:40.080
this guy, BeMySponsor,
so we've just won enough

01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:42.610
pots where this guy
is also short now.

01:02:42.610 --> 01:02:45.590
So it's a pretty good situation
for us from an ICM perspective.

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.910
They're both short enough where
we can just go all in preflop

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:53.110
very often and they have
to fold quite often.

01:02:53.110 --> 01:02:55.780
10-7 off is a bit too weak,
but I decide to raise.

01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:58.030
But yeah, this is a bit
inconsistent play from my part

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:00.480
because I think
for most purposes,

01:03:00.480 --> 01:03:03.470
8-7 off is a better
hand than 10-7 off.

01:03:03.470 --> 01:03:09.070
But for some reason I raise
10-7 off and fold 8-7 off.

01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:10.960
He's 5-suited.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:13.150
We get a walk again.

01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:16.780
Queen-5 off, yeah, so
I just go all in here.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:19.930
So this is definitely not
a plus chip EV all-in,

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.450
but once again I
think ICM by now

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:26.500
is relevant enough where
it's fine because he just

01:03:26.500 --> 01:03:31.070
has to fold, weakening it down.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:33.610
10-6 off, I decide to fold.

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:35.950
Big blind gets a walk.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.380
Get a walk with
6-deuce pretty good.

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.070
Ace-2 off, once
again, we go all in.

01:03:41.070 --> 01:03:42.560
They fold.

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.300
Pocket kings, so I basically--

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:44.929
AUDIENCE: Wow.

01:03:44.929 --> 01:03:46.970
WILL MA: Yeah, so this is
a bit suspicious again.

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:48.850
Normally I've been going all in.

01:03:48.850 --> 01:03:49.530
He raises small.

01:03:49.530 --> 01:03:52.670
Obviously yes, pocket kings.

01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:54.740
So yeah, that's basically true.

01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.630
But I mean also I
think I will do this

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:58.880
with some of the
weakest hands that I'm

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.800
not willing to
gamble all in with

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.600
but still want to raise maybe
something like 9-7 offsuit

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.220
maybe.

01:04:07.220 --> 01:04:12.170
But we don't play it,
so we take it down.

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.040
So he goes all in.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.110
We fold jack-2 offsuit.

01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:18.627
Queen-3 suited, go all in.

01:04:18.627 --> 01:04:20.460
So I'm going to go
through this fairly fast.

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.310
There's a lot of same stuff.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:26.895
6-5 off, we fold because
yeah, by now they're

01:04:26.895 --> 01:04:29.020
short enough where they
might actually just call us

01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.310
pretty often.

01:04:30.310 --> 01:04:32.830
So I fold 6-5 off.

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:36.430
So here, pocket 3s holds
against queen-jack.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:39.250
So this is an extreme ICM spot.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.010
So he calls here, and
he does double up.

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:46.120
So the next hand, we do
have an extreme ICM spot

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:48.970
because this guy only
has one big blind.

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:50.770
So essentially their
correct strategy

01:04:50.770 --> 01:04:53.290
is going to be I'm supposed
to shove any two cards.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:56.590
And he's only supposed
to call, I would guess,

01:04:56.590 --> 01:05:02.080
maybe the top 7% or 8%
of hands in a situation.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.410
He normally should be
calling top 30 or something.

01:05:05.410 --> 01:05:07.380
So I just go all in.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:11.660
Even if he has ace-2 offsuit,
I'm certain he has to fold.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:15.520
Even if he has, say, king-queen,
and I turn up my hand

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.335
and show him jack-8,
he probably still

01:05:17.335 --> 01:05:23.275
has to fold just because
he really can't bust.

01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:25.570
I haven't done the
exact math, but I

01:05:25.570 --> 01:05:27.520
wouldn't be that
surprised if he told me

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.140
pocket 9s is a fold for him.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:32.100
I wouldn't be that
surprised, so yeah.

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:39.160
So once again, I go all in
because this guy probably

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:39.850
can't call.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.440
Oh, OK, so yeah.

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.927
We win against
ace-queen, which is crazy

01:05:48.927 --> 01:05:51.260
that they picked up ace-queen
with one big blind, right?

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:51.760
Anyway.

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:52.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:57.720
Some players like to do this
thing called cooperative play

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:01.350
to get that big blind to bust.

01:06:01.350 --> 01:06:04.470
In the history of
poker, it's what

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:09.620
was almost customary for the
players who have chips in here

01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.660
to basically just all agree
to just call and not raise

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:16.140
each other and to maximize
their chances of busting

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:17.117
the big blind.

01:06:17.117 --> 01:06:18.700
It's a form of
cheating in some sense.

01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.320
It's collusion in some sense.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.930
But it's customary maybe
five-six years ago for everyone

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:28.140
to do this because it
benefits everyone else.

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:33.150
It benefits all of these guys
if they all agree to do this.

01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:35.760
And it just
maximizes the chances

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.650
that the big blind
is eliminated.

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:43.950
But the issue with
this is unfortunately

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:46.170
there is an option
to be selfish.

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:50.640
Unfortunately, if we both
trusted each other completely,

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.760
we could collude and be like,
OK, we're just going to call,

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:56.250
check down every flop
turn and river no matter

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.160
what to match so that we can
both see the river with any two

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.010
cards and maximize the
chances of busting this guy.

01:07:02.010 --> 01:07:09.180
The issue with this is when you
play a game, you're selfish.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.950
If there is an
opportunity to bet

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:14.469
because you have a good hand,
you're going to want to bet.

01:07:14.469 --> 01:07:16.260
If there's a draw and
you have a good hand,

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.210
you want to bet to get
the other guy to fold.

01:07:18.210 --> 01:07:21.420
And basically from a game
theoretic perspective,

01:07:21.420 --> 01:07:23.250
since we have these
options, there's

01:07:23.250 --> 01:07:25.650
no way for us to
essentially agree

01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:28.320
that we're going to just check
down and see the river, which

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:32.630
is why I consider collusion
of players actually do this.

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:35.760
So nonetheless, I do
the most selfish line,

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.680
which is just go all in.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.050
But yeah, if this guy
was my best friend

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:43.350
and I wanted to cheat, then
I could just call and let

01:07:43.350 --> 01:07:45.300
him call and then
just check it down

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:46.680
even if I flopped the nut flush.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:54.630
OK, so now it's heads up.

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:57.780
OK, I'll try to show every hand.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:07:59.105
OK, so now ICM doesn't matter.

01:07:59.105 --> 01:08:01.230
But it would be good to
show a little heads up play

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.780
because I don't think
we've done too much

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.910
heads up play in this class.

01:08:05.910 --> 01:08:07.230
So we call here.

01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:09.990
And we check.

01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:11.520
He makes it 32.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:16.359
And I just have to
check-raise bluff this flop.

01:08:16.359 --> 01:08:17.460
I think it's close.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:20.370
I think I probably
shouldn't be folding.

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:23.370
I think jack-6 suited
just has too many backdoor

01:08:23.370 --> 01:08:28.529
draws on this flop to ever fold
just as part of my strategy.

01:08:28.529 --> 01:08:31.720
I think I decided that I
wanted my strategy to be I'm

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.490
going to raise good
hands, like 8s and 4s.

01:08:35.490 --> 01:08:38.520
And then I'm going to also raise
hands with lots of backdoor

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.290
draws like jack-6 of hearts.

01:08:40.290 --> 01:08:43.950
So I decide to do this.

01:08:43.950 --> 01:08:47.890
So unfortunately he
goes all in, so we fold.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:48.890
It doesn't quite work.

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.054
So queen-10 off, we raise.

01:08:55.054 --> 01:08:56.470
Oh, so one thing
I should say is--

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:59.140
I think most of you know
this-- but once a tournament

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.319
gets heads up and it's just a
small blind and the big blind,

01:09:02.319 --> 01:09:04.514
the small blind is
actually has position.

01:09:04.514 --> 01:09:06.680
So normally when it's small
blind against big blind,

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.790
the bid blind has
position postflop.

01:09:08.790 --> 01:09:10.810
But when it's heads
up as a small blind,

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.160
you actually have position.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.483
So you're very strongly
incentivized to play

01:09:14.483 --> 01:09:15.399
from this small blind.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.380
It's just by far
the better position

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.150
because you have
position, and you

01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:22.810
have to put in less of a blind.

01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:25.029
So another cheat that--
so I'm teaching you guys

01:09:25.029 --> 01:09:26.356
all these different cheats.

01:09:26.356 --> 01:09:27.939
Another cheat that
people used to do--

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:28.990
it's not really a cheat.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:33.460
But another angle shoot people
used to do back in the day is

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:36.970
there would be people who
normally play pretty low

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:41.109
stakes, let's say, $0.25, $0.50.

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:44.260
They would set up
these $25, $50 tables.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:47.020
So where the blinds
are $25, $50, which

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.500
is really high stakes for them.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.200
They really don't have the
bankroll to gamble that.

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.180
But their strategy
basically is if you're

01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.910
the first to sit
down, you get to be

01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:59.590
the dealer on the first hand.

01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:02.440
So their strategy
is basically just

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.019
sit there and then wait for
someone else to sit down.

01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:07.060
And then play the first
hand as the dealer, where

01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:08.810
they have a huge advantage.

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.185
They can just raise, and
usually the other guy will fold,

01:10:11.185 --> 01:10:14.320
and they'll win 50 bucks,
which is a huge deal to them.

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.900
And then they'll just
leave after the first hand.

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:19.840
So this is something that
happened quite a lot.

01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:21.520
So my friends and
I, we've talked

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.740
about playing a
crazy strategy, where

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:26.400
you would sit down knowing this
is what the other guy's going

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.130
to do.

01:10:27.130 --> 01:10:28.960
And then sit down with him.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:31.240
We would have the
capital to take on risk.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:33.550
And then we would basically
just play the first hand

01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:35.340
extremely aggressively.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.900
And knowing that the guy has
been fold most of the time,

01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:41.570
because if he calls, that's
all his money on the site.

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:45.154
So yeah, it led to a
lot of weird dynamics.

01:10:45.154 --> 01:10:47.840
But OK, so here we have--

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:50.410
This is why I chose
tournaments, not cash games.

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:52.720
There's fewer ways to do
these when you use cheats.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:54.535
So queen-10, we raise.

01:10:54.535 --> 01:10:57.228
We take it down.

01:10:57.228 --> 01:10:59.110
Next hand we get
ace-queen suited.

01:10:59.110 --> 01:11:00.590
So unfortunately we get a walk.

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:05.260
So queen-8, we raise.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:08.080
We take it down--
sorry, he calls.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.340
And then it's checked to us.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.380
We continuation bet.

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:14.890
And he raises, which
is weird because it's

01:11:14.890 --> 01:11:17.521
a flop that's a lot better
for my range than his

01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:19.270
because I can have
ace-king and ace-queen.

01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:21.228
And even ace-jack, I
think, if he had ace-jack,

01:11:21.228 --> 01:11:23.260
he would have reraised preflop.

01:11:23.260 --> 01:11:27.389
So in some sense it's
weird because it's

01:11:27.389 --> 01:11:28.930
really hard for him
to have, I think,

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:30.640
pocket aces or pocket 8s.

01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:32.910
Or even pocket 3s,
he probably would

01:11:32.910 --> 01:11:34.330
have reraised all on preflop.

01:11:34.330 --> 01:11:36.662
So really it's like,
what do you have?

01:11:36.662 --> 01:11:37.870
It's like, I don't have much.

01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:40.540
But really it's like,
what do you have?

01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:45.970
So it's weird because I expect
him to check-raise this flop so

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:49.740
rarely that what he does, on
the one hand, it's just strange.

01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.570
But on the other hand,
he must know that.

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:54.160
I'm assuming it's
somewhat balanced,

01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:57.670
and he will occasionally turn
up ace-3 or something here.

01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.760
So I decide to call
and see one more card.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.890
I don't know if that's great.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:05.350
Maybe I should have just
folded and just believed him

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:08.770
or just reraised if
I didn't believe him.

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.210
Reraise essentially is a bluff.

01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:13.540
Make it 100,000, and
just hope he folds.

01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:14.800
But I decide to call.

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:17.380
The turn is a 9 putting
out some straight draws

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:19.330
but no flush draws.

01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:22.420
That's fairly big, and I fold.

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:25.090
I don't really know how I feel
about how I played that hand.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:27.400
I think I mostly
played exploitatively.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.120
I just called the flop because
I wanted to see what he did,

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.400
and I folded the
turn because maybe

01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.020
based on his bet sizing
or his bet timing,

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.150
I just felt like he had it.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:39.029
So I'm not sure I'm
extremely happy with how

01:12:39.029 --> 01:12:39.820
I played that hand.

01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.950
But probably just at
the time, I decided

01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:45.310
to play exploitatively and
try to play best against how

01:12:45.310 --> 01:12:47.680
I expect him to act.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:54.160
So here 10-7 off, I
decide to reraise.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:57.720
So the reason I reraise a
hand as bad as 10-7 offsuit--

01:12:57.720 --> 01:13:01.360
I talked a bit about this two
classes ago about your preflop

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:02.560
raising strategy.

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.360
So essentially
what I'm doing is I

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.820
want to be reraising
my good hands

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:10.690
and also my hands that I'm
not sad if he goes all in,

01:13:10.690 --> 01:13:13.060
and I have to fold, and I
don't get to see a flop with.

01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:17.420
So if I had 10-7 suited,
that's too good of a hand.

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.300
And I really don't
want to reraise.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:22.480
And then if he goes all in,
fold my pretty 10-7 suited

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.550
and not even get to
see a flop with it.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:26.950
But 10-7 offsuit is
a bad enough hand

01:13:26.950 --> 01:13:29.290
where I'm not that sad
if he just goes all in,

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.370
and I have to fold.

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:33.130
So that's why I'm
raising my good hands

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:37.050
and also my weakest
possible hands

01:13:37.050 --> 01:13:40.930
that I'm OK if I don't
get to see a flop with.

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:43.660
He does call unfortunately,
but we do hit a great flop.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:46.360
So I'm just going to
bet and get it all in.

01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:49.540
Heads up basically any
top pair is, in general,

01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:53.540
just way more good enough to
put all your money in with.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.610
He folds, though.

01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:55.740
So ace-6, we raise.

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.490
I'm going to go fairly
quickly because I'm

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:58.885
running a bit short of time.

01:13:58.885 --> 01:14:03.760
We continuation bet the
flop and take it down.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.420
He raises here.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.650
I call with king-6, which
is pretty borderline.

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:11.590
It's too good a hand to
fold, but probably it's

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:12.700
too bad a hand to call.

01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:14.740
Probably I should
have just raised

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.550
by the same logic as before.

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:17.530
But we call.

01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:19.510
And I decide to donk
out on this flop

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:24.690
because I figured there's a
number of draws I can have.

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.710
And here I do have a weak draw.

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:30.800
A 7 gives me a bad
streak but still

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.920
a very good hand in
the two-player pot.

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.480
He calls.

01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.560
And the turn is a
jack, which I still

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.260
have a straight draw because
now a queen gives me a straight.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:41.020
So I continue bluffing.

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.010
So he folds, which is good.

01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:47.240
6-2 offsuit I just
give one to them.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.300
So yeah, I think you
should be playing

01:14:49.300 --> 01:14:51.280
90-95% percent of buttons.

01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.680
Maybe not that high when
it's getting shallower,

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:55.590
but at least 80% of buttons.

01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:59.470
But 2-3 offsuit is one of the
hands I'm OK with folding.

01:14:59.470 --> 01:15:02.320
8-5 suited, I'm just
check-raising this flopping,

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:03.970
getting it in.

01:15:03.970 --> 01:15:04.730
He folds-- yeah?

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:06.610
AUDIENCE: Let's say
you had an opponent

01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:10.650
that from the big blind was
very likely to three-bet you.

01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:12.850
How would you adjust
your range opening

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:14.440
from the button or
the small blind?

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:17.660
WILL MA: Oh, OK.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:19.690
So if they're really
loose, you would basically

01:15:19.690 --> 01:15:22.210
raise only your good
hands that you're hoping

01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.481
they reraise all in with.

01:15:23.481 --> 01:15:23.980
And--

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.020
AUDIENCE: So would that be
from maybe 60% of your hands

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:27.870
down from 80?

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:29.910
WILL MA: Oh, yeah.

01:15:29.910 --> 01:15:31.330
You would basically raise less.

01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.074
So it'd just have more
value essentially.

01:15:33.074 --> 01:15:35.240
AUDIENCE: It's hard to
calibrate that range, though,

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.640
as what's a good hand.

01:15:36.640 --> 01:15:39.280
WILL MA: Yeah, and also another
thing you can do is call more.

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.620
I don't think it gets relevant
in this heads up match.

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.382
But sometimes it
gets shallow enough

01:15:43.382 --> 01:15:45.340
where you actually want
to have a calling range

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.740
preflop from the button.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.210
OK, so king-10.

01:15:52.210 --> 01:15:53.810
OK, so I do call here.

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:55.960
I think I essentially
call, thinking

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:58.340
I would call if he went
all in but also just

01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:01.930
to make it so that I
can also sometimes call

01:16:01.930 --> 01:16:04.070
a hand like 10-4 offsuit.

01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:07.190
And he can't just shove any
2 and expect me to fold.

01:16:07.190 --> 01:16:08.840
So I decide to call here.

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:13.910
We get a great flop, so I
check it back as a slow play.

01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:15.470
He checks again on the turn.

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:16.970
So I bet.

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:18.470
He calls.

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.750
The river he leads
out quite big.

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:24.890
And I just call because I
think raising I'll usually only

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:26.840
get called by better.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:28.850
And he actually turns
up a flush here.

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.530
So it's a weird hand.

01:16:30.530 --> 01:16:32.450
It seems like we could
have lost a lot more.

01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:34.850
But I'm not saying our
opponent played the hand badly,

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:38.280
but we were very lucky to
lose this little when we have

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.640
a two pair against a flush.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.290
And we only lost, essentially,
four big blinds or something.

01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:48.100
I guess I'll be happy
to get away with that.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.561
OK, I'll probably run two
or three minutes over time.

01:16:51.561 --> 01:16:52.310
I'll try to hurry.

01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:55.310
But I don't want to not
finish the tournament today.

01:16:55.310 --> 01:16:56.780
So we fooled this.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.545
Maybe I'll skip forward a bit
to some of the bigger pots.

01:17:03.164 --> 01:17:04.080
So what happened here?

01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.030
So we raise jack-6.

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:06.136
He goes all in.

01:17:06.136 --> 01:17:06.635
We fold.

01:17:12.638 --> 01:17:13.990
All right, let's go do this one.

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:16.759
OK, so king-- so OK, so the
match has gone on for a bit.

01:17:16.759 --> 01:17:17.800
He's won a bunch of pots.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:18.880
He catching up.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.290
He's catching up.

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:21.520
King-3 off, we raise.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.570
He calls.

01:17:22.570 --> 01:17:25.060
So here the flop I
think is-- so once again

01:17:25.060 --> 01:17:29.260
it's a situation where I don't
think he ever has an ace.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:32.440
So I'm basically
betting at 100%.

01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.160
He calls.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:36.280
The turn's another ace,
which is a bad card for us

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.080
because now it's less
likely we have an ace.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.060
But normally, I still
think it's a fine spot

01:17:42.060 --> 01:17:45.910
to bluff just because he
essentially can't have an ace

01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:46.870
and we can.

01:17:46.870 --> 01:17:49.640
But I think king-high is
good enough here where

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:52.780
I am going to win the pot by
checking it down with king-high

01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:56.090
often enough that
bluffing is superfluous.

01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:57.474
So I just check.

01:17:57.474 --> 01:17:58.390
And it's checked down.

01:17:58.390 --> 01:18:00.610
And he was actually
trapping with king-9 here.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.290
So he wins that one.

01:18:03.290 --> 01:18:05.380
Yeah, and probably he
wouldn't have folded.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:08.950
Let's say, I bet the turn
and went all in on the river.

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.530
Probably he has to call just
because it's almost the best

01:18:11.530 --> 01:18:13.570
hand he can possibly have.

01:18:13.570 --> 01:18:15.580
It pretty much is the
best hand you can possibly

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.560
have other than maybe 7-6.

01:18:22.111 --> 01:18:23.450
I think nothing happens there.

01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:26.310
So let me see.

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:28.790
OK, so yeah, we lose a bunch
of pots because we raise

01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:31.640
and he reraises and we fold.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:34.330
So things aren't
looking too good.

01:18:34.330 --> 01:18:37.340
Oh, so I actually
made a hero fold here.

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:39.650
I think, once again, this
is an exploitative play.

01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:42.847
I would probably never fold
this from an optimal strategy

01:18:42.847 --> 01:18:43.430
point of view.

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:46.160
I think an ace in heads
up with only 20 big blinds

01:18:46.160 --> 01:18:47.120
is way too good.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:50.570
But he did just reraise
me two hands ago.

01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:51.280
And I don't know.

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:54.050
I think at the time I just felt
like he almost certainly had it

01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:56.600
when he did this.

01:18:56.600 --> 01:19:01.640
I made an exploitative fold
based on what I thought he had.

01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.320
So the next hand, he raises.

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:04.670
We go all in with pocket 5s.

01:19:04.670 --> 01:19:06.490
And we've never
[INAUDIBLE] the ace-jack

01:19:06.490 --> 01:19:07.894
which is pretty stupid.

01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:12.360
Yeah, I was very surprised.

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.260
I was basically
ready to just leave.

01:19:15.260 --> 01:19:17.037
I was probably in some
other tournaments.

01:19:17.037 --> 01:19:18.870
But I basically was
ready to close the table

01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:20.328
and focus on the
other tournaments.

01:19:20.328 --> 01:19:23.510
But somehow we get there.

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:25.620
And then the tournament
just is easy from there.

01:19:25.620 --> 01:19:26.161
We get ace-9.

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:26.900
We go all in.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:27.870
He folds.

01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:30.170
And then he goes all
in into our pocket 6s.

01:19:30.170 --> 01:19:32.240
And we hit a
straight, so we win.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.367
Right,

01:19:36.367 --> 01:19:38.450
So I played through all
the hands at a tournament.

01:19:38.450 --> 01:19:40.650
Once again, there's a lot
of selection bias there.

01:19:40.650 --> 01:19:43.210
But hopefully you learned
some stuff from that.

01:19:43.210 --> 01:19:44.920
So there's two classes left.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:50.381
Next class, I'll wrap up the
theory and the exact poker

01:19:50.381 --> 01:19:50.880
example.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.924
So I'll talk a bit
more about cash games

01:19:52.924 --> 01:19:54.965
and show you how to play
when you're really deep.

01:19:54.965 --> 01:19:56.900
I talked about postflop raising.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:19:58.640
And then Friday we
have a guest lecture

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.610
from Bill Chen, which
should be really exciting.

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:03.690
He always talks about
very interesting stuff.

01:20:03.690 --> 01:20:06.640
So I'll see you guys around.

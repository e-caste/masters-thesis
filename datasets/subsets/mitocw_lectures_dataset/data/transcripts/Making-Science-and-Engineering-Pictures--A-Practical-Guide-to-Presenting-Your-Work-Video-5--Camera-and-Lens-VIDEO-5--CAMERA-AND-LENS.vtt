WEBVTT

00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.960
For this second
week, week 2, we'll

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.800
be taking you from the pretty
straight-forward process

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.690
of creating images on a flatbed
scanner to what you probably

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.210
expected in the first place
when you enrolled in our class

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.190
using a camera and lens to
capture images of your work

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.080
in the lab.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.850
We'll first take a look at what
kind of equipment you'll need.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.970
We'll look at specific
lighting next week.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.320
And we'll go over the very
basics of making an image.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.940
Because this course is about
photographing certain material

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.770
with a certain
scale, we're going

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.380
to be very specific
in our suggestions

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.670
for a camera and lens
and for other equipment.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.730
These photographs
will be staged.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.800
You have control.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670
You're not going to
wonder what the image will

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.600
look like after it's done.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.330
You will see your
process and your thinking

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.800
as you create the set-up
and light it and compose it.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.440
We're also going to
review the important issue

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.620
of getting the right exposure
for our specific requirements.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.080
Now we're assuming you already
have some basic knowledge

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.330
of picture making.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.690
And, we'll just be
modifying what you hopefully

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.789
already know.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.610
If you're really brand
new to all of this,

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.705
you'll find some useful
websites on our resource page.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.530
SO FIRST YOUR CAMERA: You
don't a camera with all sorts

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.600
of bells and whistles.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.990
You just need one which
will take various lenses

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.470
and that will allow you to
change your ISO, aperture,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.120
and shutter settings.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.500
And most important,
one that will

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.530
create a large enough image
measured in file size that

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.940
could be submitted, let's
say, for a publication,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.229
or even a cover submission.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.940
You will generally need, for
example, about a 27 meg file.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.880
So something like 300 dpi for an
eight and half by eleven cover.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.924
So you need a camera that
will give you that size image.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.440
NOW FOR YOUR LENS: You'll
need a 105 macro lens.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680
This particular
lens will allow you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.310
to get close to your
material or device,

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.630
basically using macro
photographic techniques.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.370
Don't use enlarging
filters on a normal lens:

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.280
The quality of the
optics just doesn't

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.690
compare to the optics of
a very fine macro lens.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.730
You'll also need a tripod and I
suggest getting a quick release

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.570
mechanism so that you
can take your camera on

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.000
and off the tripod easily.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.120
I'm not going to suggest
a copy stand, which

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.840
I see around many labs.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.370
Using a copy stand where
the camera is placed only

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.220
in one position really
limits your point of view

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.829
and we don't want to do that.

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.680
You'll see in our
discussion of point of view

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.960
about having the ability
to move the camera around

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.240
on a tripod, which not
only slows you down, which

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.880
is a good thing, but it
teaches you to learn to see

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.610
and encourages you to look
carefully at your material.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.900
Finally, I'm also suggesting
that you use your computer

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.350
to decide on the various
settings for exposure.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.680
You'll use a software to
make the right settings

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.980
and you'll store the images
right onto your computer, not

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.910
a card in your camera.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.510
Make sure you get the right
software for your camera.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.103
But, for those of you who
decide not to use software,

00:03:39.103 --> 00:03:41.520
you'll just have to learn how
to set all of those settings

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.370
within your camera.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.780
Okay, the best way to go
about learning all of this

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.200
is to make a picture.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.040
So, we'll work with a
device you've seen before:

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.829
The inside of a music box.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.150
PROFESSOR: Welcome back to
8.20, special relativity.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.010
In this section, and
also the next time,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.440
we talk about electromagnetism.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.400
Electromagnetism is not
part of the core of 8.20.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.450
We are not requiring
electromagnetism

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.400
as part of the prerequisite.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.210
I will not test or include
electromagnetism in the final.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.580
But nevertheless, it's
interesting to discuss

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.660
electromagnetic effects in the
context of special relativity,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.540
as they led to the development
of special relativity

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.750
in the first.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.350
After all, the paper
which describes

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.820
the theory of special relativity
is about the electrodynamics

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.930
of moving bodies.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.350
And so let's have a look at
the natural dynamics of moving

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.190
bodies.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.050
And so here, we have a source--

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.070
a charge which is moving
with a velocity V.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.610
And moving charges, or currents,
create magnetic fields.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.910
You can use your right-hand
and see particles are

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.470
moving in this direction here.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.980
The electric field lines
are curling around you.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.790
Good.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.130
So now I have a second
charge-- a test charge which

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.440
is moving with the velocity u.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.320
That test charge will
experience the magnetic force.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.050
The force is equal to
the test charge itself,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.650
qt, times u cross
B, the velocity

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.310
cross the magnetic field.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.080
So there's clearly
a magnetic force

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.160
acting on this [INAUDIBLE]
charge in this reference frame.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.730
However, if I now move
into a reference frame

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.130
where the source
charge is stationary,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.020
a stationary charge is not
creating magnetic field,

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.240
so the magnetic field is 0.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.400
Hence the magnetic force
on the test charge is 0.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.880
I can, alternatively, look at
the reference frame in which

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.100
the test charge is stationary.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.040
And so also here,
because u is equal to 0,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.450
the magnetic force is 0.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.150
So clearly, we do have to treat
magnetic and electric fields

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.370
in sort of a
consistent manner as we

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.340
treated time and space,
and energy momentum

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.930
in a consistent manner.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.660
But we need a concept of
electromagnetic fields.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.540
And previously in this class, we
looked at electromagnetic field

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.622
light before.

00:02:25.622 --> 00:02:28.080
The difference here is-- and
that's the context of the next

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.830
section--

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.430
is that you want to understand
how we create those fields--

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.980
how we can create electric
and magnetic fields, and how

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.140
that all works together.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.240
Now the first
activity, I want you

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.500
to consider a cube of
length L with n electrons.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.015
There's n charges inside,
and everything is at rest.

00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:48.390
And what I want
you to figure out

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.080
is what is the charge and
current density [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.203
and j0 of this cube?

00:02:56.203 --> 00:02:57.120
There's a second step.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.330
As you can imagine, I ask you
to consider the very same thing

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.750
from a moving reference frame,
S prime, with some velocity

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.690
u which is the velocity of
S prime with respect to S.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.540
What is the charge in
the current density now

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.150
in this new reference frame?

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.570
I'd like you to figure this out.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.800
So now we look at this cube,
and the total number of charges

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.390
is N. The length--

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.240
or the volume is l0 cubed.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.380
And so the density is
N divided by l0 cubed.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.670
The current 0.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.630
Nothing is moving.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.930
There's no moving
charges [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.920
All right, this one is
more straightforward.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.450
But now in our moving reference
frame, the situation changes.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.110
Here, one of the directions--
the direction in which we are

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.860
moving--

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.550
is Lorentz contracted.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.300
So we have lx equal
to lx 0 or l0, times--

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.060
divided by gamma, or times
square root 1 minus u

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.250
squared over c squared.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:06.490
The volume then of the same cube
in the S prime reference frame

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.500
is l0 cubed divided by gamma.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.070
The number of
electrons, however,

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.380
is unchanged, so the charge
density is the previous charge

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.550
density divided by the volume.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.239
And if you compare--

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.420
sorry, it's the charge divided
by the new volume which

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.550
is the density times gamma.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.090
For the new charge
density, we simply

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.070
have to multiply
the current density.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.220
For the current density, we
have to multiply the charge

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.210
density times the velocity.

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.990
And again, we find ro
0 times 0, times gamma.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.400
Good.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.110
So if you look at
those relations,

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.390
they look very much
like the relationship

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.210
between the current
and the charge density.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.950
They look very much
like the relations

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.800
we had between momentum and
energy, and time and space.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.870
And Lorentz transformation
looks very similar.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.670
So we can, motivated
by this, write

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:14.110
a 4 vector, which is the first
component c times the density.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.200
And as the first, second, and
third component, the current.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.450
And you find that
the invariant here

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.160
is very similar to time and
space, energy and momentum

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.015
given as the density where
the charges are addressed.

00:05:31.015 --> 00:05:34.160
And that's the invariant,
and you can calculate this

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.140
from multiplying the 4 vector
[INAUDIBLE] square [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.520
So concept questions.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.330
Is the electric charge conserved
in the Lorentz transformation,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.190
or did we actually
change the charge?

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.430
So we have the charge density
here and the current here,

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.320
but did we actually
change the charge

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.420
on the Lorentz [INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.170
The answer is, no, we
did not change them,

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:01.780
so the charge is conserved.

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:06.540
The charge is invariant in
the Lorentz transformation.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.790
Is electric current conserved
in Lorentz transformation,

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.830
or invariant on the
Lorentz transformation?

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.290
Should rather use
invariant [INAUDIBLE]..

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.680
And the answer is, no, it's not.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.560
So we have seen from
the very first example

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.840
that you start with
the current which is 0,

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.820
and then in the S prime
frame, the current

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.150
is of a certain value.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.300
So certainly, the
current was seen

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.260
from two different
observers is changed.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.630
PROFESSOR: Next is this
phenomenon that when

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.760
you have a wave
packet and it moves

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.390
it can change shape
and get distorted.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.700
And that is a very
nice phenomenon

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.680
that takes place in
general and causes

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.410
technological complications.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.440
And it's conceptually
interesting.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.729
So let's discuss it.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.340
So it's still wave packets.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:44.680
But now we have to go back
and add some time to it.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.380
So shape changes.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.490
So we had a psi of x
and t is equal to 1

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:06.480
over square root of 2
pi phi of k e to the ikx

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.230
e to the minus i omega of kt.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.340
And what did we do with this
to analyze how it propagates?

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:23.960
We expanded omega
of k as omega of k0,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.750
which, again, this quantity is
centered and peaks around k0,

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:39.800
plus k minus k0 times
d omega dk at k0

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:51.740
plus 1/2 k minus k0 squared, the
second omega, dk squared at k0.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.610
And it might seem that
this goes on forever.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.850
And what did we do before?

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
We looked at this thing and we
did the integral with this term

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.090
and ignored the next.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.009
And with this
term, we discovered

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.780
that the profile moves with this
velocity, the group velocity.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.970
Now we want to go
back and at least get

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.210
an idea of how this term
could change the result.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.020
And it would change
the result by deforming

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.360
the shape of the packet.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.400
So it is of interest to know,
for example, how long you have

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.970
to wait before your packet
gets totally deformed,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.370
or how do you evolve a packet.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.120
So we need to recall
these derivatives.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:03:00.880
So the omega vk is the same as
de dp by multiplying by h bar.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.100
And this you'll
remember, was p over m.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.030
The edp is p over m and is
equal to h bar k over m.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:25.330
So the second omega, dk squared.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.590
I must differentiate the first
derivative with respect to k.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.440
So I differentiate the first
derivative with respect k.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.420
And now I get just h bar
over m, which is quite nice.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.950
And the third derivative,
the 3 omega, dk cubed, is 0.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.000
And therefore, I didn't have
to worry about these terms.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.820
The series terminates.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:55.390
The Taylor series
terminates for this stuff.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.305
Yes?

00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:57.679
AUDIENCE: The
reason this happens

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:59.040
is because we're [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.040
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.670
So of what is it that we get?

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:20.140
Well, this term is roughly
then 1/2 k minus k0 squared

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.210
times h bar over m.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:37.500
And we can go back
to the integral

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.870
that we're trying to do.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.790
We don't do it again
or not by any means.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.310
But just observe
what's going on there.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.460
And we have an e to
the minus i omega of kt

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.910
that we did take into account.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.310
But the term that
we're dropping now

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.740
is a term that is
minus i omega of k,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.380
well, whatever we have
here, 1/2 k minus k0

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.280
squared h bar over mt.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.050
That's the phase that
we ignored before.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:41.140
But now we'll just say,
that we expect, therefore,

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.770
that the shape doesn't
change as long as we

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.530
can ignore this phase.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.015
And this phase would start
changing shape of the object.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:06.370
So our statement is going to
be that we have no shapes.

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.000
So let's imagine you
started with a packet

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.610
that sometime t equals 0.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:14.710
And then you let time go by.

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.370
Well, there's some numbers
here and time is increasing.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.740
At some point, this phase is
going to become unignorable.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.420
And it's going to start
affecting everything.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:34.550
But we have no shape change,
or no appreciable shape change,

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.650
as long as this quantity
is much less than 1.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:48.500
So as long as say,
k minus k0 squared

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:56.570
h bar over m absolute value
of t is much less than 1,

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:57.690
no shape change.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.110
Now it's convenient to
write it in terms of things

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.520
that are more familiar.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:17.990
So we should
estimate this thing.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:25.850
Now we're doing estimates in a
very direct and rough way here.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.220
But look, your
integrals are around k0.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:35.450
And as you remember, they
just extend a little bit

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.190
because it has some width.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:43.770
So k minus k0, as you
do the integral over k,

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.760
you're basically
saying this thing

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:50.660
is about the size of
the uncertainty in k.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.825
So I'll put here
delta k squared.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:05.880
Then you'll have h bar t
over m much less than 1.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.790
Now h bar times
delta k is delta p.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:20.570
So this equation is also of
the form delta p squared t

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:28.020
over h bar m much less than 1.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.720
There's several forms of
this equation that is nice.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.210
So this is a
particularly nice form.

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:43.929
So if you know the uncertainty
and momentum of your packet,

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:49.360
or wave packet, up to
what time, you can wait

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.390
and there's no big deformation
of this wave packet.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.940
Another thing you can do is
involve the uncertainty in x.

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:06.640
Because, well, delta p
delta x is equal to h bar.

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.220
So we can do that.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:33.270
And so with delta p times
delta x equal to about h bar,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:45.420
you can write t less
than h bar over m

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.280
over a delta p
squared, which would

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:53.200
be h squared delta x squared.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.830
I think I'm getting it right.

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:07.440
Yep, so t much less than m
over h bar delta x squared.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.430
That's another way you
could write this inequality.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.460
There is one way to
write the inequality

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:20.940
that you can
intuitively feel you

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.700
understand what's happening.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:31.460
And take this form a from a.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:49.320
Write it as delta p t over m is
less than h bar over delta p.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.960
And h bar over
delta p is delta x.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:17.810
So you go delta p over mt
much less than delta x.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.570
I think this is understandable.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:35.920
Why does the packet
change shape?

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.690
The reason it changes shape
is because the group velocity

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.960
is not the same for
all the frequencies.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.550
The packet mostly moves with k0.

00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.690
And we haven't rated the
group velocity in k0.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.820
But if it would have
a definite velocity,

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.130
we would have a
definite momentum.

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.930
But that's not possible.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.260
These things have
uncertainty in momentum.

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:10.180
And they have uncertainty in
k that we use it to write it.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:15.900
So different parts
of the wave can

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.890
move with different velocities,
different group velocities.

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:24.470
The group velocity
you evaluated at k0.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:28.440
But some part of the
packet is propagating

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.380
with group velocities that are
near k0 but not exactly there.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.190
So you have a dispersion
in the velocity, which

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.670
is an uncertainty
in the velocity

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.750
or an uncertainty
in the momentum.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.680
Think, the momentum divided
by mass is velocity.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.510
So here it is, an
uncertainty in the velocity.

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:55.095
And if you multiply
the uncertainty

00:12:55.095 --> 00:12:59.720
in the velocity times this
time that you can wait,

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:04.280
then the change in
shape is not much

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.060
if this product, which
is the difference of how

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.080
one part moves with respect
to the other, the difference

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.540
of relative term,
is still smaller

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.690
than the uncertainty
that controls

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.980
the shape of the packet.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.070
So the packet has a delta x.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:31.840
And as long as this part, the
left part of the packet, then

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.880
the top of the packet, the
difference of velocities

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:42.070
times the time, it just still
compared to delta x is small,

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.770
then the thing
doesn't change much.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:51.490
So I think this is
one neat way of seeing

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.460
what an equation
that you sometimes

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:58.140
use in this form, sometimes
use in in this form--

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:03.700
it's just things that you
can use in different ways.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:11.100
So for example, I can do
this a little exercise.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:20.700
If you have delta x equals 10
to the minus 10 meters, that's

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.440
atomic size for an electron.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:38.940
How long does it
remain localized?

00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:49.250
So you have an electron.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:50.550
And you produce a packet.

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:54.650
You localize it to
the size of an atom.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.160
How long can you wait
before this electron is just

00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.460
all over the room?

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:05.300
Well, when we say this
t, and we say this time,

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.600
we're basically saying that
it's roughly still there.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.810
Maybe it grew 20%, 30%.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.490
But what's the
rough time that you

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.230
can expect that it stays there?

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.720
So in this case, we can
use just this formula.

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:28.820
And we say the time
could be approximately

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:34.490
m over h bar delta x squared.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:35.990
It's fun to see the numbers.

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.870
You would calculate it
with mc squared over h bar

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:50.590
c times delta x over
c, this squared.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:16:01.485
The answer is about 10 to the
minus 16 seconds, not much.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:14.320
This is a practical issue
in accelerators as well.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.780
Particle physics
accelerators, they

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:22.540
concern bunches, a little
bunch of protons in the LHC.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.530
It's a little cylinder in
which the wave functions

00:16:26.530 --> 00:16:31.190
of the protons are all
collimated very thin, short,

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.880
a couple of centimeters short.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:40.420
And after going around many
times around the accelerator,

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:44.440
they always have to be
compressed and kept back,

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.850
sent back to shape.

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:51.190
Because just of diffusion,
these things just propagate.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:56.430
And so it's a rather
important thing.

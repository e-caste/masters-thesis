00:00:20.532 --> 00:00:21.615
PROFESSOR: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.930
So, we continue our discussion
of quantum states of light,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.360
and we focus on single
photons as qubits today.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.600
But before I get
into this, I want

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.520
to ask you if you have any
questions about the last unit

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.190
we be completed on Wednesday--
namely, the discussion or non

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.950
classical light-- in
particular, squeezing light--

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.090
and we also discussed a lot
of exciting quantum mechanical

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.520
effects related
to beam splitters.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.350
So, any questions?

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.290
Anything you would
like to see discussed?

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.160
So, as I pointed out,
we want to now talk

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.240
about realization of quantum
logic and quantum gates

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.170
with single photons, but I
also said that we are actually

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.155
using the language of
quantum communications--

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:34.060
a kind of information
processing to describe

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.970
general physics in
a very nice way.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.360
So, first-- when we
talk about photons,

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:50.500
we should talk about our
qubits, and right now, you

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.410
may think that having
a single photon

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.910
and having no photon in a
mode are two possibilities.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.430
And you could use
them as qubits.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.160
However, I will tell you today
that it is better, actually,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.340
to use always one photon, but in
two different wave guides-- two

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.050
different modes.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.220
But, we'll get
there in a moment.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.410
So, the first task at hand is
we want to manipulate photons.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.390
And for that, I want to
introduce phase shifters

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.170
and beam splitters.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.990
And just to give you the
punchline right away,

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.750
what I want to show you is that
those two simple devices --

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.796
beam splitter, a half-silvered
mirror, a phase shifter,

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:39.170
which is just a piece of glass
which you can put into one

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.340
of the laser beams-- that those
two elements and those two

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.420
basic operations, if they
are now put together--

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.760
if you do a beam
splitter, a phase shifter,

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.490
another beam splitter and such--
you can realize any single

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.300
qubit operation.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.250
Therefore, if you have
our qubit cubic state

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.150
with single photons, any
possible state of those qubit

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.140
can be realized using
these optical elements.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.670
Therefore, when I say we want
to realize how we can manipulate

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.570
photons with optical
elements and such,

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.390
I'm not going for a zoo
of optical elements.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.430
Those two will do it all.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.520
So, with the phase
shifter, that's

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.020
what we discussed at
the end of last class.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.210
If you have two modes, and
we shift the phase in one

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.930
of the modes, just simply
put a piece of glass into it,

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.630
then there is a phase shift.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.220
And why do we need two modes?

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.070
Well, phases are
usually-- at least

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.010
in experiments-- not
absolutely defined.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.020
You need a phase
reference, and here,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.520
the mode a acts as
a phase reference.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.830
Let me address one question
which a student asked me

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.950
after class, and
this was related

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.680
to what phases appear
in more than one place.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.060
The student's
question was motivated

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.290
that if you have one
photon, it's a flux state.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.360
A flux state is a circle
in the causal probability,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.450
and therefore, the electric
field has no phase.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.560
Well, this is the phase
of the electric field,

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.780
but here, we're talking about
the phase of the wave function.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.050
And a flux state within
photons is an eigenstate

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.630
of the harmonic oscillator.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.780
It has a time dependence,
e to the i omega t,

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.660
and we can change its phase.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.950
So, this is a kind of phase
shift I've introduced here.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:55.810
So, the second element
we need to realize--

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.490
arbitrary single qubit
operation is the beam splitter,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.600
and I introduced a beam splitter
by just saying, hey look,

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.460
I think that's a
good Hamiltonian.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.300
Let's see what this Hamiltonian
does to the two modes,

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.550
and then we realize-- yes,
it takes those two modes,

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.710
and it mixes the modes with
cosine theta sine theta reading

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:16.500
factors.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.390
That's exactly what you
expect a beam splitter to do.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.570
I'm not sure we need
here now because it's

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:24.380
part of your
homework assignment.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:28.310
You will show that if you
have a coherent state,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.430
the coherent state is
split by a ratio which

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.280
is cosine square theta
sine square theta.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.270
So, it's exactly what you'd
expect from a beam splitter.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.510
So from that, you
realize now what

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.860
this angle theta is, which I
just put into the Hamiltonian.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.260
The cosine square
and sine square of it

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.715
is the reflection
and the transmission

00:05:50.715 --> 00:05:51.590
of the beam splitter.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.900
Any questions at that point?

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.870
Let me now introduce
matrix representation,

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.040
which will come in handy.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:23.370
You remember that you transform
an operator-- the mode

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.360
operator, the annihilation
operator a and b.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:33.300
We multiply with the beam
splitter operator on the left

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.150
and on the right,
b dega-- b ab dega.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:42.630
But there is often a simpler
way how the right inside

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.850
can be written, and this is by
using a matrix representation,

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:47.780
which goes as follows.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:02.770
We can say that the two
operators are transformed

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:16.650
by the following
matrix, and this matrix

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.460
represents the beam splitter.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:29.790
So that's what the beam splitter
does to the mode operators.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.170
Now, we want to talk about
what does the beam splitter do

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:36.220
to quantum states, to
single photon states.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.630
So now, we want to transform
the single photon states.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:43.472
It's a little bit
like, well-- we

00:07:43.472 --> 00:07:45.180
know what to do in
the Heisenberg picture

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:46.500
to the operator,
but now, we want

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.249
to see what happens
to the wave functions.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:08:00.510
So, now-- I want to
say it very slowly,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:07.470
because it shouldn't lead
to any confusion later.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:12.720
We have single photons-- we can
have the single photon in mode

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.260
b, or we can have it in mode a.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.970
These are the two possibilities.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:23.025
And right now, I
label it like this--

00:08:23.025 --> 00:08:27.060
where the first number is your
occupation number of mode a,

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:34.689
and the second number is
your occupation in mode b.

00:08:34.689 --> 00:08:36.230
You have to be a
little bit careful--

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.740
I'm just saying that keep
your alert level high.

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:46.310
Later, I will use
qubit representation,

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:50.130
where the qubit one means
the photon is in mode a,

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.640
and the qubit zero means
the photon is in mode b.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.200
So when we talked about logical
states of our two levels used,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.640
and the photon can be here
or the photon can be there,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.740
zero means the photon is there.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.480
It doesn't mean that
we have zero photons.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.979
But sometimes, I have to
talk about the photons--

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:08.520
and that's what I'm
doing right now--

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.410
and zero means no
photon in this mode.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:16.280
But I will remind you
of that as we go along.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.720
So we have the two
quantum states-- one zero,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.410
and zero one.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:27.490
And let's just see what
the beam splitter is

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:35.450
doing to one photon in mode b.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:44.740
I'm changing notation from one
line to the next in my notes.

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.300
Just give me a split second.

00:09:58.606 --> 00:09:59.106
Yes.

00:10:05.351 --> 00:10:06.600
So, let's use this convention.

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.560
So, just to elaborate
what I just said

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.660
is-- this convention one
zero is the direct product

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.480
of the Hilbert space
for mode b, with one

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:26.800
photon with the Hilbert
space of mode a,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.710
and we have zero photons there.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.150
And sometimes, you want
to denote the state

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:35.040
by putting a comma in between.

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.060
That's all the same.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:46.340
So, how do we transform
the quantum state

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.310
with the beam splitter operator?

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.150
Well, we could now apply
to the quantum stage,

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:54.910
but we just learned how to
apply to operators, so let's

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.530
just use what we
already know, because we

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:04.070
can write the state like this.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:23.120
And now, we want
to insert the unit.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:43.420
We want to insert the
unit operator b dega b,

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:49.950
and now, we can use our
knowledge of the operator.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:51.520
We know how this transforms.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.960
We had this above the
transformation of the operators

00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:04.530
b and b dega, and when we apply
b to nothing-- to no photons,

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:05.300
we get no photons.

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.310
So now, by taking from the
page above the transformation

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:16.180
or the operator b dega,
it's a linear combination

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.920
of a dega and b dega.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.130
We find what we expect--
the photon can now

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:29.870
be in the same mode, or it
can appear in the other mode.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:37.740
And the coefficients from the
transformation of cosine theta

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.310
minus sine theta.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:49.830
And if you would send the
other state through the beam

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:59.930
splitter, we find the cosine
theta sine theta component.

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.670
So, since the total
probability to have a photon

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.800
is cosine square plus
sine square is unity,

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.000
we find what we expected,
but it's nice to see it.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:31.940
Namely, that b conserves the
photon number-- of course,

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:34.270
this should have been
obvious from the outset,

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.860
because we used a Hermitian
operator, a unitary time

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.190
evolution, and that
is energy- conserving.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:49.440
What happens if we
use a state which

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:55.180
has one photon in
each mode, and we

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.570
act on it with
the beam splitter?

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:11.740
Well, it gives a superposition
of the two photons

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.770
can now be in either
of the two modes,

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:21.150
or they can be distributed
one in each mode.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:27.800
And the coefficients are because
we have two transformations,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.575
products of sine and cosine.

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.630
Here is cosine square
plus sine square theta.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:44.390
Here is a plus sine, square
root two plus square root two.

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:56.040
So that means if we allow one
photon to be in each mode,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:59.740
it leads us actually out of the
Hilbert space of single photon

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.190
states, because we have
a certain probability

00:15:02.190 --> 00:15:06.780
now that we have two
photons in each mode.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:07.940
So, we don't want that.

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.740
So if you want to deal
with only one photon,

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:20.990
we should restrict our
attention, our formalism

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:34.370
to the states which have
nor more than one photon.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:37.820
And now, if we act on those
states with beam splitters,

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:43.740
we don't get out of this
subspace or fill that space.

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:59.150
However, we also want to
omit this state because it's

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.350
more elegant to do it, but also,
if you have a single photon

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:06.830
state and we have a detector
which has not 100% efficiency

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:08.770
and we do a
measurement-- well, we

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.900
don't know if we have
the state zero one,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:14.550
but we just didn't detect it,
or we had the state zero zero.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.410
Whereas if you deal
with two states

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:25.280
where you always have a
photon-- exactly one photon--

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.610
and you read out your system
and you detect nothing,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.100
well you discard
the measurement.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.390
And then, you only
take the measurements

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.940
which have detected one photon.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:41.870
So you have the ability to
deal with finite efficiencies

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.890
and losses in a very
straightforward way.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.084
Yes?

00:16:51.084 --> 00:16:53.461
AUDIENCE: The
operation of dega 1, 1

00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:54.710
doesn't look so unitary to me.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:01.780
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.220
And it is in my lecture notes.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.822
Minus.

00:17:04.822 --> 00:17:05.764
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:14.102
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:14.102 --> 00:17:15.560
And it's right in
my lecture notes.

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.210
Sorry.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.731
Sometimes, when you're talking,
explain it, build it up-- yes.

00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:20.230
Thank you.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:27.790
Other question?

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.070
Good.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.700
So what I just said, that we
want to restrict the Hilbert

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:38.290
space to exactly
one photon, this

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:43.040
is so important for
implementations and discussions

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.620
of quantum information protocols
that it has its own name.

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.900
It's called the
dual-rail photon state.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.860
The dual-rail
photon state space.

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:06.200
Exactly one photon, but the
photon can either be in mode a

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.242
or in mode b.

00:18:09.242 --> 00:18:13.690
So this part-- this dual-rail
photon state space--

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:30.070
is a Hilbert space which has a
basis which is zero one and one

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.440
zero, and this is of
course a two-level system.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:44.410
In this so-defined
Hilbert space,

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:52.930
we can have an arbitrary
state, [? psi ?] which

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:56.680
is-- as in any two-dimensional
Hilbert space--

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:00.320
it's a linear superposition
of your two base

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:03.140
states with coefficients
alpha and beta.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:18.660
And the few of them for which
we have prepared right now

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:28.050
is that any possible state
of this Hilbert space

00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:36.575
can be created from any
of the base state, that

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:48.520
is from zero one simply by beam
splitters and phase shifters.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:02.810
When I taught this unit the last
time, I went through the proof,

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.650
but I want to make room for more
in-class discussion like we had

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:09.590
on Wednesday with
the clicker question,

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.140
so what I decided is I give
you the idea behind the proof,

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.160
and the formal parts
you can simply fill in

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.220
by reading about it
on the Wiki page.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:23.250
So, let me just
focus on the idea.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:29.130
So the proof is that
if I use some column

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:36.670
vector for alpha beta-- that
we can identify with the beam

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:38.630
splitter and the
phase shifter-- we

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:42.780
can identify them as
rotation operators.

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:50.050
This is immediate obvious if I
use the transformation on psi

00:20:50.050 --> 00:21:00.670
by beam splitter, we learned
just a few minutes ago

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:03.810
how the beam splitter operator
acts on the base state.

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:06.790
So now, we know how it
acts on an arbitrary

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.780
linear combination.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:13.030
And the matrix here
is nothing else

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:18.800
than the rotation
matrix with the minus

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:22.490
sign around the y-axis.

00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:40.220
So that's a beam splitter.

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:51.110
The phase shifter is
not changing any state.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:22:02.130
It shifts one of the states
by e to the minus i phi,

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:06.740
but I can sort of summarize
it by taking half of it

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:12.110
out as a prefector,
and then adding here

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.650
e to the i phi over two.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.780
And this here is
immediately recognized

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:26.970
as the rotation matrix
around the z-axis.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.680
Now, you may ask
what about this?

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:37.840
Well, this is an irrelevant
global phase factor.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:44.406
If you have any state
in Hilbert space

00:22:44.406 --> 00:22:46.650
and you change the global
phase, it doesn't matter.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:59.260
Therefore, we are realizing
that the beam splitter

00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.910
is a rotation around the y-axis.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.720
It's now a definitional thing,
but we put a factor of two

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:16.360
here by an angle two theta,
and the phase shifter

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:23.131
is a rotation around the
z-axis by an angle phi.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:37.370
Now, with that, we
can formulate what

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:42.390
is called Bloch's theorem,
that any unitary operation

00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:44.310
of a two-dimensional
Hilbert space

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.340
can be written as a
product of rotations.

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:51.130
Now, let's first count an
arbitrary unitary operation

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:53.660
while a two by two
matrix in complex space

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:59.280
has eight numbers-- four real
parts, four imaginary parts.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:01.320
But if the matrix
is unitary, they

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:03.350
are only four
independent elements--

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.970
alpha, beta, gamma, delta.

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:09.960
And if you parametrize the
unitary matrix with alpha,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:13.950
beta, gamma, delta which is
shown in the weekly notes,

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:20.340
then we can write this
arbitrary unitary matrix

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.620
by a combination of an
overall phase factor.

00:24:27.182 --> 00:24:29.140
Which is irrelevant
because it's a global phase

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:35.470
factor-- and then a rotation
around z, a rotation around y,

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.665
and a rotation
around the z-axis.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:59.380
So, if I rephrase this
theorem in modern language,

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:05.930
I would say we
have a qubit which

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.790
is a two-level
system characterized

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.620
by two numbers alpha beta.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:18.950
And we can do an arbitrary
operation in the Hilbert space

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:30.780
of the qubit, which is called
an arbitrary single qubit

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:31.280
operation.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:50.250
So, can be performed by phase
shifters and beam splitters.

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.650
Just to make sure that this
doesn't lead to any confusion,

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.430
the phase shift which is
relevant for this Hilbert space

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:08.310
is a phase shift which is
relative between the two

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:12.590
states, and can be detected
by an interference experiment.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.790
Those global phase shifts
cannot be detected.

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.420
There is no observable,
no procedure

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:23.510
to observe those-- unless you
would have a a third mode.

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.680
But then, we would
expand the Hilbert space

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:32.240
to three levels and
then, of course,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.060
it's the global phase shift
in the two-dimension Hilbert

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.622
space becomes a
relative phase shift

00:26:36.622 --> 00:26:38.330
within the three-dimension
Hilbert space.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:47.685
And in modern language,
those single qubit operations

00:26:47.685 --> 00:26:50.660
are called quantum gates.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.980
So, all gates which
act on a single qubit

00:26:54.980 --> 00:27:00.120
can be realized with phase
shifters and beam splitters.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.870
Let me give you one
example for that.

00:27:03.870 --> 00:27:08.980
In quantum computation,
quantum information science,

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.710
there is a very important
gate-- the Hadamard gate,

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:19.130
which is described by
a transformation which

00:27:19.130 --> 00:27:23.430
has 1 minus 111.

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:28.790
And I said it can be realized
with a beam splitter and phase

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:29.930
shifter.

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:37.930
So let me just show it to you
in using our symbolic language.

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:42.430
So if you look at the matrix
we had derived for the beam

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:48.480
splitter, you realize that
we get the Hadamard gate

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.730
by aiding the phase
shifter by pi.

00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:07.220
So, in that sense, single qubit
operations are checked off.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.850
We know how to deal with that.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:19.780
We want to now move towards
two qubit operations--

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.490
and then, it's getting
really interesting.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:26.230
As you may know, you can
do any arbitrary operation

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:28.650
in many qubits by
just having single

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:30.700
and two qubit operations.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.940
Therefore, once we know
how two qubits interact--

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:38.970
how photons in two
different qubits interact,

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:43.500
we are done-- we have
universal quantum gates.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.632
The element I need for
two qubit operation

00:28:46.632 --> 00:28:48.090
is the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:11.200
Just a side remark, I introduce
a Mach-Zehnder interferometer

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.760
here as a way to
manipulate qubits.

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.850
On the other hand,
most of you know

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:19.900
that interferometers for light
and interferometers for atoms

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.120
are used for some of the most
precise measurements ever done.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.110
So, in that sense,
this shows the dual use

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.340
of the formalism I'm
introducing here.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.110
We really use some of the
formalism and the language

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:34.630
we develop here for
qubit operation,

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.350
and discuss next week
the ultimate accuracy--

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.200
the fundamental
limits to the accuracy

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.100
you can get in
precision measurements

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.100
based on interferometry.

00:29:53.995 --> 00:29:55.520
Let me just write
down the sentence

00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.080
because it has a lot
of key words in it.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:04.390
So the dual-rail photon
presentation of a qubit-- this

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:05.800
is what we have achieved so far.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.340
So this allows us now to
discuss interferometers simply

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.268
as [INAUDIBLE] gates.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:48.746
And what isn't interferometer--
an interferometer is,

00:30:48.746 --> 00:30:51.870
in its basic [INAUDIBLE],
you have a beam splitter,

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.700
you have two paths, and then
you use another beam splitter

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.167
which recombines the two beams.

00:30:57.167 --> 00:30:58.625
So, let me draw
two beam splitters.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.300
These are two beam splitters.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:20.770
We have an input [INAUDIBLE]
b, an input mode a.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:22.030
They are sort of mixed.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.090
Here are the two arms
of the interferometer.

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.230
And now, we create output
modes b prime and a prime.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:38.810
What we have introduced
here is the beam splitter b,

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:43.880
and by putting the dot on the
other side, this is b dega.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:50.320
Since b dega times b equals
one equals the identity,

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.400
this interferometer
is doing nothing.

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.410
If the photon
starts in mode b, it

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.680
comes out in the upper mode b.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:32:01.580
If it starts in a, it
comes out in the mode a.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:05.290
But of course, this
is just the beginning,

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:15.410
because we can now introduce
here an arbitrary phase shift

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:16.600
phi.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.470
And now, it is an
interferometer.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.090
Now, we can read
out with the output

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:26.450
the phase shift, and ultimately,
with very high precision.

00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:28.570
I what you to appreciate that.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:34.280
If we had used single qubits
in one mode-- no photon,

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.390
one photon.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:38.680
I gave you many reasons
why we shouldn't do that,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.700
but then, we would be
dealing with one mode,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.200
and this would
actually be something

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.570
which involves two qubits.

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:48.420
But since our
single qubit system

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.580
is a two-level system where
the photon is here and there,

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:56.800
we can now send single photons
with the interferometer--

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:02.140
describe the interferometer
as a single qubit operation.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.810
At least it's nice.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:07.142
It allows us to
keep things simple,

00:33:07.142 --> 00:33:09.100
and discuss things at a
very fundamental level.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.470
So, what we want to
figure out-- what

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.080
is this interferometer doing?

00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:27.390
So, we want to know if we
have an input state-- what

00:33:27.390 --> 00:33:28.950
is the output state?

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:33.720
And the input state can now
be any arbitrary wave function

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.660
in our dual-rail Hilbert space.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.420
So, it's always
one photon, but it

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.730
can be in a random
superposition in an arbitrary

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:47.580
superposition of states a and b.

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.950
Well, with the formalism
we have developed now,

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:52.720
it becomes very simple.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:57.220
All we have to do is we have
to act with the first beam

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.430
splitter with a phase shifter,
and with a second beam splitter

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:03.740
onto the state.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:14.070
And this is nothing else than
taking two rotation matrices

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.600
and multiplying them.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.659
The beam splitter
we have chosen,

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:26.170
I said there was sort
of a phase convention

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.445
when I peeked the beam splitter.

00:34:29.445 --> 00:34:33.590
It is a rotation by pi over 2.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.449
This is minus pi over 2, and
the z-rotation is by minus phi.

00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:51.000
I'm not sure if I manage to do
that, but if this is the y-axis

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.980
and we start with the qubit,
the first beam splitter

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:57.340
rotates it down.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:02.620
Then, the rotation by z-- thus,
that-- and the second beam

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.700
splitter rotates by y.

00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:09.080
Therefore, the
qubit is like that.

00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:15.000
Therefore, if you count
all x's with the things

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.530
I did is-- I started
with a qubit here.

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.170
It went down like
this, like this.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:22.000
So what I did is--
in the end, I simply

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.970
rotated it around the x-axis.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:27.630
If you want, you can
multiply the matrices,

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:33.440
or you can draw block
sphere visualization.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:41.170
That you say we have an
x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:42.330
So the z is vertical.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:55.300
So, we started out with
the qubit along the z-axis.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.110
The first one was rotation
around the y-axis.

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.980
So then, we were here.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:15.880
The second operation was
rotation around the z-axis.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:26.340
And then, we have to rotate
back around the y-axis, which

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.920
eventually gives this
as the final state.

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.610
So ultimately, the
product of all this

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:37.225
is a rotation around the x-axis.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:44.354
Our interferometer--
I'm not sure

00:36:44.354 --> 00:36:45.770
if you've ever
heard the language,

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.840
but it's really
elegant and powerful.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.330
An interferometer with
an arbitrary phase

00:36:52.330 --> 00:36:55.350
in this two-level Hilbert
space with this sort

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.430
of geometric interpretation
we have given,

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.765
is nothing else than a
rotation around the x-axis.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:15.250
Therefore, we know immediately
the two limiting cases when

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:21.100
we rotate by zero,
it's sort of balanced.

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.450
Output and input are the
same, because we're not

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:26.520
rotating at all.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.460
Whereas if we have a phase
shift of 180 degrees,

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:33.590
we swap the two qubits.

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:40.840
So, we swap the two
modes, and swapping modes

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.550
is an inversion of the qubit.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:38:00.390
So that's almost trivial,
but we need this definition--

00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:03.490
we need this knowledge to
take it to the next step.

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:05.160
Remember, we want
to do something

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.870
more interesting than
rotating two level systems.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:12.420
We want to get two qubits,
combine them, entangle them,

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.770
and all that.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:19.200
So what we need for
that is-- we have

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.660
to expand the Hilbert space.

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:25.150
I introduced the Mach-Zehnder
interferometer as the device

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:26.400
to do it.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.000
But now, we need a way
how a second photon

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.410
from another qubit can
interact with the photon

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:35.420
of our first qubit.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.020
And we want to do that
by introducing first

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.440
the non-linear Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.810
I want to throw in a
non-linear element,

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:48.640
and then we are ready to
allow the second qubit

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.430
through the non-linear element
to manipulate the first qubit.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:55.960
And then, we have
interactions between qubit.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:57.580
We have two qubit gates.

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:21.202
Let me maybe just
deviate for my notes.

00:39:21.202 --> 00:39:22.910
I really want to show
you what I'm doing,

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:26.510
and that you have it clearly
in mind where I'm aiming it.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:31.160
So what we want to accomplish
is-- instead of having a phase

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:34.080
shifter with an externally
controlled phase,

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:38.480
I want to put in some
non-linear crystal-- which

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:41.820
has an index of refraction
which has a phase shift.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.070
But now, the face that
the non-linear crystal

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.780
has the property, that
its index of refraction

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:54.740
changes when I take another
laser beam and send it through.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.530
So, the laser beam through--
because the index of refraction

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:01.400
is intensity-dependent,
the green laser beam

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.420
changes index of refraction of
the non-linear crystal-- also

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.340
called Kerr medium.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:11.240
And that means now,
because the blue beam

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.060
goes through the same crystal,
that the green beam controls

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.520
now the phase shift
of the blue beam.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:23.302
And now, we have interacting
photons-- one photon interacts

00:40:23.302 --> 00:40:24.260
with the second photon.

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.120
Let's work it out.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:37.940
So our goal is to
develop a description

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:40.620
for non-linear Mach-Zehnder
interferometer.

00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.080
What we need is a
non-linear medium.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.140
So, let me just introduce
for two or three minutes

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.289
non-linear medium,
how we describe it,

00:40:58.289 --> 00:41:00.080
and then we put in into
our interferometer.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.060
So, in linear optics--
just to remind you,

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:12.940
we have a polarization on
electric dipole moment, which

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:17.420
is proportional to the
electric field of light,

00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.840
and x i is the polarizability.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.030
The most complicated case, it
can be polarizability tensor.

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:35.110
Now, this is linear.

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:42.720
If you want two non-linear, then
we have the linear relationship

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:46.890
simply as you can say the first
terminal [INAUDIBLE] expansion.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:50.900
So we expand the response
of the medium in powers

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:57.480
of the electric field, and
we have the susceptibilities

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:02.400
chi 1, chi 2, chi 3, and so on.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:13.230
We have already encountered
a non-linear element which

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:19.610
had a chi 2 susceptibility,
and these where the crystals

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:29.400
we put in our OPOs into our
optical parametric oscillators.

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:32.290
Remember, the optical
parametric oscillator

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:36.770
involved-- how many modes?

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:38.730
Three.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:43.890
We had one photon, which was
broken down into two photons.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.350
But that also means
that the reverse process

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:51.460
is you drive the beam-- you
drive the OPO with omega,

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.730
but the e square term creates
an electric polarization

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:57.800
as 2 omega.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.680
And if you have an oscillating
polarization as 2 omega,

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:02.720
you create light at 2 omega.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.020
So, I just want to remind you
that the chi square term is

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:08.779
what we have
already encountered.

00:43:08.779 --> 00:43:11.070
That's not what we need for
the non-linear Mach-Zehnder

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:12.620
interferometer.

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.100
What we need now is
a chi 3 interaction,

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:18.485
which is the Kerr medium.

00:43:22.790 --> 00:43:26.820
Because we want to realize
the following Hamiltonian.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.410
The Hamiltonian, the Kerr
medium is also called cross--

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:37.460
that's cx --
cross-phase modulation.

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.795
One beam can affect the
phase of another beam,

00:43:40.795 --> 00:43:42.545
and this is called
cross-phase modulation.

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:47.300
There's also
self-phase modulation--

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:49.540
that one laser beam changes
the index of refraction

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:52.655
for itself-- but here, we want
the cross-phase modulation.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:07.130
So, we know that if we have a
mode, and we shift its phase,

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:09.850
we're not changing any photons.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.420
So if we're in an
eigenstate of mode a

00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:17.260
with one, two, or three photons
and we simply shift its phase,

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.870
we are diagonal in a dega
a, and the phase shift

00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:24.170
is proportional
to prefector here.

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:28.115
So this Hamiltonian is simply a
phase shift for photons in mode

00:44:28.115 --> 00:44:35.170
a, but if you now multiply
that with b dega b,

00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:38.680
the phase shift is now
proportional to the number

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.900
of photons in mode b.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.830
Now, we have a situation that
the phase shift from mode

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:48.440
a proportional to the intensity
in beam b, and vice versa.

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.140
So, I think it's self-evident
that this Hamiltonian is

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.930
sequential description
of the process we

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.080
want to introduce know.

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.300
This is the cross-phase
modulation Hamiltonian.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.400
Isn't it much more elegant
to describe non-linear optics

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.150
with Hamiltonians than with
parametrized susceptibilities

00:45:18.150 --> 00:45:18.994
and all that?

00:45:18.994 --> 00:45:20.910
It's just amazing-- you
write in a few letters

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.390
and it has all the power of
the classical description--

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:27.060
plus extra, because it
includes quantum fluctuations

00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.380
and everything.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:31.780
I hope you appreciate
the power of the language

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:33.460
we are developing.

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:35.420
This is the cross-phase
modulation Hamiltonian.

00:45:39.350 --> 00:45:45.320
And now, we want to
use this Hamiltonian

00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:55.365
in a crystal of
lengths L Well, you

00:45:55.365 --> 00:46:02.230
know if you have a
time-propagation operator,

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:06.410
you put the Hamiltonian in the
exponent and multiply with t,

00:46:06.410 --> 00:46:11.300
but for propagating laser
beam, t and L are related,

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:14.240
so this is now the
unitary transformation

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:17.980
if you propagate
through that crystal.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:33.780
We are now defining
that by saying

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.650
we have this non-linear
susceptibility,

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:39.540
things will be proportional
to the links L,

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:42.910
and then we have the
operator a dega a, b dega b.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:58.680
And let me choose for
the following discussion

00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:06.300
that the links are
chosen, such that-- when

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.360
multiplied with a
non-linear susceptibility,

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:09.880
we get a phase shift of pi.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.900
Now, we are ready
to describe what

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.730
happens when we
have a Kerr medium,

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:31.235
and we have two input modes.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:41.295
So, let's write down the
table of possible combinations

00:47:41.295 --> 00:47:41.920
and operations.

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:47.565
Well, when we act on the
vacuum, we get nothing.

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:54.884
What happens when we have
one photon in one mode?

00:47:54.884 --> 00:47:56.050
What happens to that photon?

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:14.500
Well, the extra
phase shift coming

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:17.130
from cross-phase
modulation is zero,

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:22.760
because we have no photon in
one of the modes, and a dega a

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:25.410
or b dega b acting on
this mode gives zero.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:34.020
Therefore, as long as
we have only one photon,

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:35.810
we have no phase shift.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:38.600
The exponential factor
is one, and we simply

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:44.300
reproduce the original state.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:47.980
So, the only non-trivial
situation by construction

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:52.090
is when we have one
photon in each mode,

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:58.320
and then we get the matrix
element e to the ikl.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.660
And we adjusted the
lengths of the crystal

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.030
that this is just minus one.

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:10.540
In other words, in
this Hilbert space,

00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.360
we get a phase shift of pi--
we get a minus sign when

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.130
we have one photon in each mode.

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.800
That's all what
this medium does.

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:28.400
And if you ever
thought about it--

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.380
how to deal with this
situation-- that when

00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:36.200
I said there is one photon
which provides a phase

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.200
shift to the other photon.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.590
But the other photon is
also providing a phase shift

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:41.990
to the first photon.

00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:43.340
So you may wonder.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.470
When you have a combined
state of the two,

00:49:45.470 --> 00:49:47.970
how do you deal that
one photon shifts

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.500
the other photon,
and vice versa?

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:52.000
But when you apply
the operator, you

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.620
don't even have
to think about it.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:56.540
You see that the operator
for the combined Hilbert

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:59.350
space of the two photons
gives you a phase shift of pi.

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:02.440
It's not pi for one photon
times pi for the other one--

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.180
it's pi for the
whole quantum state.

00:50:06.766 --> 00:50:07.550
Any questions?

00:50:11.530 --> 00:50:17.730
We have a Kerr
medium, which means

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:22.360
we are ready now to put it
into our interferometer.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.135
I'm doing at this
time-- insert picture.

00:50:55.290 --> 00:50:57.660
This is what you want to do now.

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.990
We have now three
modes of light.

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:04.090
You would say, hey-- a
qubit, each qubit is two.

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.010
What is it-- is it
one and a half qubit?

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:10.490
Yes, it is-- but we extended
two cubits in a moment.

00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:12.830
So what we simply
have right now is

00:51:12.830 --> 00:51:18.300
we have the mode c-- which
controls the non-linear medium,

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:20.750
and we have what we
have already discussed.

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.250
Our interferometer
with a phase shifter,

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:24.520
which is now the Kerr medium.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:33.120
So I think even
without doing any math,

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:43.870
we know that by construction,
when we have no photons in c,

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:52.390
that the modes a prime b prime
transform-- become a and b,

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:54.610
because we have a balance
interferometer which

00:51:54.610 --> 00:51:57.710
is the identity transformation,
unless we have a phase shift.

00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:12.530
But when we have one photon in
state c, then we actually swap.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:14.150
So, that's pretty cool.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:19.750
A single photon in mode c will
redirect the photon from ab

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:21.490
to ba.

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:26.320
So that's how one
photon in mode c

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:29.410
controls what happens
to the photon in ab.

00:52:35.130 --> 00:52:39.540
If you want a general
description of that,

00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:46.060
we obtain the output
state from the input state

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:50.520
by using the matrix b.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:55.960
This was our interferometer
based on two beam splitters.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.410
It involved mode a and b.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.340
But now, we throw in
the phase shifter,

00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:07.000
which is our Kerr operator--
our non-linear phase

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.840
shifter with b and c.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:18.540
This new addition to
the interferometer

00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:25.130
is described by e to the i,
non-linear susceptibility L,

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:27.700
b dega b, c dega c.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.080
Let me give you one
intermediate result.

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.295
We have now beam
splitters on either side.

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:54.540
And that leads us
to an expression.

00:53:54.540 --> 00:54:03.810
While the beam splitters
do nothing to the mode c,

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:07.390
but the beam splitters
transform the modes

00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:09.026
in linear combinations.

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:28.910
And if you do some tedious
rearrangement of terms--

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:31.480
more details are
given in the Wiki--

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.200
you find that the
essential result is now

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:54.460
the operator, which we get is
a dega b minus b dega a over 2.

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:08.390
I'm not giving you the
non-essential terms,

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:12.095
which are just phase
shifts-- global phase shifts.

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:20.680
So, let me write it
down in blue here.

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:29.420
This is just the result of
the operator manipulation.

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:36.320
If I would cover
that-- what is that?

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:40.710
Do you remember a dega b minus
b dega a in the exponent?

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:42.680
It's a beam splitter.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.120
And the beam splitter--
the beam splitter

00:55:45.120 --> 00:55:47.890
matrix was sine
theta cosine theta.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:50.280
So we had a theta here.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.320
Now, you realize that this
non-linear Mach-Zehnder

00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.100
interferometer, the
three optical elements

00:55:56.100 --> 00:56:00.020
can be replaced by simply a
single-beam splitter for mode

00:56:00.020 --> 00:56:04.520
a and b, but the angle
theta of the beam splitter

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:09.140
is now controlled by the
photon field in state c.

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:26.810
In other words, we have
now a beam splitter.

00:56:37.762 --> 00:56:39.970
I told you that a
beam splitter is

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:43.235
nothing else than a
rotation around the y-axis.

00:56:46.720 --> 00:56:51.170
So now, this non-linear
Mach-Zehnder interferometer

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:53.840
is simply a beam
splitter with a rotation

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.630
angle given by this term.

00:57:09.007 --> 00:57:09.590
Any questions?

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:40.870
This is a situation we
just had, and we can now

00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:51.010
get to two qubits by simply
adding one more rail.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:59.120
Remember, two rails with exactly
one photon in it is a qubit.

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:05.570
So now, we have a qubit here,
and we have a qubit there.

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:08.980
And you see immediately
one way how the upper qubit

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:11.705
x on the lower qubit--
if the lower qubit has

00:58:11.705 --> 00:58:20.880
a photon in state c, it
flips the other qubit.

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.790
But if the upper qubit
has a photon in d,

00:58:23.790 --> 00:58:26.100
it doesn't do anything
to the lower qubit.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.825
Now, we have a
two-qubit operation.

00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.870
This is shown here.

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:49.490
But what I want to discuss
now is the situation

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:52.800
when we throw in one
more beam splitter,

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.130
and this beam splitter
acts on the upper qubit.

00:59:04.611 --> 00:59:08.370
Well-- isn't it
great how quickly

00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:10.460
we go from simple
elements to something

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:13.930
which looks quite sophisticated?

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:21.520
So, this device now is
a single optical device

00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:26.560
which can entangle qubits,
which leads to entanglement.

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.020
And actually, entanglement
is our next big topic

00:59:29.020 --> 00:59:32.260
we want to talk about--
entanglement between particles,

00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.410
entanglement between photons.

00:59:34.410 --> 00:59:39.130
And by introducing the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer,

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.600
I was actually building
up the situation,

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:45.845
which is extremely
simple elements which

00:59:45.845 --> 00:59:46.720
lead to entanglement.

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:52.350
We have everything
for the description--

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:54.700
each of those
elements is described

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:58.170
by a matrix which
we have developed.

00:59:58.170 --> 01:00:01.130
Therefore, by just
multiplying those matrices,

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:05.990
you find immediately how
this whole device is now

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:08.490
manipulated into qubits.

01:00:08.490 --> 01:00:10.910
So, if you want, you
can just take the crank,

01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:13.140
use what we have already
done, and crank out

01:00:13.140 --> 01:00:14.426
the result for it.

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:29.220
Now I wish I had
a bigger screen,

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:32.470
because I want to describe
what's going on for you.

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.190
What I want to
discuss with you now

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:49.560
is what happens when
we take this device,

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.245
and we use exactly the
states 0,1 0,1 at the input

01:00:54.245 --> 01:00:54.870
as I indicated.

01:01:00.690 --> 01:01:04.960
In terms of qubit
language, I say

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:08.560
that the first
qubit is in spin-up,

01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.550
and the lower qubit
is also in spin-up.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:17.830
Spin-down would mean
that the single photon

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:19.820
is in the other state.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:23.140
Our two-level system--
our dual-rail single qubit

01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:26.790
two-level system is the
photon can be either

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:28.090
in one of those states.

01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:33.140
This one, we call spin-up--
this one, we call spin-down.

01:01:33.140 --> 01:01:38.690
What I want to
discuss with you now,

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:41.950
what happens when we start
with this symmetric input

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:46.240
up-up, which means 0,1 0,1.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.620
And since I don't want to
scroll up and down so often,

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:52.760
everything is trivial
beam splitters,

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.330
except for the situation when
we have one photon each here,

01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.587
and then the Kerr medium
gives us a minus sign.

01:02:00.587 --> 01:02:01.920
So that's what I want to put in.

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:16.790
Remember, I want to
develop the physics

01:02:16.790 --> 01:02:20.960
in one, two, three
temporal steps.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.490
The first temporal step is
simply two beam splitters,

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:25.570
and this is shown here.

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:32.650
We start out-- and now
we have beam splitter

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:37.270
for the upper qubit, beam
splitter for the lower qubit.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.410
And well, by just
multiplying it out,

01:02:40.410 --> 01:02:48.730
we are now obtaining
this summation state

01:02:48.730 --> 01:02:53.290
for the four different modes.

01:02:53.290 --> 01:02:55.660
And I'm dropping here
factors of square root--

01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.420
or you can collect them
at the end, if you want.

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.370
And I said the only
interesting situation

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:06.800
is where we have two
photons-- one each in the two

01:03:06.800 --> 01:03:11.320
middle modes, because now, the
Kerr medium kicks in and gives

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.570
us a minus sign.

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:20.480
Now, you can show by inspection
that if you now apply the beam

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:24.190
splitter to modes
a and b, you take

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:28.740
1, 0 into a linear
combination of 1 and 1,

01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:32.680
but the beam splitter is only
acting on the last two numbers

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.600
here.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:37.870
Then you obtain a state
which looks very simple.

01:03:37.870 --> 01:03:40.070
So this is the output
state of the device.

01:03:43.287 --> 01:03:43.870
Any questions?

01:03:47.870 --> 01:04:06.700
And this output state is--
if I use the spin language,

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.020
it's an entangled state.

01:04:19.780 --> 01:04:21.860
So now, you have
one simple example

01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:25.130
how just using linear
optics, very simple elements

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:28.540
you can start with one
photon here, one photon here,

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.980
a simple product state,
and what comes out

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.940
is an entangled state.

01:04:36.285 --> 01:04:36.785
Questions?

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.000
Let me tell you what I'm
not telling you-- namely,

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.810
the Wiki developed by
a professor [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:54.030
has now a wonderful section on
a famous quantum algorithm--

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:57.100
the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:59.750
Pretty much using the
elements we discuss,

01:04:59.750 --> 01:05:03.220
you can now realize the
Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm,

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:06.150
which is one of the
famous algorithms where

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:09.620
quantum logic--
quantum computation is

01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.430
faster and more efficient
than classical computation.

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:16.530
I decided not to present
it to you, because it just

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:19.200
leads to an even more
complicated diagram and more

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:20.090
formulae.

01:05:20.090 --> 01:05:22.930
You should just sit back and
slowly read it by yourself.

01:05:22.930 --> 01:05:25.290
There is no new
idea introduced--

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:28.820
it's just the concepts
we have discussed

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:32.990
can lead to very
powerful algorithms.

01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:37.050
What I want to rather do is-- I
want to continue our discussion

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:41.440
and now talk about the object
we have encountered here--

01:05:41.440 --> 01:05:42.625
namely, entangled states.

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:48.650
But if you have any
questions, if you

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:52.100
want me to explain anything
more about the single qubit

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.150
manipulation, the
dual-rail photon state,

01:05:55.150 --> 01:05:56.784
I would be happy to do that.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:51.630
Our next chapter is
on entangled photons,

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:57.050
and what we can accomplish
in the next 10 or 15 minutes

01:06:57.050 --> 01:07:00.585
is mainly a definition and
some of the properties.

01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:07.830
What we will do
next week is we will

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:11.617
talk about how we measure
entanglement-- you already

01:07:11.617 --> 01:07:14.460
had one homework assignment
where you discussed one

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:16.690
way to measure
entanglement, but there

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:18.890
are others which we want
to discuss next week.

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:27.260
I also want to show you next
week how entanglement leads

01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:30.830
to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
paradox and Bell's

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:32.470
inequalities.

01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:34.310
And eventually, I
want to show you

01:07:34.310 --> 01:07:39.520
how you can entangle
not only photons,

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.040
but how you can entangle atoms.

01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.610
But that's an outlook.

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:46.340
I think, first of all,
we want to understand

01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.260
what is entanglement.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:59.740
Entanglement is-- let me
first [? motivate ?] it.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:05.850
Many people regard entanglement
as the most quantum

01:08:05.850 --> 01:08:07.700
essence you can find.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.620
Well, there's
always a discussion,

01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.510
but it's really quantum.

01:08:16.510 --> 01:08:19.760
Some people would say
waves are quantum.

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:23.774
But often, we find
quantum systems--

01:08:23.774 --> 01:08:26.720
very famously, Bose-Einstein
condensates, which really

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:29.380
behave like
electromagnetic waves.

01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:30.410
They can be split.

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.880
They can interfere.

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:35.960
But Bose-Einstein condensates
are so big, have so many atoms

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:39.859
that you hardly ever encounter
quantum fluctuations.

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:42.790
You're really in the classical
limit of matter waves,

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:47.370
and I would actually
say this is maybe not

01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:48.899
at the heart of
quantum mechanics.

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:50.520
While it's nice,
it's powerful, it's

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.540
important-- but this is not
really the new feature which

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:58.540
quantum mechanics has
shown us in nature.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:01.010
You would say-- well,
what else is quantum?

01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:02.810
Maybe certain
quantum fluctuations

01:09:02.810 --> 01:09:05.040
going down to single
photons, and I

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.952
would agree that's
a quantization

01:09:06.952 --> 01:09:08.160
of the electromagnetic field.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:11.290
That's much more quantum than
having millions of condensates,

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:15.330
millions of condensed
atoms in one single wave.

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:17.899
But what I would say
is even more quantum

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:20.950
than the single photon
is the entanglement.

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:25.420
Entanglement is sort of
pure quantum mechanics.

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:28.300
With single photons, you
can still use intuition.

01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:32.689
But with entanglement,
that is really bizarre.

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:35.985
This is really- I
hate the word, but let

01:09:35.985 --> 01:09:39.569
me use it-- this is sort
of pure quantum weirdness.

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:43.359
And there are people who have
spent most of their career

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:47.510
until now to just show the
weirdness of quantum mechanics,

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:52.779
and showing to what peculiar
phenomena entanglement leads.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:57.709
So entanglement has really
lead to a lot of-- I

01:09:57.709 --> 01:10:00.000
should be careful with the
word surprising-- surprising

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.060
always means you didn't
have enough imagination

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:05.370
to think about it, but yes,
I would say-- really truly

01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:09.330
unanticipated, and in that
sense, surprising developments.

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:18.610
Entanglement is, therefore,
for me, the most quantum

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:20.085
aspect of quantum mechanics.

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:32.590
It was through the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:38.800
argument-- it was actually
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:42.890
in the '30s who argued--
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen were

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:45.237
really the first--
this was almost 5

01:10:45.237 --> 01:10:47.070
or 10 years after the
development of quantum

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.890
mechanics.

01:10:47.890 --> 01:10:50.600
But it was
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:56.185
who looked at the properties
of entangled states.

01:11:01.420 --> 01:11:04.220
This famous experiment
where you have something

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.170
entangled in position
and momentum space.

01:11:06.170 --> 01:11:08.040
And then,
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.760
found a paradox,
and their conclusion

01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:16.250
was that the properties
of entangled states

01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:19.560
implies that quantum
mechanic is not

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.390
compete-- is not a complete
description of the word.

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:32.260
Well, we don't any longer
share this opinion.

01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:40.820
It was John Bell and others who
said that entanglement really

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:54.460
exemplifies that quantum
mechanical correlations go

01:11:54.460 --> 01:12:02.180
beyond classical mechanics--
go beyond the classic picture.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.370
Therefore, you can say
if you have a quantum

01:12:07.370 --> 01:12:10.600
system like a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:14.130
where you have end
particles doing

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:16.470
in unison what
one particle does.

01:12:16.470 --> 01:12:19.100
This is sort of like the
laser where many photons do

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.640
what one photon does--
but it fits very, very

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:25.310
well into the concept of
classical probabilities

01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:28.800
and an intuitive understanding
of why many particles do

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.680
what one particle does.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.980
But if the particles
are entangled,

01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:36.280
that's almost like you
turbo-charge your system.

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:39.960
Your system has now more
oomph, more power in it.

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:43.380
And this is shown that it
has extra correlation-- there

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.785
is something extra in
it, which you would never

01:12:45.785 --> 01:12:48.090
get from any classical limit.

01:12:48.090 --> 01:12:52.340
And this extra oomph,
this extra power

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:55.600
turns out to be a real resource.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:13:02.490
So, entanglement-- this extra
correlation-- is a resource.

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:06.270
And resource means it's
good for something.

01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:07.453
It enables teleportation.

01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:19.470
Remember when we talked about
the teleportation scheme--

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:22.920
Alice and Bob could only
teleport a quantum state

01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.240
because they shared
entangled photons.

01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:32.020
It was this entangled state
which Alice manipulated

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.620
with a measurement,
and Bob used this half

01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.740
of the entangled state to
recreate the original state.

01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:44.320
So, it's the engine
[INAUDIBLE] up

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:51.380
behind teleportation in the
world of quantum computation.

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:55.860
The exponential speedup
of quantum computers

01:13:55.860 --> 01:14:05.400
versus classical computers
in quantum algorithms

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.840
is due to the
entanglement, which

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.430
we can put into
a quantum system.

01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:13.840
And eventually,
next week, you will

01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:17.540
see that if you have
an atom interferometer

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:28.520
with entangled states,
we can operate it

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.900
at a precision which is
better than short noise.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:41.480
So in other words, you use laser
light to measure something,

01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.990
and you're limited by
the fundamental noise

01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:45.650
limit of classical physics.

01:14:45.650 --> 01:14:48.630
Now, you entangle
your laser beam

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:50.380
and you get higher
precision out of it.

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.790
So this shows that entanglement
is a very special resource.

01:14:53.790 --> 01:14:56.070
It's very precious,
very powerful

01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.240
and can extend what
physics can do.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.770
So, let's define it.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.880
I'm not describing
to you entanglement

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:29.860
in the most generous situation.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.880
If you talk about
many modes-- if you

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.570
talk about not just pure states,
but statistical operators--

01:15:36.570 --> 01:15:39.580
it can become quite involved.

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:43.060
I'd rather start with the
simple situation, which

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:47.370
for conceptual discussions is
also the most important one.

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:52.840
I restrict our focus
now on two modes.

01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:13.260
I want to ask if you have two
modes a-- actually, two modes

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:15.350
means two subsystems here.

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:20.630
If you have two
subsystems a and b--

01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:23.530
let me tell you what
entanglement is not,

01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:26.220
and then I make
it the definition.

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:28.100
There wouldn't be
anything special

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:34.200
if you have a system which
has two parts a and b.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.100
The global system is psi ab.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.610
But if your system
would simply factorize

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:44.750
into a wave function
of subsystem a,

01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:50.270
direct product with
subsystem b, and this here

01:16:50.270 --> 01:16:51.305
is the tensor product.

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:56.780
Then, there would be
nothing special going on

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:59.697
between subsystem
a and subsystem b--

01:16:59.697 --> 01:17:00.780
and this is non-entangled.

01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.455
Everything else is entangled.

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:06.580
So, this is our definition.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:16.740
When we have two
separate systems a and b,

01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:21.840
we call this situation the
total system bipartite.

01:17:21.840 --> 01:17:27.220
So, a bipartite state which has
sort of half of it in system a,

01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.700
half of it in system b.

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:42.320
We need those two
different systems--

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:49.230
it's a composite
system a plus b.

01:17:49.230 --> 01:18:13.140
And this state is entangled-- if
and only if you cannot find two

01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:25.496
states psi a and psi b,
such that the state can be

01:18:25.496 --> 01:18:25.995
factorized.

01:18:34.770 --> 01:18:37.950
We need a few examples
to fully comprehend

01:18:37.950 --> 01:18:43.030
this discussion-- what
systems a and b qualify.

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:46.940
What does it mean if there
does not exist any combination?

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.820
So, let me give you
some examples now,

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.060
and then I think we stop.

01:18:55.170 --> 01:19:02.750
If you have the 0, 0
state, photons in two mode,

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:09.360
we can factorize it-- and
this is not entangled.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:23.600
If you have a state which
is 0, 0 plus 1, 1-- well,

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:27.020
you cannot write it as a product
of one state times another

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:27.570
state.

01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:28.319
This is entangled.

01:19:34.530 --> 01:19:51.290
Well, if you take the following
state-- Is that entangled

01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:53.330
or not?

01:19:53.330 --> 01:19:57.970
I've written it as a
sum of four states,

01:19:57.970 --> 01:20:01.520
but if you just stare at
it for a split second,

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.590
you realize you can just write
it as a product of two states.

01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:11.430
It's just a product
of 0, 1 with 0, 1.

01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:14.160
So, a state is not entangled
if you can write it

01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:17.470
as a linear superposition
of those states.

01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:20.140
The definition of
entanglement is--

01:20:20.140 --> 01:20:22.220
if you try hard
and hard and hard,

01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:25.726
and there doesn't exist any
product state decomposition,

01:20:25.726 --> 01:20:26.600
then it is entangled.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:31.045
So, that was easy.

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:38.330
If you use a state like-- let
me just leave the 1, 1 out.

01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:47.530
What about this one?

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:01.700
Well, you can try as
hard as you want--

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:04.560
you will not find
the decomposition.

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.350
So eventually,
when I say you have

01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:09.230
to try hard to
find decomposition,

01:21:09.230 --> 01:21:11.440
maybe what we want
is we want to apply

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.970
some operator or some
procedure to this state,

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:15.870
and get the answer, yes-no.

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:18.795
This naturally asks for
question-- how in general can

01:21:18.795 --> 01:21:21.000
we measure if a state
is entangled or not?

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.920
But this is something
we'll discuss next week.

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:27.700
So let me just conclude
with the following.

01:21:27.700 --> 01:21:33.060
I'm focusing here and for pretty
much all of this cause when

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.195
we talk about entanglement,
about pure states.

01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:45.900
If you have decoherence--
if you have the transition

01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.890
from pure states to
density matrices--

01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:52.040
it gets much more involved
to talk about entanglement

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.740
and measure entanglement.

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:56.800
But at least the
basic definition

01:21:56.800 --> 01:22:00.040
can still be maintained
for statistical operators.

01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:02.920
If you describe the system--
the total system by one

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:07.730
statistical operator-- the
system is not entangled.

01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:10.600
If the statistical
operator can be broken up

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:14.160
into a direct tensor product
of statistical operator

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.260
for system a and system b.

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:18.690
Otherwise, the
system is entangled.

01:22:18.690 --> 01:22:21.960
So the basic definition
can be generalized

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:25.470
to density matrices,
but a lot of things

01:22:25.470 --> 01:22:28.410
become much, much more messy
if you don't have pure states.

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:35.460
Any last-minute questions?

01:22:35.460 --> 01:22:37.900
See you on Monday.

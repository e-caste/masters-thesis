00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.170
PROFESSOR: So today, we're going
to have the final presentations

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990
from the student projects.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.400
So they did a lot of hard work.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.164
Some of them are
still working upstairs

00:00:30.164 --> 00:00:32.485
and will come down just
in time for presentation.

00:00:32.485 --> 00:00:37.993
So just a few slides on format
and how the judging will

00:00:37.993 --> 00:00:41.580
happen-- so each team will
have 15 minutes during which

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.050
to tell about their
little project

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.900
and to give us a little demo.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.720
At least two PlayStation
3s will be set up

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.300
by the end of the class.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.940
One will have audio.

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.440
The other will have video and at
least two teams will use them.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.447
The others will
SSH in and show you

00:00:57.447 --> 00:00:59.280
their programs running
on the PlayStation 3s

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.150
that we have upstairs
on the network.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.740
One of the things that they'll
be graded on or scored on

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.490
is performance.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.140
Some of the things
we'll do after class

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.210
is performance profiling,
to try to understand

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.660
how much scalability
you were able to achieve

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.803
using parallel processor versus
two versus three, all the way

00:01:15.803 --> 00:01:18.270
up to six.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.980
So what we'll do is we'll
set up some time with the TAs

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.550
to do the profiling after class.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.960
And you can update your
source code up until 9:00 AM.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.490
So you'll show us how
to do the profiling

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.580
and then we can re-run that
at 9:00 AM Saturday morning

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.224
and give you updated scores
to change your grades

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:37.840
at the time of grades.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.000
There are six
scoring categories.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.277
Performance-- and this
first Performance category

00:01:44.277 --> 00:01:46.599
is essentially what your
performance metric is.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:48.140
You're going to
define it, hopefully,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.480
and then you'll tell
us how well you did.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.180
Project scope-- this is
essentially a measure,

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.620
because each of your different
projects were different.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.084
You picked your own projects.

00:01:57.084 --> 00:01:58.548
We'll try to get
an understanding

00:01:58.548 --> 00:02:01.070
for how much you tried to
cover and what you actually

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.340
did achieve.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.695
So we'll hopefully give
us a good idea of that.

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.669
Completeness-- how
robust is your code?

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:10.750
How much you actually
achieve relative

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.840
to what you wanted to do?

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.860
Are there data races?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.460
Is your code reproducible
with every run?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.994
Presentation and Demo-- so
we've decoupled it here,

00:02:19.994 --> 00:02:22.035
just because there are
different ways people will

00:02:22.035 --> 00:02:22.759
be doing a demo.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.050
So you can sort of earn points
in different categories.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.633
If you have a really
good presentation

00:02:26.633 --> 00:02:29.874
but you might not be flashy,
we'll take that into account.

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:31.790
And then, Performance
Scalability, which we'll

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.530
do off and on.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.700
So each one of these categories
score on a 10-point basis

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.310
from one to 10, 10
being really good,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.740
and for a total of 60 points.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.690
So for our judging
panel, unfortunately, we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.320
couldn't get virtual Saman
to really work, so Saman

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.064
is with us on the phone.

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:50.980
We have Michael Gordon
and Bill [? Theeves, ?]

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.800
two graduate students
in Saman's group.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.410
We have myself, Professor
Steve Ward from MIT,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.890
and Professor Weng
Fai Wong, who's

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.014
visiting from the National
University of Singapore,

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:02.810
doing a sabbatical year here.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.630
Student presentations
will dynamically

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.200
reorder based on who's
available and who's ready to go.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.740
This is a rough ordering
that was picked randomly.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.770
So [? Pumuk is ?] here.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.790
He'll go first.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.405
And then, I see Linear Algebra
Pack so they'll go after that.

00:03:15.405 --> 00:03:17.530
The Ray Tracing team is
still in my office working,

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.490
so we might have
to bump them down.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.430
Soft Radio Team is here?

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.100
Yep.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.764
Speech is here.

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:24.264
Backgammon?

00:03:24.264 --> 00:03:24.764
Yeah.

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:30.180
Those guys were ready
having breakfast at 9:00.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.220
The seventh team, Molecular
Dynamic Simulator--

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.190
unfortunately, they're not here.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.780
That team is not
physically in Boston,

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.250
so they'll present
tomorrow morning

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.180
but will not be considered as
competitors in the competition.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.582
There is a countdown clock.

00:03:46.582 --> 00:03:47.905
Bill is running his laptop.

00:03:47.905 --> 00:03:49.810
You can see it directly
in front of you.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.520
It'll start at 15
minutes and every minute,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.380
it'll tick down, 14, 13,
all the way down to zero.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.820
And you can go into
negative times,

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.001
but we'll start
subtracting points.

00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:06.690
So the more you run over, the
more points you start losing.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.190
So try to keep under
the time limit.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.550
What about questions?

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.300
If there are questions,
we can take those

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.258
after the presentation.

00:04:12.258 --> 00:04:15.914
If it's a short question--
yeah, let's leave all questions

00:04:15.914 --> 00:04:18.159
until after presentation
today, unless there's

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.950
something pressing.

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.769
I'll try to moderate.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.150
So if we're ready to
start, come up here.

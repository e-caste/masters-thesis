00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.310
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.340
In this section, we're
going to further investigate

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.280
the energy momentum for
vector, which we introduced

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.090
in the previous sections.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.200
But here, we focus on the zeroth
component, the first component

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.090
of this vector, where
we find mass in A

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.595
for particle A times
the proper velocity

00:00:28.595 --> 00:00:33.620
of the zeroth component is equal
to mA times c times 1 over 1

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.750
minus uA square
over c square, which

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.170
is the energy of this
particle A over c.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.470
Or in other words, the energy
is equal to the mass times c

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.880
square over 1 square root of
1 minus uA square c square.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.670
So let's discuss or look
at-- let's have a look

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.720
at this a little bit more.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.360
The first question we can ask--

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.600
how does this now look like
for particles which travel

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.220
with reasonably low velocity?

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.180
So uA-- much smaller than c.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.870
So we can Taylor expand
this following this equation

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.150
here, which we
discussed earlier.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.420
And we find that the energy
is equal to mA c square.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.950
That's the first
term, which we call

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.440
rest mass, the energy given--

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.485
just the rest mass by the
mass of the particle times c

00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:24.800
square, plus 1/2 mA c square
times uA square over c square.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.110
The c squares cancel.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.610
And we find what we know as the
kinetic energy, 1/2 m v square,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.090
or in this case,
1/2 mA uA square.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.360
That looks very familiar.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.230
So the energy of a particle
is given by its rest

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.735
mass plus its kinetic energy.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.340
All right, now investigating
this for vector,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.388
then we can ask, how does the
invariant interval look like?

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:54.180
How does this property,
which is invariant,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.670
and the Lorentz transformation
look like when we multiply

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.570
the vector with itself?

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.140
Here, we find minus E square
over c square plus the 3

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.280
momentum squared is equal
to minus m0 c square.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.090
Or in other words, we find this
energy momentum, energy mass

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.180
relation, energy
momentum mass relation,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.315
where the energy is given by
the momentum square times c

00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:21.370
square plus the rest mass
square times c to the 4th power.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.340
Again, we can unroll this
now and ask, how does this

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.210
look for a particle at rest?

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.380
And again, we find the
energy is equal to mc square.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.110
No surprise.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.690
That's how we started
the definition of this.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.700
In general, we can
find that the energy

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.105
is equal to a
relativistic mass times c

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:43.030
square, which is equal to the
rest mass times gamma times c

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.660
square.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.860
And that's equal to the rest
mass times c square plus k,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.960
the kinetic energy, square.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.340
All right, does
this definition--

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.580
I can tell you that this
confused me as a student

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.480
quite a bit.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.510
This understanding that
the mass becomes heavier

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.660
for a part of this-- really,
one I didn't quite like.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.310
I just like to think about the
fact that the kinetic energy--

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.700
there's a relativistic component
to the kinetic energy, which

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.920
is owned by the
particle in addition

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.840
to the rest mass of this
particle times c square.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.380
Also interesting to note is
that for particles at rest--

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.560
particles which are
massless, like a photon,

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.030
the energy is equal to
the momentum times c.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.150
If you want to know what
the energy is of a photon,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.400
you need to know
what the momentum is

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.180
of the photon multiplied by c.

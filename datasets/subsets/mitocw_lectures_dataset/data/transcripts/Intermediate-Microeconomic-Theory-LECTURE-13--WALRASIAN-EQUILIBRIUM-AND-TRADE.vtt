00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.450 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
OK, so let me say

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.360 align:middle line:84%
a couple of words about where
we are in the reading list.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.040 align:middle line:90%
We're going to start today.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.870 align:middle line:84%
We're done with the segment on
contracts and mechanism design,

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.070 align:middle line:90%
theory and applications.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.680 align:middle line:84%
And we start today, Walrasian
General Equilibrium,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.980 align:middle line:84%
which you've seen a
bit before already.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.010 align:middle line:84%
But we'll review and give
the proper definitions

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
for the first 20%
of the lecture.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.150 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest
of the lecture is

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.570 align:middle line:84%
devoted to an
important application

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.550 align:middle line:90%
of General Equilibrium theory.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.730 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, it
has to do with trade.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.150 align:middle line:84%
So this lecture
today is the theory,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.540 align:middle line:84%
with some really startling
and interesting propositions.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.850 align:middle line:84%
And then with
trade on our minds,

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.460 align:middle line:84%
we'll go back to the Thai
data, and take a look

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.490 align:middle line:84%
at trade flows and
financial flows that

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.620 align:middle line:84%
have changed over time
as the country became

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.370 align:middle line:84%
more liberalized, or
more open internally.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.080 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go to
a parallel lecture on the US

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
that's going to look at
trade flows and potentially

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.320 align:middle line:84%
financial flows across
states in the US,

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.860 align:middle line:84%
where we'll be analyzing
the impact of tariffs,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.690 align:middle line:90%
and/or China shocks--

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.190 align:middle line:90%
China imports.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.470 align:middle line:84%
So these, dare I say it, it
may or may not be on your mind.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.710 align:middle line:84%
If it's on your mind
already, the motivation

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.870 align:middle line:84%
here is a US policy decision
which is very much in the news,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.440 align:middle line:84%
and in some respects, a big
part of the upcoming election.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.800 align:middle line:84%
So I don't know if the timing of
these lectures are good or bad.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.620 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we'll be talking
about US trade policy

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.730 align:middle line:90%
within two lectures.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.520 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's coming up.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And today's lecture has got
two start readings, the Kreps

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.040 align:middle line:84%
book on section 6.1, and
this Mas-Colell, Whinston,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.540 align:middle line:90%
and Green.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.460 align:middle line:90%
I rarely assign this book.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.320 align:middle line:84%
But on the other
hand, the lecture

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.770 align:middle line:84%
is based very closely
on that chapter.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.110 align:middle line:84%
So I went ahead and just
listed it, MWG chapter 15 D,

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.660 align:middle line:84%
although it's quite
a famous model.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.670 align:middle line:84%
We've been using MWG in
the theorems and so on.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:84%
But I've never really
featured it so heavily.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.840 align:middle line:90%
In terms of the overall--

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.450 align:middle line:84%
just to see it in one
spot, again, we're

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.600 align:middle line:84%
going to do Walrasian
equilibrium, and then

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.080 align:middle line:84%
two applications of trade
in Thailand and the US.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.060 align:middle line:84%
That's actually
going to complete--

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.360 align:middle line:84%
lecture 15 completes the
current segment of lectures

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.560 align:middle line:90%
before the second exam.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.510 align:middle line:84%
So problem set 4, which was
released last-- the last thing

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.210 align:middle line:84%
I want to do before
getting to the lecture

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.440 align:middle line:84%
is to review a bit of
what we did last time.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.890 align:middle line:84%
I deliberately didn't pick
out very many questions here.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.590 align:middle line:84%
Allow risk aversion on
the part of the borrower.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.200 align:middle line:84%
There are several
advantages to writing down

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.450 align:middle line:90%
programs in lotteries.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.280 align:middle line:90%
List two of them and explain.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.020 align:middle line:90%
So let's see if I can get some--

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.930 align:middle line:84%
Charles, do you want to
take a crack at that?

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.570 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think I can guess
one, definitely at least one

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.620 align:middle line:84%
of them, which, if I
remember correctly,

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.600 align:middle line:84%
is that it allows you
to make an incentive.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.040 align:middle line:84%
You may select between
people with high income

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.650 align:middle line:84%
and low income, if you don't
know the income already.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.060 align:middle line:84%
So like, if you're risk
averse in the correct manner,

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.600 align:middle line:84%
then if you have a lottery,
then someone with low income

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.900 align:middle line:84%
might prefer a lottery with
something like-- you might

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:58.850 align:middle line:84%
prefer the different risk return
trade off at different incomes.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.520 align:middle line:84%
There's a dislike
between various things,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.010 align:middle line:84%
and help with some
of the constraints.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.690 align:middle line:84%
The other one, I don't
remember the exact details.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.020 align:middle line:90%
I haven't quite got them yet.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.750 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The
first one is good.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:23.480 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I'm going to
guess something like,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.592 align:middle line:84%
maybe making people not
as willing to borrow

00:04:26.592 --> 00:04:27.550 align:middle line:90%
or something like that.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.930 align:middle line:90%
But I'm not exactly sure.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.410 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Let's see.

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.620 align:middle line:84%
Kerry, can you get
one more of them?

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.410 align:middle line:90%


00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.990 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it, like,
incentive constraints

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.750 align:middle line:90%
could be non-convex.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.960 align:middle line:90%
So it might be hard to solve.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.550 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, good.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.210 align:middle line:84%
So there's various
sources of non-convexity.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.020 align:middle line:84%
So those incentive
constraints, when

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.990 align:middle line:84%
written without the lotteries,
like first order conditions

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
of the borrower's
choice of effort.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.390 align:middle line:84%
Those things can lead
to non-convexity.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.790 align:middle line:84%
So by doing it in lotteries,
we get that problem solved.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:15.840 align:middle line:84%
And also, if there is
some indivisibilities,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:16.990 align:middle line:90%
that would be solved.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.650 align:middle line:84%
There are two indivisibilities
in this problem.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.580 align:middle line:84%
One has to do with
occupation choice.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.040 align:middle line:84%
You're either a wage
earner or an entrepreneur.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.170 align:middle line:90%
That's a binary choice.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.890 align:middle line:84%
So the lotteries kind
of smooth that over

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:36.460 align:middle line:84%
because you can effectively
choose the probability.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.470 align:middle line:84%
And secondly, there could
be individual abilities

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.660 align:middle line:84%
in the discreteness
of the capital grid.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.820 align:middle line:84%
Like, you're going to capitalize
a high amount or a low amount.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And again, lotteries help
with that indivisibility.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:06:00.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so the next one is really
a summary of what we did.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.760 align:middle line:90%
But let me read it out.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.210 align:middle line:84%
Sketch out how one can take
the model with the lotteries

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.110 align:middle line:84%
to the data on
occupation choice,

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.390 align:middle line:90%
and estimate parameters.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:16.150 align:middle line:84%
So can anyone attempt a
summary of what we did

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.310 align:middle line:90%
last time on that dimension?

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:28.375 align:middle line:90%


00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:28.875 align:middle line:90%
Pablo?

00:06:28.875 --> 00:06:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.630 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Sure, I can
take a stab at this.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:38.150 align:middle line:84%
So I think the way
that we did it was we--

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:84%
given these different parameters
that we had, of ability,

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:46.400 align:middle line:84%
education, and wealth, we solved
for this optimal contract,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:90%
theoretically.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.260 align:middle line:84%
And then we made a
likelihood function to--

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.200 align:middle line:84%
given these solutions,
to see which one of these

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.130 align:middle line:84%
is like going to be like
the best, essentially.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:01.658 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Do you remember
how we did, quote, "the best?"

00:07:01.658 --> 00:07:04.250 align:middle line:90%
The best in terms of what?

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.800 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Just kind of, like,
the likelihood function,

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.850 align:middle line:90%
trying to maximize that.

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.740 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, OK.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so the likelihood
function tells us

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.940 align:middle line:84%
the probability of what
we are seeing in the data

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.190 align:middle line:90%
if the model were true.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:26.180 align:middle line:84%
So we're choosing parameters
to make that probability

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.440 align:middle line:90%
as high as possible.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.390 align:middle line:90%


00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.840 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's good.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.220 align:middle line:84%
Any other questions
about that lecture?

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.020 align:middle line:84%
All the other questions
at the beginning

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.800 align:middle line:84%
here were basically, write
it down the way we did it

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.480 align:middle line:90%
in class, et cetera, et cetera.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.920 align:middle line:84%
So it's not exactly
conducive to asking you

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.180 align:middle line:90%
these questions in class.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.010 align:middle line:84%
But it is important to
be reviewing these review

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.720 align:middle line:90%
questions.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.000 align:middle line:84%
All right, so then we
come to the lecture today.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.860 align:middle line:84%
This is Walrasian equilibria
with an application to trade.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.890 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to consider
trade, for the most part,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.990 align:middle line:90%
in a small open economy.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.900 align:middle line:84%
Although we'll say a little bit
about putting the world pieces

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.070 align:middle line:90%
together at the very end.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So here's the notation,
which is largely

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.900 align:middle line:84%
a review because you have
seen almost all of it before.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.170 align:middle line:84%
When we write down an economy,
we mean the commodity space,

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.470 align:middle line:84%
in this case, capital L, a
finite number of commodities.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.690 align:middle line:90%
I is the number of consumers.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:36.460 align:middle line:90%
J is the number of firms--

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:37.840 align:middle line:90%
finite for each.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.679 align:middle line:84%
Household or consumer,
I, has a consumption set.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:46.060 align:middle line:84%
And preferences over bundles
in the consumption set, as for,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:48.850 align:middle line:84%
example, represented
by a utility function.

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.480 align:middle line:84%
Each firm, J, has a technology
production possibility

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:55.280 align:middle line:84%
set in the same L
dimensional space.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:59.530 align:middle line:84%
And the economy has
exogenously given endowments,

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.770 align:middle line:84%
according to this L
dimensional endowment vector,

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:06.060 align:middle line:84%
with the bars being
the aggregates.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:08.490 align:middle line:90%
So that's the economy.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.580 align:middle line:84%
Now, in, say, a private
ownership economy, we

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
have to specify, in
addition, who owns what.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.070 align:middle line:84%
So we imagine that consumer
I has an endowment vector, L

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.790 align:middle line:84%
dimensional, subscript
I, for consumer, I.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.090 align:middle line:84%
And it is the sum of
these endowments over all

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.840 align:middle line:84%
the household that adds
up to the omega bar L

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.720 align:middle line:84%
dimensional endowment vector
on the previous slide.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Aggregates naturally come from
the individual's ownership.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.100 align:middle line:84%
Each consumer, in addition
to having endowments,

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.650 align:middle line:84%
has some share of
the profits of firms.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:49.860 align:middle line:84%
So theta, IJ, being the
share that household, I, has,

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.390 align:middle line:90%
of J's profits.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.670 align:middle line:84%
So these are meant to be
a division of the profit.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.620 align:middle line:84%
So the sum of the shares
over households, I,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.290 align:middle line:84%
for a given firm,
J, add up to 1.

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.970 align:middle line:90%
Everything gets distributed.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.800 align:middle line:84%
And household I is getting theta
IJ of pi J, for firm, J. Now,

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.630 align:middle line:84%
pi J is obviously an
endogenous object.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:14.160 align:middle line:84%
It could be 0 if there were
constant returns to scale.

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.370 align:middle line:84%
It could be positive if
there are diminishing returns

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.120 align:middle line:90%
to scale.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.010 align:middle line:84%
And also, when we did risk and
return in village economies,

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.940 align:middle line:84%
we kind of naturally had
an interesting and relevant

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.900 align:middle line:84%
special case that household
I gets all the profits

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.390 align:middle line:84%
from the activities
that it undertakes.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.330 align:middle line:84%
In that case, there was a
household, I, and a firm,

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.790 align:middle line:90%
I. It was the same entity.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And household I was
getting theta IJ

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
equal to 1 of its own
profits, as a special case.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:48.840 align:middle line:84%
But general equilibrium
theory usually

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.700 align:middle line:90%
allows something more general.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.520 align:middle line:84%
And you could think of
this literally as a market

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.850 align:middle line:84%
economy, where the shares are
equity shares being traded.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.640 align:middle line:84%
And all of the
dividends are claimed

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.380 align:middle line:90%
by the ownership of shares.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.380 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a private
ownership economy

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.900 align:middle line:84%
has a summary of
the consumption,

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.210 align:middle line:84%
set preferences,
endowments of consumer

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.960 align:middle line:84%
I, the production sets of
all the house firms, J,

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.060 align:middle line:90%
and the shares, theta IJ.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.080 align:middle line:84%
Now we get to the
big definition here.

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.050 align:middle line:84%
In this L dimensional
commodity space,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:26.790 align:middle line:84%
a price vector, p, is the price
of all the commodities, inputs,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.320 align:middle line:90%
and outputs, and everything.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.920 align:middle line:84%
And a Walrasian equilibrium,
or competitive equilibrium

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.950 align:middle line:84%
for short, for this
private ownership economy,

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is a specification of
allocations with stars on them,

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.900 align:middle line:84%
x and y star, for
consumers and firms--

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:49.020 align:middle line:84%
and a price vector star here
because it's a special price.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:52.200 align:middle line:84%
Allocations and prices have
the special properties.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.890 align:middle line:84%
Each firm, J, has y
star J as the maximum

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.550 align:middle line:84%
of the firm's problem, which
is to maximize profits.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.660 align:middle line:84%
Hence, at y star, the valuation
of outputs less inputs

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
is weakly greater than it
would be for any other choice

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.370 align:middle line:90%
of production vector.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.390 align:middle line:84%
Each consumer, i, is maximizing
relative to the preference

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:16.410 align:middle line:84%
ordering on bundles in the
consumption set, but also

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:17.910 align:middle line:84%
subject to the
budget constraint,

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:21.720 align:middle line:84%
that expenditures at price
p star, for any xi that

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.760 align:middle line:90%
could potentially be chosen--

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.010 align:middle line:84%
cannot exceed the
right hand side,

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:28.920 align:middle line:84%
which is the private
ownership part.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.490 align:middle line:84%
So omega i, being the
endowments of consumer,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.870 align:middle line:84%
i, evaluated at price p star,
that dot is inner product.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:42.060 align:middle line:84%
And again, household i's claim
on the profits of firm, J.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.610 align:middle line:84%
And the final property
is that the allocation

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:45.495 align:middle line:90%
has to be feasible.

00:12:45.495 --> 00:12:49.800 align:middle line:84%
And you can just read this as
demand cannot exceed supply,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.500 align:middle line:84%
where supply includes both
the aggregated endowment

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.540 align:middle line:90%
and production.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.590 align:middle line:84%
So we worked a lot with
feasibility before.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:13:00.710 align:middle line:84%
We did that when we
defined Pareto optimality.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:02.930 align:middle line:84%
The difference here
in general equilibrium

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.150 align:middle line:84%
or Walrasian
equilibrium is we've

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:08.690 align:middle line:84%
added this price vector
explicitly, and rewritten

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:11.270 align:middle line:84%
consumer maximization
problem, on which we've

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:12.410 align:middle line:90%
had several lectures.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.990 align:middle line:84%
And firms-- sorry, I
reversed the order--

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.050 align:middle line:84%
firms max and
consumers max problems.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.906 align:middle line:90%
So everything's in one spot.

00:13:22.906 --> 00:13:27.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so a classic example
is the Edgeworth Box.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.740 align:middle line:84%
We previously defined
Pareto optimal allocations

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.250 align:middle line:84%
in this box, as
characterized by tangencies

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.720 align:middle line:90%
of indifference curves.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.420 align:middle line:84%
Here we add one more
ingredient, that if they

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.230 align:middle line:84%
start with this endowment,
and we draw a price line

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.790 align:middle line:84%
through the endowment, then
each consumer is maximizing

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.680 align:middle line:90%
utility, subject to its budget.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:56.550 align:middle line:84%
So consumer 1 here has the
normal-looking budget line.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:14:01.130 align:middle line:84%
And coming from the endowment
and the tangency at x star

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:02.480 align:middle line:90%
would be the maximum.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:06.500 align:middle line:84%
You may remember consumer
2 up here on the northeast

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.920 align:middle line:84%
is moving to the southwest in
terms of increased utility,

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.590 align:middle line:84%
and is also maximizing
utility, which

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:15.780 align:middle line:84%
is achieved by a tangency on
that consumer's budget line.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.560 align:middle line:84%
So this line here is
doing double duty.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a budget line
for each household.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.010 align:middle line:84%
But the perspective is
at or below consumer 1,

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:28.520 align:middle line:84%
at or above the
line for consumer 2.

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.850 align:middle line:84%
And here you're seeing the
star allocations, which

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:34.010 align:middle line:90%
are a competitive equilibrium.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.700 align:middle line:84%
Everything in the box adds up to
the aggregates by construction.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.170 align:middle line:90%
There is no production.

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.360 align:middle line:90%
They're all maximizing utility.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.680 align:middle line:84%
And the price vector is
characterized by the slope

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.300 align:middle line:90%
of this budget line.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, we could go on with
a lot more interesting,

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.710 align:middle line:84%
and some nonstandard pictures,
of the Edgeworth Box.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.160 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to save a lot
of that for another lecture.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.740 align:middle line:84%
Here, I defined
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:04.670 align:middle line:84%
I wanted to find something
similar but not identical.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:08.030 align:middle line:84%
It's a price equilibrium
with transfers.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.060 align:middle line:84%
So here, the idea is
that the right hand

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.030 align:middle line:90%
side is a wealth assignment.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.730 align:middle line:84%
Household, i, has
wealth, w sub i.

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:18.903 align:middle line:90%
So the rest is similar.

00:15:18.903 --> 00:15:20.820 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have an
allocation with stars--

00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.840 align:middle line:84%
a price vector, p, which
should have had stars on it

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.550 align:middle line:90%
because it's a special one--

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.490 align:middle line:84%
with the property,
and an assignment

00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.340 align:middle line:84%
of these wealth levels, such
that firms maximize profits.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.800 align:middle line:90%
That's the same as before.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.150 align:middle line:90%
Households maximize utility.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:middle line:84%
But the right hand side of the
budget is this wealth object.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, when we did partial
equilibrium consumer problem,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:45.500 align:middle line:84%
we talked about
prices and wealth.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
We had income expansion
paths as wealth varied.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.080 align:middle line:84%
So this formulation
of the problem

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.700 align:middle line:90%
is consistent with that.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.680 align:middle line:84%
Although in partial
equilibrium, we

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.170 align:middle line:84%
didn't ask where that
wealth was coming from.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:58.880 align:middle line:90%
An allocation is feasible.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Again, demand cannot be greater
than the two sources of supply.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.260 align:middle line:84%
Now the wealth assignments
have to be feasible.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.270 align:middle line:84%
And here's where we
can say something

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:09.920 align:middle line:84%
about where wealth
is coming from,

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.710 align:middle line:84%
namely, the sum of the
wealths, whatever they are,

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.690 align:middle line:84%
have to equal the valuation of
the aggregated endowment vector

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:21.425 align:middle line:84%
plus the profits
of all the firms.

00:16:21.425 --> 00:16:23.300 align:middle line:84%
So somehow, this stuff
on the right hand side

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:26.630 align:middle line:84%
gets distributed across the
households, each household, i,

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.400 align:middle line:90%
getting wealth, wi.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.800 align:middle line:84%
And when we add it
up, therefore, it

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.360 align:middle line:90%
sums up to the right hand side.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.970 align:middle line:84%
Now note that at the bottom
here, a particular wealth

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.780 align:middle line:84%
assignment that works is what
we had on the previous slide,

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:46.370 align:middle line:84%
namely, give household, i, the
valuation of its endowment,

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.280 align:middle line:84%
plus its share of the profits
of the firms that it owns.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.680 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, a price
equilibrium with transfers

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.240 align:middle line:84%
is more general, but includes
the valuation equilibrium.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:03.740 align:middle line:84%
That said, the word
transfers may catch your eye.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.609 align:middle line:84%
And the idea here is that
a Walrasian equilibrium

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.730 align:middle line:84%
with ownership specifies
one level of wealth.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.609 align:middle line:84%
But we could, in principle,
redistribute that wealth

00:17:13.609 --> 00:17:15.800 align:middle line:84%
by the government
with lump sum taxes

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.720 align:middle line:84%
and transfers, and then look
for a new priced equilibrium.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.089 align:middle line:84%
And we will-- I think it's
on the next slide, yeah.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.760 align:middle line:84%
We will get to why
we're doing this.

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.560 align:middle line:84%
Namely, any Walrasian
equilibrium is Pareto-optimal.

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:34.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's also true that any
Pareto-optimal allocation

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.160 align:middle line:84%
can be supported as
a price equilibrium

00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.040 align:middle line:84%
with transfers, as
in this definition.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.010 align:middle line:84%
However, to achieve the
fact that any optimum can

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.980 align:middle line:84%
be supported, it's
kind of intuitive.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.570 align:middle line:84%
We may have to
redistribute wealth.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:53.110 align:middle line:84%
And again, I have a series
of lectures on this.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.780 align:middle line:84%
But if we're back in
the Edgeworth Box,

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:57.850 align:middle line:84%
the competitive
equilibrium has picked

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:01.480 align:middle line:84%
out one particular
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.530 align:middle line:84%
But as there are many
optimal allocations--

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.300 align:middle line:84%
and to get to those,
we're going to have

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.600 align:middle line:84%
to move this budget
line up or down, hence,

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.815 align:middle line:90%
redistributing the wealth.

00:18:11.815 --> 00:18:14.550 align:middle line:90%


00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.510 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now that we've got
the concept of the Walrasian

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.000 align:middle line:84%
equilibrium in hand,
I want to focus

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.600 align:middle line:84%
on the primary application
today, which is production

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.000 align:middle line:90%
in a small open economy.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to shift gears
just a little bit.

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:32.250 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely going to
be general equilibrium.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.290 align:middle line:90%
We're going to have J firms.

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.660 align:middle line:90%
And firms are producing goods.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.140 align:middle line:84%
So they're J goods
because we have J firms.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.450 align:middle line:90%
Firm J produces good, qJ.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.910 align:middle line:84%
And there are L
factors of production,

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:49.080 align:middle line:84%
labeled, in this
case, Z. So Z1J is

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.500 align:middle line:84%
the input of the first
factor by firm, J, and so on.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.450 align:middle line:84%
And each firm, J, has a strictly
concave production function,

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:02.520 align:middle line:84%
indicated here by f sub J.
Output of consumer good, qJ,

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.700 align:middle line:84%
is a function of the
input vector, ZJ.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.520 align:middle line:90%
So now we specify endowments.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.320 align:middle line:84%
The endowments are going to
be given of the factor inputs.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.060 align:middle line:90%
They're owned by households.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.670 align:middle line:84%
And for the sake of
argument, let's say they're

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:19.110 align:middle line:90%
supplied in-elastically.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.340 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
going to be consumed.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.290 align:middle line:84%
What we're going to try to
do is find the factor prices

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:27.630 align:middle line:84%
that's consistent
with an equilibrium

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.980 align:middle line:90%
within this small open economy.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.150 align:middle line:84%
However, we're going to take the
prices of the goods as fixed.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:36.660 align:middle line:84%
So in that sense, it's
still partial equilibrium.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
Think of it as a village,
as a small open economy

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.420 align:middle line:84%
or a country, that
is small relative

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:47.190 align:middle line:84%
to the rest of the world so that
these price vectors are fixed.

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:49.860 align:middle line:84%
They're not going to be
the focus of our attention.

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.800 align:middle line:84%
We are going to,
however, try to find

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.400 align:middle line:84%
the allocation of the inputs
across all the firms, how

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.610 align:middle line:84%
those endowments of
factors get used,

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:03.390 align:middle line:84%
as well as the Walrasian
equilibrium price vector.

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So firm j producing good qj
will maximize the difference

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.580 align:middle line:90%
between revenues and costs.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:17.010 align:middle line:84%
So if w star, say, is a
candidate equilibrium price

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:21.720 align:middle line:84%
vector, the firm would
choose its input vectors, Zj,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:27.180 align:middle line:84%
to maximize revenue minus costs
at that guessed equilibrium

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.610 align:middle line:90%
price vector, w star.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:34.650 align:middle line:84%
p is, again, a given-- pj,
the price of quantity, j,

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:38.250 align:middle line:90%
is externally specified.

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:44.620 align:middle line:84%
So Z star j is the solution to
firm j's maximization problem.

00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we're finding
an equilibrium,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.530 align:middle line:84%
each firm will be
maximizing profits

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.290 align:middle line:84%
and the sum of
the input demands,

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:56.610 align:middle line:84%
in this case, the demand for
the L-th input from firm,

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.670 align:middle line:84%
j, summing over all the
firms j, and in particular

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.940 align:middle line:84%
the stars, which are
already profit-maximizing,

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.980 align:middle line:84%
add up to the economy's
endowment of the factor, Z bar,

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
for the L-th factor.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:12.630 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for all,
each and every, factor,

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:16.800 align:middle line:84%
L. This one is true for
each and every firm, j.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.610 align:middle line:84%
So this is what we're looking
for, the Walrasian equilibrium

00:21:20.610 --> 00:21:24.870 align:middle line:84%
in the factor markets, taking
external prices as given.

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:28.560 align:middle line:84%
All right, you already know
something about the solutions

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:31.140 align:middle line:84%
to the profit
maximization problem.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:34.620 align:middle line:84%
Namely, the value of
the marginal product

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.920 align:middle line:84%
should be equal to--
of the L factor,

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:39.900 align:middle line:90%
should be equal to its cost.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.800 align:middle line:84%
Just differentiate this
thing on the previous slide.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.700 align:middle line:84%
With respect to zj, you'll get
a derivative in the F function,

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:52.830 align:middle line:84%
and will get the factor
input price on the cost side.

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.910 align:middle line:90%
That's what this says.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.450 align:middle line:84%
Factor input price--
here's the derivative of F,

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.100 align:middle line:90%
with respect to the L factor.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:03.540 align:middle line:84%
And that p is, of course, part
of the exogenously-given price

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.530 align:middle line:90%
vector.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.990 align:middle line:84%
How many equations
are there like this?

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.070 align:middle line:90%
Well, we have to specify here.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:12.870 align:middle line:90%
It's the L factor.

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.150 align:middle line:90%
And we have L--

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:17.520 align:middle line:90%
capital L factors all together.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.130 align:middle line:90%
And this is for the j firm.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:23.680 align:middle line:90%
But we have capital J firms.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:28.620 align:middle line:84%
So we have L times
J equations here.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:30.480 align:middle line:84%
And we have another
set of equations

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.930 align:middle line:84%
which are the equilibrium,
that the demand for the factors

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.370 align:middle line:90%
adds up to the total.

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.710 align:middle line:84%
But again, this is true for
each and every L-th factor.

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:40.810 align:middle line:90%
So there are L of these guys.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.490 align:middle line:84%
So we have L times
J equations here.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:47.650 align:middle line:90%
And we have L equations here.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:50.850 align:middle line:84%
So the number of equations
is equal to the number

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:52.240 align:middle line:90%
of variables.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.330 align:middle line:84%
So in principle, we
should be able to solve

00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.420 align:middle line:84%
this system of equations to
determine the equilibrium

00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:58.890 align:middle line:90%
factor prices.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:01.100 align:middle line:84%
It's tedious and
boring to keep counting

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.100 align:middle line:90%
the number of variables.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.720 align:middle line:84%
But it is actually useful to
see if we have fully specified,

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.340 align:middle line:84%
and we potentially
have a solution.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:13.080 align:middle line:84%
So now, we've already
solved in lecture 4,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.020 align:middle line:84%
which was about production,
a cost minimization problem.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.030 align:middle line:84%
So we defined there
the cost for firm J

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
of producing the quantity, qj,
when the input vector was w.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I must say, even I
went back this morning

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.540 align:middle line:84%
in reviewing this lecture to
take a look at the earlier

00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:34.590 align:middle line:90%
lecture.

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.280 align:middle line:84%
Today there's kind of an uneasy
tension because I'm partially

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.580 align:middle line:84%
telling you things that you've
had before, on the other hand,

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:46.020 align:middle line:84%
aware that you may not remember
exactly what we had before.

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:48.630 align:middle line:84%
If you go back and look,
it'll all come back to you.

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.820 align:middle line:84%
And some of these
slides are actually

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.820 align:middle line:84%
repeats of what
was in lecture 4.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.540 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, when we
derived the least cost

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.660 align:middle line:84%
way of producing
an output, qj, we

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.330 align:middle line:84%
got that marginal cost
was equal to price.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:04.830 align:middle line:90%
It's equal.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.660 align:middle line:84%
Marginal cost is from your very
first economics micro course,

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:10.560 align:middle line:90%
probably.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, this second
equation is the equation

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:17.970 align:middle line:84%
that the demands for the
factors adds up to the total.

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.800 align:middle line:84%
But it's written
in an interesting

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.990 align:middle line:90%
and a bit unconventional way.

00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:26.970 align:middle line:84%
The aggregate amount of factor
l that's available is z bar l.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And we want the demands of
these firms for producing.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:33.780 align:middle line:84%
But instead, we use
the Shephard's lemma,

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.050 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of
the cost of firm j,

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:40.560 align:middle line:84%
with respect to the
price of the l-th factor,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:45.820 align:middle line:84%
we derived as the amount of
the l-th factor to be used.

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, you may or may
not remember that that's

00:24:48.510 --> 00:24:50.610 align:middle line:90%
the Shephard's lemma.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:53.770 align:middle line:84%
Here it is, written
down here at the bottom.

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:57.660 align:middle line:84%
So we just substitute
what was written as zlj,

00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:02.700 align:middle line:84%
summation over j equal to z
bar, we substitute in the result

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.550 align:middle line:84%
from Shephard's lemma
to get this equation

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.670 align:middle line:90%
OK, special case, 2 by 2.

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And there'll be another
two coming later.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.760 align:middle line:84%
But for now, two types
of firms, J equals 1, 2--

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.230 align:middle line:90%
two inputs.

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:23.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's useful to think of
the inputs as labor and capital.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:26.040 align:middle line:84%
And that, in fact, will
anticipate the trade

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.185 align:middle line:90%
applications.

00:25:27.185 --> 00:25:28.810 align:middle line:84%
Are we reproducing
goods with machines?

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:31.440 align:middle line:84%
Are we producing
goods with labor?

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.740 align:middle line:84%
What happens to the
labor when we have

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:36.720 align:middle line:90%
a decline in manufacturing?

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:38.610 align:middle line:84%
It comes from
having more inputs.

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:41.640 align:middle line:84%
So these are the kind of
ingredients, labor and capital

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.320 align:middle line:84%
being kind of obvious labels
for us, in the case of this two

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:47.730 align:middle line:90%
factor model.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Production functions,
just to write out

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.060 align:middle line:84%
the notation, production
function for good 1, as it

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:58.260 align:middle line:84%
inputs, the second
subscript denotes the firm,

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.650 align:middle line:90%
the first one, the input.

00:25:59.650 --> 00:26:02.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is the first
input in firm 1,

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.635 align:middle line:90%
the second input in firm 1.

00:26:04.635 --> 00:26:07.860 align:middle line:84%
f2 is output of
firm 2 as a function

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:10.050 align:middle line:84%
of the first input
in for firm 2,

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:90%
and the second input for firm 2.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.460 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
assume, in this special 2

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.400 align:middle line:84%
by 2 model, that these
production functions, each

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:20.260 align:middle line:84%
of them, are constant
returns to scale.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.980 align:middle line:90%
So it's homogeneity of degree 1.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:26.370 align:middle line:84%
So if we're given a
vector of input prices

00:26:26.370 --> 00:26:29.670 align:middle line:84%
for capital and
labor, we can define

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:34.320 align:middle line:84%
the cost of producing
one unit of good, j.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.010 align:middle line:90%
This is called the unit cost--

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:42.630 align:middle line:84%
or you may want to review that
the cost of producing arbitrary

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:45.420 align:middle line:84%
levels just scales
up or down depending

00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:48.120 align:middle line:84%
on whether that
other target level is

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.400 align:middle line:90%
higher or lower than 1.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.910 align:middle line:84%
So once we have the cost
of producing one unit,

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.330 align:middle line:84%
we can get the cost of
producing any number of units.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.840 align:middle line:84%
And what inputs solve
that minimum cost problem?

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.940 align:middle line:90%
They're denoted with a's.

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:07.890 align:middle line:84%
So for firm j, a1j
and a2j are the way

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.600 align:middle line:84%
to achieve the least cost
when the input vector is w.

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.190 align:middle line:84%
Input price vector
is w So here I

00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:20.350 align:middle line:84%
belabor a little bit
what you've seen before.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.540 align:middle line:90%
It's constant returns to scale.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.180 align:middle line:90%
So the cost function is linear.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:27.630 align:middle line:84%
Constant returns to scale
is this linear production

00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:29.220 align:middle line:90%
possibilities frontier.

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:30.730 align:middle line:90%
Cost function is linear.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:32.790 align:middle line:84%
Marginal cost
equals average cost.

00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:35.070 align:middle line:84%
If price of a good,
say good j, is

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.560 align:middle line:84%
less than marginal and average
cost, nothing gets produced.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.940 align:middle line:84%
And when price is equal to
marginal and average cost,

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.620 align:middle line:84%
then they're happy
to produce anything.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:44.850 align:middle line:90%
Although profits are 0.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:48.930 align:middle line:84%
And price cannot be higher
because they would go bananas.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:52.170 align:middle line:84%
And then the assertion, which
I've already said twice,

00:27:52.170 --> 00:27:53.850 align:middle line:90%
profits must be zero.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And that's just, again, a
review slide from before.

00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:90%
So price equals cost.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.050 align:middle line:90%
This is the unit cost.

00:28:01.050 --> 00:28:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Price is the price of a unit.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.030 align:middle line:90%
So we have cost equal to prices.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.880 align:middle line:90%
OK, so another review.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.500 align:middle line:90%
We did this before, too.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.450 align:middle line:84%
What's special about
constant returns

00:28:12.450 --> 00:28:17.620 align:middle line:84%
to scale is we can solve
the problem for the one

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:20.590 align:middle line:84%
unit of output,
minimize the cost

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.110 align:middle line:90%
of achieving one unit of output.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.790 align:middle line:90%
And that's going to give us--

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I guess I just
said this, the cost

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.490 align:middle line:84%
for any other level of output,
just by scaling up and down

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:31.420 align:middle line:90%
the solution.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And the ratios of input
use will not be changing.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.440 align:middle line:84%
I think in the previous
lecture, I actually

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.110 align:middle line:84%
said I wasn't terribly
pleased with how

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:42.700 align:middle line:90%
cryptically-worded it was.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.850 align:middle line:84%
And I gave you as an
informal homework assignment

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:50.770 align:middle line:84%
to do a proof by contradiction
to prove that the input use

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.590 align:middle line:84%
ratio is going to
be entirely dictated

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:57.790 align:middle line:84%
by the input prices,
regardless of the scale.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:01.150 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, this input
ratio will remain constant.

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, please, I apologize
because I'm throwing at you

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.580 align:middle line:90%
things from a previous lecture.

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:07.570 align:middle line:90%
It was lecture 4.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.370 align:middle line:90%
So that was some time ago.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.870 align:middle line:84%
But I don't want
to belabor it today

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.740 align:middle line:84%
or we won't get
to something new.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So for now, we'll just
accept this as a fact.

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.600 align:middle line:84%
Then we come to a key definition
about factor intensity.

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.180 align:middle line:84%
Say good 1 is more intensive
in factor 1 than good 2.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.940 align:middle line:84%
Then the production of
good 2, if naturally,

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:33.340 align:middle line:84%
firm producing good 1 uses
relatively more of input 1--

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:37.600 align:middle line:84%
input 1 relative to input
2, then does firm 2.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.200 align:middle line:84%
So the definition, to say
good 1 is relatively more

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.950 align:middle line:84%
intensive than factor 1, means
that the ratio of factor 1

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:49.150 align:middle line:84%
to factor 2 in firm 1 is
higher than it is in firm 2.

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So it's a pretty
natural definition.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.620 align:middle line:90%
Of course, it can move around.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.080 align:middle line:84%
But the inequality
remains the same.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:57.880 align:middle line:90%
It's intense.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.510 align:middle line:84%
No matter what the
input price ratio is,

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:04.960 align:middle line:84%
the optimizing choice
of inputs will always

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:09.610 align:middle line:84%
satisfy this inequality when
comparing firm 1 to firm 2.

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:13.840 align:middle line:84%
So now something a bit new
that was not in lecture 4,

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.340 align:middle line:90%
although it's not hard.

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to plot the cost of
producing one unit of a good.

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:23.770 align:middle line:84%
We're going to plot that
cost curve as a function

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.670 align:middle line:90%
of the input prices, w1 and w2.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So in particular, if, say,
for a given w1 and w2 bar,

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.650 align:middle line:84%
your assertion is we're
on this cost curve,

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:41.560 align:middle line:84%
then if we increase the price
of the first input to w prime 1

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.050 align:middle line:84%
and we're supposed
to be on an isocost,

00:30:44.050 --> 00:30:46.480 align:middle line:84%
meaning same cost
curve, the increase

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.000 align:middle line:84%
in the first factor price would
mean the cost would be higher.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.530 align:middle line:84%
So we have to lower the
price of the second factor

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:55.310 align:middle line:90%
in order to compensate.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.960 align:middle line:84%
So that on net, after
we make this move,

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:02.780 align:middle line:84%
total costs are the same
because it is the isocost curve.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:07.090 align:middle line:84%
So this down-sloping nature
of the isocost curve,

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:11.570 align:middle line:84%
plotted against various input
prices, makes a lot of sense.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.260 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is
this concave shape.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:19.060 align:middle line:84%
This comes from a property
of the minimized cost.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:24.190 align:middle line:84%
In particular, this set of input
prices at or above the cost

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.780 align:middle line:90%
line is a convex set.

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.730 align:middle line:84%
But we did this a
lot with respect

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.550 align:middle line:84%
to the consumer
optimization problem.

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
We defined quasi-concave utility
functions and the associated

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:35.920 align:middle line:90%
concave indifference curves.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.960 align:middle line:84%
And we had the
weak upper contour

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.090 align:middle line:90%
set as being strictly convex.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.650 align:middle line:90%
So these are analogs here.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.310 align:middle line:84%
Now, the assertion is that
this cost function is, in fact,

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.330 align:middle line:90%
concave.

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.850 align:middle line:90%
And again, as a review--

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:50.850 align:middle line:90%
but who remembers?

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.540 align:middle line:84%
We already had
derived in lecture 4

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.030 align:middle line:84%
that the cost function is
concave in the input prices.

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:01.140 align:middle line:84%
So I just pasted in
the slide to remind us.

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.170 align:middle line:84%
So now we have
down-sloping concave.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.880 align:middle line:84%
And the other thing
that's going on here

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:09.330 align:middle line:84%
is, at these particular
input prices,

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:11.310 align:middle line:84%
if we go back to
Shephard's lemma,

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:14.580 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of
the minimized cost,

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:17.760 align:middle line:84%
with respect to, say, the
price of the first factor,

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.790 align:middle line:84%
is the level input
of the first factor,

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:24.040 align:middle line:84%
and similarly, for the level
input of the second factor.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So the ratio, the slope
of this line, which

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:29.850 align:middle line:84%
is the ratio of the
derivatives of the cost

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:33.630 align:middle line:84%
curve at an optimum,
must, by Shephard's lemma,

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:37.630 align:middle line:84%
be equal to the ratio of
the optimizing inputs.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:42.870 align:middle line:84%
And again, logically, if you
increased the input price

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:46.470 align:middle line:84%
of factor 1, keeping
cost constant,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.170 align:middle line:84%
you would move along
this isocost line.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:53.100 align:middle line:84%
And you would increase
the amount of good 2

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and factor 2, and decrease
the amount of factor 1.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.700 align:middle line:84%
You substitute away
from the factor, which

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.300 align:middle line:90%
has now increased in price.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.350 align:middle line:84%
So in the earlier slide, lecture
4, I didn't replicate it.

00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:09.420 align:middle line:84%
We had a Walt Disney example
about machinery versus humans.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Now I'll just warn
you, it is very hard

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.790 align:middle line:84%
to remember what's
divided by what.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:18.300 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, the fact that this
perpendicular becomes steeper

00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:21.720 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with
the input of factor 1

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.560 align:middle line:84%
going down because
it's the inverse ratio.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.330 align:middle line:90%
All right, did that.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, how do we solve for
equilibrium factor prices?

00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:35.100 align:middle line:84%
This is just a picture
of a particular firm

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.380 align:middle line:90%
and what it would do, firm j--

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.810 align:middle line:84%
what it would do as we
vary the input prices?

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.210 align:middle line:84%
And we want to find
particular input prices,

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.960 align:middle line:84%
such that both firms
are minimizing costs,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.390 align:middle line:84%
and all the factors
get utilized.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:51.810 align:middle line:84%
So remember, because we have
constant returns to scale

00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:55.050 align:middle line:84%
and because we've taken the
right hand side prices as

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.990 align:middle line:84%
arbitrary and given,
coming from nowhere,

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.800 align:middle line:84%
say, but certainly known
to the firms, as part

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.770 align:middle line:84%
of the solution,
the unit cost has

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:08.670 align:middle line:84%
to equal to the price
for both firms 1 and 2.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So we have, from this, two
equations and two unknowns,

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:18.310 align:middle line:84%
namely the factor prices, w1 and
w2, that we want to solve for.

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:23.280 align:middle line:84%
So visually, we can actually
put both firm 1's and firm 2's

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.219 align:middle line:84%
isocost lines on
the same diagram.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
I've gone from here,

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
which was firm j, and firm
j's particular isocost line--

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.870 align:middle line:84%
talking about how it
varies with w1 and w2,

00:34:36.870 --> 00:34:40.260 align:middle line:84%
to this diagram, in which
we have not only firm 1--

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.320 align:middle line:90%
excuse me, but also firm two.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:46.469 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to
find an equilibrium,

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:50.310 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find price for
factor 1 and a price for factor

00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:51.540 align:middle line:90%
2, each.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.150 align:middle line:84%
So each firm, in an
equilibrium, is going

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:56.670 align:middle line:90%
to face the same factor prices.

00:34:56.670 --> 00:35:00.810 align:middle line:84%
And each firm must lie
on its own unit cost

00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:03.940 align:middle line:84%
curve equal to the price
from this equation.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:10.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can see the unit cost
for firm 1 equal to p 2,

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:12.930 align:middle line:84%
the unit cost of
firm 2 equal to p2.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:16.230 align:middle line:84%
These are particular
isocost curves for firm 1

00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:19.920 align:middle line:84%
and firm 2 that are associated
with two of the equilibrium

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.710 align:middle line:90%
equations.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:23.580 align:middle line:84%
And if we're going to find
common factor prices faced

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.340 align:middle line:84%
by both of the
firms, we only want

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:28.890 align:middle line:84%
one factor price for
the first factor,

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:31.150 align:middle line:84%
and one factor price
for the second one.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:33.240 align:middle line:84%
So where can that
happen in this diagram?

00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:38.110 align:middle line:84%
Only one spot, and that's where
these isocost curves cross.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.930 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of
displaying the equilibrium.

00:35:40.930 --> 00:35:45.270 align:middle line:84%
Let me say one more word about
why they're shaped in this way.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:49.080 align:middle line:84%
Remember, firm 1 is
intensive in factor 1.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.900 align:middle line:84%
So if we did move
along its curve,

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:90%
lowering w2 and increasing w1--

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.840 align:middle line:84%
because it's
intensive in factor 1,

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.730 align:middle line:84%
it tends to use a
lot of factor 1.

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.160 align:middle line:84%
So increasing the
price of factor 1

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.740 align:middle line:84%
is kind over big
burden for firm 1.

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And to compensate,
we have to lower

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:10.140 align:middle line:84%
the price of the second
factor quite a lot,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:15.000 align:middle line:84%
relative to the compensation
we would have to offer firm 2.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.950 align:middle line:84%
For the same increase in w1,
the corresponding decrease in w2

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:24.630 align:middle line:84%
is less for firm 2 than firm
1 because, again, firm 1

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.790 align:middle line:90%
is intensive in factor 1.

00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:29.100 align:middle line:84%
So this factor
intensity, which I

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:31.470 align:middle line:84%
said was a very
natural definition,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.860 align:middle line:84%
is true everywhere
by definition.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.730 align:middle line:84%
Hence, the curve for firm 1
has to be steeper everywhere

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:40.350 align:middle line:90%
than the curve for firm 2.

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.900 align:middle line:84%
And that's why
they have to cross.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.370 align:middle line:84%
OK, so again, just
to review this slide,

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.130 align:middle line:84%
we're looking for
an equilibrium.

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:53.160 align:middle line:84%
The claim is we found
it now because we

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:57.480 align:middle line:84%
have found the factor prices
for the first and second factor,

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:01.530 align:middle line:84%
such that each firm is
minimizing its unit costs

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.870 align:middle line:90%
associated with the cost--

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:06.590 align:middle line:84%
the unit cost being
equal to price.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.460 align:middle line:84%
So these must be the
equilibrium quantities

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.930 align:middle line:84%
of the factors being utilized
in each of the two firms.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.430 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we're kind
of doing an algorithm here.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:23.530 align:middle line:84%
The algorithm was define
Walrasian equilibrium.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.650 align:middle line:84%
And do that for
this 2 by 2 model.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:29.500 align:middle line:84%
And without telling you
that I was going to do this,

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.420 align:middle line:90%
we're doing it iteratively.

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:36.400 align:middle line:84%
The very first thing we do is
solve for the factor prices.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.620 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to get
the quantities this way.

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:41.470 align:middle line:84%
So the quantities,
naturally, are

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.160 align:middle line:84%
going to come from a diagram
where we have isoquants.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.350 align:middle line:84%
So here we have the
input of factor 1,

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:48.850 align:middle line:90%
the input of factor 2.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.270 align:middle line:84%
For firm j, this is an
isoquant equal production,

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
as you move along
that isoquant curve.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:58.660 align:middle line:84%
And again, you may
remember, or not,

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:04.900 align:middle line:84%
that to minimize the cost
of producing one unit,

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:08.170 align:middle line:84%
we find the tangency,
where the isoquant

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.650 align:middle line:90%
is tangent to the isocost line.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.230 align:middle line:84%
Now again, it's a bit
dizzying because what's

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:18.880 align:middle line:84%
an isocost line in one space
is a different-looking cost

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.870 align:middle line:90%
line in another.

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:22.150 align:middle line:84%
In this space,
the isocost curves

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:25.300 align:middle line:90%
are concave, as I was saying.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.670 align:middle line:84%
That's in the space
of factor inputs.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.950 align:middle line:90%
W1 and W2 prices.

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:34.210 align:middle line:84%
w1 and w2 here,
the isocost line is

00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:39.880 align:middle line:84%
linear, in the space of
input quantities, z1 and z2.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.470 align:middle line:84%
So again, the minimized cost
of producing one unit of output

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.780 align:middle line:84%
here at these factor
prices, w, is this tangency.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:55.120 align:middle line:84%
And it's associated with the
inputs, a1 and a2, to firm, j.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:58.240 align:middle line:84%
And again, the
reason is something

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.820 align:middle line:84%
we reviewed before,
that when you take

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:07.510 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of the isoquant,
we're getting dz2, dz1,

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:09.290 align:middle line:84%
the quantity is
staying the same.

00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:11.530 align:middle line:90%
So we solve for the solution.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.380 align:middle line:84%
And we're getting a relationship
between the derivative

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.720 align:middle line:90%
of the isocost and the inputs.

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.160 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now we want to solve,
not only for quantities,

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.160 align:middle line:90%
but the equilibrium amounts.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.540 align:middle line:84%
Now remember, again, here
we were playing around

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.980 align:middle line:90%
with unit costs.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:34.280 align:middle line:84%
But we don't know the level
of the quantities yet.

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:38.270 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, hence, we don't
know the levels of the inputs.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Although we do know
something about the ratios

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:45.260 align:middle line:84%
of the inputs one once we find
the equilibrium factor prices.

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.990 align:middle line:84%
So having found the
equilibrium factor prices,

00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.950 align:middle line:84%
we now turn to
determining the inputs.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.470 align:middle line:84%
But it almost looks
like a review.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:57.740 align:middle line:84%
The input ratio
for firm 1 must be

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
those a coefficients,
the solution to the cost

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.800 align:middle line:84%
minimization problem
in the quantity

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.270 align:middle line:84%
space at the equilibrium
factor prices, w star.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:09.560 align:middle line:90%
This is true for firm 1.

00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:11.490 align:middle line:90%
It's also true for firm 2.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:14.540 align:middle line:84%
So the ratios of
inputs being used

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.990 align:middle line:84%
must be consistent with
the optimized ratio

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:21.890 align:middle line:84%
of inputs being used at the
equilibrium factor prices.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:23.360 align:middle line:90%
There are two equations there.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:27.890 align:middle line:84%
There's another equation,
namely that the inputs being

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.460 align:middle line:84%
used by the firm, in this case,
input 1, and the second, input

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.060 align:middle line:90%
2--

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.790 align:middle line:84%
input 1 in firm 1,
input 1 in firm 2,

00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:37.470 align:middle line:84%
must sum up to the
aggregate endowments.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:41.690 align:middle line:84%
So finally, another
ingredient of the economy,

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.360 align:middle line:84%
the level of the
input endowments,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:46.500 align:middle line:90%
is here on the right hand side.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:49.640 align:middle line:84%
And when we found an
equilibrium in input use,

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.730 align:middle line:84%
it has to satisfy this
system of equations.

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.300 align:middle line:84%
Now I can show you
a picture of it.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.150 align:middle line:84%
You may remember that
when we did production,

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.650 align:middle line:84%
we talked about the
production box--

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.700 align:middle line:84%
not the Edgeworth Box
of the consumer theory,

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:84%
but the production box
of production theory.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.610 align:middle line:84%
We had, again,
like the isoquants,

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:13.940 align:middle line:84%
input 1 and input 2
on the x and y-axis,

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.270 align:middle line:90%
firm 1 is oriented around 01.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:20.360 align:middle line:84%
And we have
isoquants for firm 1.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:24.080 align:middle line:84%
And this ratio, the
slope of this line,

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.720 align:middle line:84%
is the optimizing
ratio of inputs.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.770 align:middle line:84%
And again, that
optimizing ratio of inputs

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.410 align:middle line:84%
is entirely pinned down
by the equilibrium factor

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.400 align:middle line:90%
prices, which we already found.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.600 align:middle line:84%
So they have to lie on
this line somewhere.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:39.710 align:middle line:90%
Why here?

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Because when we go up to firm
2, the same thing is true,

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:middle line:84%
that the optimizing input ratio
of factor 2 to factor 1 must

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.550 align:middle line:84%
lie on this line coming
out of the 02 origin.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:56.810 align:middle line:84%
So input ratio for
firm 1 is fixed.

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:59.347 align:middle line:90%
Input ratio for firm 2 is fixed.

00:41:59.347 --> 00:41:59.930 align:middle line:90%
Fixed at what?

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:03.410 align:middle line:84%
Fixed at these levels, as
in the earlier diagrams.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.430 align:middle line:84%
Hence, in an equilibrium, to be
consistent with each of them,

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:10.190 align:middle line:84%
it must be where
these lines cross.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So this finally
determines output

00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:14.840 align:middle line:90%
because we have isoquants here.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.500 align:middle line:84%
So firm 1 is producing
on this isoquant.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:20.870 align:middle line:84%
Firm 2 is producing
on this isoquant.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:24.200 align:middle line:84%
So now we've got
both, the equilibrium

00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:26.240 align:middle line:90%
level of the inputs--

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.210 align:middle line:84%
which is boom boom and
boom boom, as well as

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the outputs associated
with these isoquants.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:36.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, are there questions so far?

00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:39.400 align:middle line:84%
Well, let me just
say, when you review,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.740 align:middle line:84%
there is a lot of
content in this lecture.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.130 align:middle line:84%
Some of it's review, as I've
already been apologizing.

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:46.750 align:middle line:90%
Go back to lecture 4.

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:49.120 align:middle line:84%
But also, it's kind of
stacked, in the sense

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.770 align:middle line:84%
that each segment builds
on the subsequent segments.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:55.450 align:middle line:84%
And it's very hard
to take it in when

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:58.100 align:middle line:84%
I go through these slides
for the first time.

00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:01.100 align:middle line:84%
But I think if you review
it the second round,

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:84%
you'll see how the ingredients
are coming together.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, where are
we at this point?

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:09.460 align:middle line:84%
We had a country,
say, an economy,

00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.970 align:middle line:84%
with two types of
firms, j, equal 1, 2.

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.390 align:middle line:84%
We have two factors,
say labor and capital.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:20.740 align:middle line:84%
We had this economy facing
externally-given arbitrary

00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:25.330 align:middle line:84%
prices, p1 and p2,
for the firms 1 and 2.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:30.370 align:middle line:84%
And we have now solved for the
market clearing factor prices

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:35.140 align:middle line:84%
in the input markets for the
level of the inputs being used

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.510 align:middle line:84%
and the equilibrium
quantities being produced.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.560 align:middle line:90%
That's how far we got already.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.240 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I want to
get to the trade part.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:45.920 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to
add the other two.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.630 align:middle line:84%
So this is two firms, two
factors, and two countries.

00:43:49.630 --> 00:43:52.390 align:middle line:84%
And the two countries
are denoted A and B.

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So each country has
the same technologies.

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.350 align:middle line:84%
Each country can produce
good 1 and produce

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:04.450 align:middle line:84%
good 2 with these factors, the
two factors, labor and capital.

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:07.090 align:middle line:84%
We could have imagined
different technologies

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:09.580 align:middle line:84%
in the different
countries, and in a minute,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.080 align:middle line:90%
different preferences.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.240 align:middle line:84%
You haven't seen the
consumer side of it yet.

00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:18.400 align:middle line:84%
But the famous 2 by 2 by 2
model with some amazingly cool

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.430 align:middle line:84%
theorems assumes
identical technologies

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.400 align:middle line:84%
and identical preferences
in the two countries.

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.560 align:middle line:84%
What's different across
the two countries

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.240 align:middle line:90%
are the factor endowments.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.000 align:middle line:84%
Namely, one country
is capital abundant.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.890 align:middle line:90%
The other is labor abundant.

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.590 align:middle line:84%
So you might, for
example, have thought--

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:37.660 align:middle line:84%
although this is
no longer as true

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.420 align:middle line:84%
as it once was for reasons
of the theorem we're

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:41.560 align:middle line:90%
about to see--

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.040 align:middle line:84%
that countries like
Mexico or China

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:47.530 align:middle line:84%
are relatively
well-endowed with labor.

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.200 align:middle line:84%
The US, being quite
industrialized,

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.230 align:middle line:84%
is relatively
well-endowed with capital.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:57.010 align:middle line:84%
So the US, as
distinct from Mexico,

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:00.010 align:middle line:90%
is a capital-abundant country.

00:45:00.010 --> 00:45:02.830 align:middle line:84%
And Mexico is a
labor-abundant country.

00:45:02.830 --> 00:45:06.520 align:middle line:84%
I choose the example carefully
because, again, with NAFTA,

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.530 align:middle line:84%
there's all kinds
of controversies

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:12.640 align:middle line:84%
about what happened to the
wages of US domestic workers

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.120 align:middle line:84%
when the US increased
its trade with Mexico.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.670 align:middle line:84%
We now have a theorem
that's going to tell us

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.080 align:middle line:90%
something about that.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.470 align:middle line:84%
Oh, anyway, here, two countries,
A and B, with different factor

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.780 align:middle line:84%
endowments-- one being
capital abundant,

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:27.130 align:middle line:90%
and the other labor abundant.

00:45:27.130 --> 00:45:29.170 align:middle line:84%
Now, what if there's
no trade at all?

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:30.580 align:middle line:90%
We're in autarky.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:34.180 align:middle line:84%
What's going to determine the
price of the consumption goods?

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:36.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, that's where we
need the consumer part.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.740 align:middle line:84%
We're going to need the
representative consumer

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.440 align:middle line:84%
in a given country
maximizing utility,

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.580 align:middle line:84%
given its ownership of factors,
and potentially shares.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:49.120 align:middle line:84%
Although in this constant
returns to scale world,

00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.950 align:middle line:90%
there are no profits anyway.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.680 align:middle line:84%
So we have an entirely
domestic market,

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.980 align:middle line:84%
like China completely closed
to the rest of the world.

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.010 align:middle line:84%
Now we jump all the
way to free trade.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And if there's no cost
of shipping goods around,

00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:03.640 align:middle line:90%
there's an abstraction.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.320 align:middle line:84%
The price of the
two goods now have

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:09.400 align:middle line:84%
to be the same in each
country because if there's

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.180 align:middle line:84%
no cost to shipping goods
around, if the price of a good

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.830 align:middle line:84%
were lower in one country
than another, then

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:20.290 align:middle line:84%
they would basically
be exporting

00:46:20.290 --> 00:46:22.270 align:middle line:84%
a lot of that good
at a low price

00:46:22.270 --> 00:46:24.430 align:middle line:84%
to the other country
that's willing to buy it

00:46:24.430 --> 00:46:25.340 align:middle line:90%
at a high price.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.040 align:middle line:84%
So those prices
can't be different

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.530 align:middle line:84%
when there's no cost to
shipping goods around.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.860 align:middle line:84%
Now exactly where
the prices are,

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.910 align:middle line:90%
I will show you in a minute.

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:38.910 align:middle line:84%
But first, let me give
you the theorem called

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.640 align:middle line:90%
Heckscher-Ohlin theorem.

00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:42.640 align:middle line:84%
Suppose initially,
we're in autarky.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.740 align:middle line:90%
And neither country is trading.

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.470 align:middle line:84%
And the price of the
capital-intensive good

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:52.150 align:middle line:84%
in the capital-abundant country
will be relatively low--

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:55.780 align:middle line:84%
relative to the price of
that capital-intensive good

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.550 align:middle line:90%
in the other country.

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:00.640 align:middle line:84%
This is intuitive in
terms of the economics.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:05.230 align:middle line:84%
You have a country that has a
lot of capital and relatively

00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:06.370 align:middle line:90%
little labor.

00:47:06.370 --> 00:47:08.020 align:middle line:90%
That's abundant capital.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:10.570 align:middle line:84%
That should drive down
the price of the capital

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:14.950 align:middle line:84%
input, relative to the
wage of the labor input--

00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:18.400 align:middle line:84%
relative also to
the other country,

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.700 align:middle line:84%
which is abundant in
labor, and should have,

00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:27.070 align:middle line:84%
because there's a lot of labor
around, a relatively low wage.

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So those are the two
statements, the price

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.080 align:middle line:84%
of the capital-intensive good
in the capital-abundant country

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:35.710 align:middle line:84%
will be lower,
relative to the price

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.500 align:middle line:84%
of that capital-intensive
good in the other country.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.450 align:middle line:90%
And vise versa for labor.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.900 align:middle line:84%
The price of the labor-intensive
good in the labor-abundant

00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:48.490 align:middle line:84%
country will be lower,
relative to the price of that

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.740 align:middle line:84%
labor-intensive good
in the other country--

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:55.190 align:middle line:84%
or in some, when an input is
abundant, it has a low price.

00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:57.220 align:middle line:90%
Now we go to trade.

00:47:57.220 --> 00:47:59.950 align:middle line:84%
We don't allow the
inputs to migrate.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:02.740 align:middle line:84%
But we do allow
trade in the goods.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.210 align:middle line:90%
Think about that first line.

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.430 align:middle line:84%
The price of the
capital-intensive good

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:10.630 align:middle line:84%
is low, relative to the price
of the capital-intensive

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.230 align:middle line:90%
good in the other country.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.370 align:middle line:84%
So because it has
a low price, it

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:17.980 align:middle line:84%
should be a, quote,
"competitive export."

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:22.300 align:middle line:84%
So the capital-abundant
country will be exporting

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.220 align:middle line:90%
the capital-intensive good.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:27.340 align:middle line:84%
The labor-abundant
country will be exporting

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:29.590 align:middle line:90%
the labor-intensive good.

00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:32.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to find
an equilibrium where

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:36.310 align:middle line:84%
this kind of arbitrage is
no longer profitable, where

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.460 align:middle line:90%
the prices will be the same.

00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:43.870 align:middle line:84%
But the adjustment mechanism
is coming from the possibility

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:45.470 align:middle line:90%
of exports and imports.

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:48.220 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you
an example picture.

00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:52.300 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we have country B
here with this production

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:56.350 align:middle line:84%
possibilities set in the
two goods, G1 and G2.

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:59.900 align:middle line:84%
Now, I'm not telling you
exactly why it looks like this.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:06.700 align:middle line:84%
But it has to do with the fact
that country B is relatively

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.040 align:middle line:90%
abundant in one of the factors.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.710 align:middle line:84%
You can see, relative
to country A,

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:14.200 align:middle line:84%
this country can
produce a lot of good 2,

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.420 align:middle line:90%
and relatively little of good 1.

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:19.030 align:middle line:84%
And that's because of the
different factor intensities.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.100 align:middle line:84%
The flip side of
that is country A

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:24.160 align:middle line:84%
over here with its production
possibility frontier.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:29.380 align:middle line:84%
And it can produce relatively
more of good 1 than good 2,

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:31.960 align:middle line:84%
in the sense of enumerating
all the possibilities.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:33.430 align:middle line:90%
If you're in autarky--

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:36.010 align:middle line:84%
now, you remember the
Robinson Crusoe economy

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.980 align:middle line:84%
where we had Robinson
Crusoe producing two goods?

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:43.630 align:middle line:84%
No trade-- we had, in autarky
therefore, on the island,

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.120 align:middle line:84%
Robinson Crusoe's
indifference curve

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.550 align:middle line:84%
would be tangent to his
production possibility set.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the autarky
allocation in country B.

00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:58.260 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, country A, with
a different technology,

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.140 align:middle line:84%
a different island, so to speak,
would have another tangency

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:05.380 align:middle line:84%
of its preference
indifference curve,

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:07.510 align:middle line:84%
with a production
possibility set.

00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:12.010 align:middle line:84%
Now, it's kind of easier to
draw with common preferences,

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:15.340 align:middle line:84%
having the same indifference
curve tangent in both.

00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But that's not a necessary
part of the argument.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:22.150 align:middle line:84%
All we care about is
tangency for country B

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:24.070 align:middle line:84%
relative to its
indifference curves,

00:50:24.070 --> 00:50:27.190 align:middle line:84%
and tangency for
country A in autarky,

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.825 align:middle line:84%
relative to its
indifference curves.

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:31.540 align:middle line:84%
It just happens to be the
same indifference curve.

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:34.690 align:middle line:84%
Now finally, we go from
autarky to free trade.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:36.700 align:middle line:90%
What must be the solution?

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:42.460 align:middle line:84%
Each country-- B over here
will separate its consumption

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.750 align:middle line:90%
and production problems.

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:46.420 align:middle line:84%
It will maximize
profits by finding

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:49.570 align:middle line:84%
the point on its production
possibility frontier

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:52.960 align:middle line:84%
which gives it the
highest level of profits,

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:57.220 align:middle line:84%
as captured by this
budget line, really--

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:01.490 align:middle line:84%
trade line, that emanates
from the new change production

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.990 align:middle line:90%
point.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:04.840 align:middle line:84%
And I know the old
production point was autarky

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:10.180 align:middle line:84%
for country B. It's now shifted
to be giving up some of good 1,

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:15.610 align:middle line:84%
and producing more of good
2, and then exporting good 2

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.770 align:middle line:90%
and getting more of good 1 back.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:21.250 align:middle line:84%
So it specializes
more in production.

00:51:21.250 --> 00:51:23.560 align:middle line:84%
And then achieves
balance in consumption

00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.840 align:middle line:90%
by imports and exports.

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:29.060 align:middle line:84%
And country A down here
is doing the opposite.

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:30.970 align:middle line:84%
It specialized
more in production

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.970 align:middle line:84%
in the other direction,
more of good 1,

00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:38.260 align:middle line:84%
and then trades in the world
economy, giving up good 1

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:39.940 align:middle line:90%
and getting good 2.

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And although it's not drawn
here, the exports of good 1

00:51:44.140 --> 00:51:48.820 align:middle line:84%
for country A are exactly
equal to the imports of good 1

00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:53.290 align:middle line:84%
for country B. So the prices
of the goods associated

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:55.690 align:middle line:84%
with this external
price line are

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:57.760 align:middle line:84%
the same for both
countries, and have

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.400 align:middle line:84%
the property that, finally,
we have an equilibrium

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.450 align:middle line:90%
in the goods markets.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.540 align:middle line:84%
In sum, we've now made
the prices endogenous.

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:08.260 align:middle line:84%
P1 and 2, which were given
throughout 3/4 of the lecture,

00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:12.040 align:middle line:84%
are now determined
internationally by free trade.

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:14.590 align:middle line:84%
All right, so we
did Heckscher-Ohlin.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:18.130 align:middle line:84%
Now we have another theorem,
Stopler-Samuelson theorem.

00:52:18.130 --> 00:52:22.090 align:middle line:84%
In this 2 by 2 by 2 model
with these varying factor

00:52:22.090 --> 00:52:27.260 align:middle line:84%
intensities, if the price
of good i increases,

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:29.680 align:middle line:84%
then the equilibrium
price of the factor

00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:32.360 align:middle line:84%
that's used more
intensively in good i

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:36.590 align:middle line:84%
also increases, while the price
of the other factor decreases.

00:52:36.590 --> 00:52:39.080 align:middle line:90%
So let me say it again.

00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.570 align:middle line:84%
And let me give the
motivation here.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:45.320 align:middle line:84%
We're going from autarky
in each country one

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:49.280 align:middle line:84%
at a time, with its
internal domestic prices,

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:52.280 align:middle line:84%
to an equilibrium
in the world economy

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.680 align:middle line:84%
with free trade at
different prices.

00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:59.990 align:middle line:84%
So for country b
here, P1 over P2

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:04.610 align:middle line:84%
is going down, relative to what
it will be in the free trade

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:05.450 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium.

00:53:05.450 --> 00:53:07.490 align:middle line:84%
And the reverse is
true for country A.

00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:10.220 align:middle line:84%
So when we go from
autarky to trade,

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.550 align:middle line:84%
we're moving the price
ratio in both countries--

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.690 align:middle line:84%
in different directions,
but we're moving it.

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:19.190 align:middle line:84%
So let's say, what is the
impact now of moving a price?

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:23.390 align:middle line:84%
If we increase the price of good
i relative to the other good,

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:25.790 align:middle line:84%
the equilibrium
price of the factor

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:29.330 align:middle line:84%
that was used more intensively
in the production of good i

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:32.210 align:middle line:84%
will increase, while the
price of the other factor

00:53:32.210 --> 00:53:33.930 align:middle line:90%
will decrease.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:38.210 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's go back to a proof
of this in the earlier diagram,

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:42.200 align:middle line:84%
setting aside the two countries,
kind of not asking for a minute

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:45.860 align:middle line:84%
where the price comes from--
except that where previously we

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.530 align:middle line:84%
had these isocost
lines crossing,

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:51.590 align:middle line:84%
the cost lines associated
with P1 and P2--

00:53:51.590 --> 00:53:54.620 align:middle line:84%
we now increase the
price of good 1.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:59.090 align:middle line:90%
So C1 equal to P1 is here.

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:03.680 align:middle line:84%
C1 equal to P prime
1 lies further out.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:05.300 align:middle line:84%
It kind of stands
to reason that it

00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:08.150 align:middle line:84%
should lie further out because
we've increased the price.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:10.200 align:middle line:90%
And we want cost equal to price.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.650 align:middle line:84%
So if price is higher,
cost can be higher.

00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:17.330 align:middle line:84%
And cost can be higher by having
higher levels of w1 and w2

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.780 align:middle line:90%
as the input prices.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.620 align:middle line:84%
So the isocost
line for the price

00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:24.440 align:middle line:84%
when the price increases,
in this case, good 1's price

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:26.720 align:middle line:90%
increases, shifts outward.

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:30.380 align:middle line:84%
We haven't done anything to
the price of the other good.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.150 align:middle line:90%
The C2-- where is it?

00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:35.030 align:middle line:90%
The C2 line is staying constant.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:39.170 align:middle line:84%
The C2 isocost line of price
B2 is staying constant.

00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:42.140 align:middle line:84%
However, we need a crossing--
that an equilibrium

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:44.180 align:middle line:84%
is described by where
the lines cross.

00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:46.700 align:middle line:84%
So we would move from
this initial crossing

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:48.950 align:middle line:90%
to this second crossing.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:51.500 align:middle line:84%
And you can see,
as a consequence

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:56.390 align:middle line:84%
of the increase in price in P1,
that the price of factor 1--

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:59.480 align:middle line:90%
good 1 is intensive in factor 1.

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition that we
were given at the beginning.

00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:05.330 align:middle line:90%
The price of good 1 increases.

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.460 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, the
input, which is used

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:11.670 align:middle line:84%
intensively in good 1, namely
factor 1, should increase.

00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:13.320 align:middle line:90%
And the other one decreases.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.390 align:middle line:84%
So this diagram illustrates
the Stopler-Samuelson theorem.

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.940 align:middle line:84%
But again, in the
context of free trade,

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:22.430 align:middle line:84%
those price movements
come about for a reason.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:25.640 align:middle line:84%
Namely, we've gone from
autarky to free trade.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:29.000 align:middle line:84%
So you could see earlier which
way the price was moving,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.870 align:middle line:84%
depending on the initial
country and the autarky.

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.720 align:middle line:84%
Now, although we
know, again, to repeat

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.520 align:middle line:84%
the steps of the
algorithm, we now

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.530 align:middle line:84%
know what happens
to the factor prices

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:43.040 align:middle line:84%
from this diagram, what happens
to the levels of the inputs,

00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.840 align:middle line:90%
and what happens to output.

00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.050 align:middle line:84%
Well, we have this,
again, box for production.

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.890 align:middle line:84%
We had the initial allocation
ratio of the factors

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.750 align:middle line:90%
as quantities crossed.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:57.620 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, the line for
good 1 and the line for good 2

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:58.730 align:middle line:90%
crossed.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:00.620 align:middle line:90%
And they crossed here.

00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:03.830 align:middle line:84%
But now those factor
prices have changed.

00:56:03.830 --> 00:56:06.200 align:middle line:84%
As a consequence of
the price change,

00:56:06.200 --> 00:56:10.400 align:middle line:84%
the quantity of the
first factor will go down

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.750 align:middle line:84%
because its price has gone up
from country 1's point of view.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:19.010 align:middle line:84%
That produces a somewhat
steeper sloped line.

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:21.770 align:middle line:84%
And the opposite is
going on with country 2.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:26.210 align:middle line:84%
So the new equilibrium is
where these now-changed slope

00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:27.830 align:middle line:90%
lines cross.

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:30.260 align:middle line:84%
And you can actually
see, in this case,

00:56:30.260 --> 00:56:34.340 align:middle line:84%
that firm 1 is producing more
because its isoquant will

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:34.850 align:middle line:90%
be higher.

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:37.760 align:middle line:84%
And it's using a higher
level of both inputs.

00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:43.490 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the production
of good 2 will contract.

00:56:43.490 --> 00:56:47.630 align:middle line:84%
So again, this factor price
equalization theorem is,

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:52.550 align:middle line:84%
just to restate it, in the
2 by 2 and 2-country model,

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:56.390 align:middle line:84%
as long as we have this factor
intensity assumption holding

00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:59.300 align:middle line:84%
and the countries are not
completely specialized,

00:56:59.300 --> 00:57:03.110 align:middle line:84%
the equilibrium price
of factors, inputs,

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:07.790 align:middle line:84%
only depends on the technologies
and on the output prices--

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.640 align:middle line:84%
determined as it may
be, in such a way

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:15.310 align:middle line:84%
that the prices of the outputs
equals the input costs.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:18.760 align:middle line:84%
But now, look, if both
countries face the same prices

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.890 align:middle line:84%
because they trade in
goods, and otherwise there

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:23.740 align:middle line:84%
would be arbitrage, then
since the prices are

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:28.210 align:middle line:84%
the same in both countries, we
can zero inside each country,

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:32.020 align:middle line:84%
and look at the factor prices,
which are clearing the factor

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.250 align:middle line:90%
markets in each country.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:37.360 align:middle line:84%
And since each country
has the same technology,

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:42.100 align:middle line:84%
these equations across the two
goods in each country hold.

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:44.290 align:middle line:84%
If the prices are the
same on the right hand

00:57:44.290 --> 00:57:47.290 align:middle line:84%
side as a consequence
of free trade,

00:57:47.290 --> 00:57:50.380 align:middle line:84%
then the solution
to the input prices

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.180 align:middle line:84%
has to be the same on
the left hand side.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:58.360 align:middle line:84%
So in short, remarkably, we have
not allowed trade in factors--

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.070 align:middle line:90%
no migration.

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:04.030 align:middle line:84%
But we've managed to equalize
factor prices without migration

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:07.280 align:middle line:90%
simply by having trade in goods.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.260 align:middle line:84%
So that's the famous factor
price equalization theorem.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:17.560 align:middle line:84%
So vis a vis, the US and Mexico,
allowing the NAFTA, free trade

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.110 align:middle line:84%
in goods, even with
a wall, if I dare

00:58:20.110 --> 00:58:24.070 align:middle line:84%
say, prohibiting
Mexican migration,

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:29.680 align:middle line:84%
the theorem says that the wages
in Mexico should rise in Mexico

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.620 align:middle line:84%
and fall to the US, to the point
that the wages are the same.

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:36.610 align:middle line:84%
So the factors
bear consequences.

00:58:36.610 --> 00:58:40.270 align:middle line:84%
It's not necessarily a good
thing that wages of labor

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:42.190 align:middle line:90%
are falling in the US--

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.690 align:middle line:90%
not good for those firms.

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:46.540 align:middle line:84%
We have to come back
to those households.

00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.610 align:middle line:84%
We have to come back
to the welfare theorems

00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:52.130 align:middle line:84%
to think about the winners
and losers from trade.

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:56.440 align:middle line:84%
The point here only is that you
can see why there is sometimes

00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:00.490 align:middle line:84%
resistance to trade because
trade does have consequences

00:59:00.490 --> 00:59:01.910 align:middle line:90%
for factor prices.

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:05.440 align:middle line:84%
Hence, for the welfare of the
providers of those factors,

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:09.100 align:middle line:84%
depending on whether they're
capitalists that own wealth,

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.160 align:middle line:84%
capital that's used in
machinery and so on,

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.100 align:middle line:84%
versus laborers that have
only their labor endowment.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:20.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so next time we're going
to go with this kind of theorem

00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.560 align:middle line:90%
back to the Thai villages.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.470 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go,
in the subsequent lecture,

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:28.900 align:middle line:84%
to the US, and

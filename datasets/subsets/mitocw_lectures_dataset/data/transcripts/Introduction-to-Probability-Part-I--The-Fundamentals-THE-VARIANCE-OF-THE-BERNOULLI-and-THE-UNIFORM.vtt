WEBVTT

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.040
In this segment, we will go
through the calculation of the

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.900
variances of some familiar
random variables, starting

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.170
with the simplest one that we
know, which is the Bernoulli

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.480
random variable.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.990
So let X take values 0 or 1, and
it takes a value of 1 with

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.500
probability p.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.950
We have already calculated the
expected value of X, and we

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.150
know that it is equal to p.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.930
Let us now compute
its variance.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.040
One way of proceeding is to use
the definition and then

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.460
the expected value rule.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.600
So if we now apply the expected
value rule, we need

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.570
the summation over all possible
values of X. There

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.600
are two values--

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.730
x equal to 1 or x equal to 0.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.400
The contribution when X is
equal to 1 is 1 minus the

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.010
expected value, which
is p squared.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.610
And the value of 1 is taken
with probability p.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.430
There is another contribution
to this sum when little x is

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.890
equal to 0.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.390
And that contribution is going
to be 0 minus p, all of this

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.789
squared, times the probability
of 0, which is 1 minus p.

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:19.020
And now we carry out
some algebra.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:24.100
We expand the square here, 1
minus 2p plus p squared.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.170
And after we multiply with this
factor of p, we obtain p

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.220
minus 2p squared plus p
to the third power.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.500
And then from here we have a
factor of p squared times 1, p

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.710
squared times minus p.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.310
That gives us a minus p cubed.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.350
Then we notice that this term
cancels out with that term.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.860
p squared minus 2p
squared leaves us

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.330
with p minus p squared.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.020
And we factor this as
p times 1 minus p.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.120
An alternative calculation
uses the formula that we

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.810
provided a little earlier.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.190
Let's see how this will go.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.220
We have the following
observation.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.210
The random variable X squared
and the random variable X--

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.380
they are one and the same.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.120
When X is 0, X squared
is also 0.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.430
When X is 1, X squared
is also 1.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.530
So as random variables, these
two random variables are equal

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.430
in the case where X
is a Bernoulli.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.790
So what we have here is just the
expected value of X minus

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.720
the expected value of X squared,
to the second power.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.230
And this is p minus p squared,
which is the same answer as we

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.070
got before--

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.030
p times 1 minus p.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.420
And we see that the calculations
and the algebra

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.620
involved using this formula
were a little simpler than

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.110
they were before.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.940
Now the form of the variance
of the Bernoulli random

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.120
variable has an interesting
dependence on p.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.395
It's instructive to plot
it as a function of p.

00:03:29.395 --> 00:03:32.810
So this is a plot of the
variance of the Bernoulli as a

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.380
function of p, as p ranges
between 0 and 1.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.450
p times 1 minus p
is a parabola.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.590
And it's a parabola that is
0 when p is either 0 or 1.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.460
And it has this particular
shape, and the peak of this

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:58.300
parabola occurs when p is equal
to 1/2, in which case

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.770
the variance is 1/4.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.030
In some sense, the variance is
a measure of the amount of

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.590
uncertainty in a random
variable, a measure of the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.260
amount of randomness.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.060
A coin is most random if it
is fair, that is, when

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.060
p is equal to 1/2.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.570
And in this case, the variance
confirms this intuition.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:29.460
The variance of a coin flip is
biggest if that coin is fair.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.630
On the other hand, in
the extreme cases

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.880
where p equals 0--

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.440
so the coin always results in
tails, or if p equals to 1 so

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.180
that the coin always results in
heads-- in those cases, we

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.920
do not have any randomness.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.750
And the variance,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.720
correspondingly, is equal to 0.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.270
Let us now calculate
the variance of a

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.440
uniform random variable.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.159
Let us start with a simple case
where the range of the

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:59.370
uniform random variable starts
at 0 and extends up to some n.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.300
So there is a total of n plus 1
possible values, each one of

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.960
them having the same
probability--

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.930
1 over n plus 1.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.725
We calculate the variance using
the alternative formula.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.230
And let us start with
the first term.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:20.700
What is it?

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.010
We use the expected value rule,
and we argue that with

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.070
probability 1 over n plus 1, the
random variable X squared

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.460
takes the value 0 squared, with
the same probability,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.350
takes the value 1 squared.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.370
With the same probability, it
takes the value 2 squared, and

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.500
so on, all of the way
up to n squared.

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.860
And then there's
the next term.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.360
The expected value of the
uniform is the midpoint of the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.040
distribution by symmetry.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:06:00.820
So it's n over 2, and we take
the square of that.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.000
Now to make progress here, we
need to evaluate this sum.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.580
Fortunately, this has
been done by others.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.630
And it turns out to be equal
to 1 over 6 n, n plus 1

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.970
times 2n plus 1.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:24.610
This formula can be proved by
induction, but we will just

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.470
take it for granted.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.740
Using this formula, and after a
little bit of simple algebra

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.659
and after we simplify, we obtain
a final answer, which

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:42.240
is of the form 1 over
12 n times n plus 2.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.680
How about the variance
of a more general

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.580
uniform random variable?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.620
So suppose we have a uniform
random variable whose range is

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.690
from a to b.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:56.610
How is this PMF related to the
one that we already studied?

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:01.410
First, let us assume that n
is chosen so that it is

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.800
equal to b minus a.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.320
So in that case, the difference
between the last

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.240
and the first value of the
random variable is the same as

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.060
the difference between the last
and the first possible

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.830
value in this PMF.

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:18.320
So both PMFs have the same
number of terms.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.110
They have exactly
the same shape.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.730
The only difference is that the
second PMF is shifted away

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.640
from 0, and it starts at a
instead of starting at 0.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:34.220
Now what does shifting
a PMF correspond to?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.780
It essentially amounts to taking
a random variable--

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.400
let's say, with this PMF--

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.860
and adding a constant to
that random variable.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.070
So if the original random
variable takes the value of 0,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:49.090
the new random variable
takes the value of a.

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.890
If the original takes the value
of 1, this new random

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.780
variable takes the value
of a plus 1, and so on.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:08:02.650
So this shifted PMF is the PMF
associated to a random

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:05.010
variable equal to the
original random

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.010
variable plus a constant.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.230
But we know that adding
a constant does

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.910
not change the variance.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:14.160
Therefore, the variance of this
PMF is going to be the

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.380
same as the variance of the
original PMF, as long as we

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.320
make the correspondence that
n is equal to b minus a.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.050
So doing this substitution in
the formula that we derived

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:34.900
earlier, we obtain 1 over
12 b minus a times b

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.830
minus a plus 2.

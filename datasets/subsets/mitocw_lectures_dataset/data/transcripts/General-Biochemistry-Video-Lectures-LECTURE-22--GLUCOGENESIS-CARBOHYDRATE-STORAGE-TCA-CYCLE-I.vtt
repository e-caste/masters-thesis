00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.936
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.396
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.740
PROFESSOR: So last time,
we discussed glycolysis

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.850
as a pathway.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.950
And I just want to
remind everybody

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.010
that, like all pathways,
glycolysis has to be favorable.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.570
That is, delta G across
the entire pathway

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.060
has to be less than 0.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.770
We spent a lot of
time discussing

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.510
the regulation of glycolysis.

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.790
And I just want to
revisit this quickly.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.850
And remember, we discussed that
the steps that are regulated

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.580
are those with the
biggest, quote, unquote,

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.960
bio-energetic cost.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.480
That is, the biggest
drop in delta G

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.630
is as molecules would
proceed across the pathway.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.600
And those are shown here--
the hexokinase step,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.770
the phosphofructokinase
step, and the pyruvate kinase

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.580
step of the pathway.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.550
Now this is largely true of most
pathways that we will consider,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.890
in that these regulated
steps are often

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.020
those with the biggest
bio-energetic cost.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.770
And the reason for that is
that it makes a lot of sense.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.960
Once you go through those steps,
it's very difficult to go back.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.590
Also, you'll note that
these are the steps that

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.710
regulate entrance and
exit from the pathway.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.850
And this also is something we'll
commonly see and other pathways

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.670
and also makes some sense.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.680
Just to remind
everybody, I drew up

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.640
here a skeletonized
version of glycolysis

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.160
and the most important
regulatory features of it.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.470
Just to remind people
that initially,

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.350
hexokinase is regulated
by glucose-6 phosphate.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.470
Glucose-6 phosphate negatively
regulates hexokinase.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.740
And that's because if the
glucose-6 phosphate levels

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.620
in the cell go up such that it
can't be shunted to glycogen--

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.390
something we'll
talk about today--

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.460
or be sent through
glycolysis, it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.100
makes sense not to
trap more glucose.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.820
Once glucose-6 phosphate
enters the rest

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.370
of the glycolytic pathway,
the key step of regulation

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.110
is phosphofructokinase.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.740
It, of course, will have
positive feedback, saying,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.710
let's put carbon
into the pathway.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.510
If energy charge low, AMP
is high, activates it.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.270
This molecule fructose
2,6-bisphosphate that we talked

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.060
about earlier today--
we'll mention again today--

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.020
can be involved in some
other signaling inputs

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.240
to allosterically
regulate the enzyme.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.420
FBP can feed forward to
activate pyruvate kinase.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.380
You want to match
input with output.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.640
And, of course, if PEP builds
up, you want to slow it down.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.140
If a downstream product--

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.970
citrate-- builds up, you
want to slow it down.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.570
And of course, a major
output of glycolysis is ATP.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.110
And if ATP is high, no reason
to continue oxidizing glucose

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.670
carbons.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.370
Now this regulation
we discussed is often

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.340
done at the allosteric level
by controlling enzyme rates.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.540
That can be via a small molecule
binding, as I've shown up here.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.940
And it could also
be via signaling.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.990
And that's really a place
where fructose 2,6-bisphosphate

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.700
as a combination of signaling,
and allosteric small molecules

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.540
comes into play.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.500
That is, you can have signaling
that controls the enzymes that

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.170
generate fructose
2,6-bisphosphate,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.440
thereby creating an additional
molecule that can act

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:41.230
as allosteric regulator of
the enzyme PFK to generate FBP

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.620
and commit carbon to glycolysis.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.160
Now we closed the
discussion last time

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.400
beginning to discuss
how it is that organisms

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.840
can make glucose.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.970
Obviously, this
glucose carbon that

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.020
is being oxidized to get ATP
has to come from somewhere.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.140
We mentioned that plants
make glucose during the day

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.460
when they have plenty of excess
energy from light from the sun

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.090
but then use that glucose to do
constant metabolism to maintain

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.760
their ATP levels at night.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.329
And we as animals obviously
take advantage of this

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.700
by eating the glucose
that ultimately

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.760
was created by plants using
the energy of the sun.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.840
We began to discuss an example
of where us, as organisms, also

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.620
make glucose.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.770
Of course, this is not
net production of glucose.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.250
But for instance, if our
muscle cells are working hard,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.630
lactate can build up.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.880
That lactate is
excreted into the blood.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.800
That lactate can then
be used by the liver

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.090
to regenerate glucose.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.100
And one of the major
jobs of the liver

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.940
is to maintain a constant
level of blood glucose

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.530
to continue to supply
fuel for various organs,

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.600
including the muscle to be
able to carry out the work

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.770
that it needs to do.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.020
And so this whole process
is called the Cori cycle.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.560
And a major job of
the liver is thus

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.650
generating glucose to
maintain blood glucose levels.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.410
And the pathways
used to do this is

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.500
a pathway that we began
to talk about last time

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.380
called gluconeogenesis.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.260
And it's really a discussion
of gluconeogenesis.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.670
That is, how can one
build a pathway in plants,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.950
in the liver, wherever, as
a way to generate glucose

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.980
from something like lactate?

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.110
Now, of course, we
know from last time,

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.540
lactate dehydrogenase
can, obviously, it's

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.450
a redox reaction to
interconvert with pyruvate.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:59.820
And what gluconeogenesis
really is

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.480
it's a pathway that
cells use to convert

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:10.000
pyruvate or really anything else
that can come into glycolysis--

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.310
and example being lactate.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.210
This, of course, can happen
by the lactate dehydrogenase

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.080
reaction.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.330
And then once it
has that pyruvate,

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.930
turn that pyruvate into glucose.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:25.720
That's really what we're
talking about when we're

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.070
discussing gluconeogenesis.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:33.360
Now how can we turn
pyruvate into glucose?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.430
Well, we just discussed
the whole pathway

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.310
where we could turn glucose
into pyruvate-- glycolysis.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.200
And so this is really the
reverse of glycolysis.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.490
I said many times that all
enzymes are reversible.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.890
So why can't we
just run the pathway

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:51.960
in the opposite direction?

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.450
Well, hopefully, if you've
been paying attention

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.220
for the last several
lectures, you

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.380
realize there's two
problems with doing that.

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.720
The first is that, remember,
why we're doing metabolism

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.410
in the first place is to
maintain a high ATP:ADP ratio

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:11.220
under conditions so that the
cell can use that ATP:ADP ratio

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.430
to carry out otherwise
unfavorable processes.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:16.200
And so thus, at a
very high level,

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.120
cells can't stop catabolism.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.960
Glycolysis or whatever has
to continue to maintain

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.967
ATP in the right range.

00:07:23.967 --> 00:07:26.550
And so now, if we're going to
do something anabolic-- that is,

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:29.790
build something,
turn it into glucose,

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.160
this has to happen
in the background

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.420
where catabolism
has still happened.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:37.560
And so at least you
need some kind of way

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.690
to control both and
prevent this from being

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.540
some kind of futile cycle.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.150
Second, even if that ATP level
is super high in the cell,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.470
it has extra energy, there is
still a thermodynamic problem

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:54.840
with just reversing glycolysis.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.140
And that is, remember, delta
G has to be less than 0

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.480
for any pathway to work.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:06.420
And so it then stands to reason
that if glucose oxidation

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:11.190
to pyruvate, if this
reaction is favored,

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:16.920
as it is in glycolysis,
that delta G is less than 0.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.420
Well, under the conditions
where that's occurring,

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.750
if we want to then say,
well, what about the reverse?

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.680
Let's switch the signs--

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.280
pyruvate to glucose.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.770
We know that delta
G is the same as it

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.050
was in the opposite
direction but,

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.860
now, changing the signs
from positive to negative

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:36.179
or negative positive.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.780
And so, thus, delta G,
for the reverse reaction,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.179
must be greater than
0 and, therefore, must

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.799
be spontaneous--

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.470
is not spontaneous.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.910
And therefore says that we need
to have a different pathway

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.950
simply for energetic
reasons if we're

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:55.440
going to go in the
opposite direction.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.830
Now oxidizing glucose
releases energy.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.760
That's how we keep the
ATP:ADP ratio high.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.370
It stands to reason
then that we are

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:08.420
going to have to put energy
in if we're going to run

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.630
in the opposite direction.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.230
And so if we're going to
build a pathway from pyruvate

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:19.640
to glucose, you can guess, we're
going to have to add couple

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.180
that pathway to
ATP-ADP hydrolysis--

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:27.440
that is, couple it to something
favorable to now allow

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.710
this otherwise unfavorable
reaction to happen.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.480
Now this energy, of course, in
plants can come from the sun.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.070
We'll discuss that
in great detail

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.990
when we get to photosynthesis.

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:44.890
However, for the sake
of you and I, I guess,

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.800
what it says is, if
you think about this,

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.040
if you release energy from
glycolysis, it makes sense

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.750
then you have to
add energy if you're

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:55.030
going to do gluconeogenesis.

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.330
But remember, to satisfy all
the laws of thermodynamics,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:03.610
the net energy loss to the
universe is going to be--

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:06.070
must exist, which
means that it is

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.550
going to cost more
energy to make glucose

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.040
than you're going to get
back from breaking it down.

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.780
That just, hopefully,
fits with your intuition.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:18.500
And it actually, I
guess, is good news,

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.500
because when are we
going to do anabolism?

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.780
When are we going to store
all these excess calories

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:23.802
as glucose?

00:10:23.802 --> 00:10:25.510
Well, we're going to
do it if we overeat.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:27.490
And if we overeat,
and it costs us

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.730
energy in the form of
calories to actually store

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.240
that energy for later, I guess,
it means that when we overeat,

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.320
we don't have things quite
as bad as it could have been.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.460
All right.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:44.600
Now let's get back to the
how one can actually do this.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.510
So if we want to think,
what is a pathway

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:50.020
that we can build to get from
pyruvate back to glucose?

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.320
Well, we know we're going to
have to burn some ATP to do it.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.630
But what are the issues with
simply reversing glycolysis?

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.440
Well, we can come back
here and say, well,

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.290
what was driving glycolysis
in the first place?

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.300
And it was these big steps
of free energy change

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.780
acts of hexokinase,
phosphofructokinase,

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.160
and pyruvate kinase.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.320
Where as many of
these other reactions,

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.870
at least under these
standard conditions that

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.230
are estimated to exist
in cells, are relatively

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.320
close to equilibrium.

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:24.280
So there's really no problem
with reversing glycolysis

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.950
across here or across there.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.860
The real issue comes from
getting around the hexokinase

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:33.580
to phosphofructokinase and
the pyruvate kinase step.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:35.860
These are the places
where the most energy

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.450
is released, if you
will, when you're

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.110
going through glycolysis.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:40.600
So those are the
steps we're going

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.890
to have to add energy in order
to reverse build a pathway that

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.020
goes in the opposite
direction and allows

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.720
you to start with pyruvate
and end up with glucose.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:12:04.070
And so what we will find is that
gluconeogenesis and glycolysis

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:13.690
use many of the same enzymes.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.380
However, not all of the
enzymes are the same

00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:19.390
because we need
different enzymes

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.930
if we're going to get
around this hexokinase,

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.770
phosphofructokinase, and
pyruvate kinase steps

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.370
of the pathway.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.420
And so for gluconeogenesis,
we essentially

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:36.360
need four new enzymes in order
to get past those places.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.110
So we're going to need
a new enzyme called

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.740
glucose 6-phosphatase.

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:44.350
And glucose
6-phosphatase is going

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:50.350
to allow us to get from
glucose 6-phosphate

00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:53.250
and turn it back into glucose.

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:54.270
All right.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:13:01.230
We're going to need an enzyme
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:06.480
which is going to allow us
to take FBP and turn it back

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:14.190
into fructose 6-phosphate.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.250
And then we're going to need
two enzymes to get around

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.960
the pyruvate kinase step.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:25.290
These are two enzymes
called PEPCK and PC.

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:27.000
That stands for
phosphoenolpyruvate

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.440
carboxykinase and
pyruvate carboxylase.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:32.430
I'll discuss these in
great detail in a minute.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:44.800
And these are going to allow
us to get from pyruvate back

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.330
to PEP.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.560
Also, essentially, I'll add
them up here to this diagram.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:14.140
So to get back from pyruvate
to PEP, two enzymes--

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.860
pyruvate carboxylase
and phosphoenolpyruvate

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.480
carboxykinase to get from
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.390
fructose 6-phosphate,
an enzyme called FBPase.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:40.410
And to get from glucose
6-phosphate back to glucose,

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.130
an enzyme called
glucose 6-phosphatase.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:55.560
OK.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.290
Now, of course,
if you think back,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.930
we're also going to need
to balance electrons

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.010
in the pathway.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.980
Remember, glucose to pyruvate
is an oxidation reaction.

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.740
That is, we're generating NADH.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.210
That means to go in
the reverse direction,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:15.720
we need a source of NADH to
reverse that GAPDH reaction.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.240
I just want to point
out that you're only

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.860
doing gluconeogenesis if
cells have plenty of energy.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:24.580
What does plenty of energy mean?

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:28.230
Well, that means the
ATP:ADP ratio is high

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:30.600
because you're doing
lots of metabolism.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.370
But if you're doing
lots of metabolism,

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:36.600
and the ATP:ADP ratio's high,
that also means the NADH/NAD+

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.980
ratio is high.

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.390
And so you can think
of the NAD regeneration

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.500
by gluconeogenesis as being,
for all intents and purposes,

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.690
an alternative to
fermentation, if you will,

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.600
as a way to keep
catabolism going.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.640
That is, you're only
doing this if you

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.620
have plenty of NADH around.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.210
And so dealing with
that electron balance

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:02.970
is less of an issue.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:03.900
OK.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.480
Now let's discuss briefly how
some of these enzymes work.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.950
So glucose 6-phosphate and
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase are

00:16:10.950 --> 00:16:13.110
very straightforward.

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:17.070
Effectively, all they are is
simply removing a phosphate.

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.600
That's very favorable.

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.250
Remember, when we
did those reactions

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:23.730
of hexokinase
phosphofructokinase reactions

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:27.750
and glycolysis, that, we
had to couple otherwise

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.040
unfavorable things--

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:32.560
adding a phosphate
group to ATP hydrolysis.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.940
This is the reverse of that.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.490
And so the reverse
of that, delta G

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:37.200
is going to be less than 0.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.280
Delta G less than 0 means we
just have a phosphatase there,

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:43.710
just like you might
have on a kinase enzyme.

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.570
That's very straightforward.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:50.640
But there's a much bigger issue
to get around this other step,

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.440
this pyruvate kinase step.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.675
Remember, equilibrium
strongly favored

00:16:54.675 --> 00:16:56.580
PEP to pyruvate conversion.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:16:58.830
That was one of the reasons
why we could use that step

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:03.300
to maintain a high
ATP:ADP ratio in cells.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.280
Well, now, the issue
becomes, how can we

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.329
trap that phosphate
back onto pyruvate

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:13.619
while generating
phosphoenolpyruvate?

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:18.390
How one does that is an issue.

00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:21.060
Even if the ATP:ADP
ratio is high,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:25.020
it's never high enough to
reverse pyruvate kinase on its

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:25.780
own.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.840
And so we need a new pathway
with two steps in it.

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.450
That's why there's two enzymes--

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:36.150
PC and PEPCK-- that are there
to create a pathway where

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:43.530
pyruvate to PEP now
becomes favorable.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:47.490
That is, where delta G
0 prime is less than 0.

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.640
That is, the equilibrium
favors to the right.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.370
And under cellular
conditions, this pathway

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:58.810
can actually happen such that
cells can net make glucose.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:03.660
Now these are two steps,
both of which require ATP.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.540
And so you effectively
get one ATP from PEP

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:07.800
to pyruvate conversion.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.710
It costs you to ADPs
or two ADP equivalents

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:15.240
to go back from pyruvate
to PEP, which makes sense.

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.980
You should have to
spend more energy

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:21.000
to go upstream than you
get back coming downstream.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.720
All right.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.490
Here's how this pathway works.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:38.970
So this is pyruvate,
the first reaction

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:50.470
catalyzed by PC, which stands
for pyruvate carboxylase.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:10.110
Couples ATP
hydrolysis to addition

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:27.270
of a CO2 that generates
this intermediate, which

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:35.520
is called oxaloacetate,
often abbreviated

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.355
OAA for Oxaloacetic Acid.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:46.770
That oxaloacetate is
then decarboxylated.

00:19:46.770 --> 00:19:54.790
That is, the CO2 that
is lost is removed--

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.010
that was added is removed.

00:19:57.010 --> 00:20:03.250
This reaction is coupled
to GTP and is catalyzed

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:28.750
by this enzyme, PEPCK
PEP carboxykinase

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:33.070
and uses that phosphate
from GTP to trap pyruvate in

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:37.660
the enol form as PEP
or phosphoenolpyruvate.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:43.550
great.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:49.990
So once you've
regenerated PEP, now

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:54.550
that PEP gets to this flat
part, if we go over here

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.230
to our delta G place.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:01.000
So now it can easily run
back across this flat part

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.050
of the curve.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:11.310
That is, go through enolase
phosphoglycerate mutase,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:19.900
phosphoglycerate kinase, GAPDH,
taking advantage of the high

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.920
NADH/NAD+ ratio that would
exist when you're doing

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.580
gluconeogenesis--
triosephosphate isomerase,

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:29.060
aldolase.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:33.190
This generates a DHAP and a
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate that

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:39.340
you can then combine to give
a fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.420
Now we get back here to now
we have this steep part there.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:47.770
But rather than
going through FBP,

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:53.470
we can just have a phosphatase,
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.420
that releases the phosphate.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:01.390
Now, we have
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.640
That fructose
6-phosphate can then

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.720
go through glucose
6-phosphate isomerase

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.490
and generate
glucose 6-phosphate.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.770
That now gets back to
this other steep hill.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.200
So this is relatively flat.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.720
Now, you have this steep
hill around hexokinase.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:25.885
But rather than coupling it to
adding to ATP-ADP hydrolysis,

00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:31.480
you just remove the phosphate
with glucose 6-phosphatase.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.560
And in the end, now
we have a pathway

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:45.380
using these four extra
enzymes that give us

00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:48.980
a way to start at pyruvate
and run the opposite direction

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:52.190
and generate glucose.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:23:00.120
And you can do so in a way that
is thermodynamically favorable.

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:11.340
In other words, we can start
with 2 pyruvate and use 4 ATP--

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:22.770
so and ATP to turn pyruvate
twice into oxaloacetate.

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.060
So that's two.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:30.390
And then another ATP at
phosphoglycerate kinase

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:33.910
to go backwards
there to go from--

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.960
to run that reaction
backwards, plus 2 GTP.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.610
Those 2 GTP are effectively
the equivalent of an ATP.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:52.530
So this would be
6 ATP equivalents.

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:55.590
Why are the GTPs
equivalent of ATP?

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.910
I just want to point out
that cells have enzymes

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:05.580
that basically can interconvert
ATP and GDP or, really,

00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:13.800
any nucleoside triphosphate and
diphosphate to GTP plus ADP.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.960
This has a delta G 0 prime
that is effectively 0.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.855
And so cells basically
match their ATP

00:24:21.855 --> 00:24:25.560
to ADP ratios with
any other ratios

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:30.330
of nucleoside triphosphates
and diphosphates because

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:31.240
of this reaction.

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.385
And so that's why the two GTP
are roughly an ATP equivalent.

00:24:35.385 --> 00:24:41.910
So we'll just call
it 6 ATP plus 2 NADH

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.550
to reverse the GAPDH step.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:25:00.080
That gives us 6 ADP plus 2 NAD+
plus 6 inorganic phosphate plus

00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:03.000
a glucose.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:10.020
The delta G 0 prime for
this entire coupled pathway

00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:15.150
is on the order of
negative 9 kcals per mol,

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:19.920
with the delta G less than 0,
equilibrium lies to the right.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:25.240
Net synthesis of
glucose is favorable.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:29.610
And so if we just think
about this in ATP terms,

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.010
remember, when we
discussed glycolysis,

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:37.470
you harvest net two ATP
from conversion of glucose

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:38.910
into two pyruvate.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:43.860
If we reverse the reaction doing
gluconeogenesis, in ATP terms,

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:48.090
we have to invest six ATP
to turn that pyruvate back

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.530
into glucose.

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:50.320
Makes sense.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.320
We didn't make a
perpetual motion machine.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.210
Both pathways are favorable.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:58.350
But it costs more energy to make
a glucose than we can get out

00:25:58.350 --> 00:26:00.915
by burning the glucose.

00:26:00.915 --> 00:26:03.940
I should say, the energy
isn't just the ATP.

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:06.720
There's also this NADH.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.180
That NADH that's produced from
glycolysis also is storing

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:15.960
energy, if you will, from
oxidation and an NADH/NAD+

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:19.560
ratio, and you're consuming
that going in the opposite

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.690
direction.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:26.130
You only do gluconeogenesis if
you have a high ATP:ADP ratio,

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:30.090
of course, and a
NADH/NAH+ plus ratio--

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.640
that is, if you have it
under the right conditions

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.310
to actually run this
pathway and have

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.960
it make sense for the cell.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.250
All right.

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.950
Now I want to
discuss, briefly, how

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.160
these enzymes in
gluconeogenesis work.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:48.910
I'm not going to spend time
on fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:50.530
or glucose 6-phosphatase.

00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.580
As I said before, this
is just hydrolysis

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:57.400
of that phosphate-alcohol bond.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.650
That's relatively
straightforward.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:04.360
But I do want to spend time
on pyruvate carboxylase

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.500
and PEP carboxykinase
because this introduces

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.900
a new reaction, carboxylation.

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:16.750
But it also introduces a
new concept in metabolism

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:21.760
that is actually quite
important in eukaryotic cells.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:36.350
And that is this issue of
so-called compartmentalized

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.670
metabolism.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.210
And, of course, you've learned
in introductory biology

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.790
that a big difference between
eukaryotes and prokaryotes

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.580
is eukaryotes have all of
these organelles-- that

00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:50.030
is, these membrane-bound
structures within cells that

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.440
carry out various functions.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.370
So one reason that
it's useful to have

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:58.280
these different
membrane-bound organelles

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:03.050
is it creates different
compartments within the cell.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:04.080
What does that mean?

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:11.420
Well, if you have
different compartments,

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:18.610
that means you can create
different conditions

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:21.160
within each compartment.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.403
And that's very
important for metabolism.

00:28:23.403 --> 00:28:25.195
Well, why is that
important for metabolism?

00:28:25.195 --> 00:28:30.070
Well, because, remember, whether
or not reactions are favorable

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.190
depend on delta G,
which, of course, is

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.680
dependent on the
equilibrium constant, which

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.130
is related to delta
G 0 prime but also

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:43.420
to the ratio of the
products and reactants

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.330
within that compartment.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:48.160
And so by having
different compartments,

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:53.500
you can have different
ratios of metabolites-- say,

00:28:53.500 --> 00:29:00.580
a different ratio of ATP to ATP
or a different ratio of NADH

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.190
to NAD+.

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:08.320
Having those different ratios
means that because delta G is

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:16.575
proportional to the ratio of the
reactants over the products--

00:29:16.575 --> 00:29:22.330
I'm sorry-- products
over reactants,

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.880
by having different
ratios of things

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.920
like ATP and ADP, NAD, NADH,
you can make different reactions

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.370
more or less favorable
depending on which

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:37.270
compartment in the cell
that they're located.

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:41.710
Now it turns out that glycolysis
and most of gluconeogenesis

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:45.310
takes place in the cytosol
of eukaryotic cells.

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:47.890
The cytosol is
basically the space

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:52.450
inside the cell that's not
inside another organelle.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:58.000
However, pyruvate carboxylase
is a reaction that takes place

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.820
in mitochondria because
mitochondria have

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.790
a particularly
high ATP:ADP ratio.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:08.260
And it turns out, this helps
favor the pyruvate carboxylase

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.560
reaction.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.460
And so we'll talk a lot about
reactions in the site cytosol

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.140
versus the mitochondria.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:18.820
But basically, here's
glucose to PEP.

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.790
Whether you do that in one
direction by glycolysis

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.160
or the other direction
by gluconeogenesis,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.710
that happens in
the cytosol as does

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.530
turning that PEP into pyruvate.

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:32.590
But if you're going to
reverse the reaction,

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:37.300
eukaryotes take advantage
of a different compartment,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:44.950
the mitochondria, with
a high ATP to ADP ratio.

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:50.860
And basically, in
the mitochondria,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.820
turn that pyruvate
into oxaloacetic acid--

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:58.690
that is, carry out the
pyruvate carboxylase reaction.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:07.480
And then that pyruvate
carboxylase reaction

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.470
generates oxaloacetic
acid, and then PEPCK

00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:14.680
can, either in the
mitochondria or in the cytosol,

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:17.290
generate PEP.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:22.765
And so here's a place where
one can run one reaction--

00:31:22.765 --> 00:31:25.870
PEP to pyruvate of t
make ATP in the cytosol--

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:27.570
but a different reaction--

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.200
pyruvate carboxylase
to turn pyruvate

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.630
into oxaloacetic
acid that would then

00:31:31.630 --> 00:31:36.310
be used for PEPCK to
turn that back into PEP

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:40.300
and have that take place
in the mitochondria.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:45.100
I want to point out, just so
for MCAT exams and things like

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:49.300
that, PEPCK is
classically defined

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.030
as a cytosolic
activity, at least

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.920
in terms of gluconeogenesis.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:56.740
Although, there is a
mitochondrial isoform of PEPCK.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:59.788
And it's at least
somewhat debated.

00:31:59.788 --> 00:32:01.330
There's some evidence
that, at least,

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:06.070
in some tissues, that might be
important for gluconeogenesis

00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.620
as well.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.345
And so that's why I draw it
as PEPCK using oxaloacetate

00:32:10.345 --> 00:32:14.330
to PEP either in the
mitochondria or in the cytosol

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:19.780
because that's an area of
active investigation right now.

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.490
All right.

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.200
Let's start by talking about how
does pyruvate carboxylase work?

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.890
This is an example of a
carboxylase reaction, that is,

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:34.480
adding a CO2 group to a molecule
to make a carbon-carbon bond.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:39.010
That purple CO2 is added
to the CH3 of pyruvate of

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:42.100
to make oxaloacetate.

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:48.790
And how this happens, in
many cases, uses a cofactor.

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:53.110
And that cofactor
is called biotin.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:58.240
Biotin, like many
cofactors, is a vitamin.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.480
And this provides a
useful functional group.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:06.430
In this case, enzymes
that use biotin

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:11.560
use ATP to basically drive
CO2 addition to biotin.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.740
And then that CO2 on
the biotin is then

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:18.790
activated to be transferred
to another molecule

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:21.410
in a carboxylation reaction.

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:21.910
All right.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.940
So what does biotin look like?

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:25.990
I will draw it for you.

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.780
So this, here, would be biotin.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:02.390
I've drawn it in the
enolate form of biotin.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.180
I'll draw it in a
different way in a second.

00:34:05.180 --> 00:34:13.429
Biotin is typically bound
to a lysine molecule

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:16.520
in the active site of an
enzyme that uses this.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:19.580
And so this, here, is
basically a peptide bond

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:26.179
between the terminal amino
group, the epsilon amino group

00:34:26.179 --> 00:34:30.440
of the side chain of
a lysine in a residue

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.270
that basically
makes a peptide bond

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:38.690
to link biotin into the active
site of the enzyme that's

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:40.580
using it.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:45.320
Biotin is often drawn
in the keto form.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:48.050
And the active part
of biotin is basically

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:50.429
this top part of the molecule.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:55.429
And so to draw it to see
differences between the enolate

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.190
and keto form, I just
want to show that quickly.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:04.160
I drew it in the enolate
form because it's easier

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.320
to see, I think, how it--

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:19.700
so this, here, would
be the keto form where

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:23.340
biotin is drawn most commonly.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.300
And basically, the
reaction, the way biotin

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.070
picks up a CO2 is as follows.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:37.630
And that is CO2 can
exist particularly

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:46.610
under basic conditions
as CO2 or as--

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.040
this is bicarbonate.

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:57.500
OK.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.740
So bicarbonate-- turns out,
some enzymes use CO2 directly.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.610
Some enzymes use bicarbonate.

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:11.600
It turns out that pyruvate
carboxylase uses bicarbonate.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.710
So biotin bound in the active
site of pyruvate carboxylase

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:20.610
will utilize bicarbonate
in the following way.

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:23.810
And I'll just point out that
the pH of the mitochondria

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:26.420
is also more basic,
which also helps

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.750
this pyruvate
carboxylation reaction.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:30.290
All right.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:33.590
So what happens is
this bicarbonate

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.355
is phosphorylated by ATP.

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:55.400
This phospho
intermediate can then

00:36:55.400 --> 00:37:07.060
react with this active
site here of biotin

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.540
to release the phosphate.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:29.580
And now, you now have
this activated CO2 group

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.640
that's attached to the biotin.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:48.940
Here's pyruvate drawn
in the enol form.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.540
You can look back in your notes
about how to interconvert it

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.980
between keto and the enol form.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.240
I've shown that several times.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:09.640
And then this, then, can
end up adding this CO2

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:23.980
to the end of
pyruvate to generate

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:30.710
oxaloacetic acid plus
regenerate the biotin

00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:34.830
cofactor in the right form.

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:37.040
It'll be the keto
form, which can then

00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:38.660
get back to the enol form.

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:42.990
And it's ready to do
another catalytic cycle.

00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:46.310
And so, basically,
pyruvate carboxylase

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:51.140
uses ATP to produce this
carboxylate of biotin.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.735
And then uses that
to add the CO2

00:38:53.735 --> 00:38:58.850
to pyruvate to generate
oxaloacetic acid.

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:03.760
Now I want to point out
that oxaloacetic acid is

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:09.400
both an alpha keto
acid like pyruvate was.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:11.750
And it's a beta keto acid.

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:20.380
And so this ketone is alpha
to that carboxylic acid.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:23.930
And it's beta to
that carboxylic acid.

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:29.170
So it's both an alpha
and a beta keto acid.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:31.970
And it turns out
that the way PEPCK

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:38.350
works is it takes advantage of
the favorable decarbonization

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.720
of a beta keto acid,
which we talked about

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:48.280
last time, along with GTP to
phosphorylate pyruvate and trap

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.720
it in the enol form.

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.980
And so this is how PEPCK works.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:59.350
So I'm going to draw GTP
in this very stylized way--

00:39:59.350 --> 00:40:02.095
so guanine with three
phosphate groups.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:17.010
There's oxaloacetate.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:36.180
That decarboxylates--
takes advantage

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:44.330
of this being a beta keto
acid to decarboxylate and add

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:45.170
the phosphate.

00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:58.400
And that's how we
can generate PEP.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.040
OK.

00:40:59.040 --> 00:40:59.540
Great.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:03.560
And so that's how you can
build a different pathway that

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:07.490
uses ATP and GTP
for energy input

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:12.850
in order to run glycolysis
in the opposite direction--

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:14.750
gluconeogenesis.

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.470
All right.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:20.180
So how is gluconeogenesis
regulated?

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:23.840
Well, just like the principles
we talked about in glycolysis,

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.100
it works in a way
that makes sense.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.770
And so you can guess
that the steps that

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:30.200
are going to be
regulated are exactly

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:33.710
the ones that you might guess.

00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:37.330
They were the same
steps that were

00:41:37.330 --> 00:41:39.520
regulated running glycolysis.

00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:42.730
It's going to be these
big changes where

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:48.310
energy changes occur across
the pathway, which are also

00:41:48.310 --> 00:41:50.620
the entrance and
exit of the pathway.

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:55.640
And basically, regulation
has to be reciprocal.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.830
So in glycolysis, you want
to increase glycolysis

00:41:59.830 --> 00:42:05.500
under conditions where
you need to produce ATP.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.500
And you want to
decrease glycolysis

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:16.960
if you have enough ATP or enough
of another downstream product,

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.700
such as citrate.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.870
All right.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:28.160
Well, gluconeogenesis is going
to be exactly the opposite.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.810
You certainly don't want
to do gluconeogenesis

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.490
if you need energy release.

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:38.060
If you need ATP, you don't
want to run gluconeogenesis.

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:42.530
However, you want to
increase gluconeogenesis,

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:46.800
if the cell has ATP
excess, you also

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.080
want to do it if you have
excess of other products

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:59.450
like citrate because why go
through the trouble of sending

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:02.150
things down glycolysis if
you have nowhere to put it.

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:06.020
You might as well, instead, make
glucose or shunt that glucose

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:09.630
off to produce glycogen.

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:20.780
And so let me just add
that regulation here.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:26.510
And so major regulators of
gluconeogenesis are as follows.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:31.920
And so high levels of citrate
is going to stimulate fructose

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.320
1,6-bisphosphatase.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.560
So high levels of citrate will
inhibit things coming through

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:42.360
glycolysis and activate
gluconeogenesis by acting

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:49.200
at fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase
to match the energy

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.590
considerations.

00:43:51.590 --> 00:43:56.015
If you have high levels of
AMP, energy charge is low.

00:43:56.015 --> 00:44:01.070
You want to stimulate glycolysis
at phosphofructokinase.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.990
Similarly, that's going
to inhibit gluconeogenesis

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:07.700
at FBPase.

00:44:07.700 --> 00:44:11.780
And it turns out,
high levels of ADP--

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:15.240
I'm sorry-- yeah, high levels
of ADP, low energy charge,

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.530
also inhibits PEPCK
because you also

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:23.890
don't want to try to generate
PEP under those conditions.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.770
Great.

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:32.280
All right.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:37.860
Now in animals, we also want
to regulate glucose catabolism

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.340
and production under
signaling control.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.280
And this gets back to this
other topic we talked about,

00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.690
such as the liver's job being
to maintain a constant level

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.580
of blood sugars.

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:54.480
Most of you are very familiar
with blood sugar control

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.830
through diabetes.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:58.560
You've probably heard that
this is under hormonal control,

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.650
that the job of insulin
is to lower blood glucose.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:04.950
And you also have hormones
like epinephrine or glucagon

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.650
whose job is to
raise blood glucose.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.330
Why do you want to
raise blood glucose?

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.840
Well, if you have some kind
of fight-or-flight response--

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.090
you see that lion, and
you need to run away,

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:17.130
your body has this
adrenaline rush.

00:45:17.130 --> 00:45:18.600
That's what epinephrine is.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.450
That basically wants to supply
more energy to your muscles,

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.930
so that you can run
away effectively.

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:27.870
So it turns out, both
insulin and glucose act

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:29.370
on lots of tissues in the body.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:32.340
I'm going to focus on
what they do in the liver.

00:45:32.340 --> 00:45:34.320
And that's because
in the liver, this

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.460
is a major organ that
regulates blood glucose levels.

00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:44.130
So if you have excess glucose
around, what do you want to do?

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.950
You want to stimulate
glucose uptake

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.860
into cells, its metabolism,
and its storage.

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.200
And so insulin with
high blood sugar

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.760
basically wants to stimulate,
taking glucose into the liver

00:45:56.760 --> 00:46:00.460
and storing it as glycogen.

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:03.580
If you want to run
away from the lion,

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.470
well, now you have
epinephrine around.

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:06.970
You want to make
sure that as you're

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:08.770
consuming that
glucose in your blood

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:10.660
that you're continually
making more.

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:14.320
And so you want the epinephrine
to stimulate release of glucose

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:18.160
either from gluconeogenesis
or from the breakdown

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:23.650
of glycogen. And both
of these hormones act--

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:27.190
insulin and epinephrine--
act at a level

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.530
where they can regulate
enzymes of glycolysis

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:33.430
and gluconeogenesis as well
as entry and exit of glucose

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.380
monomers in and out of glycogen.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:44.350
And so this is an example of
how fructose 2,6-bisphosphate

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:44.930
works.

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:49.150
And so remember you learned
from Professor Yaffe

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:57.590
that epinephrine acts via
cyclic AMP signaling, which

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.690
turns on a kinase--

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:03.740
protein kinase A. And that
protein kinase A can regulate

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:09.680
enzymes that produce or
break down, basically,

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:12.560
these enzymes that produce
or break down fructose

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.590
2,6-bisphosphatase
which, in turn,

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:20.990
regulates PFK activities such
that you can match your need

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:25.640
to burn that glucose versus
doing gluconeogenesis

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.790
in the case of the liver, so you
can do enough gluconeogenesis

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:36.830
in order to have glucose around
for the body to use in that

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:40.530
fight-or-flight response
being driven by epinephrine.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:46.270
Now a major effective insulin
and epinephrine signaling,

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:53.020
though, is actually on release
or storage of glucose molecules

00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.140
in glycogen. And I alluded
last time in talking

00:47:56.140 --> 00:48:00.520
about the regulation hexokinase
that glucose 6-phosphate is

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.420
basically the entry point
to get glucose units in

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:08.260
and out of glycogen.
And I want to discuss

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.550
how you add and
subtract those glucose

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.680
units into storage polymers.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.230
Now I'm going to discuss it
in the context of glycogen

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.010
storage in humans.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.690
But remember, plants
actually store things also

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:24.730
as glucose polymers.

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.260
The chemistry is very similar.

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:30.760
But, obviously, the
regulation is very different.

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:34.960
Now you'll hopefully
recall from past

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:39.430
lectures that these storage
polymers of glucose--

00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:43.450
glycogen in humans,
starch in plants--

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:48.670
are basically these alpha 1,4
linkages of glucose molecules.

00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:50.410
Remember, there was
a non-reducing end

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.580
and a reducing end
of the molecule.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:55.420
So starch was a
straight-chain polymer.

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:59.950
Glycogen had these
alpha 1,6 branch points

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:02.200
that made this
branch polymer, where

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:07.870
there's lots of non-reducing
ends and a single reducing end.

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:10.300
And each of these
non-reducing ends

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.810
is a polymer of glucose
molecules with this alpha 1,4

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.590
linkage that, at the branch
point, has this alpha 1,6

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:23.200
linkage to make this
long-chain branched polymer.

00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:25.630
Now when we discussed
this at the time,

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.730
I mentioned that this
is useful because you

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:30.430
have all these
non-reducing ends that

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:34.270
can be used to add or
subtract glucose monomers.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:35.200
And that's great.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:38.140
This is a nice compact form
of storage with lots of places

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:40.240
to put or remove glucose from.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.490
You either store
it quickly, insulin

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.020
driving glucose storage--

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:47.710
or remove it quickly,
epinephrine driving release

00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:52.040
of glucose from the glycogen.

00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.020
And so if we're going to have
a way to add glucose polymers

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.110
or break them down, those are
two separate pathways, just

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:01.660
like glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis--

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:04.240
reciprocal activities,
but we need two pathways

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:08.650
to do it because delta G has to
be less than 0 for each pathway

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:09.640
to work.

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.370
Also, we have to be able to
regulate these separately

00:50:12.370 --> 00:50:16.150
because we don't want
to have a futile cycle.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:23.590
Now the way you add and subtract
glucose polymers to glycogen

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:32.190
acts through glucose 6-phosphate
being first converted

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:34.170
to glucose 1-phosphate.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:44.950
So this, here, is alpha
glucose 6-phosphate.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:47.450
Remember, it's alpha because I
drew that hydroxyl at the one

00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:49.650
position pointing down.

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:56.140
This, obviously, can
enter glycolysis and come

00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:01.330
in from glucose via hexokinase.

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:01.830
All right.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:10.380
This is first converted
via a mutase reaction

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:14.865
to move the phosphate from the
6 to the 1 position of glucose.

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:32.870
So this, here, is
glucose 1-phosphate.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:34.580
The way the mutase
reaction works

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:37.220
is exactly the same
analogous mechanism

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.840
that I explained for
phosphoglycerate mutase

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.390
in glycolysis--

00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:44.840
moves the phosphate in this case
from the 6 to the 1 position

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.760
of glucose.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.150
And then once you have that
glucose 1-phosphate, that

00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:58.310
can be added to a non-reducing
end of a glycogen polymer

00:51:58.310 --> 00:52:09.560
using an enzyme called
Glycogen Synthase, GS.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:16.590
So that'll give me
a glycogen molecule

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:20.730
with one additional monomer
added to the non-reducing end

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:22.770
of the polymer.

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:26.340
And you release that
glucose back off

00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.400
via a different pathway,
a different enzyme

00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:31.560
called phosphorylase.

00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.250
All right.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:44.400
Now the activity
of these enzymes--

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.850
glycogen synthase
and phosphorylase--

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:51.090
that is, the pathway to add
glucose 1-phosphate glucose

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:55.590
monomer to the polymer versus
remove it from the polymer

00:52:55.590 --> 00:53:02.760
is under hormonal signaling
control in animals.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:07.905
And basically, that hormonal
signaling works as follows.

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:46.090
So phosphorylase can
be phosphorylated

00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:55.640
or dephosphorylated via a
signaling enzyme, an enzyme

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:07.330
like phosphorylase
kinase, which is

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:15.310
downstream of PKA, which is
downstream of epinephrine

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:16.420
signaling.

00:54:16.420 --> 00:54:17.410
OK.

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:22.750
And so when phosphorylase is
phosphorylated by phosphorylase

00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:25.660
kinase-- that has, has a
phosphate group added is

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.430
a signaling cascade--

00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:29.320
it is in the active state.

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:36.290
And when it's dephosphorylated,
it's in the inactive state.

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:40.820
Well, glycogen synthase also
is subject to regulation

00:54:40.820 --> 00:54:44.990
by protein phosphorylation
on the enzyme by a kinase.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:48.750
Except this has the
opposite relationship.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:56.460
So when it is in the
phosphorylated state,

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.580
it is inactive.

00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:03.180
But it is in the
non-phosphorylated state,

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.720
it is active.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:14.310
And so protein kinase A, which
is downstream of epinephrine,

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:18.720
can both activate
phosphorylation

00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.840
of phosphorylase and
glycogen synthase.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.610
And that makes sense.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:27.090
You want to release
glycogen glucose monomers

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:30.930
from glycogen. You turn on, by
phosphorylation, the pathway

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.100
to release them.

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.940
And you turn off the
pathway to store them.

00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:39.475
Another kinase
that phosphorylates

00:55:39.475 --> 00:55:43.900
to glycogen synthase is a kinase
called GSK or Glycogen Synthase

00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:44.950
Kinase.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:50.200
This kinase is inhibited
by insulin signaling.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:55.300
And so this is a
negative of a negative.

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:58.480
So effectively, a
negative of a negative

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:03.610
will keep it in
the inactive state.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:08.410
And so insulin, by
inhibiting the ability of GSK

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:11.650
to put glycogen synthase
in the inactive state,

00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:13.900
will make glycogen
synthase active.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:16.000
And when you have
high insulin around,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.850
that actives glycogen
synthesis, and you

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:21.820
store glucose
monomers as glycogen.

00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:24.020
Get them out of the blood.

00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.230
OK.

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:40.820
Now let's discuss
the chemistry that

00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:45.950
allows us to do this glycogen
synthase and phosphorylates

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:46.850
reactions.

00:57:14.490 --> 00:57:16.740
Now as we go through
this, what you will see

00:57:16.740 --> 00:57:22.420
is that when we break down the
polymer, energy is released.

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.440
So that's going to be
breaking down a polymer.

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.510
That's the right
direction of entropy.

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:28.370
And so that's going
to be released.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.350
And storing it is going
to require energy.

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:32.392
That is, you're going to
have to have some energy

00:57:32.392 --> 00:57:33.830
input to build a polymer.

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:36.740
But nature actually
does this in a way that

00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:41.560
is actually quite efficient.

00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:50.430
First, let's talk about how you
store glucose 1-phosphate units

00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:54.870
by adding them to glycogen.
So this uses energy input

00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:59.280
from UTP, which is an ATP
equivalent for exactly

00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.780
the reason I described earlier.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:06.000
That is, because ATP plus UDP,
like any other interconversion

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.730
of nucleoside triphosphates
and diphosphates

00:58:08.730 --> 00:58:10.410
is very close to equilibrium.

00:58:10.410 --> 00:58:13.830
So the UTP to UDP ratio should
be similar to the ATP the ADP

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:14.670
ratio.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:17.220
And so UTP is really
an ATP equivalent.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:20.820
But nature, for whatever
reason, decided to use UTP here.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:27.180
And it generates a nucleoside
sugar called UDP glucose.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.510
And so let me show
you what that is.

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:41.455
So here is glucose 1-phosphate.

00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:59.770
I will draw a stylized
version of UTP here.

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:29.990
And so this molecule with
the UDP added to the glucose

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:36.320
is UDP glucose.

00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:41.600
This will also generate
a pyrophosphate.

00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:46.220
And that pyrophosphate
can be hydrolyzed

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:49.550
to generate two inorganic
phosphates, effectively,

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:54.020
like building any other polymer,
by doing this downstream--

00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:57.290
keeping that product of
the first reaction low

00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:02.360
helps pull that reaction
forward for polymer synthesis.

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:11.810
This UDP glucose can now react
with the non-reducing end.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:25.570
So this, here, will be
the non-reducing end

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:28.070
of the polymer.

01:00:28.070 --> 01:00:31.580
That's the OH group
at the 4 position,

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.440
at the non-producing end.

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:46.360
And so that then
generates that alpha 1,4

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.480
bond to add to the polymer.

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:57.340
So here, we have glycogen
n plus 1 plus releases UDP.

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:02.740
And so the net to add
a glucose 1-phosphate

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.100
to the non-reducing end of
the growing glycogen polymer

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.720
is net conversion
of a UTP to a UDP.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:17.380
So that is one ATP equivalent
to add glucose 1-phosphate

01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:23.000
to the end of the polymer.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.180
Now, of course,
you had it to also

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:30.690
have an ATP from hexokinase
to capture that glucose

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:32.550
6-phosphate to begin with.

01:01:32.550 --> 01:01:37.890
But effectively, this
is two ADP molecules

01:01:37.890 --> 01:01:49.320
to add a glucose to
glycogen. All right.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.590
Now if we're generating starch,
that's all we have to do,

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:53.940
just build a long polymer.

01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.650
But if we're making
glycogen, remember,

01:01:55.650 --> 01:02:00.510
glycogen has all of these
branch points on them as well.

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:02.550
And to do the branch
points, you basically

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:05.640
have to make this alpha 1,6
bond, which then gives you

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:11.540
two new non-reducing ends that
you can add more subunits to.

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:15.030
The way nature does
this is as follows.

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:22.110
And so if I just draw this
here in a stylized way,

01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:28.020
it turns out, once you
get to about seven units

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:29.960
here in the growing polymer--

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:34.500
so this is the reducing end,
and this is the non-reducing end

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.680
of the polymer.

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:39.750
And so the polymer is growing
by adding things to that end.

01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.970
Once you get about
seven, there's

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:45.750
an enzyme that will basically
cleave this, and move it

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:50.050
and make a new alpha 1,6 bond.

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:51.420
OK.

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:52.300
Here we go.

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:59.060
We have our reducing
and our non-reducing end

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:06.090
and basically transfers
these 7 units over.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:09.630
And now, we have two
non-reducing ends

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:16.950
that we can continue to
grow the polymer from.

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:20.820
You can think of this
like the airplane analogy.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:24.150
When you load an airplane,
at least the way that's

01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:25.980
most efficient,
the people who are

01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:28.590
sitting in the back of the
plane, they get on first.

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:30.990
But then, they're
the last people off

01:03:30.990 --> 01:03:34.110
the plane because
you add basically

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.420
to these non-reducing
ends, and then

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.820
you subtract from those
non-reducing ends.

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:42.900
And so the first glucose added,
the one at the reducing end,

01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:47.420
is the last one that
is going to be removed.

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:48.980
All right.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.650
Now phosphorylase
is the enzyme that

01:03:51.650 --> 01:03:53.750
allows you to do the
opposite-- that is,

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:58.310
to break that alpha 1,4
bond and release monomers.

01:03:58.310 --> 01:04:00.740
And it's called
phosphorylase because it

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:05.330
uses phosphate to break
that alpha 1,4 bond,

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:08.150
taking advantage of the fact
that breaking down the polymer

01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:12.080
is favorable and actually
releasing the glucose from it

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:15.030
again is a glucose 1-phosphate.

01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:18.410
And so at the non-reducing
end of the molecule--

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.960
so this, here, would
be the non-reducing end

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.270
of the glycogen polymer.

01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:55.920
You basically have a phosphate
molecule that takes that off,

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:21.940
so you have a glycogen n minus
1 plus a glucose 1 phosphate,

01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.910
which can now undergo
a mutase reaction back

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:26.340
to glucose 6-phosphate
that could then be released

01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.200
from the cell if
it's a liver, or it

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:30.870
could be burned in glycolysis.

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:33.450
Now, obviously, if you're
doing breakdown, that is,

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:36.240
your chewing back from
non-reducing ends,

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:42.990
eventually, you're going
to hit a situation where

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:47.220
you come to where there's just a
nub here with an alpha 1,6 bond

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:48.030
there.

01:05:48.030 --> 01:05:51.930
That is, chew it back till
you hit this single monomer

01:05:51.930 --> 01:05:56.040
with a non-reducing end here
to this alpha 1,6 break point.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.760
Turns out, you just cleave
off that nub, if you will.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:04.920
And so that nub is then just
released as free glucose.

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:08.340
So other than release of
that nub, what it means

01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:14.280
is that you actually
basically get

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:19.330
no ATP to actually break down
in the phosphorylase reaction.

01:06:19.330 --> 01:06:24.630
So the net cost to store a
glucose 1-phosphate molecule

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:31.440
is one ATP via the UTP to UDP
conversion in the glycogen

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.880
synthase reaction.

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:36.600
And you get that one
glucose 1-phosphate back.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:40.470
And so two ATPs to put
a glucose tin glycogen.

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:42.030
And then you get
it directly back

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:45.630
out as a glucose 1-phosphate.

01:06:45.630 --> 01:06:48.960
That's a phosphorylated glucose
that can then enter glycolysis.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.890
So that's one less phosphate
you need to spend on glycolysis.

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:57.640
And so it's incredibly efficient
to store glucose in that way.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.240
And so it's actually
slightly greater than one ATP

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:04.185
to store it as glycogen because
you lose in ATP with that nub

01:07:04.185 --> 01:07:06.300
removal at the branch polymer.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.710
But for all intents
and purposes,

01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:12.850
it costs one ATP to store
your glucose as glycogen,

01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:15.210
which is pretty amazing.

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:16.140
All right.

01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:19.710
Now before I leave the
topic of sugar storage,

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:22.890
I want to make some comments
on some sugars that are stored

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:24.930
in forms other than glucose.

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:27.090
And want to talk about
these because these sugars

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:29.280
are, of course, important
parts of our diet.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:35.270
And so as we've mentioned
in prior lectures,

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:42.890
two of these sugars are
sucrose and lactose.

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:45.440
So remember, sucrose
is a disaccharide

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.450
of glucose plus fructose.

01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:58.390
And lactose is a disaccharide
of glucose plus galactose.

01:07:58.390 --> 01:08:01.300
So those are storage
forms of sugar-- sucrose

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.430
in the case of plants,
lactose in the case

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:06.430
of milk made by mammals.

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:11.080
And so to break
those sugars down,

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.897
basically, you break
the disaccharide.

01:08:13.897 --> 01:08:15.355
Now, you have the
glucose molecules

01:08:15.355 --> 01:08:16.479
you know how to handle.

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:17.783
That's glycolysis.

01:08:17.783 --> 01:08:19.450
But I want to spend
a little bit of time

01:08:19.450 --> 01:08:22.540
how you deal with the
fructose and the galactose

01:08:22.540 --> 01:08:25.420
that you get out
from these sugars

01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:28.430
because this actually
relates to some things

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:31.569
that I'm sure you've all
read about in the news.

01:08:31.569 --> 01:08:36.340
For instance, fructose
as a sugar in our diet

01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:39.430
is actually quite controversial.

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:42.040
Lots of stuff out there
that says fructose

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:46.540
was cooked up in the devil's
kitchen and is this evil thing.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.250
There's actually
others who argue

01:08:48.250 --> 01:08:50.410
that, oh, fructose is
the same as glucose,

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:52.490
the same number of calories.

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:53.920
There's both sides
of the debate.

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.470
Both sides are actually
making factual claims.

01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.930
And I want you to
understand the biochemistry,

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:01.930
so you can actually
judge for yourself

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:04.729
who's right in those claims.

01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:05.229
All right.

01:09:05.229 --> 01:09:06.771
So let's start with
talking about how

01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:09.010
you metabolize fructose.

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:18.490
And so fructose is first
captured by phosphorylation

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:25.390
to generate fructose
1-phosphate.

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:31.510
This is carried out by an
enzyme called ketohexokinase.

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:35.229
Ketohexokinase is an
enzyme this present

01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:36.640
in your gut and your liver.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.729
And so fructose in the diet,
from breaking down sucrose

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:41.859
or from high-fructose
corn syrup, whatever,

01:09:41.859 --> 01:09:45.880
is captured with ketohexokinase
to make fructose 1-phosphate.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.479
Turns out that
phosphofructokinase,

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:51.069
our old friend from
glycolysis, is less efficient

01:09:51.069 --> 01:09:54.170
than ketohexokinase but can
also carry out this reaction.

01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:56.410
And remember, what is
it do in glycolysis?

01:09:56.410 --> 01:09:58.395
It adds a phosphate
to the 1 position

01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.395
of fructose 6-phosphate.

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.240
Well, it can also
add a phosphate

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:06.040
to the 1 position of fructose
give you fructose 1-phosphate.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:06.880
OK.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.030
Once you have this fructose
1-phosphate, which, remember,

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:14.620
is not in glycolysis,
it can be a substrate

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:20.590
for the glycolytic
enzyme aldolase.

01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:22.810
What does aldolase
do in glycolysis?

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:26.080
It splits FBP into
dihydroxyacetone phosphate

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.300
and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:31.580
Well, here, you only have a
phosphate on the 1 position.

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:34.600
And so if you look back at how
aldolase works, what you'll see

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:39.190
is that if aldolase acts
on fructose 1-phosphate,

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:41.710
you'll generate a
dihydroxyacetone phosphate.

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:45.070
That phosphate will go to the
dihydroxyacetone half, which,

01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:50.500
of course, is perfectly good
substrate for glycolysis.

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:55.060
The other product of aldolase
acting on fructose 1-phosphate

01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:01.690
is just glyceraldehyde
without the phosphate on it.

01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.710
And then there's
another enzyme that

01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:16.670
will phosphorylate
glyceraldehyde to generate

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:21.230
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate,
which can then also, of course,

01:11:21.230 --> 01:11:23.210
enter glycolysis.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:27.170
And so fructose is a
hexose just like glucose.

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:29.090
You generate two trioses--

01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:31.670
DHAP and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate.

01:11:31.670 --> 01:11:35.600
That costs you two ATP to
do it, exactly the same cost

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:41.010
is what you spent to get glucose
to make DHAP and glyceraldehyde

01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.270
3-phosphate.

01:11:42.270 --> 01:11:44.510
And so people are
absolutely right when

01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:47.360
they say metabolizing
fructose has

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:53.180
exactly the same caloric cost
as metabolizing glucose--

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.700
two ATPs to get it
into the trioses.

01:11:55.700 --> 01:11:57.200
And then whatever
you get out of it,

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.710
you get out of it
two ATPs, four ATPs--

01:12:00.710 --> 01:12:05.120
so net two ATPs if you
just do fermentation, more

01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.310
if you do complete oxidation.

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:10.670
But the bottom line is
that from that standpoint,

01:12:10.670 --> 01:12:13.400
you get exactly the
same number of calories

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:16.880
from burning glucose
versus fructose.

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.480
However, I want to point out
that the regulation will not

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:21.690
be the same.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:26.210
And that's because in
this fructose metabolism,

01:12:26.210 --> 01:12:30.680
you will notice that there
was no glucose 6-phosphate

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.360
and no FBP generated.

01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:40.030
That means you are avoiding
all of the feedbacks

01:12:40.030 --> 01:12:44.182
that control how much glucose
you send to glycolysis--

01:12:44.182 --> 01:12:45.640
first to glycogen.
Remember, that's

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.390
what glucose 6-phosphate does,
acting on trapping sugar.

01:12:49.390 --> 01:12:52.330
And more importantly,
you're actually

01:12:52.330 --> 01:12:56.830
not using
phosphofructokinase in a way

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:02.470
to fit with the rest of
the feedback regulation.

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:05.680
I also show that
here on this slide.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.740
It's basically a better
version of what I drew up here.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:17.440
And I now want to point
out this storage of citrate

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.400
and this feedback
regulation of citrate.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.650
So we'll talk
about the specifics

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:26.170
of this more in other lectures.

01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:29.620
But it turns out,
citrate is the precursor

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:33.100
for how one stores
carbon as fat.

01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.190
And so if you're
putting fructose glucose

01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:39.640
into the system and
citrate is too high,

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.740
it'll shut off
phosphofructokinase

01:13:41.740 --> 01:13:44.260
and stop carbon coming
down the system,

01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:46.930
shunting it instead to glycogen
or just saying don't give me

01:13:46.930 --> 01:13:48.970
any more glucose at all.

01:13:48.970 --> 01:13:51.340
If I'm doing the same
thing with fructose,

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:53.050
those feedbacks don't exist.

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:57.880
Citrate doesn't feed back
on any of the enzymes that

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.670
are regulated for
fructose metabolism.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.920
And so the idea is
carbon keeps getting

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:06.920
dumped into citrate, which
ultimately ends up as fat.

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:10.690
And this really underlies, at
least on a theoretical basis,

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:14.950
why there may be a connection
between fructose and obesity or

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.660
metabolic syndrome.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:21.160
I've posted articles on Stellar,
one from The Popular Press,

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.400
one from a scientific journal
that discusses the controversy,

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.290
discusses this.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:27.040
But now, at least, you
have the background

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.410
to draw some of your
own conclusions.

01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:31.400
OK.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.590
That's fructose metabolism.

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:37.820
What about galactose metabolism?

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:45.710
Well, galactose metabolism
interfaces with, effectively,

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:50.270
glycogen metabolism or, at
least, glucose 1-phosphate--

01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:55.460
or sorry, UDP glucose
and does so in a way that

01:14:55.460 --> 01:15:00.530
is a little bit non-intuitive.

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:03.590
But it's actually very
important to understand

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:07.010
galactose metabolism, at
least for those of you

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:10.985
who are looking to
go to medical school.

01:15:10.985 --> 01:15:15.110
It turns out that galactose
metabolism and issues

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:17.570
with metabolizing
galactose are what

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:20.960
underlie a set of rare
genetic diseases leading

01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.243
to a set of conditions
called galactosemias.

01:15:25.243 --> 01:15:26.660
I guess, if you're
a pediatrician,

01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:27.830
you may encounter these.

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:29.600
If you're not, these
are quite rare.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.810
Although med schools
love to ask about these,

01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:34.700
and certainly, they're
very popular on things

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:36.170
like board exams.

01:15:36.170 --> 01:15:38.540
So it's something you
should know about.

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:43.400
And so I just want to briefly
introduce galactose metabolism

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.110
to you.

01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:47.870
So this is galactose.

01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:52.400
Like all sugars,
galactose is initially

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.620
trapped by phosphorylation.

01:15:55.620 --> 01:16:00.450
It's phosphorylated on
the 1 position to trap it,

01:16:00.450 --> 01:16:01.815
just like fructose.

01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:13.710
And so this is
galactose 1-phosphate.

01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:17.860
Remember, galactose is
an epimer of glucose.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.270
So it differs from glucose
here by the stereochemistry

01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:25.810
of the hydroxyl group
at this 4 carbon.

01:16:25.810 --> 01:16:28.350
And so the way
galactose, once it's

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:31.680
trapped as galactose
1-phosphate is metabolized

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:37.740
is it will react
with UDP glucose.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:59.560
So here is UDP glucose
from glycogen metabolism

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.960
drawn in a very stylized way.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:26.890
That will generate
a UDP galactose

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:37.560
and a glucose
1-phosphate, which,

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:46.530
of course, can enter
glycolysis, can be

01:17:46.530 --> 01:17:50.530
stored as glycogen, et cetera.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:57.250
This UDP galactose can then
be turned into UDP glucose

01:17:57.250 --> 01:18:00.950
via an epimerase reaction.

01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:03.280
And so remember, the
epimerase reaction

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:05.290
needs to change
the stereochemistry

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:08.020
of the hydroxyl group
at this 4 position,

01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:10.870
such that it's pointing
up in galactose

01:18:10.870 --> 01:18:15.020
or pointing down in glucose.

01:18:15.020 --> 01:18:19.850
The way epimerases work is
that they require a cofactor.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:21.740
That cofactor is NAD.

01:18:21.740 --> 01:18:24.150
and they work in
the following way.

01:18:24.150 --> 01:18:34.220
And so if I just draw, here's
the 4 position of galactose,

01:18:34.220 --> 01:18:47.640
the 4 carbon of galactose, with
the hydroxyl group pointing up,

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:55.740
an epimerase can
basically remove

01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:58.800
a hydride from the bottom
face of the molecule,

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:03.660
transfer those two electrons
to NAD to generate NADH.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:14.010
Now, you get this lactone
intermediate at the 4 carbon.

01:19:14.010 --> 01:19:29.430
And then you can have two
electrons from an NADH can be

01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:35.160
added to the opposite face of
the molecule that regenerates

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.750
an NAD+.

01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:45.450
And now, we've effectively
changed the stereochemistry

01:19:45.450 --> 01:19:48.810
at the 4 carbon
to now be pointing

01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:52.060
such the hydroxyl points
down, and that's glucose.

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:55.680
And so the way epimerases
work is they basically

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.640
remove and add electrons
from different faces

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:01.500
of the pyranose ring.

01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:04.740
And that changes
the stereochemistry

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:10.180
of which direction the
hydroxyl group is pointing.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:14.440
And so effectively, this
is how we metabolize

01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:18.780
all kinds of different
sugars, either

01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:22.050
putting them in glycogen
or other starch,

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.120
some other storage
carbohydrate that we

01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.450
can get them later,
and then use them

01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:32.310
in glycolysis as a way to drive
glucose oxidation as a way

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:38.230
to release energy and
keep ATP high in the cell.

01:20:38.230 --> 01:20:38.730
All right.

01:20:38.730 --> 01:20:40.830
Now I want to shift
topics and begin

01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:43.740
to discuss how we
can oxidize pyruvate

01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:49.760
from glycolysis to make
CO2 as an alternative

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:54.410
to how we can release energy
from carbohydrate oxidation

01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:57.910
rather than just
use fermentation.

01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:01.950
Now you'll see that the enzymes
and ways that we do this

01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:05.280
is going to also be
how we make citrate.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:08.730
And so this isn't just
about releasing energy.

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:11.100
It's also about storing
energy because you'll see,

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:14.190
citrate is a precursor
for storage as fat.

01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:17.730
The reactions downstream
of pyruvate oxidation

01:21:17.730 --> 01:21:20.370
also make lots of other
useful intermediates

01:21:20.370 --> 01:21:23.400
that can be used to synthesize
other things cells need--

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.630
amino acids, nucleic acids.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:29.040
And so this pathways
we're going to discuss

01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:31.470
are going to come up
over and over again

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:34.000
throughout the course.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.490
Now to facilitate
this discussion,

01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:42.870
I'm really going to at least
initially focus on catabolism.

01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:48.450
And so just to remind
you, if we do glycolysis

01:21:48.450 --> 01:21:56.350
by turning glucose pyruvate,
this involves oxidation.

01:21:56.350 --> 01:22:02.180
So we need to dispose of
those electrons somewhere.

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:07.490
In other words, that NADH
has to be regenerated NAD.

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:11.540
Fermentation of pyruvate
into something like lactate

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:14.900
is a way to do that and
allows net ATP production

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:20.040
from glycolysis without
the need for any oxygen.

01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.760
However, if we're going
to completely oxidize

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:29.810
that pyruvate CO2 we're going
to generate many more electrons

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:33.630
as waste that we have
to put somewhere.

01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:38.500
Oxygen is a particularly
good electron acceptor.

01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.170
And so we can reduce
oxygen to water

01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:43.540
as a way to deal with
that electron waste,

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:46.600
and that allows us
to, just burning wood,

01:22:46.600 --> 01:22:49.150
release lots of
energy from glucose

01:22:49.150 --> 01:22:52.490
by transferring those
electrons ultimately to oxygen.

01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:54.760
And of course,
that same process--

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:58.150
oxygen to water-- if we're using
the pyruvate to fully oxidize

01:22:58.150 --> 01:23:01.150
it, also is necessary
to regenerate

01:23:01.150 --> 01:23:04.820
the NAD to run glycolysis.

01:23:04.820 --> 01:23:08.330
Now ultimately, the
series of reactions

01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:12.830
that allow chemically
conversion of pyruvate to CO2

01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:26.660
is called the TCA cycle for
try Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle

01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:33.380
or sometimes referred
to as the Krebs cycle

01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:41.800
and also is referred to
as the citric acid cycle--

01:23:41.800 --> 01:23:47.240
so TCA, Tricarboxylic
Acid Cycle, Krebs cycle,

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.790
citric acid cycle--

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.490
all synonyms for the same thing.

01:23:52.490 --> 01:24:00.350
What these cycles
are is basically

01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:14.185
a way to take two carbon units.

01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:23.050
And those two carbon
units can come

01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:29.290
from the oxidation of
pyruvate or from the oxidation

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:31.390
of lots of other fuels.

01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:35.890
And those two carbon
units are combined

01:24:35.890 --> 01:24:37.315
with four carbon units.

01:24:41.670 --> 01:24:45.380
You'll see oxaloacetate
is the four-carbon unit--

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:47.370
oxaloacetate gluconeogenesis.

01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:50.580
That oxaloacetate could come
from the pyruvate-carboxylase

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:51.570
reaction.

01:24:51.570 --> 01:24:55.530
Or it could come, as you'll
see, from the TCA cycle itself.

01:24:55.530 --> 01:25:03.150
This generates a six-carbon
molecule, which is citrate.

01:25:03.150 --> 01:25:07.740
Citrate is a tricarboxylic acid,
hence the citric acid cycle

01:25:07.740 --> 01:25:10.350
or the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:13.050
And then those six
carbon units are

01:25:13.050 --> 01:25:17.010
reoxidized, releasing
two CO2 molecules,

01:25:17.010 --> 01:25:19.380
back to four-carbon
oxaloacetate.

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.960
And hence, this is a cycle.

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.090
Now this cycle was
initially described

01:25:24.090 --> 01:25:27.150
by Hans Krebs, who
predicted the cycle largely

01:25:27.150 --> 01:25:29.310
based on chemistry-- one
of the most amazing feats

01:25:29.310 --> 01:25:31.350
in the discovery of metabolism.

01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:34.530
Turned out, he was right.

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:40.000
And thus, it's also referred to
as his name, the Krebs cycle.

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:43.890
Now lots of oxidation is
happening in this cycle.

01:25:43.890 --> 01:25:47.400
You're oxidizing the
molecule, releasing CO2.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:49.530
That means lots of
energy is released.

01:25:49.530 --> 01:25:52.590
Those electrons ultimately will
be transferred oxygen. And so

01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:58.810
we can use this to make lots of
ATP and do lots of other work.

01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:05.150
Where are these reactions all
occur is in the mitochondria,

01:26:05.150 --> 01:26:10.700
specifically in the matrix
of the mitochondria.

01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:15.380
Remember, the mitochondria,
from cell biology,

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.780
is a double-membrane organelle.

01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:20.360
The innermost part
of the mitochondria

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.370
is referred to as the matrix.

01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:27.170
And these have conditions that
favor pyruvate carboxylase

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:29.900
reaction, as I talked
about, but also favor

01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:32.840
other oxidation
reactions, such as those

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:36.550
that occur in the TCA cycle.

01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:40.050
And so next time,
what I will start with

01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:44.490
is by being more explicit about
what chemistry is happening

01:26:44.490 --> 01:26:47.700
to allow these two
carbon units to combine

01:26:47.700 --> 01:26:52.020
with oxaloacetate 4-carbon to
generate citrate and go over

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:55.020
the reactions that then
allow you to run a cycle

01:26:55.020 --> 01:27:02.040
to regenerate oxaloacetate, that
is, run the TCA cycle as a way

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:05.630
to oxidize carbon.

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.180
Thanks.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.380
We've already talked
about kinetic energy

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.780
for an object that's
rotating and translating.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.300
Let's take, again, a
simple object like a wheel.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.580
Center of mass is
moving, and we want

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.280
to consider this is a bunch
of point-like particles,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:22.510
th Jth particle with mass MJ,
and a position vector RCMJ.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.740
And now what we'd like to do
is, what is the angular momentum

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.950
of this about some point P?

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.290
And we're going to do the
same type of decomposition

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.190
that we've been
doing right along.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.640
Let's draw the vector RJ.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.900
This is the vector from
the point P to the object.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.490
Here's the vector capital R,
and there's the vector RCMJ.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.720
And our same vector
addition, R plus RCMJ.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.510
j Now let's calculate
the angular momentum

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.150
about the point
P. Now just let's

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.390
recall two facts about the
center of mass reference frame

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.440
that we've already used.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.830
The first is that the sum of
the velocities, the momentum

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.380
in the center of mass
reference frame is zero,

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.470
and if you integrate this
equation in just exactly

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.600
the same way, if you added
up the mass times each

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.900
of the position
vectors, that's MJ,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.630
MJ, in the center of mass
frame, that's also zero.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.800
So we've used this when we
talked about kinetic energy.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.860
Now we're going to consider
both of these results.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.729
So recall that angular
momentum about a point

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:54.710
is the sum of the vector from
the point, cross-product MJ,

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.920
times the velocity BJ.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.790
Now we can also use our
law of addition velocities,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.910
VJ is V plus the
VCMJ, and so now

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.060
we're going to have to
do both substitutions.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.270
That's why this calculation is
a little bit more complicated.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:25.390
We have R plus RCMJ,
cross MJ times capital

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.070
D. That is the velocity
of the center of mass

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.829
with respect to the
ground frame plus VCMJ.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.100
Now we have four terms
in the cross-product,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.440
and this time we'll
write them all out.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:51.540
So the first term is the sum
over J of R cross MJ capital D.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.200
The second term is,
we'll take this one,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.490
and we'll cross with that one.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.990
But because MJ is just a scalar,
I'm going to pull it in front.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:08.190
So that's MJ, RCMJ, and V is the
same for every single particle

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.390
in the object.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.780
Remember, V is just the
velocity of one reference frame

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.100
with respect to the other.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.380
So I can pull that out, cross
V. And you're already noticing

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.640
that this term will be zero.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.170
The next term is
when I take R cross

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.260
MJVJ, V center of
mass, J, summed over J,

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:38.620
that's JR cross MJ, VCMJ.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.970
But again, remember that
R is the same vector.

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.400
It's just from P to
the center of mass,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.430
so I didn't need to
put the sum here.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.310
I can pull R out of the sum
and I have my sum like that.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.740
And again, you're probably
noticing that this term is zero

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:02.350
and our final term is
RCMJ cross MJ VCMJ.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:10.300
So our final term is sum
R, RCMJ cross MJ VCMJ.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.899
Now from these two
conditions, one and two,

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.829
both of these two
terms are zero.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.700
And that's the power of using
the center of mass reference

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.510
frame.

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.290
So LP, now let's look
at the first term.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.060
Here, R is the same
for every particle,

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.000
V is the same for
every particle,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.620
when we're summing
over the mass,

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.510
we're just getting
the total mass,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:42.610
so the first piece
is R cross M total V.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.380
And this last piece is precisely
the definition of the angular

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.600
momentum of the Jth particle
in the center of mass frame.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.490
So that's the sum
over J of LCMJ,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.540
because RCM cross MVJ R
cross, say whatever speed this

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.330
is in the center of mass frame,
it could be that sum VCMJ.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.070
BJ minus capital V.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.010
This is exactly the
angular momentum

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:18.460
of that Jth mass in the
center of mass frame,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.540
and when we total all of
this up, we have R cross

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.810
and total V plus LCM.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.780
Now what this first term is,
if you treated the whole object

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.480
as a point mass, M total, moving
with V, and here's our point P

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.090
and there's R, this
is just what we

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:50.050
call the translational
angular momentum.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.500
It's treating the whole
system as a point-like mass,

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.320
and just calculate
moving with speed V,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.450
and that's just the
angular momentum.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:03.290
We've called this V.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:12.360
And this piece is the angular
momentum about center of mass.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.480
So sometimes, we can think
of the angular momentum

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.010
as corresponding
to a translational,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.610
it has to do with the
actual orbit of the object.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.810
You could call this
orbital angular momentum.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.050
And this is the fact that
the object is rotating.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.010
You could think of this as
the spin angular momentum

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:33.750
about the center of mass.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.940
This is the same
type of decomposition

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.710
that we saw with kinetic energy.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.590
There was a translational
component of kinetic energy

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.980
and a rotational component
of kinetic energy.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:48.450
This is the analogous case for
angular momentum about a point

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.700
P.

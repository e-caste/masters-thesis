00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.890
Hi everyone.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.290
Welcome to the first week
in our series of classes.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:11.270
In this tutorial, we're
going to take a look

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.410
at how you can use a flatbed
scanner, believe it or not,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.710
to create some very fine images
of three-dimensional objects,

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.920
like microfluidic devices,
Petri dishes, and other sorts

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.180
of material you're creating
or working with in the lab.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.050
Now you might be
wondering why we're

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.100
starting this course with
a tool that you probably

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.930
wouldn't think of
for creating really

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.900
fine images of your work.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.250
Well, we want you to experience
the fun part of creating images

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.680
at first, and
frankly, we wanted you

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.180
to start off with some easy
stuff-- well, relatively easy--

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.980
and not having to worry too much
about technical issues, which

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.390
believe me, will come later.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.490
That's a promise.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.110
This course is
meant to encourage

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.230
you to capture your material
in a number of ways.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.210
And probably most important,
to learn to see in the process.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.100
So you're seeing, and
will continue to see,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.410
all sorts of images that I
made on the flatbed scanner

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.220
with different approaches.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.070
I'll go into detail for a few of
them in all of these tutorials

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.930
and we'll call
them case studies.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.620
You'll see things
that will surprise you

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.240
and you'll discover
new perspectives, that

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.690
is new points of
view, which might

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.300
lead to new thinking
about your work.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.650
Try out your ideas
about imaging.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.840
It won't take long.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.350
That's the nice part
about the flatbed scanner.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.910
Some of your ideas will
work, and some won't.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.940
Believe me, a lot of them won't,
from my personal experience.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.900
And emphasizing what I said
in the general overview,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.770
most of this is
about experimenting,

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.720
or in a way playing.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.920
The process, I hope, will
become an active discovery,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.410
as it did for me when
I made these images.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.150
You should think of this
process in a similar way

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.180
as you do with your
own investigations.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.650
So using the scanner can, if you
choose, come close to imaging

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.890
with a microscope, if you make
sure you capture your image

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.580
at a high enough resolution.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.530
You can start zooming in to
your image on your screen

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.200
and see things that you
could not see with your eyes.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.240
And I'll show you that
a little more later on.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.000
One thing-- I wanted to let
you know that I digitally

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.050
cleaned some of these images
so that your eye wouldn't be

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.850
distracted with dust particles.

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.970
That's important
for you to know.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.240
The decision of whether to use
a flatbed scanner is yours.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.510
First think of the size of
your device or material.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.079
I'd say a safe bet
is, if you're planning

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.370
to see details from
a few millimeters up

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.570
to a few centimeters.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.550
But as you'll see
in a few moments,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.770
you'll be able to capture detail
in the 30 to 50 micron range.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.970
What you'll see and
show in your image

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.300
will depend on how you set
the resolution in the scanner

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.970
setting.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.250
For the time being, just think
about it this way-- the higher

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.290
your DPI setting, that is dots
per inch, the more information

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.940
you're sending to the sensor.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.260
The more information
you're sending,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.690
the more detail you'll
be seeing and capturing.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.110
You'll find all about this
in our HOW-TO-DO-IT tutorial.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.810
Take a look at that after you've
completed this week's tutorial.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.810
You'll see how changing the DPI
settings, as we are seeing here

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.630
in these three images, will have
a direct effect on capturing

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.130
details.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.900
Why use it instead of a camera?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.050
Well first of all,
you can very quickly

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.440
make some very fine
images without going

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.970
to more complicated
setup with your camera,

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.930
as you'll see later
in the next few weeks.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.360
You can show evidence
that you've made something

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.340
or that you're
observing something.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.760
You might want to show
a part of something

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.630
larger, a small
structure for example.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.740
You'll be able to share
some observations quickly

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.950
with your colleagues.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.340
You can consider
it as a draft image

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.880
that you will eventually use
in a figure for a submission.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.940
Perhaps you can even use the
image as a patent submission.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.579
That's something to think about.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.829
The wonderful surprise
here is that you

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.380
can put a three-dimensional
object on the scanner

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.270
and create images that suggest
their three-dimensionality.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.760
Yes, you will lose
depth of field,

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.480
which we'll discuss in the
next tutorial about cameras

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.240
and lenses.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.500
But still, eventually
you'll create sometimes

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.900
a knock-your-socksoff image.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.680
Hopefully you're interested
in that sort of thing.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.920
PROFESSOR: I like this
lecture because the first half

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.810
of my career was
entirely devoted

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.870
to the electronic structure
of diatomic molecules.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:36.670
And this is how you make
sense of diatomic molecules.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:43.170
Now in 5.111, 5.112, one of
the most exciting thing that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.050
attracts people to
become chemistry majors

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.040
is the global interpretation
of the periodic table

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.810
in terms of some simple ideas
so that those simple ideas

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.560
enable you to predict the
important properties of all

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.910
of the atoms.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.850
And that's a pretty
exciting thing to feel like,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.650
yes, it all makes some sense.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.240
And then we go on to
other topics in chemistry,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.910
and we forget about the fact
that we think we understand

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.260
the periodic table completely.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.610
We don't use that information.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.470
And one thing that I've tried
to do throughout my career

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.660
is to take the simple insights
into the periodic table,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.080
and explain
molecular properties.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.700
And now, this is really a
strange thing because we have

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.110
computer programs
that can calculate any

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.730
of the properties--
any property you want--

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.460
of a small molecule.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.090
So why would we ever
care about being

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.390
able to predict the properties--
because we can calculate them?

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.250
And the answer is we
want to understand.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.010
We want to be able,
without a computer,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.030
to say this is what we expect
for a particular molecule not

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.130
just a diatomic molecule.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.160
What are the things
that control the bonding

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.580
in molecules in general and
the properties in molecules

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.780
in general?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.580
And if you can understand what
happens in diatomic molecules,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.930
there are very few cases
which would leave you

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.860
at a loss for what will be the
properties of this new molecule

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.420
that you're looking at.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.000
Or how would you
manipulate a molecule

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.240
so that you can force it
to go into the states that

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.590
will expose the critical
properties that you want?

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.010
So it's this sort
of part of a toolkit

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.590
that any practicing
physical chemist who's

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.890
worried about spectra,
molecular properties,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.520
electronic properties
would have to master.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.930
And this is really
hard because, one, you

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.710
have a computer-- you can
generate the answers completely

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:07.950
accurately.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.500
And two, you're
smart MIT students.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.130
And you believe in
the truth rather than

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.660
estimating the truth.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.190
But I like to maintain that
if you can estimate the truth

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.030
and find out whether your
estimates are wrong or right,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.720
that enables you
to have confidence

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.710
to deal with other
properties, other problems.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.830
And so what I want
to do today is

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.250
to give a sense of how
you begin to understand

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.060
the electronic structure
of simple molecules.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.120
And I want to tell
you that a lot

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.520
of the second-order or
complicated patches you put

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.480
on this simple
picture are things

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.680
that you develop and criticize
throughout your career.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.940
You say, yeah, well, this
works, but that doesn't.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.250
And why doesn't it work?

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.190
And that's what we do
as physical chemists.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.550
We look for when the
simple picture breaks.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.620
And we have our own private
simple pictures which

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.089
we're constantly trying to make
better than anybody else's.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:27.220
OK, so we have the
periodic table.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.910
We know the properties of atoms.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.530
We know, especially, how
the ionization energy

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.310
is supposed to behave.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.910
We know how the low-lying
electronic states

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.280
are supposed to be ordered.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.910
Excuse me.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.360
We know about orbital sizes.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.860
Everything is related to this
idea of atomic-orbital energies

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.520
and shielding.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.050
And it's all related
to the hydrogen atom.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.000
What we got from
the hydrogen atom

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.700
was a framework
for understanding

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.510
electronic properties of atoms.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.360
And what we know about
electronic properties of atoms

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.410
should be important
in explaining

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.290
electronic properties
of molecules.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.030
So I want you to be
able to make toy models,

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.440
to draw pictures which
are crude, but guiding,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.430
in your insights.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.990
And it's all based
on what we saw.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.940
And you soon are going to have
two lectures from Troy Van

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.080
Voorhis, which will lead you to
use some of the simple computer

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.100
programs that enable you to
calculate electronic property

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.940
of anything.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:04.870
OK, so we want to extend what
we had for H2+ to be able

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:14.510
to understand H 2 AH,
A 2, and AB molecules.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:23.030
And each of these steps
involve extensions

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.790
of relatively simple ideas.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.000
And so let's begin.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.570
OK, I told you that I believe
the simplest explanation

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:44.250
for bonding is when we have two
atomic orbitals that overlap

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:48.870
in the region where
this overlap region can

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.745
be attracted to both nuclei.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.280
Constructive interference
causes the density

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.010
in this special region--

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:04.340
the amplitude to be twice
as large, the density

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.230
to be four times as large.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.180
And that's a large,
energetic effect.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.590
And the amount of
overlap is crucial.

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:19.310
You can have two little if
the atoms are too far apart--

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:20.340
no bond.

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.970
You could have too much if the
atoms are too close together.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.990
OK, so we need to now look
at cartoons of orbitals

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.690
and learn about the
names for these orbitals.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:39.550
So the simplest
orbital is gerade--

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.390
sigma gerade NS orbital.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:49.090
OK, so "sigma" means
there are no nodal planes

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.210
containing the
internuclear axis.

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:56.110
"Gerade" means that in the
body frame, it's even symmetry.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:11.090
So we have ns A plus ns B.
And that looks like this.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:14.910
We can have an
antibonding orbital.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:21.790
Again, we put the predominant
atomic-orbital character

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.040
in parentheses.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.970
And for heteronuclear
molecules, we also

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.470
put which atom is more
important to that orbital.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:33.220
And this will be
just ns A minus ns.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.310
And that will look like this.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.670
And there is no overlap here.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.330
In fact, there is
negative overlap.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.450
And that's an
antibonding orbital.

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.760
And you can say, if
there's no overlap, well,

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.010
then the actual
picture will sort of

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.200
look like this, where the
region in the binding region

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.530
is actually depleted,
and there's less there.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.381
And that's part of
why it's antibonding.

00:09:09.381 --> 00:09:09.880
OK.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:19.920
Now we can also make
sigma g np orbitals.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:28.270
And np z-- "z" is the
internuclear axis--

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:36.409
A minus and np z, B--

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.575
well, that gives us something
that looks like this--

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.360
plus, plus, minus, minus.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.840
And the minus sign is
needed to turn this around.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.890
But this is overall
gerade symmetry.

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:54.785
And so everything is fine.

00:09:54.785 --> 00:10:01.530
And then we can have
sigma u star np.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.430
And that would just
be the plus sign here.

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.200
And that would be an
antibonding orbital.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.240
Now I put a star
on these orbitals

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.640
because when we don't
have atomic symmetry, when

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.640
we don't have g and
u symmetry, we still

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:24.360
use the star to
imply antibonding.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.670
But in diatomic molecules,
this is redundant.

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.590
You should be able,
just by looking

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:40.420
at the orbital character or
looking at a picture, to say,

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:43.750
yes, it's a bonding orbital,
and it's either g or u.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:53.120
Then we have pi u np.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.210
And that would be--

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.800
well, let's do it
the opposite order.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.810
So we'd like to have
something that's bonding.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.350
So we have to have
the phases right.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.930
And that's ungerade
because when you reflect

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:15.260
through the center of the
origin of coordinates,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.180
we go from plus to minus.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.350
So that's ungerade.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.050
But that's bonding.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.680
And that's a little
trick because you

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.043
start this think, from sigma,
that ungerade is antibonding.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:34.480
And finally, we have
the pi g star np.

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.320
And that would be plus,
minus, minus, plus.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.080
And that's gerade.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.650
OK, there are a couple other
things that we know just

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.450
from these pictures.

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:56.280
And that is the p-sigma orbital
is much more directional

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:59.460
than the s-sigma orbital.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.100
That's all you get
in sigma for s.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:12.570
And so the bonding interaction
between p-sigma orbitals

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:17.760
turns on at longer
range than for s.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.350
So there's qualitative
differences.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.720
And sometimes, you
have a bond distance

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.800
determined by favorable overlap
between one pair of orbitals.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.100
And it makes things not so
good for other orbitals.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.600
So usually, you
have a ground state.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.307
You figure out what the
ground state of molecule is.

00:12:36.307 --> 00:12:38.640
And that tells you something
about what the internuclear

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.230
distance is.

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.640
And then you might grow to
excited states of the molecule

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.540
or excited configurations.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.040
And these excited
configurations--

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.770
well, if you're going to
learn about a molecule,

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.630
you've got to do spectroscopy.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:00.070
So if you go from the ground
state to an excited state,

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:02.490
and the internuclear
distance of the ground state

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.180
is wrong for the excited
state, well, then, you're

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.000
going to have a big
change in geometry.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.850
You'll have Frank-Condon
factors, which--

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.190
I haven't talked about
Frank-Condon factors--

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:19.290
I will-- that say,
OK, the transition

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:22.070
is going to have a lot
of vibrational structure.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.550
And it'll tell you all sorts
of good stuff about that.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:27.510
But the important
thing is when you

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.940
start looking at a
molecule, you want

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:32.580
to know what the
ground state looks like

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.920
and what transitions
from the ground state

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.270
ought to look like when
you're ready to know how

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:41.970
to use the simple structural
information you're getting

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:46.930
from these orbitals because
there's no point doing

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.690
an experiment if you don't
have an idea about what

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.800
the experiment will yield.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.890
That's what most people do
when they do an experiment.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.130
They did the
experiment because they

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.050
thought it would
yield something,

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:03.000
and they wanted to be
surprised because they'd

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.820
like to show that
maybe it didn't

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:06.870
do what they were expecting.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.170
OK, so we have pictures.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.970
And we have notation.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.800
And this notation
is what is used

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:20.120
by professional spectroscopies,

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.510
So we care about directionality.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.550
And we care about
size of orbitals.

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.410
And this is definitely
something that you're

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.880
empowered from 5.111, 5.112.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.480
I'll talk more about that too.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.390
How about right now?

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:52.460
OK, in thermodynamics,
when we're

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:59.610
concerned about the enthalpy
of formation of a molecule,

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:04.250
we have to set a 0 of enthalpy.

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:11.090
And we set it as separated
atoms in their most-stable state

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:15.030
and energy, or
enthalpy, is something

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:18.120
where there is no natural 0.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.140
We wanted a 0 which
is convenient for all

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.870
of our calculations
and insights.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:30.480
And so what we do is we
say, OK, every particle

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.950
that we're going
to be looking at--

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.550
we're going to make a
molecule out of two atoms,

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.270
like A and B and AB star.

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:46.920
So we have the energy of A
plus electron B plus electron,

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.460
or AB plus electron.

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:54.072
That's a common 0 of energy.

00:15:54.072 --> 00:15:58.520
So we talk about
orbital energies

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.530
relative to this common 0.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:04.700
Now in almost every textbook,
the orbital diagrams

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.030
are given to you.

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:11.310
There's no discussion of,
what's the 0 of energy?

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:13.290
If you're going
to know anything,

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.430
you really want to be able
to calculate or to say

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:23.340
all of the actors in this game
are acting in a way related

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.370
to how far below this
ionization energy

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:30.570
they are because that
determines their size.

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.810
And the size
determines the overlap.

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:36.350
And bonding is
related to overlap.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:38.220
OK, so we'll play that game.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:48.730
So for H 2+, it was very simple.

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:55.620
We just had the 1s
at r equals infinity,

00:16:55.620 --> 00:17:02.870
and over here, the 1s
orbital at r equals infinity.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.859
And then we solved the
minimal-basis variational

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.119
problem.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:16.180
And we discovered that we had
something like this, where this

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:17.710
is the antibonding orbital.

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:19.510
This is the binding orbital.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.540
The antibonding orbital
is more antibonding

00:17:22.540 --> 00:17:26.329
than the bonding
orbital is bonding.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:31.520
And, of course, this
energy difference

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.810
depends on
internuclear distance,

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:36.280
also not often talked about.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:44.970
And so we have the starting
point at r equals infinity

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.860
for the separated atoms.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.880
Now as we bring
these atoms together,

00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.690
before there's any
bonding at all,

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:58.350
say, we have 1s on A.
We make the internuclear

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.170
distance smaller and smaller.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:05.230
And the bare nucleus
of the other atom

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.090
starts to penetrate into the--

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:14.290
so as you move the
positively charged nucleus

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.850
towards the static
charge on the other atom,

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.820
that's a favorable interaction.

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:25.800
But there's a repulsion
between the two nuclei.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.690
And when the bare
nucleus of one atom

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:34.530
penetrates inside the charge
distribution of the other,

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.590
it sees less attraction
and more repulsion.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:42.000
And so this is why you
get a potential curve that

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.340
looks like this.

00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:47.310
The repulsion occurs at
too-short internuclear

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:48.210
distance.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.910
And from the
variational calculation,

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:55.190
you can determine the value
of equilibrium internuclear

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.670
distance.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.290
And so a lot of
these diagrams are

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:03.670
calculated at this particular
internuclear distance.

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:06.490
It's especially important
because the repulsive states

00:19:06.490 --> 00:19:08.710
don't have a minimum.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:12.070
And so there is no particular
internuclear distance

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:20.290
that you care about so that
if you want a simple picture,

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.310
everything is calculated at
that particular internuclear

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.810
distance.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:32.860
OK, so sometimes, you want to
have a little bit more insight

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.910
in this picture.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.870
And instead of drawing
the starting point

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:42.280
at infinite separation,
you could say, well,

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:48.300
let's schematically suggest
what happens as you--

00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:00.180
so at shorter
internuclear distance,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.770
the separated atom energy
increases a little bit.

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:06.540
And that could be useful.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.490
But it complicates things,
so I won't do that.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.010
But often, we do
like to know what

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:14.970
happens as we bring particles
together as opposed to starting

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:18.570
at infinity and coming
into the end point, which

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.320
is the bond at the equilibrium
internuclear distance.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.940
So you can put that
insight in if you wish.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.700
So we know that this bonding
interaction is smaller

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.757
than the antibonding
interaction.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:48.290
OK, we can now go
from H 2+ to H 2.

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:59.060
And the first thing we know is
when we go from H 2+ to H 2,

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:04.580
we can put an electron into the
same orbital but with opposite

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.520
spin.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.710
And as a result, we
don't have to worry

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:11.950
about mysterious things,
like overlap repulsion

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:17.290
or poly-repulsion because
we're putting electrons

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.360
into different spin orbitals.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.700
And that's all you have to do.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:26.590
If you try to put two electrons
into the same spin orbital,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:28.120
that's really bad.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.730
And once we get beyond
hydrogen-- hydrogen

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:36.130
has this neat situation
that there is no core.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.550
It's just the nuclei.

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:43.750
But for anything other
than hydrides or hydrogen,

00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:48.760
we have an inner
core, which is filled

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:54.750
with electrons of both spins.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:59.070
So anytime you have
an orbital that

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:04.110
gets too close to
the other atom,

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.890
there is going to be this
mysterious overlap repulsion.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:15.690
And that makes the inner
wall of most potentials other

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.860
than hydrogen
extremely vertical.

00:22:21.010 --> 00:22:27.070
OK, so let me just--

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:33.490
oh, I know what I wanted to
say, but i will get to that

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:40.180
When we go from H 2+ to H 2, we
discover that the equilibrium

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:49.950
in our internuclear distance
decreases by approximately 30%.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:58.610
The vibrational frequency
increases by 90%.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:14.160
The dissociation energy
increases by about 70%.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.770
These are big effects.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:18.780
They're not a factor of 2.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:23.160
Naively, if one
electron gives a bond

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.860
or gives some sort of
a bonding interaction,

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:28.200
two should give twice that much.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.640
But this is pretty close
to twice that much.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.770
Even though that's only
30%, it's a big effect.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.230
And it's because
we're allowed to put

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:42.880
an electron into an
orbital which is bonding.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:47.570
And there is no
magic-overlap repulsion.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.000
There is just the
interelectronic-energy

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.100
repulsion.

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.110
So our picture is--
we're chemists.

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:56.070
We believe in bonds.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:58.410
The most important
thing is bonds.

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:06.300
And in almost every
situation, you

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:09.270
want to conserve
the number of bonds

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.340
or know how much you
have to pay for changing

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.260
the number of bonds.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.250
That's the course.

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.610
But we're more sophisticated.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:33.070
Now in our picture for H 2+,
we had an effective Hamiltonian

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.340
or a variational calculation.

00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.350
I like to talk about
effective Hamiltonians.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:45.410
But the crucial actors
in the H 2+ problem,

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:49.930
or the overlap is a function
R, the interaction energy

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:55.580
as a function of R, and the
orbital energy is a function

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:02.060
of R. And these are the
actors in almost all further

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.410
calculations.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.350
You're going to want to
either know these things

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.720
or be able to estimate
their sizes so you

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.570
know the consequences.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.140
And we know much of the
consequences from H 2+.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:29.570
We know that as R decreases,
the overlap increases,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:38.750
the increases, and
the interaction

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:42.560
energy between the
two atoms increases.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:49.400
So these are the factors that
we put into a calculation.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.880
We know that there
is a bonding region.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:26:01.460
And typically, we can say that
the bonding region for H 2+

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:07.680
and for any molecule is
going to be roughly between

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:13.800
the atomic-orbital radius and
twice the atomic-orbital radius

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.490
because we've got two atoms.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:17.670
And so they want to see
it at twice that radius.

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:19.980
And then as we get
closer, we get bonding.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:23.430
And as we get too close,
we get antibonding.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:25.730
And so this is a
critical region.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.965
Now we're ready to take
the next few steps.

00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:53.730
So we want to do H
2+ to H 2 to A 2.

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.040
And so the questions we
ask is, how many electrons?

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.910
That's easy.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:15.242
Feed the energy electrons
into lowest MOs.

00:27:15.242 --> 00:27:16.700
Well, in order to
do that, you need

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.290
to know the energy
order of the MOs.

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:27.070
We get a configuration,
which is just

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:29.890
a list of the number
of electrons in each

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.015
of the molecular orbitals.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.150
And these configurations
have particular states.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:46.120
And for a diatonic molecule,
we know the projection

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.670
of the electron
orbital-angular momentum

00:27:48.670 --> 00:27:53.200
on the other nuclear axis,
lambda, we know the spin.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.050
And sometimes, we know
about this thing, omega,

00:27:57.050 --> 00:28:02.340
which is the
projection of the spin,

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.630
as well as the projection of
the orbital-angular momentum.

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:09.180
And so we have a notation
for electronic states, which

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:15.100
will be lambda 2s plus 1 omega.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.950
And so say we have a triplet.

00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:23.850
Well, this triplet
will be 2s plus 1 is 3.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:26.130
And this is pi, say.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:31.050
So the correct way to
say that is not "3 pi."

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:33.980
but "triplet pi."

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.150
And we normally don't talk about
that in any special notation.

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:46.780
So the splittings of the
configurations for H2--

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.510
we have the ground state.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:59.730
And that's sigma g 1s squared,
and the lowest excited

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:06.880
state, triplet sigma u plus--

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:18.316
and that's sigma
g 1s sigma u us.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:25.520
So we have these pictures.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.460
And this is bound.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:30.370
This has got a binding orbital
and an antibonding orbital.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:31.640
This is a sigma u 1s.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.190
Sorry-- so antibonding.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:37.660
So this is repulsive.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:41.830
Or usually, it's repulsive
at all internucleuses.

00:29:45.270 --> 00:29:50.930
Then there are higher-energy
orbitals that come from 2p--

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:54.115
2p pi and 2p sigma.

00:29:56.790 --> 00:30:00.825
And they give rise
to many, many states.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:10.260
But we know, for hydrogen,
when we go from 1s to 2p,

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.310
we're at very,
very high energy--

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:16.850
3/4 of a Rydberg.

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:20.690
And that's an energy that's
larger than any chemical bond

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:22.940
we know.

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:27.500
So the excited states
of H 2 are going

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.210
to be a little bit weird because
of this tremendous excitation

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.080
energy.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.990
And because the excitation
energy is so high,

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.530
we're probably not
prepared to understand

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:44.250
what's going on up there.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.820
And in fact, terrible things
happen up at high energy.

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.560
We get there are some curves
that are double minima.

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.250
There are all sorts of things.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.610
And they have to do with--

00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:02.860
you could have H+
H- ion-pair states.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:06.810
You can have H 2+
plus electron--

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:12.420
those are Rydberg states as well
as the normal valence states.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.420
So normally, we don't
want to worry about that.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.220
And there are two
places we don't

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.260
want to go without preparation.

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.750
One is to very high
excitation energy.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:27.080
And the other is to very
large internuclear distance

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.920
because things can happen.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.960
The weirdnesses are
much more important

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.010
when there is no core.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.520
So since everything
is dependent on R,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:51.960
we need to know how to estimate
the internuclear distance.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.040
And we know, for
an atomic orbital,

00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.910
the ionization energy
is hc times the Rydberg

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.850
constant over n squared.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.790
And we know that the
average r for an orbital

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:25.480
is a0 times n squared
over the charge.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:34.470
And so if we want to relate
the size of an orbital

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.600
to something that
we can measure,

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.730
well, we can simply put in this
equation for n squared here.

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:47.670
And we get that the
average size of an orbital

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:52.500
will be a 0, which is the Bohr
radius of the hydrogen atom--

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.360
about half an angstrom--

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.730
times hcR.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.330
The Rydberg is
110,000 wave numbers--

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:06.310
and over z--

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:09.340
I'm sorry-- over I nl.

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.130
So this ionization
energy is measured.

00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:19.180
And so if you know the
ionization energy, you know r.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.870
If you are talking about a
molecular-orbital diagram,

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:26.010
you have r and
ionization energy on it.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:28.270
And so you can see how
it would make everything

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.450
relate to each other.

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:42.580
OK, let's do an example.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:45.120
Let's look at the NH molecule.

00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.830
This is not a stable
molecule, but it's

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:54.560
a molecule that is important
in some chemical reactions.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.260
It's easy to make an H by
having, say, nitrogen--

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.300
N2-- and hydrogen and
doing a discharge.

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.140
And so in order to be
able to understand H,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.975
you start out with all
of the orbital energies.

00:34:10.699 --> 00:34:14.270
So let's make a little table.

00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:17.650
We have H 1s.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.170
And we have its
ionization energy.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:25.350
And its 13.6 electoral volts.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:33.420
We have H 2s and 2p for
hydrogen. They're degenerate.

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.980
And that's 3.4 electron volts--

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:41.429
for nitrogen, 1s.

00:34:41.429 --> 00:34:45.239
This is an obscenely
large energy.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:48.820
And so it's greater
than 100 electron volts.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:56.460
We have N 2s, which
is 18 electron volts.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:04.800
We have N 2p, which
is 12 electron volts.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:11.790
And we're going to have, at the
end, the ground state of NH,

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:19.680
which turns out to be a
triplet sigma, g minus state.

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.550
And that's at 13.6 ev.

00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:28.680
So one of the things you want to
do is ask, OK, all my actors--

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.840
where are they below
the ionization energy?

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:40.100
And the next thing you do is you
arrange things in energy order.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:44.150
And so the lowest one is this.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.540
And it's out of the
picture altogether.

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.650
The next lowest one is this.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:57.500
And then we have two.

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:03.080
And let's just say this is
3 to 4, and this is 4 to 3.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.290
They're roughly degenerate.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.560
That's what we're
looking for because when

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.360
the orbitals are
degenerate, they

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.350
have about the same energy.

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.320
And we know from
perturbation theory,

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.650
if you want to have a mixture
of two different things,

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.960
you want the energy to
not measure to be small.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.710
So all the actors--
the simple stuff--

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.440
we know what their energies are.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.920
We know that if we have two
things that have the same,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.170
or nearly the same, energy,
they're going to be mixed.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:42.190
And so now, with this sort
of an annotated table--

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:46.380
the last one is this guy--

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:49.710
we can write down the
low-lying configurations.

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:51.870
And we can say something
about the nature

00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:54.835
of the molecular-orbital
diagram.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:08.960
[INAUDIBLE]

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:12.440
But I stress the
most important thing

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:17.300
is something that's easily
measured for atoms because what

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.790
we want to do is
build on what we think

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:25.220
we know for the periodic table
to have some sort of insight

00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:27.560
into molecular-periodic
table, although it's

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.465
a multidimensional
periodic table.

00:37:31.465 --> 00:37:33.850
I know that's probably
a stupid thing to say.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:41.430
OK, so here's the molecular
orbital diagram for NH.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:46.590
So over on this
side, we have H+.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:48.540
Over this side, we have N+.

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.940
And we put the orbitals on--

00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:05.316
OK, so here is minus 3.4,
which is the hydrogen 2s or 2p.

00:38:05.316 --> 00:38:10.390
And down here, we
have the hydrogen 1s.

00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:16.740
And that's at minus 13.6.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:27.200
And over here, we
have the nitrogen 2p.

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:32.300
And that's at minus 12.

00:38:36.202 --> 00:38:36.910
So what do we do?

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:41.430
And then down much farther
below way down here,

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:45.390
we have the nitrogen 1s.

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.440
The nitrogen 2s.

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.940
OK, how many
electrons do we have?

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.722
Well, before I do that--

00:38:55.722 --> 00:38:57.305
so how many electrons
are on nitrogen?

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:07.780
I mean, if you don't
do that, you don't

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:11.510
know the periodic table at all.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:12.010
How many?

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:16.566
Did everybody see that?

00:39:16.566 --> 00:39:17.690
Well, then I can't ask you.

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:22.920
Yes, it's seven electrons and
plus 1 for the hydrogen, right?

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.205
So we're dealing
with eight electrons.

00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:28.530
And so we're going to put
eight electrons into orbitals.

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:32.970
And now on this
diagram, basically, I

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:40.600
have two orbitals that are
roughly at the same energy.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.730
And so we know that all the
action is going to be that.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:53.980
And so we can draw something
like this and something

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.320
like that.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:03.280
And now, we use our
perturbation ideas.

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.980
And this guy is
higher in energy.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:11.720
And so it's closer to
this other orbital.

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:14.550
So this one is
dominantly nitrogen,

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:20.420
and this one is dominantly
hydrogen. Make this dotted.

00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:22.700
OK, so we have two orbitals.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:25.310
This one is polarized
towards nitrogen.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:32.390
And this one is polarized
towards hydrogen.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:40.820
And then there is
another orbital here.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:43.010
This is 2p pi.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:50.320
Well, what about 2p pi?

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.200
There is no pi orbital here.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.840
The lowest pi orbital
is way up here.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.170
So this guy is nonbinding.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:02.050
So we have a bonding orbital,
a nonbonding orbital,

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:04.330
and an antibonding orbital.

00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.670
And then up here,
we have something

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:09.290
that's so high energy, we
might call it a Rydberg

00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:14.260
orbital or just something else.

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.680
OK, so now we start
putting electrons

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.855
into orbitals in
orbital-order energy.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:30.440
So we have sigma
nitrogen 1s squared.

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:31.585
That's the lowest one.

00:41:31.585 --> 00:41:32.460
That's way down here.

00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:33.300
I erased it.

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.420
It's at minus 100
electron volts.

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:41.130
And then we have nitrogen 2s.

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:43.140
That's pretty far down too.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.780
And so these two--

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.100
we don't have any doubt.

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:52.260
The electrons go into
these sigma orbitals.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:54.390
And there's nobody
nearby, and so these are

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.080
localized on the nitrogen atom.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.970
We've got four more
electrons to deal with.

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:09.550
We have sigma NH sigma NH.

00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.530
Well, we'll call this sigma.

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:17.360
We got two electrons there.

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.040
And then we have--

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:32.580
so we got two electrons, two
electrons in core orbitals.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.602
We have a bond.

00:42:34.602 --> 00:42:35.560
Then we have a nonbond.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:39.750
Yes.

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:41.265
AUDIENCE: How far
apart in energy

00:42:41.265 --> 00:42:42.965
do the orbitals have
to be such that you

00:42:42.965 --> 00:42:45.890
consider them non-attracted?

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:48.940
PROFESSOR: It's
really up to you.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:50.070
I mean, at the lowest--

00:42:56.430 --> 00:42:58.570
it's a question
of how much detail

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.640
you want to be honest about.

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:03.490
There's always interaction.

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:07.030
But the important thing
is if the orbital energy

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:16.090
is really low or stable, the
orbitals are really compact.

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.450
And so at equally
internuclear distance,

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:22.270
which is determined
by a bonding orbital,

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:24.120
they're just out of play.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.905
So it's not 0.

00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:37.800
But you really care
about big effects--

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.250
things that are worth,
roughly, the energy

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:43.780
of a tenth of a bond.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.450
As you get more and
more better at this,

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:50.410
you could say, well, we'll
worry about bonding effects that

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:54.100
are worth less than a tenth
of a bond or a typical bond.

00:43:54.100 --> 00:44:00.340
But you want to organize things
in the order of how important

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:03.280
they are, how careful
you have to be,

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.330
how many subtle effects you
have to take into account.

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:12.020
And so to avoid craziness,
you want to say,

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:15.070
I'm not going to worry about
this because it's too small,

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:19.170
or because their energy
difference is too large.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:22.240
And it's very important
to be able to shed

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:28.180
unnecessary factors until
you're ready to deal with them.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.120
Or maybe you never will.

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:36.070
OK, so that was a
really great question.

00:44:36.070 --> 00:44:41.250
All right, so we
have the list of--

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:42.205
where did I put it?

00:44:42.205 --> 00:44:43.660
Oh, here it is.

00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:48.340
OK, so these are
three filled orbitals.

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.070
They give rise to
a singlet sigma.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:54.010
But we have two electrons
in a pi orbital.

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:58.810
And if you care
about this stuff,

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.905
you'll learn how to figure
out what two electrons in a pi

00:45:02.905 --> 00:45:04.060
orbital will give you.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:09.040
And they give you
triplet sigma minus g--

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.520
I'm sorry-- no g because it's
a heteronuclear-- triplet

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:20.070
sigma minus singlet delta
and singlet sigma plus.

00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:30.940
And this is actually much easier
than for inorganic chemistry

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:37.510
or for just figuring out
the LS states of an atom

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.380
because basically, we
have sigma, pi, delta.

00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.450
And you can figure
out, well, pi squared

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:44.740
is going to give you this.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:49.400
Pi cubed is going to give
you this again, except this--

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.030
it's going to give
you this again.

00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:53.830
So you there's a
finite number of things

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:57.120
that you don't have to
work out the energy levels

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.900
by an elaborate procedure.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.430
And so you can sort
of memorize them

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:02.320
because there's very
few that you actually

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.950
are going to deal with.

00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:10.510
OK, so now Hund's rules
apply to molecules.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:11.955
So what's the
ground state of NH?

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.305
Triplet sigma minus.

00:46:22.230 --> 00:46:25.372
So that's nice because you're
going to be doing spectroscopy,

00:46:25.372 --> 00:46:27.330
and you're going to be
starting with a molecule

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:35.990
in a triplet state and
you've got a pi bond.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.850
And so you know a typical
internuclear distance for a pi

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.120
bond, or you can figure it out.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.045
And we're only going to
be seeing triplet states,

00:46:44.045 --> 00:46:45.420
and we're only
going to be seeing

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.770
triplet-sigma-minus states
or triplet-pi states because

00:46:49.770 --> 00:46:50.750
of the selection rules.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:51.985
Now I'm telling you this.

00:46:51.985 --> 00:46:52.860
You could learn that.

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.300
These are extra things.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:56.610
You've got to know the
most-important stuff.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.340
So we have an
intentionally naive

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.440
primitive-molecular
orbital diagram.

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:15.350
OK, now-- my chance
to say terrible things

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.250
about textbooks.

00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:27.420
Every one of you has seen
the molecular-orbital diagram

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:32.100
for this mystical A2 molecule.

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:33.690
Everybody's seen it.

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:41.010
And it's presented either
dishonestly or semihonestly

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:43.150
with an asterisk.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:45.550
So let's just understand this.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.870
Again we have the
ionization energy.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.770
We have A+ and A+.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:56.670
And we plot the energies.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:48:00.720
And naively, we
say, OK, here's 2s--

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.910
same energy 2s.

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:04.490
And here is 2p--

00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:12.665
2p-- for atoms other than
hydrogen, 2p is above 2s.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:20.020
And so we know, well,
we can draw some kind

00:48:20.020 --> 00:48:23.405
of a diagram like this.

00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:35.040
So these are the sigma
star 2s and sigma 2s.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.660
No problem.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:43.052
And then we draw something
like this for the p orbitals.

00:48:43.052 --> 00:48:44.385
And we have something like this.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.210
That makes sense.

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:53.340
Now, the lowest-energy
orbital has

00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:55.830
to be the more
directional p orbital.

00:48:55.830 --> 00:48:58.890
So this is going to be
the p-sigma orbital.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:10.345
And so we'll have a sigma
2p, a pi 2p, a pi star 2p,

00:49:10.345 --> 00:49:12.440
and a sigma star 2p.

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:19.530
That's what you get
using common sense.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.560
And it's wrong.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.310
And most of the
textbooks say, well,

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.140
if we have to correct
this-- it turns out

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:32.730
that the energy order
of these two orbitals

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.910
is frequently reversed.

00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:39.000
And most textbooks
don't tell you why.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.060
They just say, well, this
is what you would expect.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:46.020
And the canonical
molecular-orbital diagram

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.430
for homonuclear diatomics
has the pi below sigma

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:57.910
except for oxygen and fluorine.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:01.000
Well, that's not something
that builds confidence.

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.330
And that's something you
learned in 5.111, 5.112.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:18.370
The energy gap between 2s
and 2p depends on shielding.

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:29.250
And so as you start out with
lithium, 2s and 2p are--

00:50:29.250 --> 00:50:32.060
lithium is more like
hydrogen. So 2s and 2p

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.260
are nearly degenerate.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:42.090
When you get to fluorine, the
energy gap between 2s and 2p

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:51.900
is enormous because
2s shields 2p.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:55.200
And as a result, the--

00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:05.680
well, the shielding arguments
explain this energy gap.

00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:09.370
And it gets large
because 2s is unshielded,

00:51:09.370 --> 00:51:16.210
and it really gets very stable,
whereas 2p is increasingly

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:23.440
affected by the shielding by
s, and as a charge, increases

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.430
the orbital energy.

00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:27.920
OK, I thought I had a
better explanation for it.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:28.950
But I do have one.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:31.120
It's just not handy.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:32.420
And so what happens?

00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:39.580
Well, what happens, as
you go from lithium, where

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.610
this and this are
close together,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:47.320
you have interaction between
orbitals of the same symmetry.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:58.350
Now the Hamiltonian
is totally symmetric.

00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:00.750
Oh, my goodness.

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.020
So because the Hamiltonian
is totally symmetric,

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:08.070
you can have interactions
between orbitals

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:12.000
of the same symmetry.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.630
And as a result, this
guy gets pushed up.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.270
And this guy gets pushed up.

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:23.770
And this guy gets pushed down.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:26.290
But these are so far out of
the picture you don't care.

00:52:26.290 --> 00:52:29.070
So it's really just the
relative energies of these two.

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:33.070
And it's all due to the
relative energies of 2s and 2p.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.160
And then you get the correct
energy-level diagram.

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:39.062
And you say, well, maybe as we
went across the periodic table,

00:52:39.062 --> 00:52:40.020
there will be a switch.

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.400
And there is a switch.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:47.550
And since I've lived most
of my early life in CO

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.490
and N 2 and O 2.

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:52.000
I've encountered that.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:53.460
And I thought about it a lot.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:55.770
OK so that's pretty
much all I'm going

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.800
to say about the
molecular-orbital diagram.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.660
I think next lecture
is on Huckel theory.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.210
OK.

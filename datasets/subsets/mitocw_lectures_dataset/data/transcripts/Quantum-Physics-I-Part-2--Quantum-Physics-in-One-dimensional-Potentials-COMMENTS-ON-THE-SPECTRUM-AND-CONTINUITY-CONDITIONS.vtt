00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.580
PROFESSOR: Would solving this
equation for some potential,

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.054
and since h is Hermitian,
we found the results

00:00:20.054 --> 00:00:22.230
that we mentioned last time.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.950
That is the
eigenfunctions of h are

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:33.970
going to form an
orthonormal set of functions

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.300
that span the space.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.690
You can expand
anything on there.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.460
This is what we proved for
a general condition operator

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.540
to some degree.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:01:03.082
So the eigenfunctions
form an orthonormal set

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:09.960
that spans the space.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.110
So you're going to define
that psi 1 with an E1

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:22.762
and psi 2 with an E2,
and then this continues.

00:01:22.762 --> 00:01:33.140
And this is called the
spectrum of the theory

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.970
because energy eigenstates are
considered the gold standard.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.088
If you want to find
solving a theory

00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:45.984
means finding the
energy eigenstates.

00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:50.120
Because if you find the energy
eigenstates, you can solve,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.960
you can write any wave
function of superposition

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.334
of energetic states and
then just let them evolve.

00:01:57.334 --> 00:02:01.230
And the energetic
states involve easily

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.863
because they are just
stationary states.

00:02:04.863 --> 00:02:09.199
So the spectrum of the
theory is the collection

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.980
of numbers that are the
allowed energies and of course,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.295
the associated eigenfunctions.

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:22.280
So the energies may be many,
maybe discrete, maybe it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.550
has a little bit of
continuous partners,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.560
all kind of varieties.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.340
But your task is to find
those for any problem.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.100
So the equation that
we're trying to solve

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.570
is now re-written.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.265
We're going to try to solve it.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:49.754
So let's look at it.

00:02:53.163 --> 00:02:57.624
It's a second order
differential equation

00:02:57.624 --> 00:03:00.660
with a potential in general.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.040
So we had an example there.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.786
It's there.

00:03:04.786 --> 00:03:06.450
It's boxed.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.270
So we'll write it
slightly different,

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.800
remove the potential
to the right-hand side

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.890
and get rid of the
constants here.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:46.540
So d x squared is equal
to 2m over h squared.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.100
So this is the equation
we have to solve.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.760
So whenever you
have a problem, you

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.963
may encounter a
potential, v of x.

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:43.440
And the question is how
bad this potential can be.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:53.650
Well, the potential may be nice
and simple, or it may be nice

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.620
but then has some jumps.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.950
It may have infinite
jumps, like a potential is

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:12.040
a complete barrier, or it
may have delta functions.

00:05:15.456 --> 00:05:19.165
all these are v of
x equal possibles.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.270
All of them.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.370
Many things can happen
with a potential.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.830
In fact, the potential
can be as strange

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.610
as you're one, depending on
what problems you want to solve.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.930
So it's your choice.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.700
Now, we're going to accept, in
fact, all of those potentials

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.510
for our analysis.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.240
May be nice and smooth.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.560
There may have discontinuities.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.466
It may have infinite
discontinuities,

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:58.630
and worse things
like delta function.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:04.420
But worse things than
that we will ignore,

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.640
and there are worse
things than that.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.710
Maybe a potential discontinues
at every point, or maybe

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:18.060
a potential has delta
functions and derivatives

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.760
of delta functions.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.490
Or potentials that blow up
and do all kinds of things.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.600
And I'm not saying you
should never consider that.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.120
I'm saying that we don't know
of any very useful case where

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.500
you get anything
interesting with that.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.810
But a conceivable a particular
time a singular potential one

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:44.530
day could be used.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.912
So we'll look at
these potentials

00:06:46.912 --> 00:07:00.390
and try to understand how to
set up boundary conditions.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:05.796
And we're going to worry
about basically psi

00:07:05.796 --> 00:07:08.820
and how does it behave.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:15.996
And my first claim is that
psi of x has to be continuous.

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.385
So psi of x cannot jump.

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:32.090
The wave function move
along but cannot jump.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.960
And the reason is a
differential equation.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:42.915
Look, if psi of x
was not continuous,

00:07:42.915 --> 00:07:47.520
if psi of x was
like this, and just

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.290
had a discontinuity,
psi of x equal to x,

00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:58.466
psi prime of x would
contain a delta function

00:07:58.466 --> 00:08:00.831
and this is continuity.

00:08:00.831 --> 00:08:04.620
The derivative is infinite.

00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.440
And psi double prime of
x, the second derivative,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:13.350
would have a derivative of a
delta function which is worse

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:16.570
because a delta
function, we think of it

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:20.064
as a spike that is becoming
thinner and higher,

00:08:20.064 --> 00:08:24.740
but the derivative of the delta
function first goes to infinity

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:30.710
and then goes to minus infinity
and then comes back up.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:35.669
It's much worse in many ways.

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:39.679
And look, if you have
this differential equation

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:45.300
and psi is not continuous,
well, the right-hand side

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.920
is not continuous.

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:51.790
Or if you have a
delta function, then

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.810
something not continuous,
but left-hand side,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.630
we've had a derivative of a
delta function that is nowhere

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.000
on the right-hand side.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.510
On the right-hand side,
the worst that could exist

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.540
is a delta function in v of x.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.950
But the derivative of a
delta function doesn't exist.

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:18.477
So you cannot afford to have
a psi that is discontinuous.

00:09:18.477 --> 00:09:22.880
Psi has to be continuous.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.680
There's other ways
to argue this.

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.090
You might put them
in your notes,

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.488
but I'll leave it like that.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.020
Now how about the next case?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.560
I will say the
following happens too.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:53.510
Sine prime of x is
continuous unless v of x

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.188
has a delta function.

00:10:00.424 --> 00:10:05.950
You see, potentials of
delta functions are nice,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.769
they are interesting.

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:09.290
We will consider that.

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:12.190
Delta functions potentials
can be attractive

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:15.830
potentials, repulsive
potentials of [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:22.430
So I claim now that psi prime
of x has to also be continuous.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.170
Why are we worrying
about psi and psi

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.835
prime is because you need two
conditions whenever you're

00:10:28.835 --> 00:10:33.230
going to solve this differential
equation at an interface,

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.550
you will need to know
psi is continuous

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:37.550
and psi prime is
continuous because

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:41.500
of second-order
differential equations.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:48.250
So suppose psi
prime is continuous.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.030
Then there is no problem.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.856
If psi prime is continuous,
the worse that can happen

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:59.200
is that the second
derivative is discontinuous.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.900
And the second derivative
is discontinuous

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:07.330
could happen with a potential
of this discontinuous,

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:12.644
so one problem if psi
prime is continuous.

00:11:12.644 --> 00:11:18.100
But psi prime can fail to be
continuous if the potential has

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.585
a delta function.

00:11:19.585 --> 00:11:21.266
And let's see that.

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:32.760
If psi prime is
discontinuous, then

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.724
psi double prime is proportional
to a delta function.

00:11:42.158 --> 00:11:47.250
If psi prime is
discontinuous, double prime

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.194
is proportional to
a delta function.

00:11:50.194 --> 00:11:54.302
But here psi just
takes some value--

00:11:54.302 --> 00:11:55.852
there's nothing
strange about it--

00:11:55.852 --> 00:12:01.420
in order to have delta function,
which is psi double prime.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.230
To be equal to the
right-hand side, v of x

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.216
must have a delta function.

00:12:10.618 --> 00:12:19.239
And v will have
a delta function.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:23.002
So it will be a somewhat
similar potential,

00:12:23.002 --> 00:12:30.790
but we're going to look at
them in about a week from now.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:36.444
But this will be our
guidance to solve problems.

00:12:36.444 --> 00:12:38.980
The continuity of
the wave function

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:41.310
and the continuity of the
derivative of the wave

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.810
function.

00:12:41.810 --> 00:12:48.060
And for this slightly
more complicated problems

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.690
in which the potential
has a delta function,

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.070
then you will have a
discontinuity in psi prime,

00:12:56.070 --> 00:12:59.130
and it will be calculable,
and it's manageable,

00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:00.810
and it's all very nice.

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.695
Now, we do it a
little complicated,

00:13:02.695 --> 00:13:06.480
and everything is
mixed up, but you will

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:09.550
see that it's quite doable.

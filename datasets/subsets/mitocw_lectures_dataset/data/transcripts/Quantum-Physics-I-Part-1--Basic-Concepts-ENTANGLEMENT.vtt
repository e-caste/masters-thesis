BARTON ZWIEBACH: Let's talk
now about entanglement.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.220
So we talk about
entanglement when we have

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.620
two non-interacting particles.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.860
You don't need a strong
interaction between particles

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.780
to produce entanglement,
the particles

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.480
can be totally non-interacting.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:32.575
Suppose particle 1 can be
in any of these states--

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.840
u 1, u 2.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.980
Let's assume just u 1 and u 2.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.130
And particle 2 can be
in states v 1 and v 2.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.700
And you have these two
particles flying around,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.410
these are possible
states of particle 1

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.740
and possible states
of particle 2.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.010
Now you want to describe
the full system, the quantum

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.680
state of the two particles.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.420
States of the two particles.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.480
Two particles.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.420
Well, it seems reasonable
that to describe

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.420
the state of the two particles
that are not interacting,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.870
I should tell you what
particle 1 is doing

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.910
and what particle 2 is doing.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.440
OK, so particle 1
could be doing this.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.360
Could be u 1.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.420
And particle 2
could be doing v 1.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.610
And in a sense, by
telling you that,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.860
we've said what
everything is doing.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.410
Particle 1 is doing u 1,
particle 2 is doing u 2.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.280
And mathematically, we like
to make this look like a state

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.100
and we want to write
it in a coherent way.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.430
And we sort of multiply
these two things,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.750
but we must say
sort of multiply,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.110
because this strange
multiplication, this,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.860
you know, we think of
them as vectors or states,

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.560
so how do you multiply states?

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.150
So you put something
called the tensor

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.405
product, a little
multiplication like this.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.720
So you could say, don't worry,
it's kind of like a product,

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.400
and it's the way we do it.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.300
We don't move things across,
the first state here,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.700
the second state here, and
that's a possible state.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.060
Now, I could have
a different state.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.550
Because particle 1, in
fact, could be doing

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.920
something a little different.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.660
Could be doing alpha 1
u 1 plus alpha 2 u 2,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:21.930
and maybe particle 2 is doing
beta 1 v 1 plus beta 2 v 2.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.520
And this would be all right.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.850
I'm telling you what particle
1 is doing and I'm telling you

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.420
what particle 2 is
doing and the rules

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.940
of tensor multiplication or
this kind of multiplication

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.100
to combine those states
are just like a product,

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.750
except that as I said, you
never move the states across.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.660
So you just distribute, so
you have alpha 2, beta 1,

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:01.290
the number goes out, u 1 v 1--

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.310
that's the first factor--

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:23.000
plus alpha 1 beta 2 u 1 v 2
plus alpha 2 beta 1 u 2 v 1

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:33.120
plus alpha 2 beta 2 u 2 v 2.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.640
I think I got it right.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.420
Let me know.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.400
I just multiplied and
got the numbers out.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.350
The numbers can be move
out across this product.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:53.390
OK, so that's a state and that's
a superposition of states,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:05:03.410
so actually, I could try to
write a different state now.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.550
You see, we're just
experimenting, but here

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.430
is another state.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:19.240
u 1 v 1 plus u 2 v 2.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:32.700
Now this is a state that
actually seems different.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.940
Quite different.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.030
Because I don't seem
to be able to say

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.080
that what particle
1 is doing and what

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.645
particle 2 is doing separately.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:49.820
You see, I can say when
particle 1 is doing u 1,

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.180
particle 2 is doing v 1.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.810
And if when particle 1 is
doing u 2, this is v 2.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.470
But can I write
this as some state

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.660
of the first particle times some
state of the second particle?

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.490
Well, let's see.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.800
Maybe I can and can
write it in this form.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.050
This is the most general
state that you can say,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:26.940
particle 1 is doing this,
and particle 2 is doing that.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.360
So can they do that?

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.860
Well, I can compare these
two terms with those

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:39.360
and they conclude that
alpha 1 beta 1 must be 1.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.870
Alpha 2 beta 2 must be also 1.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:07:00.880
But no cross products exist,
so alpha 1 beta 2 must be 0

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:06.380
and alpha 2 beta 1 must be 0.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.130
And that's a problem
because either alpha 1

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.330
is 0, which is
inconsistent, or beta 2

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.830
is 0, which is
inconsistent with that,

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.240
so now this state
is un-factorizable.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.510
It's a funny state in which you
cannot say that this quantum

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.930
state can be described by
telling what the first particle

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.810
is doing and what the
second particle is doing.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.510
What the first particle is
doing depends on the second

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.540
and what the second is
doing depends on the first.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.391
This is an entangled state.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:03.800
And then we can build entangled
states and our very strange

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.240
states.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.210
So with two
particles with spins,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:14.150
for example, we can build
an entangled states of 2

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:18.160
spin 1/2 particles.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.580
And this state could
look like this--

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:32.370
the first particle is up along
z and the second particle is

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.940
down along z, plus
a particle that

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.900
is down along z for
the first particle,

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:46.480
but the second is up along z.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.410
And these are 2
spin 1/2 particles

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:57.920
and in the usual notation,
these experiments in quantum

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.470
mechanics and
black hole physics,

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.490
people speak of Alice and Bob.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.690
Alice has one particle,
Bob has the other particle.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:12.120
Maybe Alice is in the
moon and has her electron

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.950
and Bob is on earth
and has his electron,

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.450
and the two electrons, one
on the earth and in the moon,

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.490
are in this state.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:30.240
So then we say that Alice and
Bob share an entangled pair.

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.790
And all kinds of
strange things happen.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:37.350
People can do those things
in the lab-- not quite one

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.330
in the earth and
one in the moon,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.500
but one photon at one
place and another photon

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.950
entangled with it at
100 kilometers away,

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.220
that's pretty doable.

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:56.160
And they are in this funny state
in which their properties are

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.160
currently that in
surprising ways.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.220
So what happens here?

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:06.790
Suppose Alice
goes-- or let's say

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.320
Bob goes along and
measures his spin

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.900
and he finds his spin down.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.520
So-- oh, you look here,
oh, here is down for Bob.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.990
So at this moment, the whole
state collapses into this.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:26.320
Because up with Bob
didn't get realized.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.880
So once Bob measures
and he finds down,

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.540
the whole state goes into this.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:37.360
So if Alice-- on the moon
or in another galaxy--

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.780
at that instant
looks at her spin,

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.250
she will find it's
up before light

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:47.940
has had time to get there.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:50.150
Instantaneously.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.260
It will go into this state.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:58.670
People were sure somehow this
violates special relativity.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.210
It doesn't.

00:11:00.210 --> 00:11:02.555
You somehow when you think
about this carefully,

00:11:02.555 --> 00:11:04.720
you can't quite
send information,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.210
but the collapse
is instantaneous

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.090
in quantum mechanics.

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.910
Somehow, Bob and Alice cannot
communicate information

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:16.990
by sharing this entangled pair,
but it's an interesting thing

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.860
why it cannot happen.

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.920
Einstein again objected to this.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:26.180
And he said, this
is a fake thing.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:30.980
You guys are going to share--

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:34.590
and now, of course, they have
to share many entangled pairs

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.300
to do experiments, so maybe
1,000 entangled pairs.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:44.170
And Einstein would say, no,
that's not what's happening.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:49.400
What's happening is that some of
your entangled pairs are this.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.580
That is, Bob is down, Alice
is up, some of them are this--

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.560
and there's no such thing
as this entanglement

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.970
and indeed, if you
measure and you find down,

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.830
she will find up, and if
you measure and you find up,

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:10.750
she will find down, and there's
nothing too mysterious here.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:17.050
But then came John Bell in
1964 and discovered his Bell

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:22.210
inequalities that demonstrated
that if Alice and Bob can

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.720
measure in three
different directions,

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.550
they will find correlations
that are impossible to explain

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.680
with classical physics.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.640
It took a lot of originally
for Bell to discover this,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.040
that you have to measure
in three directions,

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:42.280
and therefore, the
kind of correlations

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:48.130
that appear in entangled states
are very subtle and pretty

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.060
difficult to disentangle.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:57.160
So that's why entanglement
is a very peculiar subject.

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.250
People think about it a lot
because it's very mysterious.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.720
It somehow violates
classical notions,

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.890
but in a very subtle way.

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:22.090
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.620
Welcome back.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.720
If all goes well, we'll
be joined in a few minutes

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.668
by a simple pendulum,
a little robot

00:00:27.668 --> 00:00:29.460
that we're going to
demonstrate everything.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.049
It turns out we had
a little license

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.900
issues in the last
minute, but we're

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.580
hoping to bring down
and actually play

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.950
with a real pendulum today.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.980
The goal of today
is fairly modest.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.590
We're just going to think about
pendula, a simple pendulum.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.390
When I say a simple
pendulum, I mean

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.580
the mass is concentrated
at the endpoint.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.760
Typically, we assume that
the inertia of the rod

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.630
is negligible.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.300
In many cases, I'll write the
inertia in there just in case.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:56.800
OK.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.340
So why should we spend an entire
lecture on a simple pendulum?

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.930
Right?

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.620
It seems boring.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.290
Well, I think you
could argue that if you

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.140
know what the simple
pendulum does,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.730
and you know what
it does when it's

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.230
got complicated
interaction forces, then

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.813
everything, because
most of our robots

00:01:12.813 --> 00:01:14.410
are just a bunch of pendula.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.280
But more important, I
think, is that the pendulum

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.010
is simple enough that
we can pretty much

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.650
completely understand
it in a single lecture.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.620
And it's going to be an
opportunity for me to introduce

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.550
basically all of the topics
I want to introduce in terms

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.580
of nonlinear dynamics
and the basic definitions

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.010
that we're going to use
throughout the class,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.000
and I can plot
everything about it.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.350
So actually, even in research,
when we're testing out

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.980
new algorithms, we almost always
spend a lot of time thinking

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.420
about how it works on
the simple pendulum.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.920
OK?

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.110
It's so simple,
but it's a staple.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.960
OK.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.600
So what are the dynamics
of the simple pendulum?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.240
I told you how to do the
Lagrangian dynamics quickly

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.957
yesterday, and there's a
more worked-out example

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:04.540
in your notes.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.380
If you pop in the
Lagrangian, the energy terms,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.530
into the Lagrangian for this
system, then what you get is I

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:29.890
theta double dot t plus mgl
sine theta equals whatever

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:36.076
my generalized forces are,
which I've been calling Q.

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.800
And for today's
purposes, let's assume

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.950
that Q, there's two generalized
torques that I care about.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.920
I want to model
a damping torque,

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.250
because most pendula
have some damping,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.260
and I want to model a
control input torque.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.760
OK?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.650
So I'm going to
worry about the case

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.280
where Q is of the form negative
B theta dot plus some control

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.060
input u of t.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.390
The damping doesn't
come out of Lagrange.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.520
You think of that as
an external input.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.020
OK.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:27.980
So all together, b theta dot
plus mgl sine theta equals u.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.950
OK?

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.450
All right.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.710
So this is a one-dimensional,
second-order differential

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.808
equation.

00:03:42.808 --> 00:03:45.100
What would it mean to solve
this differential equation?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.250
To really solve this
differential equation, what

00:03:51.250 --> 00:04:00.970
that would mean is that if
I gave you theta times 0

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.860
and theta dotted times 0,
the initial conditions.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.360
Right?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.540
And I gave you some
control input over time,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.860
then I'd like you to be
able to tell me theta of t

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:15.915
and theta dot of t.

00:04:15.915 --> 00:04:16.415
Right?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.690
That would be a satisfying
solution to the differential

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.620
equation, if we could have that,
and that's the standard way

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.700
to think about solving
the differential equation.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.908
It turns out for the pendulum,
if what you care about

00:04:33.908 --> 00:04:36.190
is the long-term dynamics
of the pendulum, that's

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.170
actually not a very
practical way to think

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:39.670
about the pendulum.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.650
It turns out if you just try to
integrate this enclosed form,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.610
there's no solution in terms
of elementary functions.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.420
In fact, the integral
of these sine terms

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.670
comes up enough
that people created

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.400
a different type of
function which are

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.990
sort of elementary functions.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.750
They're called elliptic
integrals of the first kind,

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.170
and long story short,
there's not a lot of insight

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.570
to be gained by
actually integrating,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.420
in just a pure calculus
sense, these equations.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.070
It'll give you an
elliptic function

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.010
that you could pop into
Matlab and make a plot,

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.440
but it's not going to
give you a lot of insight.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.320
And actually in the
notes, for completeness, I

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.570
did give you the
elliptic integral form,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.760
but I won't trouble you
with that on the board here.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.260
OK.

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.570
So maybe there's another way.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.320
If I care about what
this pendulum's going

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.220
to do in the long term, if I
care about where theta is going

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.470
to be as time goes to
infinity, then there

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.450
are a bunch of other
techniques I can use.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:38.080
OK?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.990
And the ones that I'm
going to use today

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.210
are graphical
solution techniques.

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.130
And it's actually
the best reference

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:55.480
for that is this book
by Steve Strogatz called

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.950
Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.450
Has anybody seen that book?

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.740
It's a great book, very, very
readable book, just brilliant.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:17.740
So it's a Nonlinear Dynamics
and Chaos by Steve Strogatz.

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.460
He's at Cornell.

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.880
OK.

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.240
So let's think about
how we could possibly

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:38.585
solve that system graphically,
and let me start by solving

00:06:38.585 --> 00:06:39.710
a slightly simpler problem.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.270
Instead of making u
a function of time,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.270
let's make a constant torque.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.190
OK?

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.440
And I'm going to look
at a special case, where

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.530
the system has very heavy
damping, just to get started.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:07:10.400
Let's think about a special
case, a very heavily damped

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.350
pendulum with constant torque.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.680
OK?

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.180
OK.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.520
So what do I mean by that?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:29.120
So in this equation, the heavily
damped, what I care about

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.340
is that the viscous forces do
the damping are significant

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.310
compared to the inertial
forces of the pendulum.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:40.770
If you're in fluid's, it
feels like a Reynolds number

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.270
argument.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.520
This would be equivalent to
having a very low Reynolds

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.170
number system.

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:44.840
OK?

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.360
But what I care about
for this argument,

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:52.950
I want to say that b over I
is much, much greater than 1.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.450
Right?

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:03.560
And I'm going to say
that u of t is just

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.130
some nominal, some constant u0.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:09.050
OK?

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:11.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.610
PROFESSOR: It's not a
dimensionless quantity.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:14.110
Right?

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.530
So if you want a
dimensionless Reynolds number,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.280
an analogy would be you'd
need a square root of g

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.110
over l or some time
constant on the bottom,

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:26.540
but this is a number with
units that's greater than 1.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.050
Good catch.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:28.550
OK.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:31.950
So why is this the
relevant thing?

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:35.000
So now, if I look at
the same equation,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.470
if I do u0 minus mgl
sine theta equals I

00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:47.840
theta double dot
plus be theta dot.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.890
If b is dramatically
bigger than I,

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:59.090
then this right-hand side looks
about like just b theta dot.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.383
These terms swap these terms.

00:09:01.383 --> 00:09:03.050
Then, I'm going to
make an approximation

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:07.910
of this right-hand side
with just b theta dot.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.080
Reasonable.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.710
OK.

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:12.252
So the reason I'm thinking about
this heavily-damped pendulum

00:09:12.252 --> 00:09:15.170
example is because it changes
our second-order system

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.430
into our first-order system.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:17.160
OK?

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.470
It'll just be a way to start.

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:23.083
And that's a general thing.

00:09:23.083 --> 00:09:24.500
At a very low
Reynolds number, you

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:30.100
can start thinking of things as
being mostly first order also.

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.600
OK.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.225
So now, I've got this
simpler equation.

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:35.688
I want to make one more
simplification, actually,

00:09:35.688 --> 00:09:36.230
for a minute.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.120
I'm going to just
forget about the fact

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.350
that theta wraps around
on top of each other.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:40.850
OK?

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:46.265
So just let's ignore wrapping.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.120
It's not a big deal, but
let's just keep it clean.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.830
And to be very explicit
about that, I'm

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.910
going to replace theta with x.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.660
Just remember that
we've ignored wrapping.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.100
So my equations now are bx dot--

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:12.740
excellent-- is u0
minus mgl sine x.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.525
Thanks, guys.

00:10:15.525 --> 00:10:17.863
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:17.863 --> 00:10:18.530
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.640
OK.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.800
So we have a pendulum,
but it's got a boot.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.886
So it's amazing that
clocks work so well.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.970
OK.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.865
Simple, first-order equation,
it's a nonlinear equation.

00:10:34.865 --> 00:10:36.740
So how do I understand
the long-term behavior

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:37.980
of that system?

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:38.480
OK.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.440
Well, Strogatz says, if you've
got a one-dimensional system,

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:46.490
first-order, then you can think
of that like a flow on a line.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:47.540
So let me tell you what.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:57.230
So one d, first-order,
we're going

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:03.560
to do it a flow on a line.

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.910
OK?

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:11.750
So what I want to plot here,
I'll plot it really big.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.930
I'm going to plot theta
over here, x over here.

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:26.210
We're in x-coordinates
here, x, and I

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.930
want to plot x dot over here.

00:11:28.930 --> 00:11:30.343
OK?

00:11:30.343 --> 00:11:31.760
So this is just a
simple function,

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.800
x dot as a function of x.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.770
What does it look like?

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.930
Well, it looks like negative
sine of x possibly shifted

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:41.930
up or down a little bit.

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:42.890
Right?

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:48.500
Let's say, let me draw the
no-torque input case first.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:52.610
Then, it just looks like x
dot is negative sine of x,

00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:54.410
so something like this.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:03.680
OK?

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:09.380
Where the height of
that is mgl over b.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:09.880
Right?

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:19.890
OK?

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.980
So now, can you tell me
quickly where the fixed

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:28.600
points of the system Are

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.413
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:30.413 --> 00:12:31.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.390
So any time x dot equals
0, we have a fixed point

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.510
of the system, and that's
really the first dynamic concept

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:45.530
I care about here is when,
in this case, x dot equals 0.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:46.470
OK?

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:49.020
And in this case, it's
not too hard to solve

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.520
for the 0s of that
equation anyways,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.350
but graphically, it's
blatantly obvious

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.970
that you get a fixed point here,
a fixed point here, a fixed

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.030
point here, and of course,
every 2 pi, it'll repeat.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.900
Right?

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.660
Every pi it'll repeat.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.410
Right?

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.710
Pretty simple.

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:06.210
OK.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:08.040
But now, let's think about
the stability of those fixed

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:09.720
points and not just
in a local sense,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.240
but let's really think about
the stability of those fixed

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.740
points.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.160
Is this fixed point stable?

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:22.840
Yes.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.490
OK.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:27.435
How can you see graphically
that it's stable?

00:13:27.435 --> 00:13:29.578
AUDIENCE: The slope is negative.

00:13:29.578 --> 00:13:31.620
PROFESSOR: So locally,
the slope tells me exactly

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.170
that if the slope is negative,
then it's got to be stable.

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.720
But even in a more global
nonlinear thinking about it

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.860
sense, anywhere that this
curve is above the line,

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.470
that means I have a
flow going to the right.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.270
Right?

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:48.210
So everywhere in this regime,
I know that the system

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.200
is moving that way.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.070
Right?

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.540
Everywhere in this
regime, I know

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.110
the flow's going to this
way, and so on and so forth.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.030
OK?

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:04.760
So even without
any local analysis,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:09.650
it's crystal clear that if
I start the system somewhere

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:13.700
over here, some amount of time
later it's going to be there.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.780
Right?

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:17.000
So I'm going to use
a filled in circle

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.660
to describe that
stable fixed point,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.270
and this one is going
to be stable also.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.698
And then is this fixed
point stable or unstable?

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.490
AUDIENCE: Unstable.

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:28.280
PROFESSOR: Unstable, right?

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.730
Nearby points are going
to leave that fixed point

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:34.410
and go somewhere else.

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:34.910
OK.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.950
But stability is such
a central concept

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:39.110
in robotics and in
this class that I

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.740
want to be a little
careful about it.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:46.850
There's multiple forms of
stability that we care about.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.295
Typically, we talk about
even local stability.

00:15:09.543 --> 00:15:10.960
The first definition
we care about

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:18.460
is a fixed point can be
locally stable in the sense

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:34.000
of Lyapunov, which is
often shorthand isl.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:54.760
A fixed point can be locally,
asymptotically stable,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.580
and a fixed point can be
locally, exponentially stable.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:10.540
OK.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:13.190
Who knows what it means
to be stable in the sense

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:13.690
of Lyapunov?

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:18.688
Anybody have an
intuitive understanding

00:16:18.688 --> 00:16:19.480
of what that means?

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:25.830
AUDIENCE: We start within a
certain distance of that point.

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:30.418
Well, it's kind of founded
the more we go farther away.

00:16:30.418 --> 00:16:31.210
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.550
Yeah.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:36.540
So typically, I have to define
some sort of distance metric,

00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:38.250
let's say just some
Euclidean distance.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.080
What I want to say
is that, if I start

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.600
with my initial conditions
are near some point,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:46.970
then they're not going to
go away from that point.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:50.330
And specifically, the way
that the sense of Lyapunov

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:54.740
is written, it says if I want
to guarantee that for all time

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:59.120
I am within this distance, say
epsilon distance of the fixed

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.540
point, then you need
to be able to pick

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:04.160
some delta, some
small delta, for which

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.013
if I start the system
inside the delta--

00:17:07.013 --> 00:17:09.180
delta is going to have to
be less than the epsilon--

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.849
then it'll always,
for all time, it'll

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:13.130
stay inside the epsilon ball.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.930
I'm going to write it down.

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:16.430
OK.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:25.099
A fixed point, let's
say that a fixed point x

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:38.510
star is stable in the sense
of Lyapunov if for all epsilon

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:47.390
there exists a delta for
which if x of 0 minus x

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.220
star in some norm, let's
say a Euclidean distance

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:57.110
or something like that,
is less than delta,

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:05.840
then for all t, x of t minus
x star is less than epsilon.

00:18:10.205 --> 00:18:11.250
Does that make sense?

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:24.820
OK.

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:27.250
So we've got a simple
pendulum plot that tells us

00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.930
something about stability here.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.450
Is this fixed point stable
in the sense of Lyapunov?

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:36.120
Yeah.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.620
Right?

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.162
It's stable in the
sense of Lyapunov.

00:18:38.162 --> 00:18:40.400
Let's say you tell
me that for all time

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:44.660
I want this thing to be
within this epsilon distance.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.430
Right?

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.710
Then you can pick
anything, any delta

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.690
smaller than that epsilon,
and I know that it's

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:52.550
going to stay inside that ball.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.420
Right?

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:57.920
So in fact in this one, you
could choose delta as epsilon,

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.600
and it would be fine.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.190
OK?

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:02.840
So these flows on a
line are certainly

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.810
sufficient for
checking stability

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.810
in the sense of Lyapunov.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.680
People OK with that?

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.180
Good.

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:11.780
OK.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.940
What about
asymptotically stable?

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.459
What does it mean intuitively
to be asymptotically stable?

00:19:17.459 --> 00:19:20.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.560
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:30.550
So a system is
asymptotically stable,

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.888
if as t goes to
infinity x is actually

00:19:32.888 --> 00:19:34.180
going to be at the fixed point.

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.973
If you start in a neighborhood,
then as time goes to infinity,

00:19:37.973 --> 00:19:39.640
x is actually going
to get to the point.

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:52.210
So if x0 equals x star
plus some epsilon--

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.060
I'm saying epsilon and delta
meaning things that are small,

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.520
because these are, when I
talk about local stability,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.030
I mean these small things.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.110
If x0 starts a small distance
away from the fixed point,

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:11.762
then x at infinity
equals a fixed point.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.410
OK.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:23.360
So can we tell from our
plots that this thing

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.100
is asymptotically stable?

00:20:31.548 --> 00:20:33.036
What's that?

00:20:33.036 --> 00:20:36.508
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.453 --> 00:20:40.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.492
I think you can.

00:20:41.492 --> 00:20:42.950
I think that this
system we know is

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.050
going to go to this, as
time goes to infinity.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:46.490
I think that's quite OK.

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.440
Asymptotic stability is
considered a stricter form

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.300
of stability than stability
in the sense of Lyapunov.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.280
Right?

00:20:59.280 --> 00:20:59.780
OK.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:03.350
What about
exponential stability?

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.000
Exponential stability
means not just

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.500
that I'm going to
get there, but I'm

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.680
going to get there at some
rate, at some exponential rate.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:16.640
So if x0 is x star plus
some epsilon, that implies,

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:23.600
exponential stability implies,
that x of t minus x star

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:35.170
is less than some exponential
for C alpha greater than 0.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.830
OK.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:42.610
Then, I'm going to get there
in exponential fashion,

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.923
at least as fast
as an exponential.

00:21:44.923 --> 00:21:46.840
So can you tell exponential
stability in this?

00:21:54.845 --> 00:21:56.220
The point of these
methods is not

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.640
to talk about the rate
of something converging.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.390
So I think the first
answer is not really.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:11.970
But if you think about it, if
you were to draw some line,

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.330
if something was a
constant slope here,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.300
then that system would
converge exponentially fast.

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:20.670
So I think as long as
your curve is bounded by--

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.090
is above some line, then
that would satisfy the time

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:26.230
constant criteria.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:26.730
OK?

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.110
But we're going to use
those different definitions

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.078
throughout the class,
so I want to make sure

00:22:30.078 --> 00:22:30.870
that they're clear.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.080
OK.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:47.080
So we said fixed points.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.990
We talked about a little
bit about local stability.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:23:00.260
Let's talk about another
important concept which

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:02.245
is the basins of attraction.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:13.790
OK?

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:20.160
So for some fixed point x star,
some stable fixed point x star,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.210
I want to know, if I ask what
the basin of attraction is,

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:30.530
that means it's the set of
initial conditions, which will

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:32.710
get me to this fixed point.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:33.210
Right?

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.110
It's the bounded region
of initial conditions,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:59.790
then set of initial conditions
for which x of t as t

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.840
goes to infinity equals x star.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:10.580
So what's the basin of
attraction of that fixed point?

00:24:16.014 --> 00:24:17.653
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:17.653 --> 00:24:18.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.160
Good.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:19.660
Right?

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.180
OK?

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:32.840
So this entire region here,
not including those points,

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.150
but this entire region here
is the basin of attraction

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.830
of that fixed point, and these
borders here, these lines which

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.360
separate the basins
of attraction,

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.650
they're called the separatrix.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:43.150
Right?

00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:50.903
Does it look like it's working?

00:24:50.903 --> 00:24:51.750
AUDIENCE: It will.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:52.333
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:56.240
OK.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.282
So let's just think about
this for a second here.

00:24:58.282 --> 00:25:00.060
So I've got an
overdamped pendulum.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:00.980
OK?

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.640
This is the fixed point at 0.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:07.760
My coordinate system is
sets of 0 is the bottom.

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.455
Right?

00:25:09.455 --> 00:25:10.580
I don't have to use my arm.

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:12.330
I've got a pendulum right
here, and even if it's off--

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:12.913
can I move it?

00:25:12.913 --> 00:25:13.710
Yeah.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:14.210
OK.

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:16.820
So this is state equals 0.

00:25:16.820 --> 00:25:18.860
We just said that, if
the system's overdamped,

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.943
then we've got a stable
fixed point at the bottom.

00:25:20.943 --> 00:25:23.690
I think we can all believe that.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:27.180
If it was overdamped, it
would just go like this.

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:27.680
Right?

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.340
This is an underdamped system,
but the first-order dynamics

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:33.810
will take it to this
stable fixed point.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:34.460
OK?

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.890
The separatrix of that
stable fixed point

00:25:36.890 --> 00:25:39.560
are the unstable
fixed points, up here.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.370
Right?

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:45.260
So an overdamped pendulum,
if it's right here,

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:47.270
will come to rest here.

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:47.770
Right?

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.110
If it's right here, it'll come
to rest on the other side.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.860
Right?

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:53.152
That's the basin of attraction.

00:25:53.152 --> 00:25:54.290
That's the separatrix.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.760
I think it makes total sense.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.180
OK.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.510
What happens now, if we
start adding control torque

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.540
to this overdamped pendulum?

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.910
It's just this constant
control torque, what happens?

00:26:14.205 --> 00:26:15.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
up or down.

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:15.890
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:16.540
Yeah.

00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:19.870
So remember, I'm just working
of this equation here.

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.890
That's going to move that
whole line up or down.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:22.390
All right?

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:25.360
So what's that going to
do to the fixed points?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:31.390
What happens if I do
u0 equals mgl over 2b?

00:26:36.836 --> 00:26:40.490
You see where I'm
going with that?

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:43.752
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:44.443 --> 00:26:45.110
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.110
It might be that simple.

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:48.980
It could be that.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.850
I didn't think it out that far.

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:00.250
OK.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:11.720
So if u0 not equals mgl
over 2b, then this curve

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.470
is going to be up.

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.970
Right?

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.430
So it's going to be some
sine wave like this.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:19.590
OK.

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:24.000
And the fixed points are
going to move together.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:24.840
Right?

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:30.415
So I've got fixed points like
this, fixed points like this.

00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:33.726
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.420
PROFESSOR: Why do you say that?

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:43.320
AUDIENCE: Well, just because
it gets divided by d.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.070
PROFESSOR: Oh, it does
get-- you're right.

00:27:45.070 --> 00:27:45.570
Good call.

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.150
Yep.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:47.650
Thank you.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.370
Just mgl over 2.

00:27:48.370 --> 00:27:48.870
Good.

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.110
Yep.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.610
OK.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:55.940
So the fixed point
start moving together.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.820
Do you believe that?

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.960
Do you believe that in the
physical interpretation

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.310
of the pendulum?

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.810
This one's still
going to be stable.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.012
We could see that quickly.

00:28:03.012 --> 00:28:04.345
This one's going to be unstable.

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:09.620
Right?

00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.270
So if I apply a
constant torque, which

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:14.600
I will do as soon as Zack
gives me a green light,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.912
but if I apply constant
torque, positive torque,

00:28:17.912 --> 00:28:20.120
it's going to start moving
the fixed point like this.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:20.970
OK?

00:28:20.970 --> 00:28:23.400
The unstable fixed point
is also going to move.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:23.900
Right?

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.470
It's going to be
coming down like this,

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.185
and the basins of
attraction changed.

00:28:29.185 --> 00:28:30.060
The separatrix moved.

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.685
So if this system's
here, it's actually

00:28:31.685 --> 00:28:35.150
going to go around
to this and likewise.

00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:35.930
OK?

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:39.580
It's nice you can see that so
easily from these little plots.

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:46.841
OK, and what happens
if I put in u is 2mgl?

00:28:46.841 --> 00:28:49.003
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:49.003 --> 00:28:49.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:50.150
Exactly.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:50.650
Right?

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.000
I won't do that, because
I might hurt Zack.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.580
But as soon as this,
at the critical point

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.810
where this whole curve
is above the line,

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.990
then the thing's just going
to move this way forever.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.530
OK.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.405
So just thinking about
these flows on a line,

00:29:05.405 --> 00:29:09.380
you could start seeing
what first-order,

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:12.650
single, one-dimensional
systems can do.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:16.490
So you know they can
go to a fixed point.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:22.790
We just saw they can go to
infinity, if u0 is 2mgl.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.084
Can they ever oscillate?

00:29:34.615 --> 00:29:35.740
I don't see how they could.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.450
Right?

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.460
I said, it's either going this
way, or it's going this way.

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.460
There's no oscillations
in a first-order system,

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:43.110
and the mechanical
engineers know that,

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:45.000
but this is a graphical
way to see what

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.050
that happens, what that means.

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:49.770
So actually, it turns
out the only thing

00:29:49.770 --> 00:29:54.720
that a first-order,
one-dimensional system could do

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:57.270
is end up at a fixed
point or blow up.

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:57.770
Right?

00:30:00.922 --> 00:30:02.380
There can be a lot
of fixed points.

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:02.590
Right?

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.550
It could be a flat line.

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:05.425
It could be that it
could be stable anywhere.

00:30:05.425 --> 00:30:08.260
That's fine, but it'll always
either end up at a fixed point,

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.010
or it'll blow up.

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.510
OK?

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:18.430
All right.

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:20.980
So it's a general tool.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:26.980
It's certainly good for
things other than pendula.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:29.650
Let me just give one
other nonlinear system

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.060
example that's one dimensional
and first order, so we can

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:38.270
think about a few more terms.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:38.770
OK.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:44.987
So this one is called,
just another example,

00:30:44.987 --> 00:30:46.945
this one's actually called
a nonlinear autapse.

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:56.590
Anybody have any guess
what the heck that means?

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.320
Even a crazy guess?

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.960
It's actually a
model of a neuron.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.930
OK?

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:09.520
I did my PhD with
the neuroscientists,

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.040
so I often think about
things that are like neurons.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.540
OK?

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.000
If you've ever seen
neural networks,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.020
dynamic neural networks, a
pretty common representation

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:26.140
of a neural network is with one
of these sigmoid functions that

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:28.630
are weighted by
some parameter w,

00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:32.103
let's say, a weight parameter,
but that's inconsequential.

00:31:32.103 --> 00:31:33.520
All you have to
care about here is

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.150
that I've got a first-order,
nonlinear system

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:39.040
with a parameter w.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:39.760
OK?

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.802
And again graphically, we
can tell you everything

00:31:41.802 --> 00:31:44.330
you need to know about
the system pretty quickly.

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.830
OK?

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:49.255
So who knows what
it tanh looks like?

00:31:49.255 --> 00:31:50.380
I just said it's a sigmoid.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:50.880
Right?

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:56.800
So if you know a lot
about a tanh, so a tanh,

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.710
it goes from 1 to negative 1.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.180
This is x.

00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:08.686
This is tanh of wx.

00:32:08.686 --> 00:32:12.550
For w equals 1, it turns out
you have a slope of 1 here,

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:17.210
and you go up, and you
asymptote like this.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.040
OK?

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:19.390
That's w equals 1.

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:31.310
For w a lot greater than
1, you're even steeper,

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:32.560
but you get to the same place.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.210
So let's say that's w equals 3.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.700
And then if you're
less than 1, it's

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.160
going to be even more shallower.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.340
This is why bring
sidewalk chalk to class.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:49.840
OK?

00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:02.110
So let's say that's
w equals 0.5.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:02.610
OK.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:07.740
So now, what is the
system x dot equals

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.560
negative x plus tanh look like?

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.658
If I want to actually
draw my flow on the line,

00:33:12.658 --> 00:33:13.950
what's that going to look like?

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:36.730
If I want to plot x versus
x dot here, OK, well, I

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.510
could plot both of
them independently.

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:41.350
So I know how x dot
equals negative x looks.

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.535
I know how tanh looks.

00:33:44.535 --> 00:33:45.910
That function is
just going to be

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.930
this thing put on the line
x dot equals negative x.

00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:55.960
So what that means
is for w equals 1,

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:02.380
I have a system that comes in
like this and goes like that.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:13.400
For w equals 3, I have a
system that goes like this,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.060
and for w equals 1/2, I have
a system that goes like this.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:20.830
OK?

00:34:27.005 --> 00:34:30.489
Does that make sense?

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.650
So the reason I
chose this system

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:37.210
is I want to tell you
quickly about bifurcations

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.630
and how to make
bifurcation diagrams.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.320
OK?

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.830
So where are the fixed
points of this system?

00:34:47.966 --> 00:34:50.100
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:51.210
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.699
So I definitely have
a fixed point here.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:56.544
Is it stable or unstable?

00:34:56.544 --> 00:34:57.383
AUDIENCE: Unstable?

00:34:57.383 --> 00:34:58.800
PROFESSOR: It
depends on w though.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.330
Right?

00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:04.120
In one case, it's unstable,
and in one case, it's stable.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:04.770
OK?

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:08.280
And then in some cases,
in the blue case,

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:13.170
I have fixed points here,
and in the red case, I don't.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.920
Right?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.080
So this is a system which, as
I change my run parameter w,

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.580
I change the number
of fixed points,

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.710
and I change the stability
of those fixed points.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.210
OK?

00:35:25.210 --> 00:35:27.550
It's one of the simpler
systems where you see that.

00:35:36.304 --> 00:35:41.840
So a change in the
number of fixed points,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.500
as you vary parameter is
called the bifurcation.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:45.000
OK?

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:57.860
And you can make
bifurcation diagrams,

00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.300
which for a system like
this, the x-axis is

00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:08.630
the parameter you're changing,
and the y-axis is the fixed

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.560
point.

00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:11.060
OK?

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:21.500
So if w is less than
1, what did we say?

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.010
We've got a fixed
point at the origin,

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:26.270
and is it stable or unstable?

00:36:29.992 --> 00:36:30.700
AUDIENCE: Stable?

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:31.900
PROFESSOR: Stable.

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:32.830
OK?

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.770
So there's a critical point
here, where w equals 1.

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:41.140
We know that now, because that's
where the slope of tanh is 1.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.460
And if it's less
than 1, it turns out

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.090
for all w less than 1, I
have a stable fixed point

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:49.790
at the origin.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:52.210
So I use a solid line
to say a stable fixed

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:57.540
point and a dashed line for
an unstable fixed point.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:04.450
OK?

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:06.850
And then for w greater
than 1, what do I have?

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.973
I've got three fixed points.

00:37:12.973 --> 00:37:13.890
Which ones are stable?

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.690
Which one's unstable?

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.220
I just used my
plurals in a way that

00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.960
could only imply one solution.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.880
AUDIENCE: The middle
one is not as stable.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.400
PROFESSOR: The middle one
is not stable, is unstable,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.750
and the outside ones are stable.

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:27.250
OK?

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:31.420
So and it turns out, if you vary
w smoothly, then you get this.

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:36.290
OK?

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:43.000
Where this goes to
1, something like 1.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.330
It's not quite 1.

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:46.850
It's around 1.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.930
It's whatever 1 plus
the tanh of 1 is.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:51.860
OK?

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:57.140
It asymptotes like this, and
this fixed point in the middle

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.105
remains, but it
becomes unstable.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.260
OK?

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:12.080
So bifurcations are a critical
concept in nonlinear dynamics.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.360
Give us a crash course.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:18.290
This is actually called
a pitchforked bifurcation

00:38:18.290 --> 00:38:19.500
for obvious reasons.

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.000
Right?

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:30.020
And that's actually
a pretty common one.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:31.340
You'll run into many others.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.320
There's saddle bifurcations,
and there's also,

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.480
I think there's just
strangely named ones.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.690
I think there's a
blue sky bifurcation.

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:45.410
Pretty much any name you
look for, you can find

00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:47.790
a bifurcation named after it.

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:48.290
OK.

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:51.140
So good.

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.420
I think we know a
lot of what there

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:58.130
is to know about first-order,
nonlinear, one-dimensional

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.630
systems.

00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:59.130
OK?

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.653
I think in a lot
of classes, we're

00:39:00.653 --> 00:39:03.320
trained to think linear systems,
linear systems, linear systems.

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.772
I can do everything in linear.

00:39:04.772 --> 00:39:06.230
It turns out, you
can do everything

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.600
in a nonlinear
system too, if it's

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.730
first-order one-dimensional.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.730
But that's an important axis
that we don't see too much,

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.540
I think, and it helps to know
what all these concepts are.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.660
I think Zack says can now do--

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.940
can we do the overdamped.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.440
ZACK: Sure.

00:39:26.445 --> 00:39:27.780
How overdamped do you want it?

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:31.160
PROFESSOR: We wanted
gravity to be at 0.8.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.090
ZACK: OK.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:38.380
PROFESSOR: And we wanted
to damping to be, I think--

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:38.880
I'm sorry.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:43.014
Damping is negative 8, and
gravity was positive 0.85.

00:39:43.014 --> 00:39:44.117
ZACK: OK.

00:39:44.117 --> 00:39:44.700
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:45.700
So what do we have here?

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.780
We've got a big motor,
a little pendulum.

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:49.556
Yeah?

00:39:49.556 --> 00:39:52.380
ZACK: Could you move
it into [INAUDIBLE]??

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.480
PROFESSOR: Can I move it?

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.074
Yeah?

00:39:54.074 --> 00:39:55.277
ZACK: As long as we don't--

00:39:55.277 --> 00:39:56.610
PROFESSOR: Don't pull the power.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:59.230
Right?

00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.730
Good.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.390
That's fine.

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.420
OK.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.000
Big motor, DC motor.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.377
There's a gearbox
here, but we're

00:40:07.377 --> 00:40:09.210
going to be commanding
current which is just

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.370
like applying that
torque there, modulo

00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:14.530
some errors in the
gearbox, and just

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.740
an otherwise passive pendulum.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.240
OK?

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.500
So Zack has written the
basic system identification,

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.590
so we know what the mass
is, what the damping is.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.548
It's not quite the simple
damping I showed you,

00:40:27.548 --> 00:40:29.340
but it's not too much worse.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.950
And now, he can do
things like cancel out.

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:33.150
He can change the damping.

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:34.233
He can remove the damping.

00:40:34.233 --> 00:40:35.280
He can add more damping.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.343
He can change gravity.

00:40:36.343 --> 00:40:38.010
Its just the feedback
linearization game

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:38.850
we said yesterday.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:39.120
All right.

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:40.703
So we just said we're
going to make it

00:40:40.703 --> 00:40:41.790
an overdamped system here.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:43.538
So there you go.

00:40:43.538 --> 00:40:45.330
Now, overdamped is
actually the hardest one

00:40:45.330 --> 00:40:46.440
I'm going to show
today from the control

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.940
plane of view, because you get
chatter like crazy when you--

00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:52.050
[BUZZING] See?

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.000
Because there's an
encoder that's discreet,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.150
and we're sampling it.

00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.650
OK.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:56.567
So that's an overdamp.

00:40:56.567 --> 00:40:59.710
Now, can you give me a little
bit of a constant torque?

00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:00.210
ZACK: Sure.

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:04.710
PROFESSOR: Like 0.1.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.150
ZACK: Yeah.

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:07.858
PROFESSOR: I changed
it to the gain.

00:41:07.858 --> 00:41:08.400
ZACK: I know.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.940
I'm trying to figure
out where that--

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.648
PROFESSOR: It's--

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:15.100
ZACK: There.

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.750
PROFESSOR: I think it's
probably that torque.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:18.250
Yeah.

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:18.670
ZACK: Yeah.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.060
OK.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:19.935
How much do you want?

00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:21.340
PROFESSOR: 0.1.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.050
ZACK: OK.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:22.717
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:26.070
OK.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.648
So I applied 0.1 of torque.

00:41:27.648 --> 00:41:29.940
Actually, we've got a sign
error compared to my things,

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:31.050
but that's OK.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:31.890
Now, I've got a
fixed point here.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:32.390
Right?

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:34.800
So the same overdamped
pendulum, it's stable here.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.508
There's a little bit
of stiction in here,

00:41:36.508 --> 00:41:37.600
so it's not going exactly.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.100
OK.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.322
The other place we feel
it is right up there.

00:41:40.322 --> 00:41:41.530
That's the other fixed point.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:42.030
Right?

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:44.070
If I put it over here,
then that constant torque

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:46.620
moves me right over
there, just like I said.

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:49.230
OK?

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.950
It's all good.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:54.093
Let's just-- we can play
with it a little bit now.

00:41:54.093 --> 00:41:56.510
So give me maybe twice the
gravity or something like that.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:57.010
ZACK: OK.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:41:57.718
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:41:57.718 --> 00:42:01.046
What's going to happen
if I double gravity?

00:42:01.046 --> 00:42:03.178
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:42:03.178 --> 00:42:04.136
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:42:04.136 --> 00:42:05.090
AUDIENCE: Nothing.

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:06.020
PROFESSOR: Nothing.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:08.923
ZACK: Let me turn this
damping gain back down.

00:42:08.923 --> 00:42:09.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:10.180
Good idea.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.013
OK?

00:42:11.013 --> 00:42:12.680
ZACK: OK, and now we
want twice gravity?

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:22.040
OK.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.260
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:26.510
Changes the natural
frequency, right?

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.010
We're going to see
that in a second.

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:30.200
I didn't actually do all
this secondary stuff yet.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.825
Still got high damping
in there though.

00:42:31.825 --> 00:42:32.950
ZACK: Yeah.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:33.450
Oh.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:33.997
Yeah.

00:42:33.997 --> 00:42:34.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:35.390
ZACK: Take that out.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.660
PROFESSOR: Cool.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.430
So we're going to
play with that again,

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:39.140
when I do the
second-order version here.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.940
But at least I hope
you believe wherever

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:47.662
it went the constant torque
overdamped tells me everything

00:42:47.662 --> 00:42:49.370
I need to know about
the simple pendulum,

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:50.080
so that's kind of cool.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:50.580
OK.

00:42:56.120 --> 00:42:58.550
Let's get rid of this
overdamped constraint which

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.790
is the only reason
it was first order,

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:05.680
and let's get to the
second-order case.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.000
OK?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.300
But before we do
the whole dynamics,

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.463
we'll make another
quick assumption.

00:43:15.463 --> 00:43:16.880
Let's do a different
special case.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.213
I could have left that, I guess.

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:42.500
Let's do an undamped pendulum,
and we'll start with 0 torque.

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:47.740
OK.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:52.510
So b equals 0, and u0 equals 0.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:55.030
OK?

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.530
All right.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:57.550
So what do those
equations look like?

00:43:57.550 --> 00:44:08.380
Now, I've just got I theta
double dot is negative mgl sine

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:08.880
theta.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.380
Right?

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:13.090
OK.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:15.630
So how am I going to
graphically investigate

00:44:15.630 --> 00:44:18.900
this second-order system?

00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:21.510
Well now, there's two things I
care about evolving over time.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:22.110
Right?

00:44:22.110 --> 00:44:25.840
I need to know what
theta does over time,

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.020
but I also need to know what
theta dot does over time.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:29.520
OK?

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.980
So I'm going to need a
two-dimensional plot,

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.120
and this is the phase plot.

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:45.200
OK?

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.420
So let's make a phase plot.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:51.980
OK.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:59.510
So a phase plot, what
I'm going to plot

00:44:59.510 --> 00:45:08.090
is theta versus theta dot, and
what I'm going to plot is not--

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:10.100
my separatrix doesn't
want to go away.

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:17.080
What I'm going to plot on
this, it's a vector plot.

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.090
OK?

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:22.900
I'm going to plot I have
two equations floating.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.400
Right?

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:28.780
This is the second-order system
is equivalent to two equations.

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:36.270
One is theta dot, looks a
little silly to write this,

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:39.180
but you can think of
a second-order system

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:45.070
as coupled first-order
systems of two variables here,

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:48.180
and this is mgl sine theta.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.430
OK?

00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:56.170
So what I'm going to
plot here is a vector

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.055
which is theta dot
versus theta double dot

00:45:59.055 --> 00:46:03.780
as a function of
theta and theta dot.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.800
I see angry looks.

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.690
Right?

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:14.370
I can write this as,
if I want to think

00:46:14.370 --> 00:46:17.220
of this as a
first-order system, I'm

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.480
going to say that x
is theta, theta dot.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.460
Right?

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:25.185
And now, I can write x
dot is some function of x,

00:46:25.185 --> 00:46:27.900
a first-order equation
which describes

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.160
this second-order system.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:30.660
OK?

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:34.890
It's a vector equation, and what
I want to plot is, for all x,

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:36.655
I want to plot x dot.

00:46:36.655 --> 00:46:43.050
x is 2 by 1, and it happens to
be theta dot, theta double dot.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.760
And it's a function
of a 2 by 1, so I'm

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.050
going to make a vector plot on
this two-dimensional system.

00:46:49.050 --> 00:46:50.220
OK?

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:55.720
Maybe as I start drawing things,
it'll become crystal clear.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.870
OK.

00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:09.178
So given this equation here
for the undamped pendulum,

00:47:09.178 --> 00:47:10.470
let's plot some of the vectors.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.970
OK?

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:15.990
So it turns out that
it's simple to think

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.800
about it along the line
of theta dot equals 0.

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:21.880
Let's think about that.

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:27.030
I have a vector who's y
component is going to be 0,

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:29.130
and its x component--

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:30.690
sorry.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:32.160
This component is going to be 0.

00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.535
I should call it
the x component,

00:47:33.535 --> 00:47:37.560
and its y component is going
to be negative mgl sine theta.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.430
OK?

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.580
So at 0, I've got nothing.

00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.220
Here, I've got a little
vector going down.

00:47:44.220 --> 00:47:45.735
Its y component is this.

00:47:49.112 --> 00:47:53.480
It gets back to another 0.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.210
So if I plot this vector field
along that line, I get this.

00:48:03.390 --> 00:48:05.200
Right?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.210
OK?

00:48:06.210 --> 00:48:08.280
If I plot it up at some
positive-- or let's

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.420
even plot it now
along the other line.

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:13.290
So if theta is 0,
then I get a thing

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:16.050
that's only got an x component.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:20.280
This term is 0, and it's
actually a linear thing,

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.800
so it just looks like this.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:33.990
You with me on that?

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.330
OK?

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.940
And if I plot something in
between some positive x,

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:43.340
some positive theta,
positive theta dot,

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:45.360
then I'm going to get a
combination of these two

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:45.860
things.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.360
I'm going to get a
vector like this.

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.420
Right?

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:00.990
If you plot that
through, or if you

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:03.840
hand it to Matlab to plot
it through, for instance,

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:08.400
then you can again graphically
quickly interrogate

00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:11.400
the nonlinear dynamics
of the system.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:12.570
OK?

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:15.870
So in this phase
plot, if I start

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:21.300
with some positive
velocity and 0 angle,

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:25.080
then I'm going to
get some angle.

00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.040
Right?

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:31.560
I'm going to go around until I
get to the theta dot equals 0.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.985
I go around.

00:49:33.985 --> 00:49:36.360
That could have been more
circular, but you get the idea.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.950
OK.

00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:42.660
It turns out in
here, things really

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:45.150
do look like circles
around the origin,

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:47.670
and they should be cocentric.

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:53.220
Out here, the nonlinearity
shows up a little bit more.

00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:54.960
You get these eyeball
looking things.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:49:59.330
OK?

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:03.630
All right.

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:04.547
So what does that say?

00:50:04.547 --> 00:50:06.350
So if I start my
pendulum-- is it--

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:07.290
ZACK: It's ready.

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:08.870
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:13.820
If I start my pendulum with
0 position and some velocity,

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.190
is it 0 damping
[INAUDIBLE] good man.

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.760
OK.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.420
Then, what's it going to do?

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:20.900
It's going to start
oscillating forever.

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:21.620
Right?

00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.290
As close as we can to canceling
out damping by measuring it

00:50:24.290 --> 00:50:25.620
and subtracting it.

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:26.267
OK?

00:50:26.267 --> 00:50:27.350
So it's just going around.

00:50:27.350 --> 00:50:30.110
It's got some positive
theta, negative theta dot,

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:33.350
positive theta dot,
negative theta dot,

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:34.550
and it was pretty close.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.680
I'll give you a better
chance by going like that.

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:37.180
OK?

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:46.298
And I can really test our
model by starting it up here.

00:50:46.298 --> 00:50:47.090
That's pretty good.

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:48.230
Right?

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:52.700
So if I start way up here, it's
going to take these orbits.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:53.420
OK?

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:57.890
And it turns out, if I were to
wrap the pendulum around once--

00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:59.960
again, now I'm testing
the encoder counts.

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:00.680
ZACK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.263
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:51:01.263 --> 00:51:03.530
Well then, I would do
the same thing but over

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.820
by that other fixed point.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:06.110
Right?

00:51:06.110 --> 00:51:09.860
So this whole pattern
repeats over here.

00:51:09.860 --> 00:51:12.188
Right?

00:51:12.188 --> 00:51:13.670
ZACK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:14.544
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:51:14.544 --> 00:51:16.400
ZACK: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.670
PROFESSOR: Oh, great.

00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:21.410
We should plug that
in which is going

00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:24.440
to be mechanically impossible.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.220
OK.

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:28.654
ZACK: There we go.

00:51:30.937 --> 00:51:33.270
PROFESSOR: You can sort of
see there's an eyeball there.

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:34.070
Right?

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:35.930
This is the real data
from the encoders.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:36.680
OK?

00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:40.085
So I moved it around there,
and then I jerked it over here.

00:51:40.085 --> 00:51:43.130
I got an orbit there,
moved it over here,

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:45.090
and got that nonlinear orbit.

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:45.590
OK?

00:51:48.770 --> 00:51:51.720
That's the exact same phase
plot that we just did.

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:52.220
OK.

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:57.620
So now, where are the
fixed points of the system?

00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:01.930
On a phase plot, two variables,
where can the fixed points even

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:02.680
be?

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.055
Can I have a fixed
point up here?

00:52:08.730 --> 00:52:11.842
If I have a velocity, I
don't have a fixed point.

00:52:11.842 --> 00:52:13.300
So right away, you
know you're only

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:17.500
going to be looking for fixed
points on the x-axis here.

00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:18.000
Right?

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:26.810
And again, on the x-axis,
it just reduced to the sine.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.910
So I've got a fixed point here.

00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:30.860
I've got a fixed point at pi.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.790
I've got a fixed point at 2 pi.

00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:37.110
Right?

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:37.730
OK.

00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:38.420
Are they stable?

00:52:41.850 --> 00:52:42.750
Is this one stable?

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:48.750
You should ask, what do I mean?

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:49.440
One more sense.

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.730
Good.

00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:52.460
Is it asymptotically stable?

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:53.340
AUDIENCE: No.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.115
PROFESSOR: No.

00:52:54.115 --> 00:52:55.142
Right?

00:52:55.142 --> 00:52:57.600
If I start it here, it's just
going to go around and around

00:52:57.600 --> 00:52:58.602
and around forever.

00:52:58.602 --> 00:53:00.060
It's not going to
get to the point.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:02.160
Is it stable in the
sense of Lyapunov?

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.030
Yes.

00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:04.080
Good.

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.850
And this one is
not stable at all.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.260
Right?

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:09.000
OK.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:09.500
Cool.

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:19.730
All right.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.770
Let's add a little damping in.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:24.050
What happens if I add my
damping back in but leave

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.168
my torque off?

00:53:26.168 --> 00:53:26.960
What do I get then?

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.150
I want to ask you
one more question.

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:41.400
So this thing is a trajectory.

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.710
I didn't tell you
carefully what--

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.790
this is a closed orbit.

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:46.650
Right?

00:53:46.650 --> 00:53:48.966
Is that closed orbit stable?

00:53:48.966 --> 00:53:51.460
AUDIENCE: What do you mean?

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:53.000
PROFESSOR: That's
a fair question.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.040
What do I mean?

00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:59.170
So we have to define orbital
stability, and we will.

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:01.730
But just intuitively,
what do you feel about--

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.660
do you think that trajectories
that are near that

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.980
are going to get to that?

00:54:06.980 --> 00:54:07.600
No, right?

00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.510
This is the same sort of
marginal stability case

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:12.180
that you see here.

00:54:12.180 --> 00:54:14.230
So if there was a
sense of Lyapunov sort

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:18.672
of definition for the orbit,
then we might say that.

00:54:18.672 --> 00:54:21.130
It's not a limit cycle stability
we're going to talk about,

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:23.880
where it's not going to
converge to that trajectory.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.430
OK?

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:27.460
If I'm on this orbit, and
I give it a little push,

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:29.650
then it'll start moving
in this different orbit.

00:54:29.650 --> 00:54:32.090
OK?

00:54:32.090 --> 00:54:32.750
OK.

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:35.390
Now, what happens if
I do the damping case?

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.440
So my equations are--

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:44.570
I think it's just
unsatisfying to see that.

00:54:44.570 --> 00:54:50.900
Let me just write x dot is still
going to be theta dot out here,

00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:54.350
but now it's going
to be negative b

00:54:54.350 --> 00:54:56.300
theta dot minus mgl sine theta.

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:56.800
Right?

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:09.260
It turns out, if I make that
same plot, at the origin

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.130
all is well.

00:55:10.130 --> 00:55:11.000
It's the same thing.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.020
Right?

00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:15.620
I still get my sine wave
dynamics at the origin.

00:55:28.620 --> 00:55:29.900
OK, but what happens up here?

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:36.320
Now, this is still theta
versus theta dot phase plot,

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:44.060
but now when I have 0 theta,
I have the same x component,

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:49.520
theta dot, but now I have
some negative y component.

00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.050
Yeah?

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:53.930
So I'm going to get a
vector that looks like this,

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:56.610
and these things
go down like that.

00:56:01.620 --> 00:56:02.120
OK?

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:10.290
And in general, it looks
something like this,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:13.540
and what are my trajectories
going to look like?

00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:14.390
AUDIENCE: Spirals.

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:16.212
PROFESSOR: Spirals, good.

00:56:16.212 --> 00:56:16.712
Right?

00:56:33.312 --> 00:56:34.520
You might want to restart it.

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.260
I might have moved it too quick.

00:56:36.260 --> 00:56:38.020
It's got to grab the encoder 0.

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:38.520
ZACK: OK.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:39.103
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:44.205
That's no damping still, right?

00:56:44.205 --> 00:56:44.550
ZACK: Yep.

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:45.735
PROFESSOR: Let's put
some damping in there.

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:46.080
ZACK: No, wait.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:47.130
That's with normal damping.

00:56:47.130 --> 00:56:47.820
PROFESSOR: Normal damping.

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:49.362
ZACK: Yeah, not
doing anything to it.

00:56:49.362 --> 00:56:52.380
PROFESSOR: OK, so this
is normal damping,

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:55.523
just the damping from the motor,
the friction and the gearbox

00:56:55.523 --> 00:56:56.190
mostly probably.

00:56:58.860 --> 00:56:59.400
OK.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.460
Let's see a phase plot.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:00.960
ZACK: OK.

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.890
Let me get the data off it.

00:57:01.890 --> 00:57:02.515
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.210
ZACK: There we go.

00:57:27.670 --> 00:57:28.320
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.130
So you'll see a few
blips in the plot.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:34.900
That's when the encoders
are slipping away,

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.493
but you can see a pretty
spirally trajectory.

00:57:38.493 --> 00:57:40.410
I think if we triple the
damping or something,

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:41.280
it'll look more compelling.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:41.730
ZACK: Yeah.

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:41.985
PROFESSOR: Let's try that.

00:57:41.985 --> 00:57:42.240
Yeah?

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:42.740
ZACK: OK.

00:57:46.177 --> 00:57:46.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.640
So while he's
setting that up, what

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.370
happens to the fixed
point over here?

00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:58.430
It's going to have some
sort of dynamics over here.

00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.980
OK?

00:57:58.980 --> 00:57:59.480
Right?

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:03.310
It's going to have spiral
dynamics down here,

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:11.170
but what happens if I start
with a really large velocity

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:16.820
or a really large negative
velocity, let's say, and 0.

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:18.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:19.360
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:20.470
Right?

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:26.860
So this is my
unstable equilibrium.

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:29.800
If I'm coming down,
and I don't make it

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.530
to that unstable
equilibrium, then it

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:35.290
will actually tip back
up, and I'll go in

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.370
and spiral to this fixed point.

00:58:37.370 --> 00:58:37.870
Right?

00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:42.500
So let's see how--

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:44.090
ZACK: You going to
give that a try?

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:45.840
Let's do just the normal--

00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:46.340
ZACK: OK.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:46.930
It's ready to go.

00:58:46.930 --> 00:58:47.513
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:50.740
OK.

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.540
That was the benign case.

00:58:52.540 --> 00:58:56.124
We'll try the high energy
case in just a second here.

00:58:56.124 --> 00:58:59.290
ZACK: Let me get that
data [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:01.885
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:02.819
ZACK: There we go.

00:59:06.427 --> 00:59:07.010
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:10.508
Minus the little blips, you can
see that's the spiral going in.

00:59:10.508 --> 00:59:11.550
Now, let's see if I can--

00:59:11.550 --> 00:59:12.842
ZACK: Let me restart the--

00:59:12.842 --> 00:59:13.550
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:16.190
Let me leave it.

00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:17.000
ZACK: OK.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.770
PROFESSOR: OK?

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:19.270
Yep.

00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:31.422
So it looks like it hit the
brakes here and came back down.

00:59:31.422 --> 00:59:33.880
You might think it's like a
discontinuity in the trajectory

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.397
or something, but
hopefully, it'll

00:59:35.397 --> 00:59:37.480
look exactly like what I
pictured up on the board.

00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:44.470
Yep, again, minus the
encoders slipping,

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.420
and this is me lifting it.

00:59:46.420 --> 00:59:48.760
It goes around and
finds, stabilizes

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.590
into that fixed point.

00:59:50.590 --> 00:59:51.090
OK?

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:55.300
All right.

00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:01.150
So finally now, for
those of you that

01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:03.370
are quite familiar
with dynamics,

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:04.660
thank you for listening.

01:00:04.660 --> 01:00:07.380
Let's think about
controlling this system.

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.412
OK?

01:00:08.412 --> 01:00:10.120
What does it mean to
control this system?

01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:18.090
Let's say, I put in u again.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.410
Forget about constant u.

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:20.610
We're past that now.

01:00:20.610 --> 01:00:22.230
Let's say, in
general, I can make

01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:27.260
u be a function of the
theta and theta dot.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.860
Right?

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.450
And my equations now
are going to have

01:00:34.450 --> 01:00:42.160
this plus u which could in
general be a function of theta

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.106
and theta dot.

01:00:43.106 --> 01:00:43.606
OK?

01:00:46.193 --> 01:00:47.860
What is it going to
do to my phase plot?

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:57.950
Doesn't change this
component, right?

01:00:57.950 --> 01:01:00.475
Which means things are basically
still going to go around.

01:01:00.475 --> 01:01:01.850
Things always go
around this way.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:04.590
That's how it works.

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.020
OK?

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:11.450
But what I can do is I can
move this guy up or down.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.160
Right?

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.380
That's all I can do.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.560
Now, in a lot of cases, that's
everything I'd want to do,

01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:20.900
so maybe we should.

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.390
You want to do the
feedback linearization

01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:24.480
of gravity example?

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:24.980
ZACK: Yeah.

01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:25.370
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:26.662
ZACK: Give me a couple seconds.

01:01:26.662 --> 01:01:28.010
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:28.880
Right?

01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:30.470
So it turns out,
that's enough, if you

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:32.060
think about what
this plot looks like,

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.450
even if I have a damped thing.

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.840
So for instance, if I do
my feedback linearization,

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.730
and I make this function.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:41.420
Let me be a little bit more
careful, I'll call this pi.

01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:44.450
I'll say u is pi of
theta, theta dot.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:48.480
That's the notation we
use most of the time here.

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:53.435
Let's say, I just
made it b theta dot.

01:01:53.435 --> 01:01:56.630
That cancels out this
component the thing,

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.610
flattens it out, and gets
me back to that plot.

01:01:58.610 --> 01:02:01.540
That's actually exactly how we
did the 0 damping case there.

01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:02.040
Right?

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.970
We just canceled out the
damping to make that plot,

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:06.830
because the real
thing has damping.

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:07.580
OK?

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.010
And if we do the
feedback linearization,

01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:15.950
we can actually do
plus 2mgl sine theta.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:17.711
Right?

01:02:17.711 --> 01:02:24.140
If I make the controller look
like that then, lo and behold,

01:02:24.140 --> 01:02:26.800
the system's now an
upside-down pendulum.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.300
Right?

01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.120
Same thing I showed
you last time.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.117
This time it's on
a piece of metal,

01:02:31.117 --> 01:02:32.200
so that's more impressive.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.500
Right?

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.000
OK?

01:02:38.790 --> 01:02:39.290
OK.

01:02:39.290 --> 01:02:46.980
So here's the name
of the game, and I

01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:50.400
want you to think
about this between now

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.472
and next week, let's say.

01:02:53.472 --> 01:02:57.900
Let's say, I want to
put a fixed point.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:00.682
You can only put fixed
points along here.

01:03:00.682 --> 01:03:02.640
Let's say, I want to
stabilize, turn the system

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.610
into a system that's
stable at this fixed point,

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:06.540
unstable here.

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:10.050
I want all trajectories
to end here,

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:14.520
and I want to do it by making
minimal changes to that vector,

01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.610
by adding minimal torque.

01:03:17.610 --> 01:03:18.150
OK?

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:22.770
So you get this geometric phase
plot view of the world now.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:24.900
What would you do
to those vectors

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:29.400
to try to get all
trajectories to get there

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:31.140
with minimal torque?

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.020
Or another nice
version of the problem

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.050
is let's say I have
a bounded torque.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.202
Let's say, I don't care
about being minimal,

01:03:39.202 --> 01:03:41.160
but let's say I just have
a motor that can only

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.410
put out so many newton meters.

01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:45.240
Right?

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.310
Let's say, that means
there's a limit to how much

01:03:47.310 --> 01:03:48.900
I can move those vectors.

01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:49.830
OK?

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.620
How do I shape those
vectors in order

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:56.730
to guide all system
trajectories where I want to go?

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.020
OK?

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.910
It's when those
constraints start

01:03:59.910 --> 01:04:03.510
coming into play that you can't
just change these vectors to be

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:04.440
whatever you want.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.690
You have to think about
pushing them and pulling them.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:07.830
Right?

01:04:07.830 --> 01:04:11.700
And that's the
under-actuated robotics case,

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:15.000
where you're thinking about
moving your dynamics around

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.860
instead of squashing them.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:20.010
OK?

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:22.350
And for the computer
scientists out there,

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.630
I'd actually love to see
what you come up with.

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:29.520
Think about-- write
a program that

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.240
could try to in some minimal
way stabilize that fixed point

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:35.500
on the vector field.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.125
I think there's a
lot of ways to do it.

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:40.260
It'd be interesting to
see what you come up with.

01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:40.773
OK?

01:04:40.773 --> 01:04:41.940
That's the name of the game.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.490
Turns out, there's the right
way to formulate those problems,

01:04:50.490 --> 01:04:55.170
I think, is we're going to
talk about optimal control

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:55.680
next week.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:11.740
The most straightforward answer
I have for the computer science

01:05:11.740 --> 01:05:17.050
world is that, if I can describe
some function on my vector

01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:20.290
field that I want to minimize,
some cost function, I'll

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:22.390
call it g of x.

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:28.660
Possibly it depends, I want
to penalize actions too,

01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:37.180
some cost function,
and let's say,

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:44.050
I care about the long-term
cost over some trajectory.

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:49.555
We're going to call this
thing J, where this is x of t,

01:05:49.555 --> 01:05:50.320
u of t.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:56.740
If you can define a
cost function that

01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.890
describes the thing I
just said in this form,

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.430
then that's going to turn
everything from this fuzzy

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:07.240
dynamics problem into a
strict computational problem,

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:11.990
and we can use all our favorite
optimization tools to solve it.

01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.490
OK?

01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.020
We're going to hammer that
out big time next week.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:23.990
Good.

01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:25.580
I think you know
most of what there

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.830
is to know about the pendulum.

01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:30.410
Anybody have any questions?

01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:31.900
You know fixed points.

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:34.060
You know stability in
the sense of Lyapunov,

01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:36.880
asymptotic stability,
exponential stability, basins

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:40.810
of attraction, separatrix.

01:06:40.810 --> 01:06:41.710
What else?

01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:44.580
Closed orbits,
you've got it all.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.080
OK?

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:49.870
That's mostly it.

01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:52.510
Let me just say a couple of
the administrative details

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.910
that I didn't get to last time.

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:58.360
Your first problem
set is posted tonight.

01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.560
It's going to be due--

01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:01.840
problem sets will be due
basically every other week,

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.490
on Tuesdays.

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:05.912
It happens that the
first Tuesday that it's

01:07:05.912 --> 01:07:07.870
going to be due is one
of those weird Tuesdays,

01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:10.520
but just to keep the
clock on schedule,

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.300
we're going to ask for an online
submission on that Tuesday.

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:16.510
They'll be every two weeks.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:18.760
There's six of them
throughout the term.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.730
We do have a midterm
in the class.

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.550
It's just before
spring break, I think,

01:07:24.550 --> 01:07:27.610
and so you can
enjoy spring break.

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.950
We don't have a final
exam in the class.

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:33.130
We're going to do
final projects instead.

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:36.190
So I'd like you to
start thinking soon

01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:41.380
about final projects,
and feel free to ask me.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.530
Homeworks, you're fine
to work on as a group.

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:46.840
I don't care, whatever it
takes to learn the material.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.900
Everybody should turn in
their own problem set.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:50.770
The midterm, you'll
work by yourself.

01:07:50.770 --> 01:07:54.040
The final project, you
can team up with somebody,

01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.370
as long as the contributions
are clear from each person,

01:07:57.370 --> 01:08:00.622
and that's totally fine with me.

01:08:00.622 --> 01:08:02.330
Throughout the class,
as you might guess,

01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:07.630
we're going to have Matlab
simulations and physical robots

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:10.745
trying to show the
basic phenomenon.

01:08:10.745 --> 01:08:12.370
Many of those will
be available for you

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:15.580
for your final projects,
if you so choose.

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.770
Maybe I'll ask you to
show me that something's

01:08:17.770 --> 01:08:19.510
stable on a simulation,
before we put it

01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:22.359
on the robot or something like
that, but it should be fun.

01:08:22.359 --> 01:08:26.710
I think it's such a young
field that we can definitely

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:29.750
do publication quality
final projects.

01:08:29.750 --> 01:08:31.990
So those of you that
are in robotics,

01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:34.390
think about writing
an [INAUDIBLE] paper

01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:37.359
for the final project.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:38.109
I think that's it.

01:08:38.109 --> 01:08:41.950
I think we've got a, yeah,
the PDFs from the lecture one

01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:44.950
were online sometime yesterday.

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:47.380
Today's will be
online immediately,

01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:51.310
and let me know what you think
about this [INAUDIBLE] thing.

01:08:51.310 --> 01:08:55.720
I saw one comment last night,
anonymous, but that's good,

01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:59.369
and I'll see you next week.

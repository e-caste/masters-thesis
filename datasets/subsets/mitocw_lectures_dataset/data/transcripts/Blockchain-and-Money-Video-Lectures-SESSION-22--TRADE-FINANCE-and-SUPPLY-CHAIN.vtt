00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.350
GARY GENSLER: Today we get to
explore one of the use cases

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.270
where there's actually a lot of
activity going on in blockchain

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.210
technology, trade finance.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.390
We also have, I
think, at least two

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.030
of the groups for final
projects are doing things

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.560
on trade finance.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.580
There might be some that
haven't disclosed that to me

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.260
or after today
might shift to it.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.450
You never know.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.700
And I think 8 or 10
of you actually wrote

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.110
your individual pieces today.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.020
So it's 15 or 20 of you
that have been spending

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.210
a lot of time on trade finance.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.650
And I think the reason is that
there's a lot of application

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.520
of the underlying technology.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.730
And that's what I'm going
to try to do today and then

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.730
hopefully get the help
from the two groups

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:22.180
that have some final projects
in this regard and so many

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.840
of you that wrote on this today.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.720
I'm going to go through
readings and study

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.660
guide, what is trade finance.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:32.920
So we're going to run through.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.462
I'm going to give you a little
sense of what trade finance is

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.300
from my perspective.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.410
And then we're going to
just go into the blockchain

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.300
projects themselves.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.900
So we'll skip through
these because we're

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.940
going to be chatting
about what attributes

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.800
that trade finance really has.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.070
Well, Alpha you have a group.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.830
What attributes
is trade finance?

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.520
What attracted you to this?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.350
AUDIENCE: Multiple
stakeholders that

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.125
are changing, transferring
data and information.

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:04.750
GARY GENSLER: So two
things that I just

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.160
heard multiple stakeholders
transferring a lot of data.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.580
Anybody else, what other
attributes are there?

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.080
AUDIENCE: There's
a lot of paperwork

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.500
that is being transferred
between the importer, exporter,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.348
and the banks, issuing
banks and beneficiary banks.

00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:20.890
GARY GENSLER: So
not only is it data,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.320
but it's still actually
a lot of paperwork.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.820
And actually often times
actual physical paperwork.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.060
There are still
companies, I mean,

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.800
they're not as persistent now
as they were years ago called

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.880
document couriers
that literally brought

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.783
the documents around the globe.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:40.450
AUDIENCE: You have
different regulations

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.790
in different countries.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.360
It's hard to see and trust
one central authority

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.070
that it's going to give you all
you need done on the charge.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.110
GARY GENSLER: So a lot of
different regulatory regimes.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.500
But also different countries.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.470
So you have some
information asymmetries.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.580
And thus those issues of trust
across those jurisdictions.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.460
AUDIENCE: Along the lines
of the issues of trust,

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.945
there's also a lot of
fraud with it as well,

00:03:09.945 --> 00:03:13.500
a lot of double spend
and financing issues that

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.770
come with this space.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.090
GARY GENSLER: So a lot of
fraud and double spend.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.805
Or in trade finance, it
has another term, actually.

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:24.012
Anybody?

00:03:24.012 --> 00:03:27.510
It's double financing.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.030
But it's basically the
same conceptual framework

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.520
as a double spend.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.420
Can I finance one set of
goods, one cargo being

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.540
shipped across the Atlantic or
Pacific, can I fund it twice?

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.857
And so that's a
bit of the fraud.

00:03:45.857 --> 00:03:47.690
AUDIENCE: And also
because of the high cost,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.570
and also all the due diligence,
like small and medium

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.380
enterprises have a very
hard time getting it,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.130
like because of the
financial crisis

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.995
and also all the
terrorist attacks.

00:03:56.995 --> 00:03:59.120
GARY GENSLER: So do you
think that small and medium

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.023
sized enterprises have a
difficulty for the reasons you

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:04.190
just said, because of
terrorist attacks and so forth

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.100
or is there something more
broadly that's going on,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.520
maybe even for centuries?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.660
New hand here.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.450
AUDIENCE: I know it's more of
a problem like small financing

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.958
that they don't have access to
the find the things they need

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.750
that are required,
their business requires,

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:21.872
the essential things.

00:04:21.872 --> 00:04:24.080
GARY GENSLER: And I can't
tell whether it's a hand up

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.934
or you were fixing your hair.

00:04:25.934 --> 00:04:26.762
AUDIENCE: Um, both.

00:04:26.762 --> 00:04:28.730
GARY GENSLER: Both, OK.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.190
AUDIENCE: So I guess
I was going to say,

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.160
so small businesses often
don't have the resources

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.850
administratively to
deal with paperwork.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.670
So often the operational burden
becomes so costly for them,

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.680
that it is no longer actually
profitable for them to trade.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.200
GARY GENSLER: And also small
businesses-- you want to add?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.260
AUDIENCE: They just don't
have a credit history.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.290
So banks tend to not
want to finance them.

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.217
They just don't trust them.

00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:57.050
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.670
AUDIENCE: I just want to
put some numbers to make

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.587
it clear to everybody.

00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:03.290
I was looking at a study for
the Asian Development Bank

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.770
saying that small and
medium sized enterprises are

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.210
the most credit constrained.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.760
Around 50% of their
demands are being

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.560
rejected by banks for
trade finance, whereas 7%

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.690
to multinational corporations.

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.600
GARY GENSLER: So
this small and medium

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.150
sized enterprises
also are smaller.

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:24.980
They're not as well known.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.220
And trade finance, just by
definition, is cross border.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.880
It's cross jurisdiction,
cross country.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.530
How does somebody in the US
know a small business in Kenya?

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:39.620
Or pick your countries--

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.780
China and Mexico.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.425
So there is a lot of
information challenges.

00:05:46.425 --> 00:05:48.800
That's been the history of
this business for a long time.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.410
We'll hold off on
the ongoing projects.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.100
But we'll come back to that.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.130
So we had a bunch of readings.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:03.830
I updated this because
it's ever changing.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.020
And I hope that if
you had a chance

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.730
to dig in to the Bain review.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.860
I thought as these writings
go, it was probably

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.110
a little better than some of--

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.860
I'm sorry for any of you
going into consultancy, Tom.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.130
But as these things go, I
thought it was better than some

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.770
of the Deloitte
papers and PwC papers

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.110
that are still quite helpful.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.370
But I thought this was a
little bit more detailed.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.160
So what is the background,
the economic background?

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.350
This is just from--

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:39.020
I think I pulled this from
some World Bank figures.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.600
Worldwide exports of
goods are $17 trillion.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.880
Services are 5 or 6 trillion.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.610
But trade finance is
really around the exporting

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.130
of goods more than services.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.840
I'm not really familiar with
it in the service context.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.380
And manufacturer's $12 trillion.

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:06.710
Fuels, agriculture,
you can see that.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:11.090
So that's basically
the body of it.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.240
And the financing,
international finance--

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.730
and I purposely use words.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.400
This is the financing
of international trade.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.590
It can come in two
different ways.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.700
One is if the bank is
guaranteeing something

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.970
or the bank is supporting
it through the documents.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.710
This is the traditional
definition of trade finance.

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.820
It is letters of credits
and documentary collection.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.570
Anybody want to tell
me what a letter of--

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.212
what the difference
of two things are?

00:07:41.212 --> 00:07:42.920
Since we've got a
whole bunch of people--

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.550
I see a hand up.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:47.970
AUDIENCE: A letter of
credit is a formal letter

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:52.020
from a bank just laying out
the terms of credit extended

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.540
to let's say the next year.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.910
GARY GENSLER: OK, so it's
a formal letter laying out

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.020
the terms.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.130
But critically,
what is it doing?

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.750
AUDIENCE: Removes
counterparty risk.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.910
Removes the counterparty
risk away from your buyer

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:06.423
to the bank.

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:08.340
GARY GENSLER: So it
removes counterparty risk.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.230
It's guaranteeing payment.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:13.420
But there is a second
form that banks

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.625
support this market
in a very big way

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.670
is documentary collection.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.640
Anybody familiar with DCs?

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.760
It's basically the
banks are moving

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.880
the paperwork, this incredible
paperwork around the globe.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.550
And we'll dive into
this a little bit.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.450
And they're not-- they're
not taking counterparty risk.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.929
The banks themselves are
not guaranteeing the credit.

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.840
But they are performing
enormous services

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:44.820
in terms of the paperwork.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:50.210
And in essence, it's documents
versus performance or documents

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.530
versus authentication
that goes in.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.820
A bunch of different ways.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:59.030
Factoring and
forfaiting, not that this

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.190
is a quiz on these terms.

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.810
But these are different terms.

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.410
Factoring is when
you sell receivables,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.300
short-term receivables.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.970
Forfaiting is when
they're longer term.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:13.670
So they're kind of a
little bit the same thing.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.740
But one is short-term
receivables,

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.390
short-term letters of credit.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.580
One are longer term.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.920
You can actually take
import and export loans

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:27.470
out which are longer term.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.720
And they're about a whole
inventory and a whole supply

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.750
chain.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.800
You can get financing
beforehand, supplier credit,

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.590
and a new form aboard called
supply chain financing

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.770
where you're really funding
the whole supply chain.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:43.250
But we're going to focus
primarily on the first two.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.430
And most of the blockchain
projects in this space

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.970
are focusing on the first two.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.420
But international trade
also has trade credit.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.800
What's open account?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.300
What does that mean
in any business

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.714
when we're here at
Sloan, somebody?

00:10:04.612 --> 00:10:06.070
Alean I'm not going
to call on you.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.153
I'm not going to make you.

00:10:07.153 --> 00:10:08.010
Jake.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.480
AUDIENCE: Trade is that when
you ship the goods like prior

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.550
to payment being due.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.268
GARY GENSLER: So?

00:10:12.268 --> 00:10:14.560
AUDIENCE: So you ship goods
prior to payment being due.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.140
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:16.640
AUDIENCE: The payment is
due like 90 days later.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.400
GARY GENSLER: So it's
due 90 days later.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.620
Open account is what
most businesses do.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.440
If you just say I'm shipping
something, send an invoice.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.540
And the terms might be 2 and 30.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.190
You get a 2% discount if you pay
prompt, but 30 days, just open

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.690
account.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.650
In domestic business that's
how most services are provided

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.660
and goods are shipped
is open account.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:44.720
It's the international
export business

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.890
that you find it different.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.430
Then cash in advance, of
course, is what it sounds like.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.590
And consignment is
all the other way.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.300
An exporter would actually ship.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.190
You'd put it on your shelves.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:59.350
You wouldn't have to pay.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:02.800
And the exporter continues
to have the risk of the sale.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.650
Not used a lot in
international trade.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:12.860
You can also get public
guarantees or insurance.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:19.910
So that's the whole world of
these $17 trillion of trade.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:22.040
Only about 5 or 6
trillion is thought

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.110
to be actually using
trade credit, letters

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:32.300
of credit and
documentary commitments,

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.500
these two main things.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.040
So this ranges it.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.650
This gives you a
little bit of a flavor.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.510
And this you can think of
is what's the most secure

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.730
for the exporter is over here.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.240
The exporter is going to
have the most security

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.910
if they get cash in advance.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:57.490
But does an importer like that?

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:58.030
Not really.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.490
An importer really
would rather have

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:05.380
consignment, having risk all
the way on the other side.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.960
Consignment would say the
exporter takes all the risk.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.630
So it's all about
commercial terms.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.440
But you can think of it
as the other side of this

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:20.200
is the least attractive
for the importer is paying

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.850
cash in advance.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.010
The most attractive to the
exporter is cash in advance.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:28.680
And every one of these
happens somewhere.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.790
In a $17 trillion market,
$17 trillion of exports,

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:38.190
all of this is open
for negotiation.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.425
But think of the exporter
likes this curve.

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:46.070
And the importer likes this.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:53.620
And as I will show in a
second, most of the market

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.250
is in the middle.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:56.995
So now trade finance.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:04.207
Exporters, importers, advising
banks, and issuing banks.

00:13:04.207 --> 00:13:06.290
And what you're going to
quickly sort of sense is,

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:08.690
there's a lot of room maybe
for blockchain technology

00:13:08.690 --> 00:13:12.530
because there's a
lot of moving parts.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.910
By the way, normally if
you work at Wall Street

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:18.740
or at a commercial
bank, you might never

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.360
touch trade finance.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:23.780
It's just like a department that
if you're on a trading floor,

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.400
you're not really
thinking about a lot.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.500
Who's worked on a
trading floor here?

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.240
Did you ever think
about trade finance?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.660
No.

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.640
But it's a big market.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.130
It's a very big market.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:42.990
But basically, the exporter and
importer sign a contract that's

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.878
for the sale of goods.

00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:45.545
It could be oil.

00:13:45.545 --> 00:13:48.360
It could be agriculture
product or manufacturers.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.870
The importer then arranges
with an issuing bank

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:53.790
a letter of credit.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.950
The letter of credit is
sent to the exporter's bank.

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:03.630
Sometimes the exporter's bank
puts a second guarantee on it.

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:07.290
The exporter's bank might
be actually guaranteeing

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:11.410
the importer's bank performance.

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.830
So there's hundreds of
different arrangements.

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:18.190
But the classic thing is
that the importer gets

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.190
a letter of credit to say,
look, you don't know me,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:28.000
but you can take the risk and
I get this letter of credit.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.200
You exporter will get your money
based upon some documents, when

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.660
you put some documents
together and send them to me

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.640
that you've actually put your
oil or agricultural products

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.900
on a ship.

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.950
So shipping is a big part of it.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.750
The second piece of this is, how
did the documents actually go?

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.410
The exporter then
ships something.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.620
The shipment usually
leads to some documents.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:56.120
And at the time of
the shipping, you

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.380
see number six in this
little box over here

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.570
is, the exporter, when
they ship something,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.570
also sends some
documents to their bank.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:10.530
Their bank sends it overseas
to the bank in Kenya,

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:17.670
let's say, even though that
doesn't have any ports.

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.617
Ethiopia, you have ports, right?

00:15:19.617 --> 00:15:20.700
AUDIENCE: Kenya has ports.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.890
GARY GENSLER: Kenya
has ports, sorry.

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.742
You're landlocked.

00:15:23.742 --> 00:15:24.450
All right, sorry.

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:25.325
So I've got it right.

00:15:25.325 --> 00:15:26.460
So Kenya-- I got it wrong.

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.340
But Kenya's got ports.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:31.560
But the exporter, at the
same time they're shipping,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.200
will also send the documents,
but send the documents

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:34.890
to their bank.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.580
Their bank sends it
to the foreign bank.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.790
The foreign bank says, ah-ha.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:41.790
That triggers the condition
in the letter of credit.

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:44.410
Payment will be made.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:48.070
And payment can be made when
you put the goods on the ship.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:51.160
Payment maybe is
made when the goods

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.200
get to the foreign country.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.280
All these arrangements
can be different.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.290
So this gives you a
sense of the change.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:08.380
Letter credits were estimated
in 1970 to be about half

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:09.970
of all of trade.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.590
Now they're about 15%.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.620
World Economic Forum
Bain papers that you all

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:22.827
had the pleasure of either
reading or skimming or you'll

00:16:22.827 --> 00:16:23.535
read it tomorrow.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:30.360
But letters of credit is
a big piece of the market.

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:36.430
Primary open account has
widened as part of the market,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:41.020
I think, in part because
international trade

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.270
is probably more dominated
by large companies

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.440
now than in the past.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.990
And in the 1970s, even
the large companies

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.480
didn't know if they
could trust each other.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.020
The larger enterprises,
larger multinationals

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.570
really would prefer just
to trade on open account

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.710
and extend each
other's credit rather

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:03.580
than using the banking system
to guarantee their credit.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:09.869
But trade finance is still
a good call at 15% to 20%,

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:14.349
which would still be
rather significant numbers.

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.520
So that's a little bit
on the sort of questions

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:20.819
about trade finance, how it
fits in, before we start talking

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.379
about blockchain projects.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.243
I think I had one other thing.

00:17:27.243 --> 00:17:29.160
Here are all the parties
that can be involved.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:36.180
And just to sort
of confuse us all,

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.390
here is a list of
some of the documents.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.340
And that's not even
a complete list.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:44.680
I went to a legal
website to find out

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.640
what all the different
documents you might have.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.350
Anybody know what a
bill of lading is?

00:17:53.074 --> 00:17:58.750
AUDIENCE: It's some kind of
receipt from the vessel carrier

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:01.450
that is carrying your goods.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.640
And whoever owns
that bill of lading

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.470
has the right to
claim the goods.

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.240
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.800
So it's like a
warehouse receipt.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.440
Remember, we talked about
some of the origins of money

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.660
were around warehouse
receipts because I

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:18.340
might put my corn or wheat or
gold or bronze in a warehouse.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:23.950
A bill of lading originally,
though the definition is moved

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:27.760
on over the centuries, the
original definition it was

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.850
like a warehouse
receipt on a ship

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:34.930
that you took your products or
goods and placed it on a ship.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.820
And you had a bill of lading
because it was on the ship.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.570
And you could actually, just
like those original forms

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:46.200
of money, warehouse receipts,
you could sell a bill of lading

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.570
or discount it and
get money for it.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:50.700
So bills of lading
have centuries

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.000
old, maybe thousands
of years of history,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.670
similar to warehouse receipts.

00:18:55.670 --> 00:18:57.630
And in essence, you
might think of a bill

00:18:57.630 --> 00:19:00.150
of lading a little bit
as a form of money.

00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:06.790
But what did I
list just for fun?

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:09.845
50 different documents.

00:19:09.845 --> 00:19:10.345
Alean.

00:19:10.345 --> 00:19:11.520
AUDIENCE: How easy is
it to fake one of these?

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:12.310
GARY GENSLER: Say it louder.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.440
AUDIENCE: How easy is it
to fake one of these bills

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.915
and claim someone else's goods?

00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:17.290
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.830
So is was a point earlier.

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:21.610
And again, this
goes back centuries

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:26.980
that there's been a lot of fraud
around faking a bill of lading

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.420
or a bill of exchange,
a warehouse receipt,

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:34.750
in another effort.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:38.500
So what you have is you have
a lot of forms of notary,

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:41.740
well before cryptography,
a lot of forms of notary

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:48.910
where various transport agents
and shippers had to really

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:53.154
have seals and forms of ways
to say this was a committed.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:56.450
Leonardo.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.380
AUDIENCE: And I think
part of the problem

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:02.150
is that each one single
piece of those documents

00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:04.860
are easy to falsify.

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:08.000
That's why this system
became so burdensome

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.830
in terms of paperwork,
because they started

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:12.620
to build a lot of
steps to guarantee

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.300
that you can track all
those things and make sure

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.810
you reduce the risk.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:22.310
It's relatively easy to
get one of those faked too.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:25.400
GARY GENSLER: And it's why many
people think this is actually

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:32.420
one of the better use cases,
better ecosystems for a revised

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:34.910
technology similar to
blockchain or actually

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:38.830
blockchain technology itself,
a lot of multiple parties.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:43.940
And though I only listed seven,
you can have multiple banks.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:46.640
You can have the importer's
bank, the exporter's bank,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.410
between them you can have a
correspondent bank, right,

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.970
so at least three banks in the
chain or sometimes even more.

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.000
Freight forwarders,
shippers, customs

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.480
agents in both countries.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.656
You have a question, James?

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:03.280
AUDIENCE: Nope.

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.630
GARY GENSLER: So lots of
parties, lots of documents,

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.040
high chance of fraud.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.910
And guaranteeing
validation and verification

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.340
is a big piece of
this marketplace.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.110
So then the question is, can
you put somebody in the middle?

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:26.380
See that little blockchain
in the middle, kind of cute.

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.670
All right, you're not going
to laugh a little with me.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:34.130
That's the question, so
multiple parties involved.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:36.860
Verification is critical
to all the workflows

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.250
and the economics.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.400
And it relies on
significant document flows.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.380
That's the basic.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.690
And it's what--

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.760
Today's lecture is
really to say well

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.160
whether you're looking
at health care records,

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.590
whether you're thinking
about commercial real estate,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:59.020
you're thinking about
internet of things,

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:02.710
remind yourself of trade
finance because this is probably

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.660
one of the best
use cases, at least

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:06.870
for permissioned blockchains.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.280
So you can debate
whether it could be

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.050
done on a traditional database.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.350
But it's multiple parties.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.210
Lots of validation
and verification

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:20.300
is important, an awful lot
of different documents.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.450
And there there's
property rights involved.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.940
Critically, there is
key property rights

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:27.400
because when you're shipping
oil on the high seas

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.720
or shipping any bits of that
$17 trillion on the high seas,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.040
people want to
finance against it.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.960
AUDIENCE: I have
one question for me

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.320
to better understand this.

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.240
How do you finance these
from sending a good

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.280
from San Francisco to Boston?

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.950
And the same time, why?

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.110
Is it a matter of that we
need all these documents

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.027
and we need to put
documents on the blockchain

00:22:49.027 --> 00:22:50.930
or can we just get
rid of the documents?

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:53.395
Why don't we see the
same thing in intra-US?

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.730
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.920
Though the word trade
finance has come to mean,

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.710
for many decades, maybe hundreds
of years, international trade,

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.740
the same can be true
for domestic trade,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.560
particularly as you're going,
as you said, from San Francisco

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:14.450
to Boston.

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.060
You could use a letter
of credit between

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:23.600
a major domestic manufacturer
and a small business in Boston.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:26.510
So I might say, I
don't want to take--

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.770
sorry, Joe Quin, but you're
that small manufacturer.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.470
You're that small
entity in Boston.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.290
And Tom's not willing to
take your credit risk.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.990
You could still want to
have a letter of credit.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:40.400
It wouldn't be
called technically

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.890
a bill of lading if
it's not on a ship,

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:45.870
even though that term
sometimes is used.

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:51.930
But everything back here could
happen in domestic trade,

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.430
but usually doesn't.

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:57.240
Most of domestic trade
is done on open account.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.060
But some of it's done on
letter of credit especially,

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:02.865
if just small businesses.

00:24:02.865 --> 00:24:04.290
Does that help?

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.120
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.780
I'm trying to think why
do we need it in one case

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:11.013
and not in the other one?

00:24:11.013 --> 00:24:12.180
GARY GENSLER: There's more--

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.390
I think it's applicable in both.

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.430
It's more applicable
on international trade

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:23.280
because you have more
challenges of trust,

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:26.370
I would even say
information asymmetries.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:31.890
If you're sitting in China
and you're exporting to Kenya,

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:35.220
you have less chance to actually
know that local community.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.990
And your bank in China
doesn't know them either.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:44.610
And so what was built up to
satisfy those issues of trust

00:24:44.610 --> 00:24:46.830
is the banking sector
largely picked up

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:50.510
that, either guaranteeing
the documents

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:53.220
or actually
guaranteeing the credit.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:53.720
Hugo.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.387
AUDIENCE: There's also something
to say for like border control,

00:24:56.387 --> 00:24:56.980
right.

00:24:56.980 --> 00:25:00.480
Like, I know, in my lab we've
had like waste materials

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.760
shipped to us internationally.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.450
And customs agents really
even care about that.

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:10.480
You have to put a price on
that, even if it has no price.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.440
So like if you could just
put something on a car

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.890
and drive it from San
Francisco to Boston,

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:17.910
then maybe like, yeah.

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:19.610
If you're driving
from Canada to the US,

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.570
it would be different
from shipping it

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.290
from China to the US.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:27.150
But I think the trust
issue comes up a lot more

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:30.180
when you're dealing with
international and regulatory

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:32.065
differences between
the two places.

00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:33.690
GARY GENSLER: I'm
not saying it doesn't

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.220
exist in domestic trade.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:38.040
It definitely exists
in domestic trade.

00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.390
But international trade
long ago created a system

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.960
to address different
languages, different cultures,

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.570
different regulatory
regimes, taxing regimes.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:53.040
And it was going on a ship.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.470
AUDIENCE: Even more
anti-money laundering.

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.240
So there is other
regulation that

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.070
is part of the policy
that complicates it.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:01.740
One nation, a letter
of credit-- you

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:03.630
need to make sure
that you're not

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:08.730
breaking any regulation between
different jurisdictions.

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:14.010
Part of it will be ML as
well or ABC or whatever.

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:14.990
GARY GENSLER: James.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.100
AUDIENCE: But, I think,
looking at that question,

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.380
it seems like we are
using technology,

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.190
in this case, blockchain
to fit into the existing

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.488
framework of how things work.

00:26:24.488 --> 00:26:26.030
But shouldn't the
question be flipped

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.380
to say, hang on a second,
do we need blockchain

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.370
in a system that
is better designed,

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.400
not having 50
different documents,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.030
and actually thinking
about the actual problem.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.160
I can see the point
of the trust which

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.560
may need a blockchain solution.

00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.790
But a lot of that--

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:44.010
be that trucking receipts,
railroad receipts,

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:48.390
or cargo receipts, those
are historical relics.

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.090
Surely there must
be a technology

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.927
other than blockchain that
could solve the problem.

00:26:52.927 --> 00:26:54.010
GARY GENSLER: Well, maybe.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:56.230
Or maybe blockchain
technology is just

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.110
the right technology
that's coming along

00:26:59.110 --> 00:27:03.280
in the 21st century to solve
it better than initially pieces

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.080
of paper and literally
document couriers that

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.932
had to be trusted to do it.

00:27:09.932 --> 00:27:11.890
AUDIENCE: They've gone
the way the dodo, right?

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:12.973
So--

00:27:12.973 --> 00:27:15.640
GARY GENSLER: Well, they haven't
fully gone the way of the dodo.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.440
AUDIENCE: While I
think that there's

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.220
much to be said about blockchain
that creates trust in parties

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:24.913
that may not naturally
trust each other,

00:27:24.913 --> 00:27:27.580
the problem seems to me is there
is a lot of things that doesn't

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:30.490
need to happen in this day
and age, as you mentioned,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.420
domestic mail services.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.480
It's between sender
and receiver.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:39.070
What happens in between is
tracked by UPS or whoever.

00:27:39.070 --> 00:27:42.390
But what we certainly don't see
is all of that list of stuff

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.390
while this is happening.

00:27:43.390 --> 00:27:47.340
But it's unnecessary,
domestically,

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.200
GARY GENSLER: You
might be right.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.020
But what's happened well before
blockchain technology came

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.720
along is digitization.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.230
But part of the trade
can't be dematerialized.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.660
See in the securities
business, what

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.120
we talked about when we talked
about clearing and settling

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.150
of securities, the
equity ownership

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.710
has been dematerialized.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.660
And it started to
happen in the 1970s.

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:15.150
The legal right that
you have this cash flow

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:21.600
called an equity interest
in Apple is all digitized.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.990
Part of this trade is not
digitized, $17 trillion

00:28:24.990 --> 00:28:30.020
of physical goods
on the high seas.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.300
So I still think you're
going to need something

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:37.490
that shows that the physical
goods made it on a ship

00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.500
or on a cargo
vessel of some sort.

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.050
And so there are
some differences.

00:28:43.050 --> 00:28:43.818
Erik.

00:28:43.818 --> 00:28:44.860
Still haven't heard from.

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:50.320
Just to address a
concern of James

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:55.460
that many of the manual
plus the station projects

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.020
fail at the beginning because
they actually did that.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.450
They kind of tried to
reflect exactly what happened

00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:07.160
in the manual world into the
digitized world, which resulted

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.860
in many inefficiencies.

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:12.090
And this is not the case.

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:17.690
We're not actually trying to do
exactly that off line process

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:18.935
using blockchain technology.

00:29:18.935 --> 00:29:20.060
That's not the alternative.

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:25.820
But that actually made me think
that I wanted to point out this

00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.510
to your argumentative of
centralized databases.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.430
And centralized databases
have been around

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.940
for more than 60 years.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.300
They've been digitizing
manual processes for a while.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.300
The question comes is, why
didn't they already digitize

00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:41.490
these sort of problems?

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.860
The answer is because
this trade finance issue

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:50.000
has special characteristics
that make it especially

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.460
suitable for it to be addressed
by these specific technologies.

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:55.760
So that's why I
would argue that.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.600
GARY GENSLER: And what do you
think that specialness is?

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.050
AUDIENCE: It's
precisely the fact

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.710
that you have multiple
stakeholders dealing

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:09.140
with information that goes
among all of these moving parts

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.940
and you have a
high cost of trust.

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.710
So what you're actually doing
is using blockchain technology

00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:18.680
permissioned or
otherwise to address

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.015
this specific challenge.

00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:24.140
GARY GENSLER: And you have
a property right as well

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:27.290
that people often want to
borrow still against while it's

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.750
on the high seas.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:33.770
But I agree it may well be that
the blockchain technology is

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:36.470
not the only solution to this.

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:42.050
But it does feel like it's
a particularly fertile area.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.630
And we're going to turn right
now to some of the projects.

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.000
And there is a lot of
projects in this space.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.500
Alean.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.315
And then we'll go
in back to Aviva.

00:30:50.315 --> 00:30:54.710
AUDIENCE: So is the overarching
goal here to fix the fraud

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.292
or to fix the complexity,
what's the goal?

00:30:57.292 --> 00:30:59.250
GARY GENSLER: Well it's
a really good question.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.550
So those working
on projects, is it

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:04.440
more about fraud
or the complexity?

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.963
AUDIENCE: Fraud.

00:31:05.963 --> 00:31:07.130
GARY GENSLER: So efficiency.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:08.672
AUDIENCE: Yes, the
complexity I guess

00:31:08.672 --> 00:31:10.400
is a function of the fact.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.870
GARY GENSLER: So you can you
can drive a lot of efficiency,

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.670
which is due to the complexity.

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:19.610
I think, that's one of
the overarching goals

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:27.760
is driving efficiency, but also
to lower the fraud or the loss

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.970
to fraud.

00:31:28.970 --> 00:31:29.570
It's both.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.580
But I think it's driven
more by the efficiency

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.360
from my readings of this.

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.885
AUDIENCE: Fraud.

00:31:34.885 --> 00:31:36.510
GARY GENSLER: More
by the efficiencies.

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:38.030
AUDIENCE: What's the fraud rate?

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:39.780
GARY GENSLER: I don't
know the fraud rate.

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:41.820
That's a good question.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:45.135
We'll see if we can find it
out Aviva was going to be next.

00:31:45.135 --> 00:31:47.510
AUDIENCE: So let's say that
trade finance does transition

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.200
to a blockchain
and then that it's

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.560
more in the private blockchain.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:57.338
So then how do we solve the
problem of interoperability?

00:31:57.338 --> 00:31:59.130
GARY GENSLER: Can I
hold that, because it's

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.713
a very good question
that will come up

00:32:00.713 --> 00:32:03.260
when we talk a little bit
about some of the IBM projects,

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.840
particularly with one
of the largest shippers?

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.590
So it's the right question.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:09.997
But we're going to chat
about when we talk about it.

00:32:09.997 --> 00:32:12.080
Can I talk about some of
the projects or was there

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.920
something?

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.410
So where are we?

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:19.290
Well, there's five
big consortium.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:21.630
Two of them you can
see are backed on--

00:32:21.630 --> 00:32:23.310
or working on the Corda.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:28.020
That was R3 Corda that we talked
about earlier this semester.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:30.120
Two are on IBM.

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.020
One that's on a
Ping An Group, we

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.690
didn't talk about
earlier this year.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.300
So letter of credit approach.

00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.247
Receivables and payment
guarantee financing, which

00:32:45.247 --> 00:32:46.330
is a little bit different.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:48.030
This is, we already
have receivables,

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:48.960
how do we fund them?

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:55.870
Monitoring open transactions
and letters of credit.

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:59.610
And then the Hong Kong group is
a supply chain record keeping.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:04.260
And just if you want to
see it sort of visually,

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:06.420
this is all the banks
that are involved

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.430
in each of the consortium.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:14.190
And you'll see basically that
there's some overlap, I think,

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.530
unless I'm mistaken.

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.450
I and G might be in
a couple of them.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.480
I think two of these consortia
maybe have now merged.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:25.920
But it goes a little bit.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.680
It's not fully going to
answer your question of Aviva.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.590
But even if there were five
different consortium trying

00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.750
to figure this out amongst
different groups of banks,

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:38.210
at some point in time to
really gain a great deal

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:42.530
more efficiency, how do they
operate, how do they transact

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:47.000
across their platforms?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.120
Now they each, obviously, don't
want to give up economic rents.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:54.203
They don't want to give up
market power to somebody.

00:33:54.203 --> 00:33:55.620
They don't want
to all of a sudden

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:58.680
find out that some
entrepreneur is charging them

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:04.380
so much because they created
a network, because the one

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:10.170
consortium that figures this
out early on could price pretty

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:14.760
close to their cost structure,
but later on could, you know,

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.520
price a lot higher and
collect a lot of monopoly

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.489
or economic rents.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:22.583
So I don't know where
this will sort out.

00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:24.000
And I don't even
know that they're

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.290
going to want to solve the
interoperability problem

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.530
amongst themselves.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.250
Sean.

00:34:30.250 --> 00:34:33.989
AUDIENCE: One interesting kind
of finding fault with consortia

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:36.630
is all of the banks
listed up there,

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:38.670
all these are Asian
bank or European bank.

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:40.830
None of the US banks are
actually participating.

00:34:40.830 --> 00:34:44.130
I see US Bank, so one.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.860
GARY GENSLER: But do
you see JP Morgan Chase?

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:59.190
Now, who's the largest issuer
of trade finance in the world?

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.570
AUDIENCE: US Government?

00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:01.170
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:02.590
AUDIENCE: It's not the
US Government, is it?

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.632
GARY GENSLER: No, no, no.

00:35:03.632 --> 00:35:04.450
I think it's--

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.430
I think it's HSBC.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:08.640
I might be mistaken.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.900
AUDIENCE: I think it's HSBC.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.567
GARY GENSLER: You
think too, it is HSBC.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:16.550
But you're right.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:21.530
The five big-- Wells Fargo
is not on there either.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.030
Now that doesn't mean they're
not working on other projects,

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.140
because here here's
some other projects.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.870
And these aren't the consortia.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.280
I'm just giving us flavor.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.530
There's a lot going
on in this space.

00:35:31.530 --> 00:35:34.500
And those of you who are
doing final projects,

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.640
I challenge you to think
about these projects.

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.650
And say, well what are you
recommending that's different,

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:42.150
you know.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:46.072
It's not just me too, me
too financial, not the other

00:35:46.072 --> 00:35:46.820
me too stuff.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:53.430
India's interesting to me.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:58.530
There's another consortium
that wasn't on that page.

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.620
And I'll probably
pronounce it wrong.

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.390
"Final Cal" or "Finic Cal."

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.140
AUDIENCE: Finacle.

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:05.223
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:36:05.223 --> 00:36:06.570
AUDIENCE: Finacle.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:08.490
GARY GENSLER: Are you
familiar with that?

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.040
AUDIENCE: Not much, I just
know the pronunciation.

00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:11.582
GARY GENSLER: Just
the pronunciation.

00:36:11.582 --> 00:36:12.840
Thank you for helping me out.

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:14.170
I needed it.

00:36:14.170 --> 00:36:16.790
For validation
documents and payment,

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:19.290
so they're not really saying
we're just trade finance.

00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.020
But we're going to validate all
the documents This goes more

00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.300
to fraud.

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.880
I think this project, validating
the documents, saying,

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:28.920
yes, they're true
and good, and you can

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.440
lend against these documents.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.150
And a lot of times
these documents

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.250
are the bills of
lading and bills

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:39.760
of exchange or loan
lendable and so forth.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.700
So a lot of projects, one--

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.780
I could only find and
there may be others,

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:47.910
I could only find
one with a token.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.660
And I put it up
there last, Ethereum

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:53.640
based ConsenSys,
the company that's

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.930
run by Joe Lubin who is the
Canadian venture capitalist who

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:03.570
helped back Vitalik
Buterin and Ethereum.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.330
ConsenSys has 300 or
400 people at least

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:10.230
working in ConsenSys doing
Ethereum based projects.

00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:14.010
So I was pleased to see I could
find one native based token.

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:19.050
But to my knowledge, all of the
consortia and all of the ones

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.320
I listed up there are
permissioned blockchains

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.910
from what I can tell.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.010
But I'm curious, those of
you who are working on this,

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:31.740
have you found any native
token projects here?

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.110
AUDIENCE: There
is still b-verify,

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.170
which is a project
from the Media Lab.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.910
It doesn't have a
native token per se,

00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:42.510
but uses permissionless
blockchain,

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:45.510
existing permissionless
blockchain infrastructure

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:53.040
to gain the readability
of lots of statements

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:58.200
to build a warehouse
receipts use case.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:01.680
So they are using transactions
in the Bitcoin network

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:05.190
right now to write--

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.650
GARY GENSLER: But does
b-verify have a token?

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.522
AUDIENCE: No.

00:38:08.522 --> 00:38:09.480
GARY GENSLER: No token.

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.855
AUDIENCE: It's
been restructured.

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:11.510
Yeah.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:12.097
Yeah.

00:38:12.097 --> 00:38:13.430
GARY GENSLER: What's that Alean?

00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:17.065
AUDIENCE: I think they build on
top of our research from Cecil.

00:38:17.065 --> 00:38:17.940
GARY GENSLER: Catina?

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:18.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.060
Exactly.

00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:20.620
Yeah.

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.340
Catina is a person.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.970
GARY GENSLER: So is
that your research?

00:38:24.970 --> 00:38:25.260
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:25.690
Yeah.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:26.940
GARY GENSLER: That's terrific.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:31.470
But you're-- you're-- so
you're going to talk to Eric.

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:33.300
But you didn't have
a token in that.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:34.300
AUDIENCE: No, you
don't need a token.

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:35.258
That's the whole point.

00:38:35.258 --> 00:38:36.570
Like Bitcoin is out there.

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:37.650
It's a great system.

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:40.600
And you can build on
top of it efficiently,

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.250
providing mutability to
any permissioned app.

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:46.743
So don't start it as a
contract necessarily,

00:38:46.743 --> 00:38:48.910
unless, I don't know, maybe
there's a need for that.

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:50.368
But in a lot of
things there's not,

00:38:50.368 --> 00:38:52.820
like digital
identity, for example.

00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:54.620
That can be very conservative.

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:56.370
GARY GENSLER: But if
you put a token in it

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.230
and sold it right
into this bull market,

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.130
I guess you wouldn't be
sitting in this class.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.296
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

00:39:02.296 --> 00:39:05.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.500
GARY GENSLER: But I mean, I'm
glad you didn't put a token.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:09.722
I'm glad you're here.

00:39:09.722 --> 00:39:11.680
But I mean that's part
of-- like you're saying,

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:16.240
you didn't need it as a
technological and commercial

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.920
point is what you're saying.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:19.800
Leonardo.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.680
AUDIENCE: I was just
going to mention,

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.637
I happen to know a couple of
people working on this project.

00:39:24.637 --> 00:39:25.970
GARY GENSLER: Which one of them?

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:27.080
AUDIENCE: The last one.

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.540
GARY GENSLER: Could you
tell us something about it?

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:31.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I had to dig
a little bit into the native

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.080
talking that you mentioned.

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:35.780
But most of the
trading firms there

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:42.440
are petroleum based, so like
very large shippers of oil.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.160
Back to your point, bill of
lading, in the commodity space,

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:49.830
the petroleum bill of lading
are the ones that most actively

00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:50.330
traded.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:53.987
And they change hands very often
while the vessel is at sea.

00:39:53.987 --> 00:39:56.570
GARY GENSLER: Actually if I can
add to this, because I learned

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.290
a little bit about this when I
was in the US Commodity Futures

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:01.790
Trading Commission.

00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:06.260
The bill of lading for
oil on the high seas

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.260
can trade hands hundreds
if not thousands of times.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:16.850
The oil coming from the
Strait of Hormuz to Houston

00:40:16.850 --> 00:40:18.930
might change ownership in--

00:40:18.930 --> 00:40:22.445
I don't know how long it
takes a 15 or 30 day trip.

00:40:22.445 --> 00:40:23.603
AUDIENCE: About 20 days.

00:40:23.603 --> 00:40:24.770
GARY GENSLER: A 20 day trip.

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.790
It can change the ownership
hundreds of times.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:33.410
So those documents
become tradable goods.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.800
And it's not just in theory.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.393
It's very much in practice.

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:38.810
AUDIENCE: So the
point I was going

00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:42.170
to make is I suspect they
may be talking there must be

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:46.680
some kind of collateralization
against those,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:52.690
you know, the bill of
lading from the company.

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:55.290
GARY GENSLER: So Alpha, who
I'm sure I remember everybody

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.940
in your group, what
can you tell us

00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:58.770
about what you're working on?

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.250
How are you going to
beat all these consortia?

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.440
I'm thinking, you know,
your final project is going

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.847
to do better than these, right?

00:41:04.847 --> 00:41:05.680
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.870
We're taking the--

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:12.210
GARY GENSLER: I did give these
two groups the heads up that I

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.377
was going to I call on them.

00:41:13.377 --> 00:41:15.342
So this is not just-- but yeah.

00:41:15.342 --> 00:41:16.800
AUDIENCE: We're
taking the approach

00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.420
of just being very specific.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.440
So we're focusing
on a narrow corridor

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.360
between Chinese exports
coming into Ethiopia.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.600
And so one there aren't
many people, obviously,

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.660
looking at that space,
at least not yet.

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.910
GARY GENSLER: And is it
through the trade finance side

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:35.140
or what I'll call the
supply chain side?

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.705
AUDIENCE: The
trade finance side.

00:41:36.705 --> 00:41:38.580
And so we think it's
particularly interesting

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:40.330
around not just
Ethiopia, but all

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:42.540
of the sort of developing
countries in that region,

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.250
because credit and finance
is already so limited.

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:49.518
And so the domestic banking
systems are undeveloped.

00:41:49.518 --> 00:41:51.060
GARY GENSLER: Domestic
banking system

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.133
in Ethiopia particularly?

00:41:52.133 --> 00:41:55.200
AUDIENCE: Right, and across
East Africa, I would say.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:58.860
And so the reliance on trade
finance in those import

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.060
heavy economies, I
think, is even higher.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.690
So the ping point, I think,
is even stronger there.

00:42:03.690 --> 00:42:04.320
GARY GENSLER:
James, did you have

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.445
a question for their group?

00:42:05.445 --> 00:42:09.260
Anybody that has questions
for the group, pile in.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.500
They'll take the advice.

00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:11.958
AUDIENCE: Not
specific on this one,

00:42:11.958 --> 00:42:13.220
but more of a clarification.

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.322
So I can clearly see that
trade finance requires

00:42:17.322 --> 00:42:18.780
different parties
and the ownership

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.620
of the goods at any point
in time in the supply chain

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:24.870
is important, but--

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.240
GARY GENSLER: Particularly
when it becomes commoditized,

00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.710
like oil and so forth.

00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:31.590
AUDIENCE: But from
like over time--

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.390
a lot of the times
I hear about people

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.720
saying blockchain
using, in this scenario,

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.000
there's a supply chain.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.070
Given that they're not
really exchanging it

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.970
for money, are there actually
any commercial cases or use

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.170
cases with genuine useful
points about supply chain

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:49.170
being on the blockchain?

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:51.600
I mean, tracing where
my coffee bean came

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.450
from on the blockchain
is pretty useless to me.

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.088
But people seem to think
about it as a great thing.

00:42:57.088 --> 00:42:58.880
I can trace back where
something came from.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.740
GARY GENSLER: Are
you a coffee drinker?

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:01.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:01.920
Yes.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.010
Not because of your class.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:03.180
GARY GENSLER: No.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:03.330
No.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.260
I just didn't know.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:08.587
You could drink tea to
stay awake in my class too.

00:43:08.587 --> 00:43:10.170
AUDIENCE: But I just
didn't understand

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.020
when people keep talking
about supply chain needing

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.020
to be on the blockchain.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:15.410
I just don't understand why.

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:17.250
Where's there is trade
finance, absolutely.

00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:18.750
GARY GENSLER: All
right, your solved

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.240
is-- wait before
everybody piles in.

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:26.010
Does anybody have advice for
China Ethiopia trade finance?

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:27.510
I'm going to give
everybody a chance

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.130
to pile into James's question.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:32.995
But you're in a China
Ethiopia trade finance.

00:43:32.995 --> 00:43:35.370
AUDIENCE: Yes, I have a question
of the interoperability.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:39.990
I mean, what's the solution for
the Ethiopian purchasers, just

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.720
have to basically buy
into whatever system

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.200
these firms are using?

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:49.610
So Ethiopian firms have
to use letters of credit.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.180
So that's a regulation.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.910
So everything is done
completely manualized right now.

00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:57.000
So we would offer just something
very, very sort of specific

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.690
like an eBill of lading
or an eInvoice platform.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.556
It could be on a smartphone.

00:44:03.556 --> 00:44:05.190
My Impression is
that it'd be easier

00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:08.090
to get the Ethiopian
firms to buy into this,

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.640
whereas the Chinese firms
may have multiple options

00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:12.690
or multiple systems.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:17.280
So how would you approach
getting them onto your system

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.980
specifically or
being able to utilize

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.675
your system using websites or
whatever else they are using?

00:44:22.675 --> 00:44:23.550
So yeah, so we agree.

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:26.640
So you'd have to get just
Ethiopian businesses and banks

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.960
on the system.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.810
And so they would be sort
of our initial customers.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:32.400
And for any Chinese
bank that wants

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.942
to do business to
export to Ethiopia,

00:44:33.942 --> 00:44:35.850
they have to go
through Ethiopian Bank.

00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:38.040
So inevitably, they'd
have to go through this.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.850
GARY GENSLER: So it
sounds like you're

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:40.440
trying to build a solution.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.840
Your adoption is through
the importer side,

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.400
through the Ethiopian
side initially.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.490
And then the Chinese
exporters would say,

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:50.040
well this is how I get
into the Ethiopian market

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.130
in a more secure, maybe more
efficient, but certainly more

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.090
secure way.

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.940
Other thoughts on this project?

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:01.170
AUDIENCE: I thought I saw
there was a new consortium that

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:05.280
was predominantly Chinese
shippers and container

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.215
companies.

00:45:06.215 --> 00:45:07.590
It wasn't on that
particular one.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:08.450
GARY GENSLER: And it's not this.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:09.930
It's not the first
one, The People's--

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.097
AUDIENCE: Not the first one.

00:45:11.097 --> 00:45:14.530
No, this one has a couple of
Chinese shipping companies.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:15.750
It's very new.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.450
It's like November 8th or 9th or
something that it was launched.

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.030
So it's just getting started.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:22.320
They were looking for vendors.

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.905
And yeah, it's a
huge consortia there.

00:45:23.905 --> 00:45:24.780
GARY GENSLER: No, no.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.930
This is one of the most active
and it's remained active,

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:32.560
but mostly permissioned
blockchain chain technology.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:36.210
It's the most active
and very vibrant.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.060
And if you had to say
probability weighted,

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.340
there'll be something
successful in this space more

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:46.530
than maybe some of
the other spaces.

00:45:46.530 --> 00:45:50.130
So who wants to chime
into James' supply chain--

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:51.120
this unit?

00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.120
You're going to jump in.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.450
So I just want to
tell-- here's just two

00:45:54.450 --> 00:45:55.980
example of some shipping.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:58.170
And I just pulled up
five quick examples

00:45:58.170 --> 00:46:00.450
of supply chain projects.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.880
But Eric, you want to
address James coffee?

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.580
You like coffee more than James.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.580
AUDIENCE: I won't give
you an example of coffee,

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.300
but let's say fruits.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:13.200
You have a big
retailer chain that--

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.470
and I think the
example is in Britain.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:19.260
Suddenly you have reports
of sudden infection

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:21.350
of E coli in a specific fruit.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:27.570
OK, so as a responsible measure,
the retailer have to hold off--

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:32.420
actually has to know which
part or which load of fruit is

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.110
the one affected.

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.040
So since the whole
process of, you know,

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:40.680
digging through a huge file
of paperwork takes weeks.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:44.190
These guys would have to
hold off a big bunch of fruit

00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:46.620
that they would
eventually get lost

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:50.590
with the economic
implications of that.

00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:51.190
That was a--

00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:52.103
They probably--

00:46:52.103 --> 00:46:53.270
GARY GENSLER: So wait, wait.

00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.830
So let's see.

00:46:53.830 --> 00:46:55.080
AUDIENCE: We're getting there.

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:56.930
We're getting there.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:00.600
So having your
supply chain connect

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:05.210
to a blockchain, that
can allow you quickly

00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:09.897
get the information within
hours and immediately identify

00:47:09.897 --> 00:47:11.480
which is the load
that's been affected

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:15.460
and take it out with the
decreased economic costs.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.790
GARY GENSLER: So you got
at least three other hands.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:19.350
We'll go--

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:21.020
AUDIENCE: So I tend
to agree with James.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.245
So what I've heard
critiques of using

00:47:24.245 --> 00:47:25.620
both blockchain
for supply chains

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:29.220
for things like blood diamonds
or preventing counterfeit goods

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.060
or whatever.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:33.360
Diamonds we have
DeBeers project.

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.530
Yeah, so I know these
guys are doing that.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:36.730
But the criticism.

00:47:36.730 --> 00:47:40.385
I've heard is that because these
aren't digital native goods,

00:47:40.385 --> 00:47:42.510
there has to be an interface
between the real world

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:43.680
and the blockchain.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.120
GARY GENSLER: Physical
good to the digital good.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.010
AUDIENCE: And what
I've heard from critics

00:47:47.010 --> 00:47:50.010
is that it's at
the point of origin

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:52.937
that fraud or counterfeiting
whatever takes place.

00:47:52.937 --> 00:47:55.062
And it's the point of
origin, where that data needs

00:47:55.062 --> 00:47:56.550
to take place anyway.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:58.080
So it's garbage in garbage out.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.720
You can put a
counterfeit thing in,

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.100
but then that passes
through the supply chain.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.683
GARY GENSLER: We have
Shammon, Raheem, and then Tom.

00:48:05.683 --> 00:48:07.350
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to pick James' side.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:09.017
GARY GENSLER: Oh my
god, I need somebody

00:48:09.017 --> 00:48:10.860
on the other side of James.

00:48:10.860 --> 00:48:13.062
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
can help me in a sense

00:48:13.062 --> 00:48:15.270
that like Walmart, right,
is kind of a prime example.

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:16.980
They've implemented, et cetera.

00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:19.920
But basically if Walmart
just said like, so

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.380
basically they're using
IBM infrastructure, right.

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.230
If they went to the supply
chain said, look guys,

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:27.510
we hired IBM, OK.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:28.860
Now you're going to send--

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:31.510
every time this good
can transfer hands,

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:33.510
you're going to to send
that information to IBM.

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:33.840
That's it.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:35.923
I mean basically that's
what happened because it's

00:48:35.923 --> 00:48:37.920
being stored on a
server that IBM--

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:41.247
like what is blockchain about?

00:48:41.247 --> 00:48:42.080
GARY GENSLER: Well--

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.390
AUDIENCE: Like I heard them
how this is blockchain.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:49.170
But I really don't see what
is blockchain about it.

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:49.920
I mean basically--

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:51.795
GARY GENSLER: So who
wants to take-- who want

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:53.100
to take the other side for him?

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:53.850
And I know, James.

00:48:53.850 --> 00:48:55.920
You're not taking the
other side of James.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.900
AUDIENCE: I think is
a bit controversial.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.820
But when I was in the UK
a couple of years ago,

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:02.280
there were some
activists talking

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:05.280
about the origin of
weapons and some areas

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.790
where weapons were being
smuggled in some war zones.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:10.620
The point of origin
in this case will

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:15.990
be the developed world, which
is going into the US, UK, China.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:20.850
If you can trace the origin of
the weapons sent in war zones,

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.980
you could know how did it end
up there and you can stop maybe.

00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:26.760
I don't know.

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:28.950
You need to trust the data
entry in the first place.

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.100
GARY GENSLER: You
do have to have--

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:32.058
AUDIENCE: But the point
of origin in this case,

00:49:32.058 --> 00:49:34.930
is not trusted.

00:49:34.930 --> 00:49:38.620
It would be trusted because
it would be manufacturers.

00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.287
And most of the
manufacturing would be--

00:49:40.287 --> 00:49:42.828
GARY GENSLER: I'm going to hold
off because I want to get Tom

00:49:42.828 --> 00:49:44.770
and then I'm going to
give you a reply, James.

00:49:44.770 --> 00:49:45.270
Tom.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.640
AUDIENCE: Yes, so I
am on the other side.

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.717
I think it works.

00:49:48.717 --> 00:49:51.050
And it sort of goes back to
Alean's original question of

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.850
whether or not this is about
addressing fraud or addressing

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.540
the efficiency of the system.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.530
The data entry is the same.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.140
I mean, if the data
entry from a paper system

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:04.860
or a non-block digital system
or a blockchain system is bad,

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.080
then it's always
going to be bad.

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.430
But if it's good, it's as good
as it is right now and probably

00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:12.560
as good as it's going
to be short of like RFID

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:15.150
chipping every
individual product,

00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:17.900
then what it does is allow
that same record to go

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.760
through the entire supply chain.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.630
So what is deemed by
whatever data input

00:50:23.630 --> 00:50:28.780
system to be a conflict free
diamond is seen by DeBeers,

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:33.860
the exporter, the producer, the
porch, the ultimate importer

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:34.370
of the good.

00:50:34.370 --> 00:50:39.470
And so you can save what are
now verification costs in terms

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:43.760
of time by processing
a railway receipt,

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.310
a trucking receipt, a shipping
receipt, forwarding exchange

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:50.480
receipt by making that
same document viewable

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.810
and immutable to all of
the partners in the trade.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.610
GARY GENSLER: And to
Shammon's question,

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:58.430
I think you've framed
the right question.

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:01.550
Basically, well, why not just
the traditional database?

00:51:01.550 --> 00:51:06.770
IBM is the software provider
of Hyperledger Fabric.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.020
Why not just give the
information to IBM?

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:11.510
And in fact, maybe that's
what Walmart is doing,

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.218
is what you said.

00:51:12.218 --> 00:51:13.843
AUDIENCE: That's why
I said what I did.

00:51:13.843 --> 00:51:15.800
GARY GENSLER: Now I
haven't dug deeply enough.

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:18.425
And often when you dig into
these websites and the news

00:51:18.425 --> 00:51:20.300
articles and the white
papers you can't quite

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.150
tell how they're using IBM.

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:26.360
IBM, I think, has 1,500
people in their division

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.460
that does Hyperledger projects.

00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.900
So they they're out there.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.350
IBM is marketing this.

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:35.540
But I think the theory
at least, because I'm not

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:39.290
going to be able to answer
what Walmart's really doing.

00:51:39.290 --> 00:51:43.430
The theory is it's more
censorship resistant,

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.330
that the data is actually
shared on multiple nodes

00:51:46.330 --> 00:51:48.080
even if it's permissioned,
even if there's

00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:54.640
only 15 or 20 nodes
or 30 nodes, that it's

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:57.010
more censorship resistant
than if it's all

00:51:57.010 --> 00:51:59.080
stored on an IBM server.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.260
And I don't know the answer,
whether the Walmart is actually

00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:05.200
stored on 30 different nodes.

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:09.430
But if it were,
then arguably then,

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:12.250
even though it's
permissioned and private,

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:17.560
it's more censorship resistant
and you can have more assurance

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:18.850
around this.

00:52:18.850 --> 00:52:19.840
One of the challenges--

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.740
Aviva left the room, on
interoperability is this number

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.330
two, TradeLens.

00:52:25.330 --> 00:52:31.390
TradeLens, the IBM and
"Marks," "Merks," how

00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:32.990
do you pronounce that company?

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.880
AUDIENCE: Maersk.

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:34.300
GARY GENSLER: Maersk.

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:35.200
It's one of the largest--

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.492
it's one of the two or three
largest shipping companies

00:52:37.492 --> 00:52:38.930
in the entire world.

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:41.570
They come up with a project.

00:52:41.570 --> 00:52:43.190
They announce it, tout it.

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.350
It's over a year and a half ago.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.020
There's no adoption
because the other shipping

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:49.970
companies are
saying, why do I want

00:52:49.970 --> 00:52:53.740
to adopt something with you?

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:58.540
Now it would be one thing if
some neutral standard setter,

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:01.810
almost like in the internet
the I Can or something.

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:06.940
But some neutral standard setter
came up with a consortium.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:09.070
But all the other
shippers in the world

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:14.420
say, I don't want to give up to
Maersk my data, my information,

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:17.540
and what might be
also market power.

00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:21.260
So interoperability
works there as well.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:24.350
All right, James
wants to have a reply.

00:53:24.350 --> 00:53:26.365
But are you all
right holding off?

00:53:26.365 --> 00:53:26.990
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:27.990
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:29.880
So we'll take two from my right.

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.010
AUDIENCE: I think there's
another issue which

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:32.677
is more about the
economics of it, which

00:53:32.677 --> 00:53:35.280
is, OK, let's say
that Walmart adopts,

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.615
like basically right now they
can force a lot of the supply

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:39.470
chain to adopt this.

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:42.313
I think there's a real
question about what they're

00:53:42.313 --> 00:53:43.730
going to do with
that data, right,

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.670
because essentially what it
does it allows them access

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:47.900
to the end producer.

00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:52.530
So the production of mangoes
is very fragmented, right.

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:53.780
But then you get consolidated.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.110
So there are multiple
steps along the chain

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:59.570
that actually extract economic
value, not the growers.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:01.370
I mean, they're kind
of screwed, right.

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:05.960
But now Walmart can go
directly to the growers,

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:09.750
because now they have access to
the data of who the grower is,

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:12.560
what their productivity is,
and how much they produce

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.020
or what time of the year
they produce, et cetera.

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:17.630
Well, there's a question
about whether they

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:20.810
want to cooperate with that
or how much information I

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:22.790
want to share with that
if I'm in the middle

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:25.190
and I'm actually accepting
economic rent right now.

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:28.510
GARY GENSLER: Right, so if the
whole supply chain is somehow--

00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:30.538
AUDIENCE: It's not just
the administration.

00:54:30.538 --> 00:54:32.330
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
that's right, the data.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:36.330
Just like Facebook collects
data or Visa collects EMI

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:39.940
data, that maybe Walmart
would collect data.

00:54:39.940 --> 00:54:42.440
AUDIENCE: My question takes the
Walmart example a little bit

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:42.940
further.

00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:44.900
I'm curious to
understand do you put

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:47.040
a supplier early
on in the process,

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.610
say a farmer or something
selling to Walmart,

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:53.090
do they even have exposure in
terms of the user experience

00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:56.210
that they are on blockchain
or does this just

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:57.740
become the back end.

00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:59.550
I guess, I understand
what we've talked

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:01.490
in terms of private keys
for digital currency.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:03.530
I'm trying to connect how that
ties to the user experience

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:04.030
here.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:06.450
They have like scanners
that they basically

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:09.520
scan or it's their phones
or whatever, right.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:12.890
So you have third parties
using these linkages.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:18.523
They don't know basically
where this data is going.

00:55:18.523 --> 00:55:19.690
GARY GENSLER: So I'm honest.

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:22.410
I'm going to take Shammon's
description of it.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:24.680
I'm not as close to the Walmart.

00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:27.800
I think in the trade
finance side, the consortium

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:34.820
that these and these, the
importer, the exporter,

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:40.100
the banks, the shippers,
and the best of these

00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:44.060
are meant to have a lot of
involvement and exposure,

00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:51.060
because even though this looks
pretty complicated and it is,

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:52.460
they're large institutions.

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:53.090
They're banks.

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:53.870
They're shippers.

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:57.080
They're freight forwarders,
except for maybe

00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.740
the small and medium sized
enterprises in Ethiopia.

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:04.860
But then they're an importer
that needs to have involvement.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:07.850
I think on the supply
chain side, the Walmart,

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:10.520
an individual grower
of mango, you're

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.020
saying from your understanding
Walmart's not looking for them.

00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:17.212
AUDIENCE: Again, this is because
they're very proud of that.

00:56:17.212 --> 00:56:19.670
They're proud of the fact that
they can actually influence.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:23.970
The reason why is because
they have the last mile.

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:25.987
It is very simple.

00:56:25.987 --> 00:56:28.070
GARY GENSLER: But they
would have to have some way

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:29.090
to do what Tom said.

00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:33.290
They have to be able to
put into digital form

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:35.825
the physical asset, the mangoes
are from this pack farm.

00:56:35.825 --> 00:56:36.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:38.140
But they can use a cell phone.

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:40.740
You know, so you type in,
OK, so you know like--

00:56:40.740 --> 00:56:41.700
GARY GENSLER: A scan.

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:42.325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:42.325 --> 00:56:45.020
GARY GENSLER: A QR
code or something.

00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:46.322
James, you want to reply?

00:56:46.322 --> 00:56:47.780
And then we'll go
back to you here.

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.530
AUDIENCE: Just quick points.

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:49.160
I think--

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:50.880
GARY GENSLER: Are
you convinced yet?

00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:52.742
AUDIENCE: No.

00:56:52.742 --> 00:56:54.200
I think ultimately
there's no doubt

00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:55.900
that once the digital
record's created,

00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:58.160
the digital immutability,
whether it's

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:04.310
a blockchain or a very secure
standard traditional database,

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:05.910
they are going to be the same.

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:08.000
The digital records, it's fine.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.190
But in the fiscal
world in the context

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:14.120
of supply chain, whether
it's from the origin

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.420
or any other individuals
along the chain, all it takes

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.410
is one bad actor to do
something to the physical good.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.510
But while traditional
record is immutable,

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:27.240
you're link between the physical
and digital is not guaranteed.

00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:32.570
So I still don't see how
a physical commodity can

00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:35.420
be guaranteed to go from one
end to the other of the supply

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:39.520
chain without ever being
tampered or altered.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.628
That is still a big
question for me.

00:57:43.628 --> 00:57:44.420
GARY GENSLER: Hugo.

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
going to say that.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:47.540
I don't know if
that's the objective.

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:51.045
Because if you take diamonds,
right, and as long as you--

00:57:51.045 --> 00:57:53.420
like what people care about
when they're buying a diamond

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:55.480
is just the margin, right.

00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.400
But my point is that it doesn't
stop anyone along the supply

00:57:58.400 --> 00:57:59.120
chain to have--

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.840
It just makes it more expensive.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:03.667
But, but--

00:58:03.667 --> 00:58:05.750
GARY GENSLER: Seriously,
I think you're holding it

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.790
up to too high of a standard.

00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:11.960
Because even the oil, let's go
back, not diamonds, but oil.

00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:16.430
For quite some time you
could have a bill of lading

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:17.400
and then sell it.

00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.700
And as I mentioned
earlier for the 20 days

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:23.180
that things are coming from
the Mideast to Houston,

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:27.060
that might transact
20 times, 100 times

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:29.710
today in 2018 markets.

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:32.660
And nobody is actually looking
to see whether the oil has

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:36.680
been somehow siphoned off the
ship and it's no longer there.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:40.970
So there are aspects of
trust that would still

00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:47.170
be in the system with somebody
certifying when the ship is--

00:58:47.170 --> 00:58:49.700
I don't remember the
word, but on board,

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:53.060
when the oil is put on the
ship and when it comes off.

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:56.720
And there's validations
at those moments

00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.060
that would then communicate
to the digital records.

00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:01.310
AUDIENCE: But I guess that's--

00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:03.110
GARY GENSLER: Then you could
do that through inspections

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:03.640
of diamonds.

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.390
I don't think you're
going to change that.

00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:07.640
I think that's still
going to be important.

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.490
But what you can do is
Alean's earlier point,

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:12.830
you can lower a lot of the cost.

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:16.380
You can drive a
lot of efficiency.

00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:20.215
And you can probably lower the
fraud around the documents.

00:59:20.215 --> 00:59:20.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:59:20.840 --> 00:59:22.190
So I guess my point--

00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:24.130
one of my-- I guess
what I'm saying is--

00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:24.950
GARY GENSLER: And then
we're going to move on.

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:27.158
AUDIENCE: If the trust isn't
there in the first place

00:59:27.158 --> 00:59:30.050
or you have to rely on some
other trust, what exactly

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:31.970
is blockchain adding in
terms of the physical,

00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:34.140
the digital records?

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:36.140
That's what I'm finding
difficult to understand.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.690
But I think I'll finish
up with a quick point.

00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:41.030
I spoke to someone at the
conference from ExxonMobil,

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:43.030
since we're talking oil.

00:59:43.030 --> 00:59:45.530
And he does a supply chain and
implementation of blockchain.

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:49.650
And I challenged him, why not
use a standardized database?

00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:52.370
And he said, well, it's because
if you're going to get everyone

00:59:52.370 --> 00:59:55.760
along the chain to
upgrade to a new system,

00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:58.178
it's far easier by telling
them, oh, it's blockchain,

00:59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.720
rather than saying, well, I have
this sophisticated database.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.512
GARY GENSLER: I'm going
to hold that point.

01:00:02.512 --> 01:00:03.890
I'm agreeing with that point.

01:00:03.890 --> 01:00:05.545
But we had Dan and Jay.

01:00:05.545 --> 01:00:06.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:06.170 --> 01:00:07.700
I just want to
say, I mean, I fell

01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:11.210
like this is way more
feasible for a smaller

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:16.180
kind of vertically
integrated supply chains,

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.750
where like for
DeBeers where like

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:19.950
they own every kind of
step in the process.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:21.950
And therefore, you kind of--

01:00:21.950 --> 01:00:26.210
can really trust and trace
the flow of the product.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:30.440
But something for like
groceries where you have,

01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.670
kind of, farmers
all over the world

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:35.580
and, you know, there's
seasonality, right, changing.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.650
So there's just so many
smaller shops that I can't ever

01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.950
see it being feasible for them
to adopt kind of a high level

01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:45.590
technology.

01:00:45.590 --> 01:00:47.720
GARY GENSLER: You
may well be right,

01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:51.800
though QR codes have
been adopted in millions

01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:55.520
of retail establishments,
when 20 years ago it was kind

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.710
of like, what's this all about?

01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:59.030
In fact 30 years ago--

01:01:01.853 --> 01:01:03.770
he's in the news because
he just passed away--

01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:07.510
but President George
Herbert Walker Bush,

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:09.050
some people say
part of the reason

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:12.080
he lost the election
in 1992 was that he

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.270
didn't know what a scanner
was in a grocery store.

01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:17.090
And he was president
of the United States.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:17.965
Can you imagine that?

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:21.560
But he didn't because
he grew up in an era

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:23.990
and it was happening while
he was in the White House.

01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:28.400
And now you couldn't imagine
not knowing what a scanner is.

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.590
So I agree with you.

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:35.200
But what's happening in 20 years
is sometimes hard to predict.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.670
AUDIENCE: Yes to build
on that a little bit, I

01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:39.555
think if you are
completely vertical,

01:01:39.555 --> 01:01:41.930
then you don't really need
blockchain in the first place,

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:43.998
because you have
your own database.

01:01:43.998 --> 01:01:46.040
Your tracking everything
as it goes through that.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.540
The reason you need block chain
is for the traceability when

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.090
you have 20 different parties.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:53.690
But also once you
digitalized this whole thing,

01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:57.440
I mean, right now it's all
paperwork, so you bring it--

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.940
digitalization is
going to allow you

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.920
to use other tools like IoT.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.120
So you can maybe use--

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.610
to take the diamond
example, use computer vision

01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:07.100
to actually tell that you have
the exact diamond that you

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.920
started with at the end
of the supply chain.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.560
Or with food, that you can test
the texture of food and things

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.280
like that.

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.697
So it's all about
quality as well.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:16.363
GARY GENSLER: By the
way, you can hash--

01:02:16.363 --> 01:02:18.980
you remember that stuff, that
broccoli at the beginning?

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.960
You can use
cryptographic hashes also

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.560
to take pictures, to take
other data about the diamond,

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.650
other data about the foods.

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:29.540
AUDIENCE: I'm just going to add,
especially with the diamonds,

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.342
I got kind of razzed after
reading the article because we

01:02:32.342 --> 01:02:33.050
all know DeBeers.

01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:36.420
They're like the best
marketers out in the world.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.940
They convinced every
woman that they

01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.230
need a diamond in their life.

01:02:39.230 --> 01:02:42.380
They invented the concept of
like a diamond engagement ring.

01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.290
So I think like this is
the perfect marketing ploy

01:02:45.290 --> 01:02:49.670
to say they needed to blockchain
for diamonds, like the entire--

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:53.780
like DeBeers is the
entire diamond industry

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.420
and how they now receive
diamonds is already

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.280
completely regulated.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.780
But with regard
of about in house

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:03.440
and controlled by them
because of the backlash

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.150
against like conflict--

01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:09.830
diamonds from conflict-- or
conflict originated diamonds.

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:13.250
So for me, it just seems
like a big marketing scheme

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:17.220
that they already feel like
they have this under control.

01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:20.840
But in order to like buy
more consumer confidence,

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.590
they're using it.

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:27.170
GARY GENSLER: I think you land
upon a point about marketing.

01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.840
And James has said it earlier,
and a little bit of others

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.520
in short.

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.470
Oil executives, says,
well, it's the only way

01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:38.110
I'm going to get broad adoption
is if I call this blockchain.

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.770
And that might be true even of
the Australian stock exchange,

01:03:40.770 --> 01:03:45.210
even though I think there's
a real use case there.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.080
But it's about adoption.

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.270
Now DeBeers might be
doing it because they

01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:50.710
want to sell more diamonds.

01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:52.390
The oil executive
might be doing it

01:03:52.390 --> 01:03:54.760
because he just wants to
get rid of a legacy system.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.500
Or the Australian
stock exchange might

01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:00.850
say, this is the only way I can
get investment in getting rid

01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:03.040
of a legacy system,
because I can

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.680
either scare my
board of directors

01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.810
and say we have to
do blockchain or I

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.060
can inspire my
board of directors

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:12.370
by saying I have
to use blockchain.

01:04:12.370 --> 01:04:14.560
But nonetheless,
blockchain technology

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:16.580
will have some adoption.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:18.900
And I think it will
have more adoption,

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:20.860
so it's more ripe for adoption.

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:22.840
And I'm going to
turn to this again.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.430
You know where I'm going.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:27.710
It's like, yep, yep, you
know, cost and benefits.

01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:30.340
These are-- I'm doing this
as a favor for all of you

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.920
too because, you're all
writing your final projects.

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.310
But it's really about--

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:38.500
it's going to be where there's
multiple parties involved

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.070
in data and that data
represents some property

01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:45.560
right, either money.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.740
In a dematerialized
way, it's easier

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.520
to envision that's money
versus security, money

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:54.190
versus something dematerialized.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:57.070
It's a little harder as we've
done today on the supply chain,

01:04:57.070 --> 01:05:00.440
when it's against
a physical asset.

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:04.120
But if there's multiple parties
and where verification matters,

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.850
verification costs,
you can probably

01:05:06.850 --> 01:05:10.720
drive some efficiency with a
blockchain technology solution.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:12.310
Good question Shammon raises.

01:05:12.310 --> 01:05:13.685
Well, wait a
minute, maybe you're

01:05:13.685 --> 01:05:16.390
just shipping the data to IBM.

01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:18.130
Are you really
shipping it to just--

01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:20.920
that's called a traditional
database, a distributed

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:21.430
database.

01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:25.270
Or do you get something out
of censorship resistance?

01:05:25.270 --> 01:05:30.370
And if it's truly shared in
20, 30, 50, or 100 places,

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.980
do you lower, as the Australian
stock exchange really

01:05:32.980 --> 01:05:36.370
does believe they'll do, lower
reconciliation costs, which

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:39.002
is, again, a way to
drive efficiency.

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:40.585
But I can't remember
the number, there

01:05:40.585 --> 01:05:47.410
are 77 member companies can
all have a shared ledger

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:50.530
and then lower the
cost of reconciliation.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:52.210
It's still what
somewhat controlled.

01:05:52.210 --> 01:05:55.405
Those 77, it's not a public
blockchain like Bitcoin.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:02.160
So whether it's the two
groups that are here today

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.420
that are doing trade finance.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.878
And you have a harder challenge,
by the way, because you've

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:09.910
got to go beyond this lecture.

01:06:09.910 --> 01:06:12.670
Alpha's is going, yeah, sure.

01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:16.860
But if you're doing
commercial or consumer finance

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:19.130
or real estate or
whatever, and there

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.500
are some really interesting
projects amongst you,

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:24.060
just thinking about
where is that value add?

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.110
What verification and networking
costs are going to be lowered?

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:30.060
What's the competition doing?

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:33.180
Figure out if there's any
consortium doing whatever

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:35.470
you're proposing to do.

01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:38.220
Or is there any of the
3,000 to 5,000 white papers,

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:41.380
was there any ICO token?

01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.750
And then if you want to
do a slap down and say

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.900
why what they're doing is
foolish and doesn't work

01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:48.280
and you're doing
something better

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:51.370
or you just want to learn,
just please don't plagiarize.

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:56.470
But just look at what the
competition's doing as well.

01:06:56.470 --> 01:07:01.300
And why is an append only log,
you know, the right way to go?

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.120
Alean.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.700
AUDIENCE: What about
competitors who are incumbents?

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.940
GARY GENSLER: Absolutely.

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.910
So you're still doing the
mortgage product, right?

01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:11.950
I don't know if you changed.

01:07:11.950 --> 01:07:14.260
Yeah, what's happening
in the mortgage market?

01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:15.970
How is it being--

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:20.170
whether it's securitized
or underwritten

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:24.110
and whether it's traditional
database management.

01:07:24.110 --> 01:07:26.200
But it's also an
interesting to know

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.080
if anyone else is trying to
look at either permissioned or

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:34.460
permissionless systems and
where you fit in to that,

01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:36.200
because you're actually
trying to raise

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.520
money on this, if I remember.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:38.310 --> 01:07:39.620
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, so
to the extent that you're

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.590
going to raise money,
those venture capitalists

01:07:41.590 --> 01:07:44.690
are going to be asking tougher
questions than I'll ever

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:48.310
be asking, at least I hope.

01:07:48.310 --> 01:07:49.750
AUDIENCE: I honestly don't.

01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:50.580
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:51.080
Yeah.

01:07:51.080 --> 01:07:51.735
I got it.

01:07:51.735 --> 01:07:52.610
You want cheap money.

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:54.260
You want me to be the toughie.

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:54.760
Yeah.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.540
All right.

01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:59.480
And what are the trade-offs?

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.200
I'm not asking any
of you to have solved

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.723
scalability and performance.

01:08:02.723 --> 01:08:04.640
Some of the scalability
and performance issues

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.930
won't be solved
for 5 to 10 years.

01:08:06.930 --> 01:08:08.200
But at least note them.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.250
At least say, hey,
this won't work

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:14.120
until this is solved
or something like that.

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.930
Thursday we're going
to do identity.

01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:20.776
I can't remember, is anybody
doing projects on identity?

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:26.359
You're together, right?

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:26.859
Yeah.

01:08:26.859 --> 01:08:27.819
All right.

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:32.470
Be ready to chat on Thursday
and share where you are.

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:36.500
Kelly's looking like you're
going to be sick on Thursday.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.319
You'll be here.

01:08:38.319 --> 01:08:41.050
And how many of you are
going to get your MIT

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.399
diploma on a blockchain?

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:44.660
AUDIENCE: You have option?

01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.600
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.106
AUDIENCE: Do we get an
option of not getting one?

01:08:49.106 --> 01:08:49.843
I don't think so.

01:08:49.843 --> 01:08:51.885
GARY GENSLER: Oh, you mean
you think you have to.

01:08:51.885 --> 01:08:53.385
AUDIENCE: I think
it's done for you.

01:08:53.385 --> 01:08:54.890
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
it's done for you.

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:56.729
All right, there you go.

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:57.520
What's that?

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.689
You excited by that?

01:09:00.689 --> 01:09:04.569
Do you think you can
finance off of it though?

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:08.260
So trade finance, $17 trillion.

01:09:08.260 --> 01:09:12.729
It's a very significant
role that in financing

01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:19.490
this $17 trillion of trade,
lots of people involved,

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:22.189
sort of ripe for
blockchain technology,

01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:26.810
a lot of consortiums
and projects underway.

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:29.330
But they're almost all
permissioned systems

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:33.140
with a couple of exceptions.

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.420
But it feels like it's
a catalyst for change.

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.700
I think that even
if it's just simply

01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:41.229
because it's the
way to get adoption.

01:09:41.229 --> 01:09:43.870
And I'm talking
about trade finance.

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:47.920
And then there's this related
part of the supply chain

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.080
management and so forth.

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:52.120
Any other questions or
are we breaking early?

01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.130
AUDIENCE: Early.

01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:57.040
GARY GENSLER: Do
you want anything?

01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.270
All right, we'll break early.

01:09:58.270 --> 01:09:58.870
Great.

01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:01.320
[APPLAUSE]

[CLICKING]

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.250
PROFESSOR: Welcome back to 8.20.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.270
In this section, we're going to
talk about time, timekeeping,

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.222
and how to relate time between
two different reference point.

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:32.400
Now, let me start with a
quote by Albert Einstein.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.390
"Everything should be as simple
as possible, but not simpler."

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.240
So let's start
with this in mind.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.080
And recall that we
ended the last section

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.620
by finding that the wave
aether model doesn't really

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.160
describe electromagnetic
waves very well.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.240
We see that there is a problem
between the experiments,

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.480
specifically the one
by Michelson-Morley,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.420
and the theoretical
picture people had in mind.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.160
So Einstein approached
this in an interesting way.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.960
He simply postulated the things
he thought need to be true.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.810
He said, "The same
law of electrodynamics

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.690
will be valid for
all reference frames

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.350
where all laws of
mechanics hold good.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.790
This is the principle
of relativity."

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.420
The second postulate is that
"Light is always propagated

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.810
in empty space at the velocity
'c,' independent of the state

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.020
of motion of the emitting body."

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.870
So with these two
postulates, we will now

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.580
derive the theory of
special relativity.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.270
And again, we'll start
by talking about time.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.710
So time is suspect.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.180
And I alluded to
this already when

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.100
we looked at Galilean
transformation,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.890
where it simply, out
of our intuition,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.410
assumed that time is invariant.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.320
Now, when we now
talk about time,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.490
the viewpoint I would
like you to have

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.040
is that we want to look at
clocks from different reference

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.970
frames.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.639
We want to investigate
whether or not events

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.130
happen simultaneously or not.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.360
What does it mean?

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.990
When we make a statement like
a train arrives at 7 o'clock,

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.950
what we mean is that there
is a simultaneous-- two

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.340
simultaneous events happen.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.770
One is that this
little clock here shows

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.500
to point at seven
and 12, meaning

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.590
that it indicates to us
that-- this event indicates

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.480
to us that it's 7 o'clock.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.700
And the second event is
that the train actually

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.200
arrives at the station.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.800
So those two events
happen simultaneously.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.930
The question now
is whether or not

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.560
two observers, one
stationary and one moving,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.900
agree with this observation.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.690
And I take it away--
the answer is no.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.320
There is a relativity
of simultaneity,

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.380
meaning that two observers
can very much agree

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.430
on the description
of two events,

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.460
but not necessarily
that those two

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.000
events happen simultaneously.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.950
So let's investigate.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.320
And we use our two friends,
Alice and Bob, in order

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.736
to have this discussion.

00:03:16.736 --> 00:03:19.440
All right, so we
start from a situation

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.110
where Alice and Bob
are both stationary.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.360
Alice is on her
spacecraft, and she

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.395
has a device on her spacecraft
which shoots light or paint

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.540
balls towards two clocks.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.030
And each time this happens,
the clock ticks, right?

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:36.750
And we just look
at one situation.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.250
So she has a clock on the
left and a clock on the right.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.830
Bob observes Alice's clock.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.610
And he can compare this
observation of Alice's clock

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.530
with his own.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.290
So in this station,
as to duration,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.290
there's a TA and a TB.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.810
Those are the times
of Alice and Bob.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.470
Both are 0.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.660
This is when the
situation starts.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.460
And the capital T indicates
for Alice and for Bob

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:07.880
when they observe that
the clock has been hit.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.770
I should add here that when
we talk about observation

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.779
in this entire class, unless I
make a very explicit exception

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:22.220
to this, we don't consider the
fact that observing actually

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.610
means that light has to
be emitted from the clock

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.100
and enters Bob's
eye in order for him

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.770
to conclude that there
was something happening.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.920
The observation is like taking
an instantaneous picture.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.750
OK, so we have to
keep this in mind.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.230
But in this simple
situation, nothing is moving.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.000
We can hopefully agree
that the times being

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.600
read for Alice and Bob on
the left and the right clock

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.460
are all the same.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.190
Now, we go in the
second situation,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.910
where we use the same
device but with a paintball.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.750
So now, Alice moves and
Bob is observing her.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.600
She moves with a
relative velocity, v,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.930
and shoots off the paint
balls with a velocity, u.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.260
The velocities will add, meaning
that the answers to clocks

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.550
are initially synchronized.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.910
So there is a small tA
equals small tB equals 0.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.400
Once the clock hits,
you can hopefully

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.430
agree that Alice
and Bob will agree

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.150
that the times when the left
clock and the right clock hit

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.270
are the same, right?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.180
But now, we want to enter the
situation where we use light.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.950
So we use a phaser in
order to do the very same.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.850
So Einstein just postulated
that the speed of light

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.260
is constant, is c.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.300
And it's the same in
all reference frames.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.490
And it's independent
of the emitter,

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.420
which means that we cannot
add the velocities anymore.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.340
So the velocity, as seen
by Alice, of light is c.

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:04.350
The velocity of the same light
by the moving observer, Bob,

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.620
is also c.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.290
So here, we can conclude
that the times for Alice

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:14.130
for where the situation
is stationary, both clocks

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:16.900
will hit at the very same time.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.660
Those two events,
clock one and clock two

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.150
are hit are simultaneous.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.860
Why, for Bob, this is
clearly not the case.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:33.730
You can see here that
this lagging clock

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.790
is being hit first, while
the leading clock is

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.710
hit a little while after.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.120
So if Bob and Alice now meet
and they discuss whether or not

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.370
those two events
happened simultaneously,

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.810
they will disagree.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.800
For Alice, those two clocks
were hit simultaneously--

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.330
at the same time for her.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.530
But for Bob, the first
clock was hit first

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.900
and the leading
clock was hit second.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.800
All right, we can
conclude the two events

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.680
can be simultaneously
to one observer

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.020
but not to another one.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:13.360
This is rather confusing.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.980
And we will see
and use this fact

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.110
a few times later on when we
discuss the famous paradoxes

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.570
of special relativity.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.500
So let's look at this
in a concept question

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.810
to just make sure that
we're all on the same page.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.340
Again, we discuss
your diagram three.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.980
Alice move to the right.

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.420
Bob is the observer.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:40.150
Alice's fires her
phaser at times equal 0.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.220
Then the situation unfolds.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.950
At time TA, capital
TA, Alice observes

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:46.720
that both blocks are hit.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:50.230
At time TB1, Bob observes
that the left clock is hit.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.200
At time TB2, it's
the right clock.

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.060
Which of the following
answers is correct?

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.000
So here, you want
to stop the video

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.510
and think about which of
the answers is correct.

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.240
So moving forward,
the correct answer

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.290
is number three,
where TB1 is smaller

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.380
than TA is smaller than TB2.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.150
So again, the
leading clock lags.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.810
The leading clock
has a larger TB,

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.740
which means that clock
ticks a little slower.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.620
And again, the two events,
they can be simultaneously

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:25.580
to one observer--

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:28.310
Alice, in this case--
but not to another, Bob.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.380
All right, let's look at
clocks a little bit more

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.510
and design an optical clock.

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:39.429
So here, the situation
is as follows.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.240
We have two mirrors in
which we inject light.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.910
The light travels
up and travels down.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:47.130
And that's what
we call one clock

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.440
tick of this optical clock.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.930
The length between
the two mirrors is L.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.570
So for Alice, she has
this clock in her hand.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:09:00.450
And she can happily observe
the ticking of the clock.

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:03.000
OK, Bob observes Alice's
clock and compares it

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.430
with his own identical clock.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.650
There's a relative speed
between Alice and Bob,

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:11.230
and that's v in x direction.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:15.210
Now, the task for you is to
relate the clock ticks which

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.570
are observed by Bob and
the ones which are observed

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.480
by Alice in Alice's clock.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:25.800
So again, stop the video
and work out the algebra.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.380
The answer is going to
be, again, surprising.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:36.230
So if you do this now,
we find this picture.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.660
So we calculate how long
does a clock tick take.

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:42.020
The light has to travel
to L with a velocity c.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.360
So the clock tick is 2L over c.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.640
The length can be expressed
as c times t delta tA over 2.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.220
For Bob's, the situation is a
little bit more complicated.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:57.290
And we have to use Pythagoras in
order to calculate the length.

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.570
So we define that the length
the light has to travel

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:02.870
is D, then the delta
tB as Bob observes

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:06.080
this is 2 times D over c.

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.390
Again, for Bob,
the light travels

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.740
with the speed of light.

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.020
Einstein just postulated it.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:15.080
And then we find the length
as expressed to the time

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.430
as c times delta tB over 2.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:22.750
The length in x is simply given
by the relative velocity, v,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.690
times the time it takes
for the clock to tick--

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:27.640
v times delta tB.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:33.010
So then we can express D square
via L squared plus x squared

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:36.380
over 4 and use those
expressions here.

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:40.370
So we just use this for L,
this for D, and this 4x,

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:42.970
we find this expression here.

00:10:42.970 --> 00:10:43.780
All right.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.780
And then we solve
this for delta tB.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.740
And we find the relation
between delta tB and delta tA

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.010
and can find that it's
1 over square root

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.470
1 minus v squared
over c squared,

00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:58.930
which is the Lorentz factor.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.590
So we just used a simple
clock and Einstein's postulate

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.410
derived time dilation.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:11.020
We find that for Bob, Alice's
moving clock moves slower.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:15.000
Great.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.230
So again, gamma is
1 over square root 1

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:20.790
minus v squared over c squared.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.500
We often use, in short, beta
as a relativistic velocity.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:29.670
It's unitless and
defined as v over c.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.580
gamma is always
greater or equal to 1.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.260
And it's mostly
one for everything

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.950
we observe in nature.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:39.600
So in one of the p
sets and also here,

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.960
I invite you to simply
calculate values

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.040
for gamma for things you might
think are fast-moving objects.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:49.140
So we start with a fighter jet.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:51.480
We look at the
International Space Station,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.550
the Earth around the sun, the
particle which almost moves

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.480
with the speed of light, and
the proton at the Large Hadron

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.660
Collider, which is only 3
meters per second slower

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.860
than the speed of light.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.360
So again, stop the video
and work out those numbers.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:09.770
You will need a
calculator for that.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.950
So if I do this, I
find for this very,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:17.830
very fast F15 fighter jet,
which moves with speeds of 2,680

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.130
kilometers per hour, that
the number for gamma is

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:31.210
1.00000000000, which
is 11 zeros, 3.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.660
So we find this very, very
small number or number

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.090
which is very, very close to 1.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.460
The duration for the
International Space Station

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:40.480
changes a bit--

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.185
only 9 zeros.

00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:43.810
For the Earth around
the sun, the Earth

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.210
is really, really fast,
travels a long distance.

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.880
Every year, we travel
once around the sun.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.440
And you know, every
year you get older.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.830
You have a lot of
mileage on your back.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:55.750
Here, you have eight zeros.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.960
Particle which moves with
0.9 times the speed of light,

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.410
here the gamma factor is
very different from one.

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:03.580
It's 2.3.

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.710
And the protons we
have at the LHC,

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:07.930
they have a gamma
factor of 7,000.

00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:10.570
So you see, once you get
close to the speed of light,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.562
the gamma factor
approaches large numbers.

00:13:14.562 --> 00:13:17.080
And that's where our
relativistic effects really

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.750
are visible.

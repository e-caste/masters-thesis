MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.450
So if there is a
time dilation effect

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.480
due to gravitational
fields, then there's

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.930
also a redshift which is
of gravitational fields.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.760
So a consequence
of time dilation

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.070
is a change in the
light frequency.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.790
And I asked you to estimate
the magnitude of this effect.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.370
And the example you want to
use is the one shown here.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.020
So you have a tower just--

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.800
not randomly, but 22
and 1/2 meters tall.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.860
And a light beam is sent down.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.020
Basically, the tower is
built on this planet,

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
and there's gravity
that's acting.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.180
So this is basically an
accelerating reference frame.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.520
The length of the tower
is, again, 22 meters.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.980
And I would like you
to just get a feeling.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.520
How big can this effect be,
the effect of redshift here?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.750
So please, try to work this out.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.570
The way to think about
this is first to say, OK,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.025
now the light--

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:17.010
the delta t equals
the light to travel--

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.580
is l divided by c.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.890
The speed of light is c.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.630
The length is l.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.580
The change in velocity
is g, acceleration,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.070
times l divided by c.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.460
So the Doppler shift then is the
frequency, the new frequency,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.980
divided by the
initial frequency.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.290
And that can be approximated
by 1 plus delta v over c.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.520
So we find that it's 1 plus
g times l over c square.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.880
Now the speed of
light is pretty fast,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.870
3 times 10 to the
9 meter per second.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.140
And this distance is
only 22 and 1/2 meters.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.260
So we find that this is a
tiny, tiny, tiny effect.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.730
But nevertheless,
experimentalists at Harvard

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.780
tested this effect.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.910
So Pound, Rebka, and Snider
in the 1950s and '60s

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.560
were able to show
this very tiny effect.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.340
You want to know
more about this,

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.050
you can, for example, look up a
small description in Wikipedia

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.670
here.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.860
But there's quite
some literature

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.240
on those experimental
tests [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.890
There's even a little
bit more that we can

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.560
learn about our energy diagram.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:15.280
And I'd like to just clean this
diagram up for a little second,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.320
because I want to
work in this area.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.200
Suppose our system, because
the work non-conservative is 0,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:29.860
tells us that the mechanical
energy is constant.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.570
Now we don't know how much
mechanical energy our system

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.070
is.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.780
That's a constant of the system.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.010
But let's just suppose
that our mechanical energy

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.730
is written like that.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.940
And we'll just
clean up a little,

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.270
give ourselves a little space.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.140
So here is the mechanical
energy of the system,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.160
and that's a constant.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.510
And now we can talk about
two more special points.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.380
A point over here,
and at this point,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.560
let's just think about what
our mechanical energy tells us.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.530
This is a special point,
but let's begin with one

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.510
right here.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.970
If our particle is
at this location,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.690
then this represents
the potential energy

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.520
and the difference between the
energy and the potential energy

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.840
is the kinetic energy.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.420
So this here represents
the kinetic energy.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.920
And now we can
ask ourselves what

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.670
would happen to the energies
as our particle is moving?

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.340
So if we start right here,
the kinetic energy is 0.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.620
Because all the
potential energy,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.750
all the energy is potential.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.450
And as a particle
starts to move,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.590
let's say it has a
little bit of energy.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.760
It starts to move
in this direction.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.250
Then the kinetic energy
starts to increase

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.020
until we get to this point,
where the kinetic energy is

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.930
maximum at the
stable equilibrium

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.060
point where the force is 0.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.290
Now the kinetic energy
decreases because remember,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.650
it's now going
against the force.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.020
The side the force was
pointing in that direction.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.340
Here it was in the
other direction.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.550
And until we finally
get to this point

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.660
where, again, the
energy of system

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.329
is equal to all
potential energy,

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.790
and so there is
no kinetic energy.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.930
So I'll call this
point A, and I'll

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.440
refer to this point
over here, diagram

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.550
is getting a little
crowded, as B.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.930
And those points
A and B are what

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.235
we call the turnaround points.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.380
And they represent the places
where the kinetic energy at XA

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.750
is equal to the kinetic
energy at XB, which is 0.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.530
Now the last thing
that we like--

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.110
there's a lot of
information, as you can see,

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.630
contained in these
energy diagrams.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.070
And the last bit of information
that we'd like to ask ourselves

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.570
is what would happen if
instead of having-- confining

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.760
our system to this area, we
increased our mechanical energy

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.190
so we're up here.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.680
And let's just
follow qualitatively

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.190
the motion of a
particle that begins

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.020
say, over here, with a
little bit of kinetic energy

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.310
and potential energy.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.930
And if the particle starts
off with the velocity

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.150
in the positive x
direction, then it's

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.100
going to move in this direction.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.450
And you can see the kinetic
energy is increasing.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.990
Here we have a maximum
amount of kinetic energy.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.620
But notice that over
here the particle still

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.709
has some positive
kinetic energy,

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.440
and so it can get
over this hill.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.260
And when it gets
to the other side,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.630
the force was in the
positive direction.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.780
It increases its kinetic
energy, and it goes off

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.560
to what we're referring
to as infinity.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.820
So one analogy that
people like to make

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.650
is to understand the motion,
think of a marble that's

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.360
rolling down a hill.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.230
And this is just a metaphor for
this potential energy function.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.850
As the marble rolls down the
hill, it gains kinetic energy.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.890
It loses potential energy.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.500
It comes maximum at
the bottom of the hill.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.280
As it goes up the hill, it
still has enough kinetic energy

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.970
to get over the top of
the hill and to start

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.360
to come down the other side.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.250
And of course, our
particle can never

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.900
get to the speed of light.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.476
So our model has to
break off at one point.

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:23.550
PROFESSOR: Today
we're going to study

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.030
stochastic processes and,
among them, one type of it,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.990
so discrete time.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.340
We'll focus on discrete time.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.920
And I'll talk about
what it is right now.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.100
So a stochastic
process is a collection

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:56.070
of random variables indexed by
time, a very simple definition.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.880
So we have either-- let's
start from 0-- random variables

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.760
like this, or we have random
variables given like this.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.730
So a time variable
can be discrete,

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.590
or it can be continuous.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.310
These ones, we'll call
discrete-time stochastic

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.030
processes, and these
ones continuous-time.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.505
So for example, a
discrete-time random variable

00:01:35.505 --> 00:01:46.320
can be something
like-- and so on.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.010
So these are the values, X_0,
X_1, X_2, X_3, and so on.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.720
And they are random variables.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.330
This is just one--
so one realization

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.810
of the stochastic process.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.290
But all these variables
are supposed to be random.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.255
And then a continuous-time
random variable--

00:02:04.255 --> 00:02:06.585
a continuous-time
stochastic process

00:02:06.585 --> 00:02:09.350
can be something like that.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.440
And it doesn't have to be
continuous, so it can jump

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.410
and it can jump and so on.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.356
And all these values
are random values.

00:02:23.478 --> 00:02:27.300
So that's just a very
informal description.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.066
And a slightly
different point of view,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:31.440
which is slightly
preferred, when

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.550
you want to do
some math with it,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:44.340
is that-- alternative
definition--

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:57.550
it's a probability
distribution over paths,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.460
over a space of paths.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.260
So you have all a
bunch of possible paths

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.574
that you can take.

00:03:12.574 --> 00:03:14.490
And you're given some
probability distribution

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.980
over it.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.570
And then that will
be one realization.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.540
Another realization will look
something different and so on.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.970
So this one-- it's more
intuitive definition,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.710
the first one, that it's a
collection of random variables

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.030
indexed by time.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.125
But that one, if you want
to do some math with it,

00:03:31.125 --> 00:03:33.760
from the formal point of view,
that will be more helpful.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.870
And you'll see why
that's the case later.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.460
So let me show you
some more examples.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.500
For example, to describe
one stochastic process,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.910
this is one way to describe
a stochastic process.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.780
t with-- let me show you
three stochastic processes,

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.540
so number one, f(t) equals t.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.145
And this was probability 1.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.930
Number 2, f(t) is
equal to t, for all t,

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:20.550
with probability 1/2, or f(t)
is equal to minus t, for all t,

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.880
with probability 1/2.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:30.470
And the third one
is, for each t,

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.610
f(t) is equal to t or minus
t, with probability 1/2.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.560
The first one is
quite easy to picture.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.140
It's really just-- there's
nothing random in here.

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.700
This happens with probability 1.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.631
Your path just
says f(t) equals t.

00:04:52.631 --> 00:04:54.880
And we're only looking at t
greater than or equal to 0

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.840
here.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.350
So that's number 1.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:10.180
Number 2, it's either
this one or this one.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.209
So it is a stochastic process.

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:14.250
If you think about it this
way, it doesn't really

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.010
look like a stochastic process.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.330
But under the
alternative definition,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.820
you have two possible
paths that you can take.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.540
You either take this path, with
1/2, or this path, with 1/2.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.130
Now, at each point,
t, your value X(t)

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.930
is a random variable.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.530
It's either t or minus t.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.230
And it's the same for all t.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.659
But they are dependent
on each other.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.450
So if you know one
value, you automatically

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.785
know all the other values.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.760
And the third one is
even more interesting.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.840
Now, for each t, we get
rid of this dependency.

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.970
So what you'll have is
these two lines going on.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.150
I mean at every
single point, you'll

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.310
be either a top one
or a bottom one.

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.310
But if you really
want draw the picture,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.230
it will bounce back and forth,
up and down, infinitely often,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.770
and it'll just look
like two lines.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.880
So I hope this gives
you some feeling

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.220
about stochastic
processes, I mean,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.100
why we want to describe it in
terms of this language, just

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.250
a tiny bit.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.900
Any questions?

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.730
So, when you look
at a process, when

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.460
you use a stochastic
process to model a real life

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.700
something going on, like a stock
price, usually what happens

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.660
is you stand at time t.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.380
And you know all the
values in the past-- know.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.714
And in the future,
you don't know.

00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:54.380
But you want to know
something about it.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.650
You want to have some
intelligent conclusion,

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.500
intelligent information about
the future, based on the past.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.682
For this stochastic
process, it's easy.

00:07:06.682 --> 00:07:08.390
No matter where you
stand at, you exactly

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.130
know what's going to
happen in the future.

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.910
For this one, it's
also the same.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.750
Even though it's
random, once you

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.650
know what happened
at some point,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.250
you know it has to be this
distribution or this line,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.820
if it's here, and this
line if it's there.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.050
But that one is
slightly different.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.260
No matter what you
know about the past,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.160
even if know all the values
in the past, what happened,

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.360
it doesn't give any information
at all about the future.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.850
Though it's not true if I
say any information at all.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:43.160
We know that each value
has to be t or minus t.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.730
You just don't know what it is.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:49.880
So when you're given
a stochastic process

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.150
and you're standing at
some time, your future,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.270
you don't know what the future
is, but most of the time

00:07:57.270 --> 00:08:00.300
you have at least
some level of control

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.010
given by the probability
distribution.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.180
Here, it was, you can
really determine the line.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.120
Here, because of probability
distribution, at each point,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.280
only gives t or minus t,
you know that each of them

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.820
will be at least
one of the points,

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:16.390
but you don't know
more than that.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.240
So the study of
stochastic processes

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.890
is, basically, you look at the
given probability distribution,

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:30.000
and you want to say something
intelligent about the future

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.600
as t goes on.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.260
So there are three
types of questions

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:37.549
that we mainly study here.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:50.865
So (a), first type, is
what are the dependencies

00:08:50.865 --> 00:08:53.330
in the sequence of values.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.720
For example, if
you know the price

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.430
of a stock on all past
dates, up to today, can

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:12.140
you say anything intelligent
about the future stock prices--

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:15.140
those type of questions.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:28.350
And (b) is what is the long
term behavior of the sequence?

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:30.370
So think about the
law of large numbers

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:37.560
that we talked about last
time or central limit theorem.

00:09:43.774 --> 00:09:48.445
And the third type, this one is
less relevant for our course,

00:09:48.445 --> 00:09:51.602
but, still, I'll
just write it down.

00:09:51.602 --> 00:09:52.810
What are the boundary events?

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.480
How often will something
extreme happen,

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.370
like how often will a stock
price drop by more than 10%

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.340
for a consecutive 5 days--
like these kind of events.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.600
How often will that happen?

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.400
And for a different example,
like if you model a call center

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.760
and you want to know,
over a period of time,

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.750
the probability that at least
90% of the phones are idle

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:31.096
or those kind of things.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.210
So that's was an introduction.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:39.860
Any questions?

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.010
Then there are really lots
of stochastic processes.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:59.005
One of the most important ones
is the simple random walk.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.360
So today, I will focus on
discrete-time stochastic

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.510
processes.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.280
Later in the course, we'll go
on to continuous-time stochastic

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.610
processes.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.700
And then you'll see
like Brownian motions

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.600
and-- what else-- Ito's
lemma and all those things

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.960
will appear later.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.190
Right now, we'll
study discrete time.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:34.360
And later, you'll see that
it's really just-- what is it--

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.610
they're really parallel.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.090
So this simple
random walk, you'll

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.010
see the corresponding thing
in continuous-time stochastic

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:43.680
processes later.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.920
So I think it's
easier to understand

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.950
discrete-time processes,
that's why we start with it.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.180
But later, it will really help
if you understand it well.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.070
Because for continuous
time, it will just

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:56.830
carry over all the knowledge.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.010
What is a simple random walk?

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:12.370
Let Y_i be IID, independent
identically distributed,

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:19.220
random variables, taking
values 1 or minus 1,

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.220
each with probability 1/2.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:35.180
Then define, for each time
t, X sub t as the sum of Y_i,

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.244
from i equals 1 to t.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.350
Then the sequence of
random variables-- and X_0

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:52.250
is equal to 0-- X0,
X1, X2, and so on

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.350
is called a one-dimensional
simple random walk.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.370
But I'll just refer to
it as simple random walk

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:59.590
or random walk.

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:04.500
And this is a definition.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:13.499
It's called simple random walk.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:31.551
Let's try to plot it.

00:13:35.239 --> 00:13:40.000
At time 0, we start at 0.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.600
And then, depending
on the value of Y1,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.740
you will either
go up or go down.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.760
Let's say we went up.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.800
So that's at time 1.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.050
Then at time 2, depending
on your value of Y2,

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:56.430
you will either go
up one step from here

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:59.670
or go down one step from there.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:08.740
Let's say we went up
again, down, 4, up, up,

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:09.953
something like that.

00:14:09.953 --> 00:14:11.432
And it continues.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.910
Another way to look at it-- the
reason we call it a random walk

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:28.470
is, if you just plot your values
of X_t, over time, on a line,

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:33.700
then you start at 0, you go to
the right, right, left, right,

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.515
right, left, left, left.

00:14:35.515 --> 00:14:39.190
So the trajectory is like a
walk you take on this line,

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:40.375
but it's random.

00:14:40.375 --> 00:14:41.750
And each time you
go to the right

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.900
or left, right or
left, right or left.

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:48.310
So that was two representations.

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:51.100
This picture looks a
little bit more clear.

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.770
Here, I just lost
everything I draw.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:57.115
Something like that
is the trajectory.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:03.214
So from what we
learned last time,

00:15:03.214 --> 00:15:04.880
we can already say
something intelligent

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:08.370
about the simple random walk.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:16.050
For example, if you apply
central limit theorem

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:20.230
to the sequence, what is
the information you get?

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:29.300
So over a long time, let's
say t is way, far away,

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:38.094
like a huge number,
a very large number,

00:15:38.094 --> 00:15:43.070
what can you say about the
distribution of this at time t?

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.244
AUDIENCE: Is it close to 0?

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:46.160
PROFESSOR: Close to 0.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.610
But by close to 0,
what do you mean?

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:51.430
There should be a scale.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.500
I mean some would say
that 1 is close to 0.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.395
Some people would say
that 100 is close to 0,

00:15:57.395 --> 00:16:02.710
so do you have some degree
of how close it will be to 0?

00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:09.850
Anybody?

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.350
AUDIENCE: So variance
will be small.

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.830
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:13.371
AUDIENCE: The variance
will be small.

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:14.930
PROFESSOR: Variance
will be small.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.210
About how much will
the variance be?

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:18.027
AUDIENCE: 1 over n.

00:16:18.027 --> 00:16:18.860
PROFESSOR: 1 over n.

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:19.732
1 over n?

00:16:19.732 --> 00:16:20.616
AUDIENCE: Over t.

00:16:20.616 --> 00:16:21.527
PROFESSOR: 1 over t?

00:16:21.527 --> 00:16:23.110
Anybody else want
to have a different?

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:26.526
PROFESSOR: 1 over square
root t probably would.

00:16:26.526 --> 00:16:26.962
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:26.962 --> 00:16:28.270
AUDIENCE: The variance
would be [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:29.250
PROFESSOR: Oh,
you're right, sorry.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.542
Variance will be 1 over t.

00:16:33.846 --> 00:16:38.830
And the standard deviation will
be 1 over square root of t.

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:41.264
What I'm saying is, by
central limit theorem.

00:16:41.264 --> 00:16:42.180
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.910
Are you looking at the sums
or are you looking at the?

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.220
PROFESSOR: I'm
looking at the X_t.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.510
Ah.

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:51.610
That's a very good point.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.060
t and square root of t.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:54.560
Thank you.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:56.054
AUDIENCE: That's very different.

00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:58.544
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
very, very different.

00:16:58.544 --> 00:17:01.530
I was confused.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.030
Sorry about that.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.930
The reason is because X_t, 1
over the square root of t times

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.579
X_t-- we saw last
time that this,

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:13.510
if t is really,
really large, this

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:19.760
is close to the normal
distribution, 0,1.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:24.089
So if you just look at it,
X_t over the square root of t

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.650
will look like
normal distribution.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:32.590
That means the value, at
t, will be distributed

00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:35.030
like a normal
distribution, with mean 0

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.210
and variance square root of t.

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:39.160
So what you said was right.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.270
It's close to 0.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:45.520
And the scale you're looking at
is about the square root of t.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.010
So it won't go too
far away from 0.

00:17:54.640 --> 00:18:03.021
That means, if you draw these
two curves, square root of t

00:18:03.021 --> 00:18:08.260
and minus square root of t, your
simple random walk, on a very

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:17.400
large scale, won't like go too
far away from these two curves.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.860
Even though the
extreme values it

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:24.530
can take-- I didn't draw it
correctly-- is t and minus

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.935
t, because all values can be 1
or all values can be minus 1.

00:18:28.935 --> 00:18:32.440
Even though,
theoretically, you can

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.654
be that far away
from your x-axis,

00:18:35.654 --> 00:18:37.070
in reality, what's
going to happen

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.000
is you're going to be
really close to this curve.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.156
You're going to play
within this area, mostly.

00:18:47.362 --> 00:18:48.820
AUDIENCE: I think
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.970
PROFESSOR: So, yeah, that
was a very vague statement.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.750
You won't deviate too much.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.030
So if you take 100
square root of t,

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.260
you will be inside this
interval like 90% of the time.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.530
If you take this to be 10,000
times square root of t,

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.880
almost 99.9% or
something like that.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.390
And there's even
a theorem saying

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:20.700
you will hit these two
lines infinitely often.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.880
So if you go over time, a
very long period, for a very,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:29.090
very long, you live long enough,
then, even if you go down here.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.010
Even, in this picture, you
might think, OK, in some cases,

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.510
it might be the
case that you always

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.110
play in the negative region.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.550
But there's a theorem saying
that that's not the case.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.670
With probability 1,
if you go to infinity,

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:45.150
you will cross this
line infinitely often.

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:48.000
And in fact, you will meet these
two lines infinitely often.

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:53.959
So those are some
interesting things

00:19:53.959 --> 00:19:55.000
about simple random walk.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.855
Really, there are lot
more interesting things,

00:19:57.855 --> 00:20:04.108
but I'm just giving an
overview, in this course, now.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.866
Unfortunately, I can't talk
about all of these fun stuffs.

00:20:11.866 --> 00:20:18.900
But let me still try to show
you some properties and one

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.060
nice computation on it.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:31.990
So some properties of a random
walk, first, expectation of X_k

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.610
is equal to 0.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:36.040
That's really easy to prove.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.765
Second important property is
called independent increment.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:56.820
So if look at these times,
t_0, t_1, up to t_k,

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:05.830
then random variables X sub
t_i+1 minus X sub t_i are

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.815
mutually independent.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.880
So what this says
is, if you look

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.086
at what happens
from time 1 to 10,

00:21:18.086 --> 00:21:22.570
that is irrelevant to what
happens from 20 to 30.

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.075
And that can easily be
shown by the definition.

00:21:27.075 --> 00:21:32.510
I won't do that, but we'll
try to do it as an exercise.

00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:35.970
Third one is called stationary,
so it has the property.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:44.910
That means, for all h
greater or equal to 0,

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:50.171
and t greater than or equal to
0-- h is actually equal to 1--

00:21:50.171 --> 00:22:03.270
the distribution of X_(t+h)
minus X_t is the same

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:15.610
as the distribution of X sub h.

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:18.160
And again, this easily
follows from the definition.

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:24.280
What it says is, if you look
at the same amount of time,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.590
then what happens
inside this interval

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.530
is irrelevant of
your starting point.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.090
The distribution is the same.

00:22:35.090 --> 00:22:38.280
And moreover, from
the first part,

00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:43.630
if these intervals do not
overlap, they're independent.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.120
So those are the two properties
that we're talking here.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.120
And you'll see these properties
appearing again and again.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.640
Because stochastic processes
having these properties

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.530
are really good, in some sense.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:00.910
They are fundamental
stochastic processes.

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:03.757
And simple random walk is like
the fundamental stochastic

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:04.256
process.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:12.770
So let's try to see
one interesting problem

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.061
about simple random walk.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:27.770
So example, you play a game.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:29.940
It's like a coin toss game.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.500
I play with, let's say, Peter.

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.460
So I bet $1 at each turn.

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.360
And then Peter tosses
a coin, a fair coin.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.660
It's either heads or tails.

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.340
If it's heads, he wins.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.620
He wins the $1.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.110
If it's tails, I win.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:48.530
I win $1.

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:55.040
So from my point of view,
in this coin toss game,

00:23:55.040 --> 00:24:08.880
at each turn my balance
goes up by $1 or down by $1.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:17.060
And now, let's say I
started from $0.00 balance,

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:19.630
even though that's not possible.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:24.060
Then my balance will exactly
follow the simple random walk,

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:30.360
assuming that the coin it's
a fair coin, 50-50 chance.

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.940
Then my balance is a
simple random walk.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.797
And then I say the following.

00:24:43.797 --> 00:24:44.380
You know what?

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.130
I'm going to play.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.980
I want to make money.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:55.850
So I'm going to play until
I win $100 or I lose $100.

00:24:55.850 --> 00:25:08.780
So let's say I play until
I win $100 or I lose $100.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.070
What is the probability that I
will stop after winning $100?

00:25:17.544 --> 00:25:18.520
AUDIENCE: 1/2.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.474
PROFESSOR: 1/2 because?

00:25:20.474 --> 00:25:21.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.830
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:29.201
So happens with 1/2, 1/2.

00:25:29.201 --> 00:25:30.200
And this is by symmetry.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:36.330
Because every chain
of coin toss which

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:39.160
gives a winning sequence,
when you flip it,

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.956
it will give a losing sequence.

00:25:40.956 --> 00:25:42.730
We have one-to-one
correspondence

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.790
between those two things.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.820
That was good.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:48.850
Now if I change it.

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:53.560
What if I say I will
win $100 or I lose $50?

00:25:56.762 --> 00:26:08.126
What if I play until
win $100 or lose $50?

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.510
In other words, I look
at the random walk,

00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:18.710
I look at the first
time that it hits

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:23.230
either this line or it hits
this line, and then I stop.

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:31.660
What is the probability that I
will stop after winning $100?

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.170
PROFESSOR: 1/3?

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.150
Let me see.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.190
Why 1/3?

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.106
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:11.915
PROFESSOR: So you're saying,
hitting this probability is p.

00:27:11.915 --> 00:27:17.130
And the probability that you
hit this first is p, right?

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:19.080
It's 1/2, 1/2.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.160
But you're saying from
here, it's the same.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:25.584
So it should be 1/4
here, 1/2 times 1/2.

00:27:27.934 --> 00:27:29.100
You've got a good intuition.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.484
It is 1/3, actually.

00:27:31.484 --> 00:27:32.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.680
PROFESSOR: And then
once you hit it,

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.450
it's like the same afterwards?

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.087
I'm not sure if there is a way
to make an argument out of it.

00:27:51.087 --> 00:27:51.920
I really don't know.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.480
There might be or
there might not be.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.180
I'm not sure.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.980
I was thinking of
a different way.

00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:59.080
But yeah, there might be a way
to make an argument out of it.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.610
I just don't see it right now.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:06.290
So in general, if you put
a line B and a line A,

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:11.662
then probability of hitting
B first is A over A plus B.

00:28:11.662 --> 00:28:16.384
And the probability of
hitting this line-- minus A--

00:28:16.384 --> 00:28:23.520
is B over A plus B. And so, in
this case, if it's 100 and 50,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:27.200
it's 100 over 150, that's
2/3 and that's 1/3.

00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:33.250
This can be proved.

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.642
It's actually not that
difficult to prove it.

00:28:35.642 --> 00:28:37.850
I mean it's hard to find
the right way to look at it.

00:29:00.802 --> 00:29:19.140
So fix your B and A. And
for each k between minus A

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:27.490
and B define f of k as the
probability that you'll

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:31.320
hit-- what is it--
this line first,

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:38.830
and the probability that
you hit the line B first

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:46.010
when you start at k.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.554
So it kind of points
out what you're saying.

00:29:48.554 --> 00:29:50.720
Now, instead of looking at
one fixed starting point,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.525
we're going to change
our starting point

00:29:52.525 --> 00:29:55.290
and look at all possible ways.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:58.570
So when you start at
k, I'll define f of k

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.560
as the probability that
you hit this line first

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.490
before hitting that line.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.520
What we are interested
in is computing f(0).

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.595
What we know is f of B is
equal to 1, f of minus A

00:30:14.595 --> 00:30:15.770
is equal to 0.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.430
And then actually, there's
one recursive formula

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.670
that matters to us.

00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:34.500
If you start at f(k), you
either go up or go down.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.550
You go up with probability 1/2.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.760
You go down with
probability 1/2.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:40.950
And now it starts again.

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:46.340
Because of this-- which one
is it-- stationary property.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:49.850
So starting from
here, the probability

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:54.690
that you hit B first is
exactly f of k plus 1.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.800
So if you go up, the
probability that you hit B first

00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.690
is f of k plus 1.

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:03.012
If you go down,
it's f of k minus 1.

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.510
And then that gives
you a recursive formula

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:09.990
with two boundary values.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:12.970
If you look at it,
you can solve it.

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:17.180
When you solve it,
you'll get that answer.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:20.070
So I won't go into details,
but what I wanted to show

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:23.770
is that simple random walk is
really this property, these two

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:24.840
properties.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.120
It has these properties and
even more powerful properties.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.200
So it's really easy to control.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.080
And at the same time
it's quite universal.

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:36.790
It can model-- like it's
not a very weak model.

00:31:36.790 --> 00:31:43.280
It's rather restricted, but
it's a really good model

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.880
for like a mathematician.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.300
From the practical
point of view,

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.560
you'll have to twist some
things slightly and so on.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.800
But in many cases,
you can approximate it

00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.830
by simple random walk.

00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:04.885
And as you can see, you
can do computations,

00:32:04.885 --> 00:32:06.500
with simple random
walk, by hand.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:11.985
So that was it.

00:32:11.985 --> 00:32:14.119
I talked about the
most important example

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:15.035
of stochastic process.

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:23.780
Now, let's talk about
more stochastic processes.

00:32:27.629 --> 00:32:31.701
The second one is
called the Markov chain.

00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:34.376
Let me write that
part, actually.

00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:52.180
So Markov chain, unlike
the simple random walk,

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.775
is not a single
stochastic process.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:33:00.000
A stochastic process is
called a Markov chain

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.110
if has some property.

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:05.690
And what we want to
capture in Markov chain

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:09.690
is the following statement.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:17.090
These are a collection of
stochastic processes having

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:32.660
the property that-- whose
effect of the past on the future

00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:39.077
is summarized only
by the current state.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.840
That's quite a vague statement.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:59.620
But what we're trying to
capture here is-- now,

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:05.840
look at some generic
stochastic process at time t.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.260
You know all the
history up to time t.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.280
You want to say something
about the future.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.949
Then, if it's a Markov
chain, what it's saying is,

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.699
you don't even have
know all about this.

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.199
Like this part is
really irrelevant.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:27.853
What matters is the value at
this last point, last time.

00:34:27.853 --> 00:34:30.600
So if it's a Markov
chain, you don't

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.480
have to know all this history.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.889
All you have to know
is this single value.

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:37.949
And all of the effect of
the past on the future

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:40.679
is contained in this value.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.190
Nothing else matters.

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:44.000
Of course, this is
a very special type

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.690
of stochastic process.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:47.830
Most other stochastic
processes, the future

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:51.060
will depend on
the whole history.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.480
And in that case, it's
more difficult to analyze.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.280
But these ones are
more manageable.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.250
And still, lots of
interesting things

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:00.380
turn out to be Markov chains.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.080
So if you look at
simple random walk,

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:06.310
it is a Markov chain, right?

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:14.680
So simple random walk, let's
say you went like that.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:20.160
Then what happens after
time t really just depends

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:23.460
on how high this point is at.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.580
What happened before
doesn't matter at all.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:29.070
Because we're just having
new coin tosses every time.

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:31.155
But this value can
affect the future,

00:35:31.155 --> 00:35:32.530
because that's
where you're going

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.990
to start your process from.

00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:38.240
Like that's where you're
starting your process.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.590
So that is a Markov chain.

00:35:41.590 --> 00:35:42.790
This part is irrelevant.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.412
Only the value matters.

00:35:45.412 --> 00:35:47.370
So let me define it a
little bit more formally.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:27.814
A discrete-time stochastic
process is a Markov chain

00:36:27.814 --> 00:36:36.230
if the probability that
X at some time, t plus 1,

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:43.230
is equal to
something, some value,

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:49.830
given the whole
history up to time n,

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:55.810
is equal to the probability that
X_(t+1) is equal to that value,

00:36:55.810 --> 00:37:04.950
given the value X sub n for all
n greater than or equal to-- t

00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:10.260
greater than or
equal to 0 and all s.

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.990
This is a mathematical
way of writing down this.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:20.690
The value at X_(t+1), given
all the values up to time t,

00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:23.830
is the same as the
value at time t plus 1,

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:26.993
the probability of it,
given only the last value.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:41.750
And the reason simple random
walk is a Markov chain

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.560
is because both of
them are just 1/2.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.920
I mean, if it's for--
let me write it down.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:59.470
So example: random walk.

00:38:03.943 --> 00:38:10.420
Probability that X_(t+1)
equal to s, given--

00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:20.096
t is equal to 1/2, if s is equal
X_t plus 1, or X_t minus 1,

00:38:20.096 --> 00:38:21.436
and 0 otherwise.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:30.185
So it really depends only
on the last value of X_t.

00:38:30.185 --> 00:38:31.870
Any questions?

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:32.910
All right.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:39.350
If there is case
when you're looking

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:41.610
at a stochastic
process, a Markov chain,

00:38:41.610 --> 00:38:50.020
and all X_i have values
in some set S, which

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:59.120
is finite, a finite
set, in that case,

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.640
it's really easy to
describe Markov chains.

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:09.360
So now denote the
probability i, j

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:15.530
as the probability
that, if at that time t

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.520
you are at i, the
probability that you

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:33.942
jump to j at time t plus 1
for all pair of points i, j.

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.530
I mean, it's a finite set,
so I might just as well

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:45.160
call it the integer
set from 1 to m,

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.490
just to make the
notation easier.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:57.710
Then, first of all, if you
sum over all j in S, P_(i,j),

00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:59.216
that is equal to 1.

00:39:59.216 --> 00:40:01.060
Because if you
start at i, you'll

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.770
have to jump to somewhere
in your next step.

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.650
So if you sum over all
possible states you can have,

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.680
you have to sum up to 1.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.690
And really, a very
interesting thing

00:40:12.690 --> 00:40:16.620
is this matrix, called
the transition probability

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:24.740
matrix, defined as.

00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:40.540
So we put P_(i,j) at
i-th row and j-th column.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.130
And really, this
tells you everything

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.640
about the Markov chain.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.540
Everything about the
stochastic process

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:47.900
is contained in this matrix.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:02.070
That's because a
future state only

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.550
depends on the current state.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:08.210
So if you know what happens at
time t, where it's at time t,

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.800
you look at the
matrix, you can decode

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.030
all the information you want.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.990
What is the probability that
it will be at-- let's say,

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.824
it's at 0 right now.

00:41:15.824 --> 00:41:17.281
What's the probability
that it will

00:41:17.281 --> 00:41:18.410
jump to 1 at the next time?

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.180
Just look at 0 comma 1, here.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:23.040
There is no 0, 1,
here, so it's 1 and 2.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.690
Just look at 1 and
2, 1 and 2, i and j.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:29.814
Actually, I made a mistake.

00:41:37.074 --> 00:41:39.010
That should be the right one.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:45.180
Not only that,
that's a one-step.

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.840
So what happened is
it describes what

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:48.910
happens in a single
step, the probability

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:51.410
that you jump from i to j.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.330
But using that,
you can also model

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:58.260
what's the probability that you
jump from i to j in two steps.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:03.110
So let's define q sub
i, j as the probability

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:08.440
that X at time t plus 2 is equal
to j, given that X at time t

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.070
is equal to i.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:25.020
Then the matrix,
defined this way,

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.100
can you describe it in
terms of the matrix A?

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:34.800
Anybody?

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.980
Multiplication?

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.810
Very good.

00:42:36.810 --> 00:42:37.700
So it's A square.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:44.200
Why is it?

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.930
So let me write this
down in a different way.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:55.150
q_(i,j) is, you sum over
all intermediate values

00:42:55.150 --> 00:43:03.680
the probability that you
jump from i to k, first,

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.900
and then the probability
that you jump from k to j.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.940
And if you look at
what this means,

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:20.910
each entry here is described by
a linear-- what is it-- the dot

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:24.840
product of a column and a row.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.932
And that's exactly what occurs.

00:43:26.932 --> 00:43:29.140
And if you want to look at
the three-step, four-step,

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.390
all you have to do is just
multiply it again and again

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.230
and again.

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:35.430
Really, this matrix
contains all the information

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:40.290
you want if you have a
Markov chain and it's finite.

00:43:40.290 --> 00:43:41.882
That's very important.

00:43:41.882 --> 00:43:44.310
For random walk,
simple random walk,

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.840
I told you that it
is a Markov chain.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.570
But it does not have a
transition probability matrix,

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:53.191
because the state
space is not finite.

00:43:53.191 --> 00:43:54.045
So be careful.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:00.680
However, finite Markov
chains, really, there's

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:08.280
one matrix that
describes everything.

00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:13.110
I mean, I said it like it's
something very interesting.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:15.790
But if you think
about it, you just

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:17.766
wrote down all
the probabilities.

00:44:17.766 --> 00:44:19.140
So it should
describe everything.

00:44:34.542 --> 00:44:35.125
So an example.

00:44:41.152 --> 00:44:48.900
You have a machine,
and it's broken

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:53.180
or working at a given day.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:02.070
That's a silly example.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:13.388
So if it's working
today, working tomorrow,

00:45:13.388 --> 00:45:25.260
broken with probability 0.01,
working with probability 0.99.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:29.300
If it's broken, the
probability that it's repaired

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:35.500
on the next day is 0.8.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:40.450
And it's broken at 0.2.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:42.380
Suppose you have
something like this.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.854
This is an example of a Markov
chain used in like engineering

00:45:50.854 --> 00:45:51.395
applications.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:01.296
In this case, S is also called
the state space, actually.

00:46:01.296 --> 00:46:04.170
And the reason is
because, in many cases,

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:07.990
what you're modeling is these
kind of states of some system,

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:13.750
like broken or working, rainy,
sunny, cloudy as weather.

00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:18.380
And all these things
that you model

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.210
represent states a lot of time.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.505
So you call it
state set as well.

00:46:22.505 --> 00:46:24.175
So that's an example.

00:46:24.175 --> 00:46:26.000
And let's see what
happens for this matrix.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.720
We have two states,
working and broken.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.680
Working to working is 0.99.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:40.530
Working to broken is 0.01.

00:46:40.530 --> 00:46:42.600
Broken to working is 0.8.

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:53.590
Broken to broken is 0.2.

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.512
So that's what we've
learned so far.

00:46:55.512 --> 00:47:00.660
And the question, what happens
if you start from some state,

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:04.030
let's say it was
working today, and you

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:12.900
go a very, very long time,
like a year or 10 years,

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.720
then the distribution,
after 10 years, on that day,

00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:20.300
is A to the 3,650.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:24.680
So that will be--
that times [1,  0]

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.440
will be the probability [p, q].

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.030
p will be the probability that
it's working at that time.

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.414
q will be the probability
that it's broken at that time.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.630
What will p and q be?

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:46.655
What will p and q be?

00:47:46.655 --> 00:47:48.530
That's the question that
we're trying to ask.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:57.030
We didn't learn, so
far, how to do this,

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.400
but let's think about it.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:06.946
I'm going to cheat a
little bit and just say,

00:48:06.946 --> 00:48:12.400
you know what, I think,
over a long period of time,

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:20.760
the probability distribution on
day 3,650 and that on day 3,651

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.490
shouldn't be that different.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.246
They should be about the same.

00:48:25.246 --> 00:48:26.370
Let's make that assumption.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:27.770
I don't know if
it's true or not.

00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:32.470
Well, I know it's true, but
that's what I'm telling you.

00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:38.300
Under that assumption, now you
can solve what p and q are.

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:49.180
So approximately, I hope,
p, q-- so A^3650 * [1,

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:56.350
0] is approximately the same
as A to the 3651, [1, 0].

00:48:56.350 --> 00:48:58.555
That means that this is [p, q].

00:48:58.555 --> 00:49:01.121
[p, q] is about the
same as A times [p, q].

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.510
Anybody remember what this is?

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.030
Yes.

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.475
So [p, q] will be the
eigenvector of this matrix.

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.350
Over a long period of time,
the probability distribution

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:20.470
that you will observe
will be the eigenvector.

00:49:23.650 --> 00:49:26.510
And whats the eigenvalue?

00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:30.752
1, at least in this case,
it looks like it's 1.

00:49:30.752 --> 00:49:33.210
Now I'll make one
more connection.

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:36.954
Do you remember
Perron-Frobenius theorem?

00:49:36.954 --> 00:49:40.400
So this is a matrix.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.560
All entries are positive.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:45.980
So there is a
largest eigenvalue,

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:49.870
which is positive and real.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:52.670
And there is an all-positive
eigenvector corresponding

00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:53.415
to it.

00:49:56.555 --> 00:49:58.930
What I'm trying to say is
that's going to be your [p, q].

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.050
But let me not jump
to the conclusion yet.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:37.090
And one more thing we know
is, by Perron-Frobenius, there

00:50:37.090 --> 00:50:41.330
exists an eigenvalue,
the largest one, lambda

00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:50.699
greater than 0, and eigenvector
[v 1, v 2], where [v 1, v 2]

00:50:50.699 --> 00:50:51.240
are positive.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.100
Moreover, lambda was
at multiplicity 1.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.650
I'll get back to it later.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:00.250
So let's write this down.

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:07.032
A times [v 1, v 2] is equal
to lambda times [v 1, v2].

00:51:07.032 --> 00:51:08.740
A times [v 1, v 2],
we can write it down.

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:14.430
It's 0.99 v_1 plus 0.01 v_2.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:22.169
And that 0.8 v_1 plus 0.2 v_2,
which is equal to [v1, v2].

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:28.190
You can solve v_1 and
v_2, but before doing

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:41.501
that-- sorry about that.

00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:42.487
This is flipped.

00:51:51.544 --> 00:51:52.960
Yeah, so everybody,
it should have

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.466
been flipped in the beginning.

00:51:55.466 --> 00:51:57.876
So that's 8.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:10.190
So sum these two values, and
you get lambda times [v 1, v 2].

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:14.101
On the left, what you
get is v_1 plus v_2,

00:52:14.101 --> 00:52:15.833
you sum two coordinates.

00:52:18.611 --> 00:52:20.880
On the left, you
get v_1 plus v_2.

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:25.320
On the right, you get
lambda times v_1 plus v_2.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:27.642
That means your
lambda is equal to 1.

00:52:34.064 --> 00:52:38.600
So that eigenvalue, guaranteed
by Perron-Frobenius theorem,

00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:41.630
is 1, eigenvalue of 1.

00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:45.670
So what you'll find here
will be the eigenvector

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:49.857
corresponding to the largest
eigenvalue-- eigenvector

00:52:49.857 --> 00:52:52.440
will be the one corresponding
to the largest eigenvalue, which

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.710
is equal to 1.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:56.250
And that's something
very general.

00:52:56.250 --> 00:53:00.770
It's not just about this matrix
and this special example.

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.940
In general, if you have
a transition matrix,

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:09.460
if you're given a Markov chain
and given a transition matrix,

00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.310
Perron-Frobenius
theorem guarantees

00:53:11.310 --> 00:53:14.180
that there exists a vector as
long as all the entries are

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.520
positive.

00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:25.150
So in general, if transition
matrix of a Markov chain

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:39.170
has positive entries, then
there exists a vector pi_1 up

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:49.600
to pi_m such that-- I'll just
call it v-- Av is equal to v.

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.400
And that will be the long-term
behavior as explained.

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.790
Over a long term, if it
converges to some state,

00:53:56.790 --> 00:53:59.470
it has to satisfy that.

00:53:59.470 --> 00:54:01.630
And by Perron-Frobenius
theorem, we

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:04.440
know that there is a
vector satisfying it.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:09.090
So if it converges, it
will converge to that.

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:11.990
And what it's saying is, if
all the entries are positive,

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:13.280
then it converges.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.450
And there is such a state.

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:17.810
We know the long-term
behavior of the system.

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:28.330
So this is called the
stationary distribution.

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.290
Such vector v is called.

00:54:44.090 --> 00:54:46.230
It's not really right
to say that a vector is

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:47.670
stationary distribution.

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:52.080
But if I give this distribution
to the state space,

00:54:52.080 --> 00:55:03.340
what I mean is consider
probability distribution over S

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:10.810
such that probability is-- so
it's a random variable X-- X is

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:12.730
equal to i is equal to pi_i.

00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.830
If you start from this
distribution, in the next step,

00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:22.050
you'll have the exact
same distribution.

00:55:22.050 --> 00:55:23.570
That's what I'm
trying to say here.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.952
That's called a
stationary distribution.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:35.590
Any questions?

00:55:38.518 --> 00:55:41.836
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:46.535 --> 00:55:47.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.023
Very good question.

00:55:51.741 --> 00:55:53.366
Yeah, but Perron-Frobenius
theorem says

00:55:53.366 --> 00:55:55.282
there is exactly one
eigenvector corresponding

00:55:55.282 --> 00:55:58.100
to the largest eigenvalue.

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.280
And that turns out to be 1.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.740
The largest eigenvalue
turns out to be 1.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:06.400
So there will a unique
stationary distribution

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:09.818
if all the entries are positive.

00:56:14.226 --> 00:56:15.142
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.135
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:56:23.135 --> 00:56:24.051
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:33.991 --> 00:56:36.476
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

00:56:36.476 --> 00:56:37.967
It's a good point.

00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:58.344
Huh?

00:56:58.344 --> 00:56:59.835
Something is wrong.

00:57:06.310 --> 00:57:07.310
Can anybody help me?

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:09.170
This part looks questionable.

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.154
AUDIENCE: Just kind of
[INAUDIBLE] question,

00:57:11.154 --> 00:57:13.898
is that topic covered in
portions of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:17.874 --> 00:57:21.850
The other eigenvalues in the
matrix are smaller than 1.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:26.390
And so when you take products
of the transition probability

00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:33.150
matrix, those eigenvalues
that are smaller than 1 scale

00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:37.740
after repeated
multiplication to 0.

00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.750
So in the limit, they're 0,
but until you get to the limit,

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.739
you still have them.

00:57:43.739 --> 00:57:45.155
Essentially, that
kind of behavior

00:57:45.155 --> 00:57:49.065
is transitionary
behavior that dissipates.

00:57:49.065 --> 00:57:53.470
But the behavior corresponding
to the stationary distribution

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.970
persists.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:57:58.850
PROFESSOR: But,
as you mentioned,

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:02.000
this argument seems to be
giving that all lambda has

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:02.625
to be 1, right?

00:58:02.625 --> 00:58:05.882
Is that your point?

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:06.970
You're right.

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:09.167
I don't see what the
problem is right now.

00:58:09.167 --> 00:58:10.250
I'll think about it later.

00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:14.850
I don't want to waste my time
on trying to find what's wrong.

00:58:14.850 --> 00:58:16.660
But the conclusion is right.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.510
There will be a
unique one and so on.

00:58:24.405 --> 00:58:26.020
Now let me make a note here.

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:39.720
So let me move on
to the final topic.

00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:40.930
It's called martingale.

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:57.030
And this is, there
is another collection

00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:58.990
of stochastic processes.

00:58:58.990 --> 00:59:04.750
And what we're trying to
model here is a fair game.

00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:13.930
Stochastic processes
which are a fair game.

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:35.990
And formally, what I mean
is a stochastic process is

00:59:35.990 --> 01:00:20.770
a martingale if that happens.

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:22.310
Let me iterate it.

01:00:22.310 --> 01:00:28.100
So what we have
here is, at time t,

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.910
if you look at what's going
to happen at time t plus 1,

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:33.660
take the expectation,
then it has

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:36.640
to be exactly equal
to the value of X_t.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:41.920
So we have this stochastic
process, and, at time t,

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.180
you are at X_t.

01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:49.250
At time t plus 1, lots
of things can happen.

01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:52.570
It might go to this point, that
point, that point, or so on.

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.080
But the probability
distribution is

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:59.290
designed so that the
expected value over all these

01:00:59.290 --> 01:01:02.730
are exactly equal
to the value at X_t.

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:06.260
So it's kind of centered
at X_t, centered meaning

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.620
in the probabilistic sense.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:12.590
The expectation
is equal to that.

01:01:12.590 --> 01:01:16.040
So if your value at time
t was something else,

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:19.070
your values at
time t plus 1 will

01:01:19.070 --> 01:01:21.587
be centered at this value
instead of that value.

01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:27.980
And the reason I'm
saying it models

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:34.790
a fair game is
because, if this is

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:41.510
like your balance over
some game, in expectation,

01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:47.670
you're not supposed to
win any money at all

01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:50.070
And I will later tell
you more about that.

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:59.380
So example, a random
walk is a martingale.

01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:19.690
What else?

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:28.820
Second one, now let's
say you're in a casino

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.580
and you're playing roulette.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:40.150
Balance of a roulette
player is not a martingale.

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:49.610
Because it's designed so
that the expected value

01:02:49.610 --> 01:02:52.150
is less than 0.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:53.880
You're supposed to lose money.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:57.850
Of course, at one instance,
you might win money.

01:02:57.850 --> 01:03:02.310
But in expected value,
you're designed to go down.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:06.730
So it's not a martingale.

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:09.420
It's not a fair game.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.820
The game is designed for
the casino not for you.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:18.106
Third one is some funny example.

01:03:18.106 --> 01:03:24.596
I just made it up to show that
there are many possible ways

01:03:24.596 --> 01:03:28.130
that a stochastic process
can be a martingale.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:35.450
So if Y_i are IID
random variables such

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:45.048
that Y_i is equal to 2, with
probability 1/3, and 1/2

01:03:45.048 --> 01:04:00.854
is probability 2/3, then let
X_0 equal 1 and X_k equal.

01:04:05.255 --> 01:04:07.827
Then that is a martingale.

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:14.960
So at each step, you'll
either multiply by 2 or 1/2

01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:18.140
by 2-- just divide by 2.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:23.260
And the probability distribution
is given as 1/3 and 2/3.

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:26.910
Then X_k is a martingale.

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:32.910
The reason is-- so you can
compute the expected value.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:45.800
The expected value of the
X_(k+1), given X_k up to X_0,

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:58.880
is equal to-- what you have is
expected value of Y_(k+1) times

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:03.942
Y_k up to Y_1.

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:05.436
That part is X_k.

01:05:08.930 --> 01:05:12.438
But this is designed so that the
expected value is equal to 1.

01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:21.146
So it's a martingale.

01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.240
I mean it will fluctuate
a lot, your balance,

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:32.510
double, double, double,
half, half, half, and so on.

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:36.999
But still, in expectation,
you will always maintain.

01:05:36.999 --> 01:05:39.040
I mean the expectation at
all time is equal to 1,

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.910
if you look at it
from the beginning.

01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:43.880
You look at time 1, then
the expected value of X_1

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:44.870
and so on.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.410
Any questions on
definition or example?

01:05:53.090 --> 01:05:56.580
So the random walk is an
example which is both Markov

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.820
chain and martingale.

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:02.640
But these two concepts are
really two different concepts.

01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.800
Try not to be confused
between the two.

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.339
They're just two
different things.

01:06:11.330 --> 01:06:13.670
There are Markov chains
which are not martingales.

01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.510
There are martingales which
are not Markov chains.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.030
And there are somethings
which are both,

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.240
like a simple random walk.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.400
There are some stuff which
are not either of them.

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.350
They really are just
two separate things.

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.150
Let me conclude with
one interesting theorem

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:38.220
about martingales.

01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:42.380
And it really enforces
your intuition, at least

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:46.740
intuition of the definition,
that martingale is a fair game.

01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:48.572
It's called optional
stopping theorem.

01:06:53.780 --> 01:07:00.340
And I will write it down
more formally later,

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:05.320
but the message is this.

01:07:05.320 --> 01:07:09.050
If you play a martingale
game, if it's a game you play

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:14.470
and it's your balance, no
matter what strategy you use,

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:18.970
your expected value cannot
be positive or negative.

01:07:18.970 --> 01:07:21.120
Even if you try to
lose money so hard,

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:22.780
you won't be able to do that.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:24.940
Even if you try to win
money so hard, like try

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.300
to invent something really,
really cool and ingenious,

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.130
you should not be
able to win money.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:34.124
Your expected value
is just fixed.

01:07:34.124 --> 01:07:35.540
That's the content
of the theorem.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.230
Of course, there are
technical conditions

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:38.160
that have to be there.

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.930
So if you're playing
a martingale game,

01:07:46.930 --> 01:07:50.470
then you're not
supposed to win or lose,

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:51.470
at least in expectation.

01:07:53.995 --> 01:07:56.080
So before stating
the theorem, I have

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:59.524
to define what a
stopping point means.

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:27.279
So given a stochastic process,
a non-negative integer

01:08:27.279 --> 01:08:39.896
valued random variable tau
is called a stopping time,

01:08:39.896 --> 01:08:48.350
if, for all integer k greater
than or equal to 0, tau,

01:08:48.350 --> 01:09:00.380
lesser or equal to k,
depends only on X_1 to X_k.

01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:04.960
So that is something
very, very strange.

01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:07.950
I want to define something
called a stopping time.

01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:11.550
It will be a non-negative
integer valued random variable.

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:14.649
So it will it be
0, 1, 2, or so on.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:18.560
That means it will
be some time index.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.229
And if you look at the
event that tau is less than

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:27.800
or equal to k-- so if you
want to look at the events

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:32.229
when you stop at time
less than or equal to k,

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:34.760
your decision only
depends on the events

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:40.410
up to k, on the value of
the stochastic process

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:43.340
up to time k.

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.540
In other words, if
this is some strategy

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:49.930
you want to use-- by
strategy I mean some strategy

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:53.540
that you stop playing
at some point.

01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:55.840
You have a strategy
that is defined

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:00.040
as you play some k rounds, and
then you look at the outcome.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.480
You say, OK, now I think
it's in favor of me.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.460
I'm going to stop.

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:05.225
You have a pre-defined
set of strategies.

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:12.540
And if that strategy
only depends

01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:16.570
on the values of the stochastic
process up to right now,

01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:18.880
then it's a stopping time.

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.370
If it's some strategy that
depends on future values,

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:23.680
it's not a stopping time.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.468
Let me show you by example.

01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:31.640
Remember that coin toss game
which had random walk value, so

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:35.790
either win $1 or lose $1.

01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:49.980
So in coin toss game,
let tau be the first time

01:10:49.980 --> 01:11:02.778
at which balance becomes $100,
then tau is a stopping time.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:15.410
Or you stop at either
$100 or negative

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:17.850
$50, that's still
a stopping time.

01:11:17.850 --> 01:11:21.370
Remember that we
discussed about it?

01:11:21.370 --> 01:11:22.780
We look at our balance.

01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:27.300
We stop at either at the time
when we win $100 or lose $50.

01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:29.824
That is a stopping time.

01:11:29.824 --> 01:11:32.320
But I think it's better to
tell you what is not a stopping

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.700
time, an example.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:36.660
That will help, really.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:50.280
So let tau-- in the same
game-- the time of first peak.

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.310
By peak, I mean the
time when you go down,

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:57.794
so that would be your tau.

01:11:57.794 --> 01:12:00.250
So the first time when
you start to go down,

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.150
you're going to stop.

01:12:02.150 --> 01:12:04.680
That's not a stopping time.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.640
Not a stopping time.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:15.710
To see formally why it's the
case, first of all, if you want

01:12:15.710 --> 01:12:18.470
to decide if it's a
peak or not at time t,

01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:21.900
you have to refer to the
value at time t plus 1.

01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:23.983
If you're just looking
at values up to time t,

01:12:23.983 --> 01:12:25.955
you don't know if it's
going to be a peak

01:12:25.955 --> 01:12:28.440
or if it's going to continue.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.860
So the event that
you stop at time t

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:38.150
depends on t plus 1
as well, which doesn't

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:41.022
fall into this definition.

01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:43.050
So that's what we're
trying to distinguish

01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.580
by defining a stopping time.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:48.330
In these cases it was
clear, at the time,

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.110
you know if you
have to stop or not.

01:12:50.110 --> 01:12:51.610
But if you define
your stopping time

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.170
in this way and not
a stopping time,

01:12:53.170 --> 01:12:56.820
if you define tau in
this way, your decision

01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:59.670
depends on future
values of the outcome.

01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:04.035
So it's not a stopping
time under this definition.

01:13:04.035 --> 01:13:04.618
Any questions?

01:13:04.618 --> 01:13:07.082
Does it make sense?

01:13:07.082 --> 01:13:07.582
Yes?

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:11.534
AUDIENCE: Could you still
have tau as the stopping time,

01:13:11.534 --> 01:13:14.498
if you were referring
to t, and then t minus 1

01:13:14.498 --> 01:13:16.990
was greater than [INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:18.005
PROFESSOR: So.

01:13:18.005 --> 01:13:20.442
AUDIENCE: Let's say,
yeah, it was [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:21.900
PROFESSOR: So that
time after peak,

01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:22.640
the first time after peak?

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.223
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:13:23.223 --> 01:13:25.640
PROFESSOR: Yes, that
will be a stopping time.

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:38.030
So three, tau is tau_0 plus 1,
where tau 0 is the first peak,

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:39.630
then it is a stopping time.

01:13:39.630 --> 01:13:41.106
It's a stopping time.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:10.210
So the optional stopping
theorem that I promised

01:14:10.210 --> 01:14:13.150
says the following.

01:14:13.150 --> 01:14:25.898
Suppose we have a martingale,
and tau is a stopping time.

01:14:29.834 --> 01:14:36.900
And further suppose
that there exists

01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:43.540
a constant T such that tau is
less than or equal to T always.

01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:49.780
So you have some strategy
which is a finite strategy.

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:51.720
You can't go on forever.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.460
You have some bound on the time.

01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.390
And your stopping time
always ends before that time.

01:14:58.390 --> 01:15:08.110
In that case, the expectation
of your value at the stopping

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:11.000
time, when you've
stopped, your balance,

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.160
if that's what it's
modeling, is always

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:18.220
equal to the balance
at the beginning.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.890
So no matter what strategy you
use, if you're a mortal being,

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:24.610
then you cannot win.

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:27.670
That's the content
of this theorem.

01:15:27.670 --> 01:15:30.430
So I wanted to prove
it, but I'll not,

01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:32.990
because I think I'm
running out of time.

01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:37.470
But let me show you one, very
interesting corollary of this

01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:38.810
applied to that number one.

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:45.250
So number one is
a stopping time.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:49.610
It's not clear that there is a
bounded time where you always

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:51.830
stop before that time.

01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:54.160
But this theorem does
apply to that case.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.080
So I'll just forget about
that technical issue.

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:03.080
So corollary, it
applies not immediately,

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:09.430
but it does apply to the first
case, case 1 given above.

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:15.130
And then what it says
is expectation of X_tau

01:16:15.130 --> 01:16:15.920
is equal to 0.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:23.390
But expectation of
X_tau is-- X at tau

01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:26.370
is either 100 or negative
50, because they're always

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:29.910
going to stop at the first
time where you either

01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:33.280
hit $100 or minus $50.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:37.880
So this is 100 times
some probability

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:41.970
plus 1 minus p times minus 50.

01:16:41.970 --> 01:16:44.320
There's some probability
that you stop at 100.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.991
With all the rest, you're
going to stop at minus 50.

01:16:46.991 --> 01:16:47.740
You know it's set.

01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:49.960
It's equal to 0.

01:16:49.960 --> 01:16:55.130
What it gives is-- I hope it
gives me the right thing I'm

01:16:55.130 --> 01:16:57.030
thinking about.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.660
p, 100, yes.

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:02.770
It's 150p minus 50 equals 0.

01:17:02.770 --> 01:17:04.540
p is 1/3.

01:17:04.540 --> 01:17:07.274
And if you remember, that was
exactly the computation we got.

01:17:10.970 --> 01:17:13.560
So that's just a
neat application.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.350
But the content of this,
it's really interesting.

01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:21.090
So try to contemplate about it,
something very philosophically.

01:17:21.090 --> 01:17:23.810
If something can be
modeled using martingales,

01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:26.450
perfectly, if it
really fits into

01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:28.630
the mathematical
formulation of a martingale,

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:30.454
then you're not supposed to win.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:35.510
So that's it for today.

01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:39.470
And next week, Peter will
give wonderful lectures.

01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:41.620
See you next week.

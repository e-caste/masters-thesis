WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
OK, so what I'd like to do
today is pick up where we left

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
off last time,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with respect to how this genetic
material actually functions.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We discussed
last time the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
experiments that identified DNA as
the fundamental genetic material,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the transforming principle.
We identified the eventual work

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
by Crick and Watson's work at the
structure of DNA as a double helix.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We mentioned why that was
so tremendously important,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
because it contained within it in
principle the secret of replication,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
namely two strands, each of which
contained the full information,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and therefore each of which included
in principal serve as a template for

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
making the other strand. And
that is, after all, the big

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
issue about life is how do you,
in fact, copy life? And then, I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
mentioned briefly
these experiments

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
by these post-docs, Matt
Meselson and Frank Stahl about

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
50 years ago to demonstrate that
the semi-conservative model of DNA

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
replication was right by virtue
of actually labeling DNA during the

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
course of its replication in one
generation, and demonstrating that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
DNA actually changed in its density
when you added in an isotope of

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
nitrogen. And, it changed
in its density in such a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
way as to be intermediate between
what you'd expect from heavy,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
heavy, light, light. You
have the intermediate.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, that was all good experimental
confirmation that this model was

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
probably right. But now,
how does it really work?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
After all the excitement calms
down for a moment you say,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
OK, that's great. We now
know in principal it's there,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but what actually goes on?
How is DNA really replicated?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
How is it really read out into
information? How does it really,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
as Archibald Garrett noted,
and as Beadle and Tatum noted,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
how does it really
make protein as well?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
How does it encode the
instructions for that? Well,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that was what was on people's
minds in the late '50s.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And, it was Francis Crick who was
the real intellectual thinker about

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this. And, the eventual
synthesis that you guys all know,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because, again, all this stuff gets
taught in elementary school these

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
days, was encapsulated in the
central dogma of molecular biology,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which I will summarize
here diagrammatically.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The DNA is replicated
to make copies of DNA.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It's read out into the intermediate
RNA, and then it is translated into

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:56.000
protein. This process:
translation. This process is called

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
transcription. And this
process: replication.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And what I'd like to do is go into
some detail today about how each of

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
these processes work.
Now, at the beginning,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
when people were trying
to patch this together,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
it wasn't as obvious as it is to
you today, that DNA goes to RNA,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
goes to protein. And, in fact, it
was a real struggle to figure out

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
what this RNA stuff was doing in the
middle, how it could possibly give

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
rise to protein. I want
to talk about some of that.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Let me briefly mention,
though, Francis Crick's term,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the central dogma,
because it sometimes

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
gets criticized, the word
dogma there as being like

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
religious belief and molecular
biologists treated in this way.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I've read a couple of social
scientists who sort of say,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
dogma. In fact, Francis Crick
deliberately named this the central

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
dogma because he said there was no
proof for it at the time it was put

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
forward. He put it forward with
that word precisely to emphasize

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that this was a working guess.
But, it was merely a matter of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
belief that this is sort of how they
were putting together the pieces.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And it was really a question of
demonstrating how all these pieces

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
work. We still call it the
central dogma, but it's now,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of course, extraordinarily well
established. Let's look at this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
first piece. DNA is replicated.
All right, so Meselson and Stahl

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
tell us that, yeah, the
DNA weight look like the new

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
strand, the old strand, all
that. How would you really

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
demonstrate DNA replication? If
you wanted to show me that DNA

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
replication really happens,
this DNA goes to DNA,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that somehow we had to
take a double strand of DNA,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and it gives rise to, it's
one thing to show this in a

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
bacterium by adding the nitrogen
and all that. The way to really prove

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
this was to be in a test tube.
In vitro, reconstitute for me DNA

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
replication. Show me that
in a cell free system,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
you can take DNA, and you
can copy it as you would

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
expect according to the
Crick Watson model here. Well,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that is what Arthur Kornberg set
out to do. Arthur Kornberg was a

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000
biochemist, and so his interest
was crack open the cell,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and purify an enzyme that
was able to copy DNA. Now,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
how do you do that? What
cells should you pick?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Sorry? Why E coli? What
a bacteria? It's simple,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
exactly. Good answer. You
can grow up a lot of it,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and presumably, if this DNA
replication thing is right,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
it will apply to any organism.
So, we'll go with E coli. So,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
what do you do? You just crack
open a cell and purify components,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and throw them in a test tube,
and look for DNA synthesis? Well,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
you've got to put something in the
test tube. What should we put in

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
the test tube? Sorry?
Nucleotides, because we think that

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
this is going to be made
out of nucleotides. So,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000
we'd better add some
nucleotides to our test tube.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, actually, deoxynucleotides,
we'll add some DATP, DCTP, DGTP, and

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
DTTP, the deoxynucleotide
triphosphates, altogether

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000
known as the DNTPs.
OK, that's good.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So, we're going to take
different fractions of the cell.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We'll add it here. We'll add some
nucleotides, and what else should we

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
add? Well, if we were going to copy
DNA, maybe we ought to put in a DNA

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000
strand. Let's put in a DNA
template. So, let's put in a template

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
strand of DNA
that we'll copy,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
here we go, and we've got our
nucleotides floating around here.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And, here's our template
strand, a single strand of DNA,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and now we add enzymes, and
we hope that it's going to

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
somehow copy the DNA. Now,
it turns out that that's a

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
little bit optimistic because
in order to copy the DNA,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and I think Kornberg
had this insight,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
it's helpful to give it a start.
So, instead of just adding a single

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
template strand, he also
added a short complementary

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
primer strand with the hope that he
would be able to purify an enzyme,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
which even if it couldn't manage
to start the synthesis of DNA,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
would be able to extend
the synthesis of DNA.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
That's a reasonable thing.
Let's not ask for it all at once.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Maybe it won't be a single fraction.
Maybe multiple enzymes would be

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
needed to get going. So,
he needed a primer strand,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
a template strand, and some
nucleotides. And then he added

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
fractions, and he looked to see
whether he could get incorporation

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
of DNA. So now, let's
look at this a little more

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
closely. The primer strand
goes like this. Five prime, ah,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This direction is going to
matter a lot, I told you.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Phosphate T, phosphate A,
phosphate C, phosphate G, phosphate

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000
T, phosphate A, stop
there. Template strand,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the complement to that , will
start in the opposite direction.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
These are anti-parallel.
What matches the T: A. Keep

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
going: T, G, C, A,
T, and phosphate,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
phosphate, phosphate,
phosphate, phosphate; I'll stop

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
writing the phosphates in a while.
Let's say T, A, G, G, C, etc. This

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
is the five prime end.
That is the three prime end,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000
OK? And, this one will
go on further, let's say.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
All right, so what is the enzyme
that Kornberg hopes to find going to

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
do? What's it going to add to the
strand? It's going to add an A.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
All right, it wants to put in an
A here. So, it's going to take a

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000
triphosphate, and it's going
to catalyze the addition of a

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
triphosphate to the growing
end of this DNA chain,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and which is its growing
end? The three prime end

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
of the chain there, right?
It's adding it to the three

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
prime carbon there.
And, when it does that,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
where is it going to get the energy
for catalysis here for this chemical

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
reaction here? It's
going to get it from the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
dehydration synthesis and the
breaking of this triphosphate bond,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
which is a high-energy bond.
You'll take off your inorganic

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
pyrophosphate and you'll
add in an A. That's it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Then, it will go off and
it'll look for, what, a T,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
a triphosphate with T,
DTTP, and then DCTP, etc.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And it adds them in. This enzyme,
this hypothetical enzyme, that can

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
polymerize DNA like that is called
polymerase. It's all very simple

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
stuff. This is DNA polymerase.
OK, and the nomenclatures here make

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
tremendous sense. This
is called DNA polymerase.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Anyway, Kornberg
isolated by a lot of work

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
DNA polymerase, and was
able to demonstrate that it

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
could in fact catalyze this reaction.
This was incredibly exciting.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
He got a Nobel Prize for
this amongst other things,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but he really demonstrated that
there were proteins that could copy

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
DNA according to this double
helical model for replication.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I call your attention to the
fact that the replication goes

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
five prime to three prime always,
ever, all the time. This is

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
universal. No one has ever found a
DNA polymerization system in nature

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
where it goes the other way.
And, why would that be? This is

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:54.000
just a digression. But
tell me why that would be?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Let's take our strand
here, T, G, C, A,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:10.000
T, T, A, G, C, G, T,
why not go this way?

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Why not go, let's say, A, G, C,
G. Let's see, what base should

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we put in? We'll take
our triphosphate T, right?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We'll put that in. Let's
see, where are we going to get

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the triphosphate bond; where
are we going to get the energy?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The triphosphate's on the wrong
end. Oh, that's not a problem because

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
when we put this G in, it must
be that its triphosphate was

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
still there, right? So,
now we'll take the next one,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
a triphosphate T, and
now why don't we just

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
carry out the polymerization
using the triphosphate bond,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
the energy from the triphosphate
bond, on a growing chain going in

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
that direction?
That would work,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
right? Just stick this guy here.
It'll supply a new triphosphate at

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
the end, and that triphosphate can
be used to catalyze the next monomer.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So, what's the problem? You
could put the triphosphates on

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
the growing chain.
If we went this way,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
the triphosphate bond would
be on the growing chain,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
rather than in this way the
triphosphate is on the monomer.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But who cares?
Who might care?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If you were designing it, which
way would you prefer to do it?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The one with the energy first,
well, why do you care whether the

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.000
triphosphate is on this big,
long chain that you've made, or

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
whether it's on this monomer because
either way you've got a triphosphate

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
bond that could be on the
monomers floating around,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
or it could be in that last position
with the growing chain. Yeah?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Could be, could be. What
kind of mistake might I make?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Yep. And, you know, what other
kind of mistakes can happen?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What about these high-energy
triphosphate bonds: unstable?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
What if they should just
spontaneously hydrolyze?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Oops: big trouble,
right? You've lost your

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
triphosphate bond, and
but what if this one

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
spontaneously hydrolyzes?
Aren't you in trouble? No,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
get another monomer, right? Clearly,
it's no big deal if one of the

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
monomers spontaneously hydrolyzes
from a triphosphate to a

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
monophosphate, but it's
a big deal if you've

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
invested all of this energy
going in the other direction,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and it should
spontaneously hydrolyze.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, it makes a great deal more sense
to leave that high-energy bond on

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the monomer for the growing polymer
rather than on the polymer itself.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And, in fact, of course, nature
hasn't told me why it chose to do

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
this. This is my reason why I
think nature chose to do this,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
but I think it's very reasonable,
and I think it's right. So, this is

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
not the way it's done.
This is the way it's done,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and it's always done that way.
No one has ever found a case where

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
it's not. OK, so now
let's look a little more

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:34.000
closely at DNA replication.
Suppose I take not just this teeny

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
little piece that Kornberg gives,
but suppose I now look at what's

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
going on in an organism. An
organism might have a big,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
long chromosome. DNA replication
is occurring along this chromosome.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We've got to go five prime to three
prime, five prime to three prime.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Let's suppose there's a primer here.
Wait a second, where's the primer

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
going to come from? If
Kornberg's not there to add the

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
primer, what does the organism do?
To kind of make one itself, and I'm

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
going to need some enzyme to make it.
So, what enzyme's going to make it?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Or, primase: it turns out to
be remarkably, coincidentally

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
it's primase that makes the primer.
It's funny how that works out. And

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
so, primase makes the primer,
and then what happens? Then, DNA

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.000
polymerase comes along and catalyzes
the addition, and works beautifully.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
What about on the other
strand? So, it's got a what?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Why does it have to play catch-up?
Let's see, what kind of primer here?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
It's got to go
the other way.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
OK, so let's get a primer here.
So, but wait a second, now it

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
breathes and opens up a little
more. We've got to get a primer here.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And then, when it's going to open up
even more we've got to get a primer

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
there. See, this guy's
going the wrong way. So,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
in fact, this is what happens.
When the DNA opens like this, one

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
primer here is sufficient to keep
going, but here as you begin to open

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
this up, the other strand needs
the continual addition of new

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
primers, and then what happens
when this DNA sequence here,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
growing, meets this DNA sequence
there? They've got to be ligated

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
together. They've got to
be joined together. So,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
this is actually getting kind of
complicated. We have little DNA

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
fragments that have to be
ligated together on this strand.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Now, how are you going
to ligate them together?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Chemically, you've
got to catalyze a

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
covalent bond between this little
growing DNA chain and the previous

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
growing DNA chain that was there.
How are you going to ligate them?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Ligase: yes! Coincidentally, it
turns out that ligase does that.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It's just wonderful the way this
worked out, that ligase should do

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
the ligation, and primase should
do the primer, and all that.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
All right, so this goes on and
on. Now, this model, which is what

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
would be compelled by what we're
thinking about is experimentally

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
proven. There was
a scientist who

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
demonstrated that on this strand,
this one goes slower, right, because

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
it's got to, just as you said,
catch up. Playing catch up, this is

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
what's called the lagging strand.
This guy is called the leading

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
strand. The lagging strand plays
catch-up to the leading strand.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And, these little fragments
can actually be really,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
truly identified biochemically.
They were identified, in fact, by

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
somebody called Okazaki.
And, do you know what they're

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
called, those fragments?
Okazaki fragments,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
exactly. That's what they're
called. So, that's how it goes,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
and it goes with this continuous
replication, and then this

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
discontinuous replication there.
Now, here's another problem. This

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
upset people a lot. Try
to take a long chromosome.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
In fact, let's even imagine that
it's a circular chromosome like

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
bacteria have, a big DNA circle.
Imagine trying to replicate this.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:41.000
All right, we're going to pull this
apart some. We'll start replicating

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.000
as we'll continue to pull this apart,
etc., etc., but the problem is that

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:56.000
we're going to end up with this
DNA helix and this DNA helix wrapped

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
around each other so that
we're going to have double

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
helices, or we're going to
have interlaced double helices.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It's really very
messy. Topologically,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
if I take a double helix
and I copy the two strands,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and the double helices went around
each other 800 times before they got

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
to the end and joined up, I've
now got two circles of DNA that

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
are inextricably
linked together with

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
what's mathematically called
the linking number of 800.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
That's not very good when I try
to now divide my cell and say,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
in one chromosome to one cell and
one chromosome to the other cell

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
because I've got these two long,
continuous ropes that are just so

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000
totally knotted with each other.
This bothered people tremendously.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
You can prove, mathematically, some
of you take the topology courses

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
that there is no way without cutting
to pull apart two strings that are

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
so intertwined with each other.
So, how in the world is life going

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.000
to do that? It's mathematically
impossible to do that without

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
actually cutting. So, it
cuts it because it's got no

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
choice, right? There's
a theorem that says you

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
have to cut it.
So, it cuts it.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
You would actually need,
it turns out, that if you're

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
going to separate out these two
different double helices that are

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
all wound up around each other,
you're going to need to somehow cut

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
the DNA, separate it, and
pass it through the other side.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
And, you're going to need to
do that to un-knot this thing.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Now, does it change it chemically
when you cut it and bring it around

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
to the other side of the string?
It's still the same molecule,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
right? It's the same DNA, but
topologically it's different.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000
The two circles are now not
linked to 800 times their links,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
799 times, and if I keep doing that,
so they are, you could call them

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
topoisomers because they
differ only in their topology,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
their topoisomers. So, you
would need an enzyme that

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
actually cuts the DNA, and
is clever enough to pass it to

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
the other side and then seal
it back up, and cut the DNA,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
and pass it through the
side and seal it back up.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
What enzyme does that?
Topoisomerase does that,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
that's right. And, there are
topoisomerase enzymes that cut and

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:46.000
paste the DNA to resolve this
terrible linking number problem.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
So, life has worked all this stuff
out, and there's just fascinating

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.000
work that goes on to understand,
woops, all of the steps there of DNA

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
replication. Now, I
mentioned that these are

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
actually pretty important things
because processes like this are very

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
important to rapidly growing cells.
It turns out that some very good

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
anti-cancer drugs are inhibitors
of topoisomerase because rapidly

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
growing cancer cells are highly
sensitive to the need to continue to

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
topologically untangle your DNA.
And so, topoisomerase inhibitors

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
turn out to be pretty good,
well, they're not great, but they

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
turned out to be
acceptable cancer drugs.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Here's another issue: fidelity.
The fidelity of DNA replication.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
If I'm copying the DNA, I'm
going to put in my next base.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:52.000
It's a T. I want to put in an A,
a G, I want to put in a C; how do I

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:00.000
get it right? I have my
DNA polymerase enzyme here.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
How do I manage to get this right?
Why don't I put in a G next to the

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
T instead of an A? Well,
it's energetically less

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
favored, right? Energetically,
there's some cost.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:26.000
There's a delta G, an energetic
difference between the right base

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
and the wrong base.
Now, if I know delta G,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
I from biochemistry know
the equilibrium constant.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I should be able to calculate,
based on the energetic difference

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
between putting in the right base
and the wrong base how often DNA

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
polymerase makes a mistake, and
it turns out you can do that.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
It turns out that the
equilibrium constant is about 103.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:10.000
That means that DNA polymerase,
remarkably, gets it right 99.9% of

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:20.000
the time, it puts it in the
right base. Isn't that impressive?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:30.000
No, it's terrible. Why is
that terrible? Yeah, 99.9%

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
this is no Six Sigma performance
or anything. This is pretty

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
unimpressive stuff. I mean,
a typical gene is more than

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
1,000 letters. That means
we're going to actually

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
make a mistake on average
in every gene. This won't do.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
So, what happens? Sorry? Well,
clearly the energetics say

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
that the delta G is only enough
to get us a factor of 103.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
We're going to need an additional
mechanism, and the additional

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
mechanism's a proofreading.
It's absolutely right.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
We need to proofread this because
we know that initially we're going to

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
get it wrong at an
unacceptably high rate. And so,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
it turns out that there are two
kinds of DNA proofreading that go on.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
First off, DNA polymerase itself
has a proofreading activity.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Whenever DNA polymerase adds a base,
it kind of also has an activity that

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
will remove a base. So, it
doesn't just add bases going

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
forward. It also
has what's called an

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
exonuclease activity that
removes bases going backwards.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Now, that may seem silly,
right, because it's adding and

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
subtracting, and adding and
subtracting, but it adds more than

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
it subtracts. And, the
trick is that if there's a

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
mismatched base, it's much
more likely to subtract

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
than to add, or much more likely
to subtract than if there's not a

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
mismatched base. So, the
presence of a mismatch

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
induces the enzyme to do its removal
more than if there was a match.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
In that fashion, DNA
polymerase is able to

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
substantially increase its
proofreading ability to about one

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
error in 105 or 106,
much better in one in 103.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Then, it turns out that there are
mismatched detection and repair

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
enzymes. They come along after
DNA polymerase has done its job,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000
and they feel along the DNA for any
mismatches. Mismatches are going to

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000
create funny structures. They're
going to bulge in some way.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And, mismatch repair enzymes are
able to detect that something's

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
funny, and they chop out some
sequence, and they get copied back

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
in. Now, with the proofreading that
comes from these mismatched repair

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
enzymes, you can get down to
the neighborhood of one mistake

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
in about 108 bases. In
the course of the human,

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
yes? Oh, what a great question!
Because, when it has a mistake,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
how does it know who to correct?
In bacteria, I can tell you the

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
answer. Wouldn't it be cool if you
could leave a mark on the old strand?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
If the old strand
could be temporarily

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
marked in some way so that the
enzyme, when it sees a mismatch,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
would also know which strand
to cut out and re-synthesize?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
It turns out that bacteria do that.
Methylation enzymes actually mark

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
the old strand. And, it
takes a while before those

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
methylation enzymes come
along to mark the new strand,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
and it leaves a temporary mark
as to who's the old strand.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I wasn't going to mention that
today, but it's a great question.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
So, it leaves breadcrumbs for
a while that tells it who's

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
the old strand. So, all
of this gets worked out.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Yes? So, the exonucleases go
backwards. They go three prime to

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
five prime because, that's
right, they only work in that

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
direction. There are other exos
that go in the other direction,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
but this exo on the polymerase
go backwards, three prime to five.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Now, this is not just theoretical
stuff. It turns out that about one

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
person in 400, that is,
probably at least one

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
person in this class, is
heterozygous for a mutation in

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
one of the mismatch repair enzyme
genes. One of the genes like MSH-2

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
or MLH-1 that encode the
mismatch repair enzymes.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
What do you think happens if you
are missing one of your two copies

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
of these mismatch repair enzymes?
Nothing much. The other copy's

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
enough. But, what do you think
would happen if by chance a single

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
cell in your body were to lose the
one remaining working copy of that

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
enzyme, the gene-encoded
remaining working copy?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Then it would have no copies.
What do you think the response of

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
the cell would be?
High mutation rates,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
and cancer. It turns out
that familial, hereditary,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
nonpolyposis coli, a
familial form of colon cancer,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000
is caused by, in many cases,
mutations in the gene or genes,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000
actually, encoding the
mismatch repair enzymes.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
So, our theoretical understanding
of the central dogma here is an

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
incredibly practical disease because
getting DNA replication right is

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
important. And, that provides
a very good proof that

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
the difference between 105 or 106
here and 108 accuracy matters a

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
great deal, that without that
mismatch repair enzyme present in

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
the cells, one is in fact going
to create new mutations at an

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
unacceptably high rate and
lead to cancer. I don't know,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
a few other random nice
facts about DNA polymerases.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
They're very fast speed. The
speed of a DNA polymerase is

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:09.000
about 2,000 nucleotides
per second: very impressive.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000
And then, one last point
I can't help but mention,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Arthur Kornberg discovers this
enzyme, shows in a test tube,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000
it works, people work out,
how it works in detail,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
leading strands, lagging
strands, topoisomerases, workout

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
fidelity, all these kinds of things,
great. But Kornberg's enzyme, the

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000
enzyme he purifies that copies DNA,
is it actually the right enzyme? Is

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
it the enzyme that the bacterial
cells he used actually use to copy

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
their DNA? Well, a
biochemist would say,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
I cracked open the cell. I
purified a component. It's able

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
to carry out this
function. There you go. But,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
what would the geneticist say?
Sorry? Take out the component,

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
and demonstrate now what?
That the cell can't replicate.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
It's DNA. Until you've shown that,
you haven't got the other half of

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
the proof. So, of course,
some geneticists decided

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
to put this to the test. They
took many mutant bacteria.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
One at a time,
they grew them up,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
and they did Kornberg's purification
to purify DNA polymerase.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
This is unbelievably tedious stuff,
guys. You've got to take each one.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
You've got to purify it;
get DNA polymerase. OK,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
it's there. Next one, next
one, next one, next one.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000
But, suppose you found a mutant
which couldn't make Kornberg's DNA

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
polymerase but still grew
and replicated its DNA.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
That would prove that Kornberg's
enzyme was not essential.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
They did. It turns out
that Kornberg's enzyme,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
DNA polymerase 1, although
it can replicate DNA in the

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
test tube is not the enzyme that
cells actually use for their major

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
DNA replication. It turns
out to be a relatively

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
more minor repair enzyme used to
fill in gaps. The actual enzyme is

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
DNA polymerase 3, not that
it matters to you a great

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
deal, but this duality between the
biochemistry and the genetics is

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
very important because just the
biochemical side of the story,

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
without showing that it was
essential to the function in the

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
organism misses a very
important point there. So,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
the combination of genetics and
biochemistry, biochemistry pointed

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
us to a class of enzymes.
The genetics, then, identifies

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
which ones are used for
which purposes in vivo,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
which is not that easy to
do in the test tube. Anyway,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I mentioned that, and
obviously being a geneticist,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.000
I like tweaking the biochemists
about things like that.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
All right, onward. So, in our
picture of DNA replication,

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:04.000
in our picture of
the central dogma,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:13.000
we've got DNA goes to DNA, and what
about the step of transcription,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:22.000
DNA goes to RNA? Well, we've
got to copy out our DNA into an

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:31.000
intermediate molecule called RNA,
which is going to then be used as a

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:38.000
template for protein
synthesis. Where do we start?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Somewhere in here,
there's some information.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
We want to make a copy of that
information. How do we know where

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
to start? Well,
there's something.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
There's some information
that says start here, right?

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
There's a little sign that says,
start here. Such a thing is called

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:13.000
a promoter. And, the
promoter, which we'll come and

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
talk about more in a while,
probably in a lecture or two,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:26.000
the promoter says here's the
place to start copying the

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:33.000
DNA into RNA, and it gets
copied into the RNA by an

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
enzyme that starts here,
let's say, I don't know, T,

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:49.000
A, T, G, G, T, A, T. On the other
strand I guess it's going to be A,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:57.000
T, A, C, C, A, T, A. It's
going to start copying here,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:04.000
and it's going to put in
an A. Then opposite the A,

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:11.000
it's going to put in a U,
because RNA has U, A, C, C,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:19.000
A, U, A, etc., except this time it's
doing it not out of DNA but out of

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:26.000
RNA. How does RNA differ from
DNA? So, first off, instead of

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
deoxyribose, this
is deoxyribose.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:42.000
In fact, it's two prime deoxyribose.
This is just plain old ribose.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Remember down there on the two
prime carbon, DNA had just a

00:36:51.000 --> 00:37:00.000
hydrogen, whereas
RNA has a hydroxyl.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
All right, that's one difference,
and it turns out that that hydroxyl

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
is important because it would
interfere in making long double

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
helices of RNA. RNA
doesn't make good,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
long double helices. Let's
entirely do that, oxygen.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
And, the other major
difference between DNA and RNA?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
The only other difference between
DNA and RNA is that this has U where

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
this has T, and what's the
difference between T and U?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:38.000
A single methyl group. That's
the only difference between

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:48.000
T and U. In this six-member ring
over here, there is a methyl group.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:58.000
And here in the six membered
ring, there's no methyl group.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:08.000
That's it. Why does RNA use
U, and DNA use T? Anybody know?

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
It's not a big difference.
That would be interesting,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
although I don't think it's true.
I actually have no idea. I think

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
this is fascinating. I've
never had a good accounting of

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
why it uses U and T.
You need to know this,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
and it's true, but I
don't actually have a,

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.000
whereas I have a good explanation
for this I don't have a good

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
explanation for that, although
maybe some of my Origin of

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Life colleagues have an explanation.
But I've always been a little

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
puzzled. Why does it use
U instead of T? Anyway,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I do know why it doesn't
have the hydroxyl. Well,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
it has the hydroxyl there.
That really does affect the base

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
stacking, and all sorts of
things like that. All right,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
so you, don't go away, come back.
So, the DNA is used as a template

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
to copy here a strand of RNA.
Some important names: the strand

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
that is being copied that is
being transcribed is called the

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
transcribed strand. This is
called the non-transcribed

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
strand that makes good sense.
This is also called the coding

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
strand. And, you will find it in
your books as the coding strand.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Why is it called the
non-coding strand?

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
This is called the coding strand.
Why is the top strand called the

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
coding strand? Because
the RNA that I copy out

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
will have the same sequence
as the coding strand,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
except for T's and U's. So,
the RNA copy that is made from

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
the transcribed
strand matches the

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
sequence of the non-transcribes
strand, or the coding strand.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
So, you will find this confusing,
but you will probably find it on

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
tests and some things like that to
know which strand you're looking at.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
The coding strand is this strand
which has the code that ends up,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
but in fact it's the template
for the coding strand,

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
the complement to the coding
strand, the non-coding strand, the

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
transcribed strand that is copied.
Anyway, I've said that now, and you

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
can, So, how does it
know where to stop?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Sorry? Stop codons. Stop codons
are actually about translation into

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
protein, right, because
we're going to come to stop

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
codons in a second. There
was some start signal there

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
called a promoter, which
is a start of transcription.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It turns out there was also a
stop signal that says stop of

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
transcription. And, you
guys haven't probably met

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
that before. But,
there's a start signal,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000
a stop signal, and all over the
genome there are these things.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
So, here's some genome. Here's
some gene that's got to be read out.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
And, it's read out this way, let's
say. This is the coding strand.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000
This is what, I'll make two
strands here. Now, in the next

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
gene over here, does it
go in the same direction?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
It might. Or, it might not. It
turns out that the orientation of

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
genes along the chromosome,
which way you read, is not a fixed

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.000
thing across the entire
length of the chromosome.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
So, when I refer to the transcribed
strand or the non-transcribed strand,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
that's just a local definition that
says, with respect to that gene,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000
this strand is coding, and
this strand is non-coded.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
But with respect to the next gene
over, it could be the other way.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Now, this is not a very
orderly way to do things, right?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
If a good engineer did this,
they'd probably get all the pieces

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
going in line and all that. But
life did this, and it turns out

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
that evolvable systems, you
know, couldn't possibly maintain

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
that order. Things are happening
all the time, and genes can come in

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
any order. In addition, how
does RNA polymerase know when to

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
turn on the gene? Oh,
sorry, what's the enzyme that

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
polymerizes RNA?
RNA polymerase, yes.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:40.000
How does it know when to turn on
the gene? How does it turn on the

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
right genes in the right tissues?
We'll come to that. That's gene

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
regulation. That's a
big non-trivial thing.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
We'll save that one. All
right, so we have all of this

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
transcription. Let's
now look at the last

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
important part of our picture
here, which is translation.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:11.000
So, RNA goes to protein.
So, if RNA goes to protein,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:18.000
we take our messenger, our
RNA over there. This is an RNA.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:26.000
What's the direction it's
been copied? Five prime

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000
to three prime. It's a
single strand of RNA that

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:43.000
we've copied here, a
single strand and molecule,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:52.000
and let's give it a sequence, A,
U, A, C, G, A, U, G, A, A, G, C, C,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:44:02.000
C, etc. Eventually we'll get to U,
A, G. How is this RNA interpreted?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Well, in an abstract sense, the
way this RNA is interpreted is

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.000
by a triplet code. The cell
could come along and start

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:20.000
reading three letter codons.
But, does it just start anywhere?

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
No, it always starts at the
same codon, and that codon is A,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
U, G. This is an
initiator codon.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:40.000
And it encodes a methionine.
Then, the next codon down encodes

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:49.000
lysine, arginine, etc. The
interesting challenge is

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.000
how in the world you get from
a sequence of nucleotides to a

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:05.000
sequence of amino acids. So,
we have to now get this funny

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:12.000
translation step between
nucleotides and amino acids.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:19.000
This concerned people greatly
because transcription was pretty

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
easy. Transcription was going
to be the RNA, actually first

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:32.000
replication, each
nucleotide would match a

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
nucleotide on the DNA sequence.
Then, RNA polymerization, each

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
nucleotide of RNA would match.
But how are we going to get amino

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
acids to match specific RNA
sequences? How are we going to get

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
amino acids? Now, this
bothered people a great deal.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
And, you know what some of the
ideas were? Well, protenase,

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
right. Some
enzyme, well,

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
actually the first ideas
were very physical ideas.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
It was that the RNA message there
would fold up into some kind of a

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
funny shape that would just
happen to match a lysine,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000
and then the next little
bit would fold up to match,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
I don't know, histidine,
a methianine, and a serine,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
and a this, because people were
thinking the complementarity of DNA

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
bases all just physical matching
that it would work that the

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
amino acids would be directly
read off the RNA message.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
But, it was kind of crazy to
imagine that because the amino acids

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000
all have such wildly different
physical properties: positive

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
charges, negative charges,
hydrophilic, hydrophobic, different

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
sizes. It just didn't make sense,
but it bothered people a great deal.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
But, I would say that a lot of
biochemists thought that that was

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
sort of how it was going to have
to work. The guy who really figured

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
out what was going on did it with
no experimental data whatsoever.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
He did it by just sitting down and
saying, that doesn't make any sense.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
There's got to be another solution.
And, that was Francis Crick.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Francis Crick just
had an incredible mind.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
He, Mendel, and a few other people
had this incredible insight into

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
things. He said, look, this
just makes no sense that

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
the physical properties
are going to do it. He said,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
what's got to be going on
is that what I want to put in

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
a certain amino acid into
a growing protein chain,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I'm going to take my amino acid
here. I'm going to take my codon here,

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
and I'm going to build me
some kind of an adapter.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.000
And, this adapter molecule will,
in fact, solve the problem. So, he

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:54.000
said, because Francis Creek,
in addition to being brilliant,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
really didn't do
any experiments.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
He didn't do any experiments both
because he wasn't that fond of doing

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
experiments, and because he was
legendarily not very good at the

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000
bench. But, what Francis did was he
exhorted all of his colleagues to go

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
find the adapter. He had
what he called the adapter

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
hypothesis. And sure enough,
Crick was dead on, just right.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
The adapter hypothesis turned
out to be that there was an

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
adapter molecule who was
made itself out of RNA

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
called transfer RNA. And,
transfer RNA matched up by

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000
base pairing to each codon you see,
and had amino acids attached to it

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
and so the problem of how you
mediate between a three-letter code

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000
of DNA or RNA,
of nucleotides,

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
and amino acids was solved
by a clever intermediate.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
It turned out that they looked,
they found the molecule. So, it's

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.000
just one of these great examples of
somebody having thought up an idea,

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.000
sent people off to look for
it, and it was there. And then,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000
of course, you've got to ask,
how did the amino acids get stuck

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:17.000
onto the right transfer RNAs?
And the answer is there's a bunch

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.000
of specific enzymes that
do precisely that job,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
that look at the transfer RNA,
attach the amino acid, and handle

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
that whole problem. I will
next time briefly end with

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
the ribosome, and how
those transfer RNAs work to

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
catalyze together the protein chain,
and then what I want to do is turn

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
to how this common picture of DNA,
RNA, and protein varies amongst

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.000
organisms.
Until next time.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.000
OLIVIER DE WECK: So
let's get to work.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.730
The V-Model, well,
believe it or not,

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.430
but we've arrived today
at the bottom of it,

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.660
the pointy part of the V. We're
arriving at the bottom of it,

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.260
and the bottom of
it is basically you

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.880
driving down the design in all
its glory and all its details.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.220
And we call this
design definition,

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.090
and then I want to talk about
multidisciplinary optimization,

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.780
including what happens at
the CDR, the critical design

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.370
review.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.092
Yeah, go ahead.

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.050
AUDIENCE: All right, I
do have a quick question

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.910
about A4 based to this.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.629
Do you want a CAD drawing
or a hand drawing?

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.790
OLIVIER DE WECK: I'm fine with
a nice dimension hand drawing,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.270
but we're gonna talk
about CAD next week.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.430
So I do think it would be
good to have a CAD drawing,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.950
but you know CAD drawings can
come in very different levels

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.420
of detail, right?

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.480
So I think it would be
good to have an idea,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.100
if the PDR package--

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.960
most of the PDR
packages that you

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.230
see that have been submitted
in prior years at CanSat,

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.060
they do have a CAD
drawing in there

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.037
for their sort of
suggested configuration.

00:01:37.037 --> 00:01:38.620
And you know, it is
useful because you

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.380
get to see whether the
packaging concept really works.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.200
You know, the sketching,
you can get away

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.700
with a lot just sketching.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.060
So my answer would
tend to be yes,

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.670
but if absolutely,
you don't feel

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.740
like you need it or you
don't want to do it,

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.650
then a nice hand drawing with
dimensions will do as well.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.900
OK, so let's talk about
the bottom of the V.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.610
The other thing I'm
gonna cover today

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.250
is this idea of
multidisciplinary design

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.910
optimization, and so
where does that fit in?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.000
So you remember we talked about
concept synthesis, concept

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.520
generation, screening,
and selection,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.430
and then at the PDR
stage, you know,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.590
we picked one architecture.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.510
So today's topic
is really how do

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.020
you get this architecture,
which is shown as this square

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.360
here to an optimal?

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.060
And I put optimal in
quotes here because we're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.440
gonna argue what that means, but
you've refined the design, such

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.510
that you can go
present it at the CDR.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.080
So you take this box here,
which is your concept,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.340
and you open the box--

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.900
you can see this on the right--

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.360
and you really dive
into the details

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.880
of the various
subsystems and components

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.440
and how they're connected.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.200
And what you're trying to
do is fine tune your design.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.970
So this is shown
here schematically.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.840
Let's say there's a
design variable X1

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.090
and you want to find where
is the optimal point?

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.090
This point here seems to
be optimal to minimize

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.390
metric three and
that's the design

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.980
that you're gonna propose.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.120
So today's topic really is
about fine tuning the design

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.050
and coming up with a
CDR level design, that's

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.790
what we want to talk about.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.040
And so what I'll cover
is different topics.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.580
So first of all, the
NASA view of this.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.280
It's called the design
definition process.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.190
Then I'll talk about MDO,
multidisciplinary design

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.730
optimization, the use
of so-called CDFs,

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.280
concurrent design
facilities, and then

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.220
finally, what happens at CDR.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.120
So the general idea of the
design solution definition

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.490
process is that you
start with something

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.360
like this on the left.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.310
This is a product breakdown
structure, essentially

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.850
your system architecture,
your system decomposition.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.600
And on the right side,
you then translate this

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.790
to a detailed design, OK?

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.924
So for a launch
vehicle, we have,

00:04:07.924 --> 00:04:10.340
you know, the flight segment,
this is what-- actually it's

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.820
gonna fly and it has a payload
element, the spacecraft

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.980
bus, and then the launch and
the launch accommodation.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.470
So that's the general idea is
you have high-level breakdown,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.630
but then you need to
design every piece.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.720
You need to have
chosen your materials.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.180
You need to have
chosen the dimensions.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.580
You need to understand
the interfaces.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.490
And for every part, you
also need to decide what?

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.790
What's a big decision
that you need

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.460
to make when you go to
the detailed design,

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.850
beside, you know, material,
dimensions, software?

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.580
What is always a
big decision to make

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.000
when you do a detailed design?

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.367
Go ahead.

00:04:56.367 --> 00:04:58.325
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
interfaces between the two.

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:00.116
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yep,
interfaces, all that.

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:03.410
What I'm trying
to get at is COTS.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.440
Who knows this acronym, COTS?

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.140
Let's see if the, EPFL,
anybody know COTS?

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.890
What does it mean?

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.742
I think we can't
hear you right now.

00:05:19.742 --> 00:05:21.200
AUDIENCE: Commercial
off the shelf.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.330
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Commercial off the shelf.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.200
So you have to decide
in the detailed design

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.030
are you going to pick
components from a catalog,

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:36.290
or are you going to custom
design these components, right?

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.350
And so one of the
things at the CDR, that

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.150
I always ask the question--

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.310
so you present your CDR design.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.510
What percentage, what fraction
of your parts at the lowest

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.680
level are COTS and what
fraction did you custom design?

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:59.030
Mike, you've done a lot of
these unmanned aerial vehicles

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.600
and so forth.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.730
Can you talk a
little bit about, you

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.890
know, what's the typical
fraction of COTS,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.480
and how do you make that
decision when you design,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.540
you know, a flying thing?

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:14.510
AUDIENCE: It really depends
on the scale and how robust.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.490
The problem with COTS
in the unmanned world

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.422
is that you can easily
go to hobby grade parts.

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:22.880
And so if you want to get into
more of the commercial, kind

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:26.510
of more robust, almost
more like defense

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.510
kind of, like,
robustness and you know,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.010
durability, you
really have to start

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.230
going to custom designed parts.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.050
Because you know, if you
can do a whole design

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.219
space of, you know, all the
COTS parts, but you know,

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.760
they're always just
kind of, you now,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.580
Chinese-made electric motors
and batteries, and none of them

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:46.640
that will perform to,
like, commercial spec,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:50.702
but it just depends, really,
what you need for the vehicle.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:51.660
OLIVIER DE WECK: I see.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:54.410
So what you're saying
is there's a gap.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.440
You can get a lot of COTS stuff
at the hobby shop level, right?

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.880
So they're pretty affordable
but low reliability.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.990
Or you have really high end,
very expensive, you know,

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.120
low production--

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.410
AUDIENCE: Like traditional
aerospace grade, yeah.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.160
OLIVIER DE WECK: But there's
not much in the middle.

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.010
Is that what you're saying?

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah, for sure.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:13.220
Yeah.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.303
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

00:07:14.303 --> 00:07:18.322
So you know, that's the
reality of detailed design

00:07:18.322 --> 00:07:19.280
that you're gonna face.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.000
And surprisingly, in kind of
the formal system engineering

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.550
methodology, there's not
a lot of guidance on this.

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.790
There's not a lot of,
you know, guidance

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.010
to say what's the
optimal fraction

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.260
of commercial off
the shelf parts?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:37.070
This is really something you
have to work out yourself,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.790
and depending on, you know,
whether you're in aerospace

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:47.990
or medical devices or automotive
or making toothpaste, there's--

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.580
actually, yesterday
there was also

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.260
a big case study on diapers.

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.740
Diapers is a $3 billion
business, believe it or not.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:57.275
And they were going
for-- their solution

00:07:57.275 --> 00:08:01.550
A was to go for a COTS solution,
you know, a lot of vendors.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.500
And then they said, no.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.990
It's just gonna give
us, sort of, average,

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.340
mediocre performance.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:08.990
We want something much better.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:12.260
So they went for a much
higher custom design solution.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.650
Took them took them
a while to do it,

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.290
but it was worth it in the end.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:19.160
So this is a big decision
you have to make.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.050
So the point here
being, at the end,

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.517
you have a very detailed design.

00:08:23.517 --> 00:08:24.350
You have blueprints.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.906
You have something you
can actually build.

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:32.840
So you know, this is a list of
all the things you need to do.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.841
You define the solution space,
develop your alternatives.

00:08:36.841 --> 00:08:38.299
All the things
we've already talked

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:41.360
about at the conceptual level,
but you do this at every-- you

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.549
do it at the subsystem
level, and even

00:08:43.549 --> 00:08:45.200
at the component level.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.670
What are the alternate designs?

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.760
Cost performance and schedule.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.050
Select your design
solution, drive it down

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.410
to the lowest level of
detail, and then identify

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.890
the enabling products, which
would be like support equipment

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.460
and things like this.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.690
So the best illustration
I can give you

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:07.550
why this matters is these two
pictures I'm gonna show you.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.040
The top picture
that you see here,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.420
this is a picture that was drawn
in the '70s to sell the space

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.640
shuttle program to US Congress.

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.950
This was the vision, right?

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.500
This is the orbiter,
and you can see

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.250
it's sitting there in this
pristine hangar, right, very

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.820
clean, shiny floors,
maybe four or five people.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.550
The payload bay is open.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.180
There's, like, one or two carts
of ground support equipment.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.970
You just load up your new
satellite, close the doors,

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.250
and off you go for
your next mission.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.770
That's a reusable vehicle.

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:49.420
That's what we wanted, and then
what we actually got is this.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.900
You can't even see
the orbiter, right?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.550
But I promise you,
it's in there.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.830
It's hidden in that scaffolding.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.570
So this was the--
it's retired now,

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.750
but this was the orbiter
processing facility at the NASA

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.640
Kennedy Space Center.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.750
And the reality was
that to turn around

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:12.190
an orbiter between flights
was almost like rebuilding it.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:16.990
And the two subsystems that
required the most person hours

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.780
of work were the main engine--

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:23.200
the main engine basically had
to be disassembled and inspected

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.045
and so forth--

00:10:24.045 --> 00:10:25.295
and what was the other system?

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:28.974
What's that?

00:10:28.974 --> 00:10:29.890
AUDIENCE: Heat shield.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.880
OLIVIER DE WECK: The
heat shield, the TPS,

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.890
thermal protection system--

00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:35.160
if you've ever seen--

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.350
who's seen the shuttle close up?

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:40.420
OK, about half, half here.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.700
At EPFL, who's had a
chance to see the space

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:45.470
shuttle, the orbiter, close up?

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:48.850
Anybody?

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:51.730
Go ahead.

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:53.174
AUDIENCE: One or two.

00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:54.340
OLIVIER DE WECK: One or two.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.900
So those of you
that have seen it,

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.300
what did you notice
about the heat shield?

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.520
Did you notice anything
about the protection,

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.927
the thermal protection system?

00:11:03.927 --> 00:11:04.510
Who's seen it?

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.182
AUDIENCE: We do not
hear very well here.

00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:13.640
OLIVIER DE WECK:
You can't hear me?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.680
So the point I want
to make here is

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.710
that the thermal protection
system, every tile

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.880
is different.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.480
Every tile has a different
shape, a different curvature,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.810
and there were good
thermodynamic reasons,

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:36.060
aerothermodynamic
reasons for that,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.410
but in terms of actually
designing, manufacturing,

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:43.340
and turning around the vehicle,
it was a nightmare, right?

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:47.330
So that it turned out to be
not a very reusable vehicle

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:48.350
in the end, and why?

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.180
Because a lot of
the detailed design

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.870
decisions ended
up being critical,

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:58.820
in terms of not really
giving us what we wanted,

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.980
in terms of macro level
properties of the vehicle.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.880
So detailed design
really matters.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.040
Did you get that point, at EPFL?

00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:07.610
Is it clear?

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.309
AUDIENCE: It is.

00:12:14.309 --> 00:12:15.600
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, thank you.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.680
So here's some--

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.890
I'm not going to go
through this in detail,

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.910
but here's some flow diagrams,
process flow diagrams,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.040
from the System
Engineering Handbook

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.090
that essentially describe,
you know, how this works.

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:34.530
So your inputs are your baseline
logical decomposition model,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.620
which is essentially your
system architecture, right?

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.190
And then your baseline derived,
your detailed technical

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:42.630
requirements.

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.779
You go through all
these processes,

00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:46.320
through all these
steps, and then you

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.360
end up with a whole
bunch of outputs, which

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.620
are more detailed requirements.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.380
The specifications,
do you remember,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:58.200
we teased apart requirements
and specifications?

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.930
Requirements are what
the system should do.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.470
Requirement specifications are
how the system's actually been

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.600
designed, right, blueprints.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.270
So that's specifications
at the subsystem level.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:13.590
And then you get other things,
like a verification, validation

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.870
plan, and then logistics
and operating procedures.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.970
So very, very detailed work.

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.120
The other thing that's
important is all the design

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.970
considerations that go
into making detailed design

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:25.580
decisions.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.390
So here's a fairly
long list of them,

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:32.290
and you can group them into
performance, availability.

00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.480
This is more related
to reliability.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:38.710
So you could have a system that
has high nominal performance

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.650
but is poor reliability,
right, so it's not available

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:42.190
very much.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.390
That's not good.

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:46.420
We want high performance
and high availability.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:49.000
That gives you your
technical effectiveness.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.280
And then how do you
actually operate the system?

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:54.820
So operations,
maintenance, logistics,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.320
so that's process efficiency.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.107
Together, that gives you
system effectiveness.

00:13:59.107 --> 00:14:00.940
And then, of course,
you have the total cost

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.820
of operating the system--
lifecycle cost, total ownership

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:04.660
cost.

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:06.610
And then system
effectiveness and cost

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:09.610
together, give you what's called
here affordable operational

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:10.960
effectiveness.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.530
So I would argue, in terms
of the space shuttle program,

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.170
it had high system performance.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.175
It had OK system availability.

00:14:21.175 --> 00:14:23.550
They had-- definitely there
were some reliability issues,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.980
but it was manageable, but
it had very poor process

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.110
efficiency--

00:14:28.110 --> 00:14:31.750
operations, maintenance,
logistics very, very difficult.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:35.830
So system effectiveness wasn't
that high, and as a result,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.580
the lifecycle cost
was also very high.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.400
There's a very
famous paper, where

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.740
after the shuttle
program was ended,

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:46.680
a lifecycle cost
analysis was done,

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:52.080
and it turned out that one
launch cost about $1.5 billion.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:53.880
So during the program,
people would say,

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.640
oh, one launch is
maybe $500 million,

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.510
you know, the variable cost,
and the rest is fixed cost.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.270
But once the program is done,
it doesn't matter anymore

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.160
whether it was fixed
or variable cost.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:08.370
All you know is what was the
total cost of the program,

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.560
how many launches
did we actually do,

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.180
and you just take the ratio.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.200
And it was $1.5 billion
per launch of the shuttle.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.720
And so I would say
that's way off from what

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.130
the original target was.

00:15:20.130 --> 00:15:22.110
Yeah, Veronica?

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.550
AUDIENCE: Does that number
account for crew and crew

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.050
training?

00:15:27.539 --> 00:15:28.830
OLIVIER DE WECK: Good question.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:29.670
I think so.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.060
I think it basically-- whatever
was appropriated by Congress

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.580
for the shuttle
program, and I think

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:41.190
that would include crew
operations, as well, yeah.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.790
So I'm happy to point you
to that paper, actually.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:44.330
Yes?

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.719
AUDIENCE: It also accounted
for R&D costs as well, right?

00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:48.260
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yes, that's correct.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:50.000
It includes everything, all in.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.400
R&D costs-- R&D
took about 10 years

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.540
and then operations
was about 30 years.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:01.080
OK, so you see--

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:04.570
and of course, within
these are budget limits.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:08.280
So part of the reason
why the shuttle didn't

00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:10.140
have that high
process efficiency

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:14.520
was because the R&D budget
was capped pretty tightly.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.470
So rather than
optimizing, you know,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.470
for maintainability
and turnaround,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:22.560
they said, we need to have
the system performance.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.960
We need to have reasonable
system availability,

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:29.230
and then the rest, basically, is
we're gonna deal with it later.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.160
So what effectively
happened is they capped

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.900
R&D cost, and as a result,
the lifecycle cost ballooned.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.400
I would argue if
they had spent, you

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.610
know, two or three
more years optimizing,

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.200
you know, maintenance
and turn around,

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.160
really making it reusable,
the lifecycle costs could

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:52.190
have been much better, but
that's not how it worked.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:55.580
So you have a lot of these
competing requirements.

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:57.770
And so I want to
just ask you this--

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.800
this is the first concept
question today, OK?

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.920
So imagine you're-- this
is a very detailed design.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.109
This is just a bracket here, OK?

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:11.990
And this bracket was designed
so it has, like, a tip load.

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.109
Think of this as
a cantilever beam.

00:17:15.109 --> 00:17:18.510
So it's attached on the
right side or left side here.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.650
You have a load, and then
this is your displacement

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.140
under a given load.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:28.250
And these three brackets
all have the same mass.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.970
They use the same
amount of material, OK?

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:36.980
So you can think of this as you
get from the very simple design

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:39.830
to the more intricate design,
you have more design freedom.

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:41.150
So you get better performance.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:44.660
You see the
displacement goes down,

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:46.710
but you also have
more complexity.

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:48.680
So it's more
difficult to optimize.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.900
It's more difficult to
manufacture and so forth.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.940
And so we can actually show
these three choices here

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:58.820
on a manufacturing
cost, per unit cost,

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:01.760
versus the displacement,
structural displacement

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.290
under load chart.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.660
So our simple design,
our one bar design,

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:09.440
has a displacement of 2.5
millimeters under load,

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.090
and it costs about $2 to make.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:16.160
The two-bar design has
much better performance,

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.990
like 0.75 or something like
that, costs about $3 to make.

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:23.570
And then this 17-bar
intricate design

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:28.670
has 0.6 millimeters, so the
best structural performance,

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.760
but its cost is
about $8 per piece.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.910
So my question to you is
which of these three designs

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:39.210
would you select and why?

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:44.700
So if you could go to that
link, enter your answer,

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.300
and then we'll look
at the distribution.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.180
So we have 39 responses.

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:52.750
That's good.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:53.930
Ah, interesting.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:56.700
OK.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.430
So one of you said
you're gonna go

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.940
for the super-duper
17-bar design.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:08.800
Most of you, 74%, said
the two-bar design.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.410
And one of you said one bar.

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:15.040
And then eight of you,
20%, said you're not sure.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.830
I guess you need more
information, right?

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:22.930
So who picked the one-bar
design, the simple design?

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:28.312
OK, so please explain
why you picked that.

00:19:28.312 --> 00:19:29.770
AUDIENCE: Well,
for my application.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:31.570
I'm planning on
mass producing them,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.280
and it's for
something that doesn't

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.110
need the degree of displacement
that the other ones are doing,

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:43.180
and so I'm really only seeking
to minimize manufacturing cost,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:46.180
and the one bar is the
easiest to manufacture

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.910
and also gives me
room down the road

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.490
to iterate if it's not working.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.430
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so So what
would be an example, industry

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:54.280
or application?

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.380
AUDIENCE: Like a
children's toy, perhaps,

00:19:56.380 --> 00:20:04.019
where you don't need very strict
requirements on displacement,

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:05.560
something that you're
mass producing.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:07.685
OLIVIER DE WECK: Something
mass produced, you know,

00:20:07.685 --> 00:20:10.740
for sort of lower requirements.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.170
OK, I think that's
a valid answer.

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.390
Most of you said
the two-bar design.

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:17.800
So who said two bars?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:21.190
Let's see at EPFL, who
picked the two-bar design?

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:26.400
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:30.550
It gives you the biggest
biggest bang for your buck.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:35.600
For not that much more cost, you
get a much more sturdy design

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.440
and that's compared
for the 17-bar one.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.420
Really, it's still
pretty sturdy,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.120
but you're paying much
less, so it seems optimal.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.390
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so if
you think about this in a Pareto

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:50.870
sense, I mean, they're
all Pareto-optimal,

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:53.330
but this one is at the
knee of the curve, right?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:57.310
So you're getting, you said
bang for your buck or value.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:01.970
If you did, like, a displacement
or one over displacement,

00:21:01.970 --> 00:21:07.040
I guess, per manufacturing cost,
this one would do pretty well.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.760
So that's also a
very sensible answer.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.740
Who picked the 17-bar design,
the really intricate one?

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:17.640
Who picked that?

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.910
Oh, I think I might have picked
that when I tried out the form.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:25.090
[LAUGHS] I think so.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.700
I can't remember now.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:30.710
It's been already a while ago.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:34.140
So if, indeed, I was the one,
so how would I justify this?

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:37.830
OK, so here this
bracket will go--

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.060
this will go on the
Mars 2020 Rover.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:50.280
And the Rover will see a lot
of different thermal gradients.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.160
You know, it has
to be very precise

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.560
because it holds
scientific instruments that

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.275
need to be, you know,
pointing very accurately.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.210
Even though the mass here
is identical, but I think

00:22:03.210 --> 00:22:04.110
we could shrink this.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:06.840
You know, we get the best
performance structurally

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:09.870
for the mass constraint
that we were allocated.

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.770
And cost, you know, this
is all taxpayer dollars,

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:15.510
so this is a government program.

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.220
So we can spend the money.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.860
Of course, I don't
mean that really,

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.820
but it is a high-performance
application.

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.120
Therefore, even though
the benefit is only small,

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.330
that small benefit
is worth it when

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:29.580
you look at the whole mission.

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.950
So we're we're going
to pay for that,

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:35.410
and we're going to go for
this high-performance design.

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:36.900
Do you see how that works?

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:38.900
So the right answer--

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.780
and I think a lot of you said,
you know, you're not sure,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:43.250
and it's because--

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.930
who said you're not sure?

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.779
Nathan.

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:49.320
AUDIENCE: I said
not sure because you

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.790
don't know all
the specifications

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:53.790
or what the tolerances are
or any other information that

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.532
would lead you to
make that decision.

00:22:55.532 --> 00:22:57.240
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right,
so you know, what

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.500
are the requirements, right?

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.000
We don't know the
requirements here.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.520
Are the requirements shall
or should requirements?

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.520
If it's a shall
requirement, what it means

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.135
is there would be some
hard limit here, right?

00:23:09.135 --> 00:23:12.570
The displacement shall be
less than one millimeter.

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.530
If that's a hard requirement,
then this solution falls out,

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:17.850
does not satisfy.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.770
And if it's a
should requirement,

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.410
then it's a goal that
you're gonna trade off.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.750
The point I want to
make here, this lecture

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.460
is about detailed design.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.920
This is detailed design, right?

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.400
And you're gonna make hundreds
or thousands of detailed design

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.580
decisions just like this
bracket and together,

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:37.890
they're gonna give you, you
know, the performance cost

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:40.140
of your whole system.

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.330
And so every detailed
design decision

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:46.020
you make needs to be informed
by the requirements but also

00:23:46.020 --> 00:23:49.590
the trade-offs between
these properties.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:51.520
Does that make sense?

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.980
OK.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.050
So and that leads
us-- and so you

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.240
want to make sure you
optimize your system.

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.680
You want to make sure you get--

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.900
and I liked, Katya, the
way you said it-- get

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.280
the bang for your buck, right?

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:07.590
You want to make sure you don't
have a lot of inefficiencies

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.470
in your design.

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.290
So that's what MDO is about.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:14.860
So let me go to MDO
here, what it is.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.900
So there's a technical committee
in AIAA, the American Institute

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.340
for Aeronautics
and Astronautics,

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.620
that was founded
about 20 years ago.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.780
So it's defined as an evolving
methodology, a body of methods,

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:32.430
techniques, algorithms,
and related application

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.040
practices for the design
of engineering systems,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.650
coupled by physical
phenomena and involving

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:40.740
many interacting
subsystems and parts.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.050
So the main things
you need to do MDO

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:48.330
are a mathematical model of the
system, analysis capability,

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:50.850
and in some cases,
approximation concepts.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.500
So what that means is not--

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.500
if you put all this together,
it could be very, very slow

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.780
and computationally heavy.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.250
So you might approximate
some of these things,

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.560
and I'll explain
a couple examples.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:05.490
Sensitivity analysis,
optimization processes,

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.670
and a human interface-- those
are the main ingredients

00:25:08.670 --> 00:25:09.240
of MDO.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.610
Who's seen this chart before?

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.800
OK, about three or four of you.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:23.030
Who's seen this chart before at
EPFL, this particular graphic?

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.510
Anybody seen this before?

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:27.890
AUDIENCE: Apparently, no one.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.514
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
so let me explain.

00:25:29.514 --> 00:25:33.590
This is a cartoon, OK, and
I've experienced this myself

00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:36.440
working at McDonnell
Douglas in the '90s.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:40.430
So each of these
airplanes shown here

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.500
is what the airplane
would look like

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:46.400
if that particular
discipline or group could

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.160
call all the shots, OK?

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.720
So let's look at
a couple of these.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:56.890
So the controls group is
all about controllability.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:02.030
So you see the flight control
surfaces are very big.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:03.860
Now, the problem
is the linkages,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.010
you know, these control
linkages are on the outside.

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.870
That's really bad
for aerodynamics,

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:14.260
but the controls people say,
I don't care about drag.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.090
I need to make sure my
control surfaces are

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:18.790
deflecting appropriately.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:20.480
Here's the hydraulics
group, right?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:24.470
It's all about the
hydraulic pump, the filters,

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.480
and getting hydraulic
pressure to all

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.040
the different subsystems.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.650
You know, the big engine
here, the power plant group,

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.990
the engine is the
most important thing.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.090
The loft group-- loft means--

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:37.100
lofting is surfaces.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.630
You're dealing with
the shape of surfaces.

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:41.030
So let's keep this simple.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:43.310
So we have a little,
you know, balsa airplane

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:48.500
with little straight
surfaces, very easy for loft.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.770
Production is kind of similar.

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:55.490
The aerodynamics group wants
a very nice high aspect ratio

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:59.120
wing, very thin, very low drag.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.810
Problem is, there's no room
for passengers or cargo here.

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:05.360
You see this, the stress group?

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.950
They have a nice wing here
in the shape of an I-beam.

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:11.930
I-beams are great, you know,
this is good if you're a civil

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.390
engineer but not so much--

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:16.800
none of these things
would work on their own.

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.400
So what we really
want is something

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.540
like this, where all
these considerations are

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:28.340
blended and optimized so we get
a high-performance system not

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:30.620
just a high-performance
subsystem.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:34.250
Said another way, a
high-performance system

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:38.720
is not the same as just a
sum of individually optimized

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.100
subsystems.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:44.010
That's, in a nutshell,
what MDO is about.

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.000
So one of the readings
for today, post readings,

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.415
is this paper, 6A.

00:27:49.415 --> 00:27:53.420
And this is based on a big
workshop we had in Germany

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.302
about five years ago.

00:27:56.302 --> 00:27:57.260
That's actually longer.

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.850
It's probably seven
years ago by now,

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.190
but the paper came
out five years ago

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:05.074
called, "MDO, Assessment and
Direction for Advancement."

00:28:05.074 --> 00:28:06.740
And this is a pretty
international group

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:08.480
that put this together.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.360
And what we do in the paper,
we describe the history

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.690
of multidisciplinary
optimization, where

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.330
it is today, where it's heading,
and some of the key milestones.

00:28:18.330 --> 00:28:23.240
So this chart is essentially
a kind of history of MDO.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.520
I'm just gonna point
out a few things.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.460
The roots of MDO are in
structural optimization.

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.520
So you saw the bracket
with all those--

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.840
so there's actually a field
called structural optimization

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.590
or topology optimization,
and it's very mature now.

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.290
So you can buy, in some
of the CAD packages,

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.450
there's some specialized tools
for optimizing structures.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:50.600
And when you look at it,
it looks like Swiss cheese

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.720
with big holes, an
Emmentaler, big holes.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.760
You don't need a
lot of structure

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.180
that doesn't do work for you.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:01.020
So a lot of these
structures look like webs,

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.930
and the reason is
because the load

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.090
path has been highly optimized.

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:09.302
For example, if you
look at the A380--

00:29:09.302 --> 00:29:10.760
I don't have a
picture right here--

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:17.320
but you can look at an A380 wing
spars and different structures.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.390
They have more
holes than structure

00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:24.680
because they've been
highly optimized.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.930
So that's the roots of
MDO, starting in the 1960s.

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.770
Then, I would say, in the '80s,
mid-'80s, we started having

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:36.680
more complex
decomposition techniques,

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.180
and I will describe one
of these to you today.

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:43.220
Optimization
algorithms were started

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:46.280
to be built into
mainstream programs

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.610
like Excel, MATLAB, Mathematica.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:56.010
And then more recently,
you know, in the 2000s,

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.655
we had commercialization
of multilevel algorithms,

00:29:59.655 --> 00:30:01.905
and the one that I'll describe
to you is called BLISS.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:10.040
So let's talk through a very
specific example, and then

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.100
one of those techniques.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.380
So here's the example.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:17.690
You're designing a wing,
and in designing a wing,

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:22.520
the two main considerations
are structural and aerodynamic.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.970
So here's a simplified wing.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.020
It has a wing area,
it has a sweep angle,

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.120
it has an aspect
ratio, and so forth.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:36.110
And there's loads
acting on the wing

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:38.510
as you're flying
because of the pressure

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.770
differential between the
upper and lower surface.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:45.950
So there's some net force,
P, acting on this wing.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:49.700
And as a result of that,
the wing will warp.

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:53.690
So you will have some
twist angle in the wing,

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.570
and that's just due to the
structural deformation.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:01.640
So that twist angle and
the displacements, in turn,

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.990
will change the drag that
the wing experiences.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.120
So the lift and drag
of the wing will change

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.180
as a function of twist angle.

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:15.800
But as the lift and drag
change, the loads, of course,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.190
then change as well, and it
feeds back into the structure.

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.780
And in this case, what we're
looking for is maximum range.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.050
We want to maximize the
range of the airplane.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:30.410
And this is a sort
of simplified version

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.260
of the range equation, the
so-called Breguet range

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.530
equation.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:38.450
And you can see that
the structure influences

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:41.450
the range in two ways--
directly by weight,

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.430
the actual weight
of the structure

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:48.170
enters here twice in the range
equation, and then indirectly

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.510
through its stiffness, right?

00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:53.000
The softer it is, the more
displacements, the more

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.780
you affect the drag.

00:31:54.780 --> 00:31:59.600
So it's not so clear then
what is an optimal wing?

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.700
Is it the lightest
wing possible?

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.330
But the lightest wing possible
will have a larger twist

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:09.740
and may have more drag, which
will reduce your range, right?

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:13.600
So should you optimize
the wing for lightness

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.350
or for this minimum
displacement or some combination

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:19.880
or mix of the two?

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.670
And the answer, of course,
is it's a mix of the two.

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:25.010
There will be a
sweet spot somewhere,

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.470
you know, between a very
stiff and very heavy

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:31.330
wing and a very, very
flexible, lightweight wing.

00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:34.250
There will be some
optimal mix of the two,

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.860
and that's the key here.

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.430
So let me discuss
with you briefly--

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:41.820
this is just one of the methods.

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.110
There are several methods for
doing multidisciplinary design

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:46.880
optimization, but
this is one of them

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.320
called BLISS, Bi-Level
Integrated Systems Synthesis.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.170
And the general idea
here in this method

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:59.420
is that we have a lower level
optimization of each subsystem

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:02.840
but it's coupled through a
system level optimization.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:05.600
And what you want is, you
know, an optimal design

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.110
at the system level, not
just optimal subsystems.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:11.870
So the context
here is we're gonna

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:15.740
design a high speed, a
supersonic business jet.

00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:19.110
It's kind of shown
in this gray picture.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:22.200
And we have four
major subsystems

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.640
we're gonna consider--
propulsion, aerodynamics,

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.100
structures, and then
the performance, which,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.890
in this case, is range, OK?

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:35.120
And what's important here in
decomposing the problem is

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.280
the x's and the y's.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.194
Now, the x's are the
design variables.

00:33:39.194 --> 00:33:41.360
Do you remember, we talk
about the design variables,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.090
the knobs you can
turn as a designer?

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:46.940
And so these here
are-- the upper ones,

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.730
we call them local design
variables, you know,

00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:53.360
like the throttle setting, the
tail sweep, the wing moment

00:33:53.360 --> 00:34:00.080
arm, the thickness of the
wings, the taper ratio.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.630
So the idea of a
local design variable

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:07.010
is that design variable only is
used in one of the subsystems.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:10.610
It's local to that subsystem.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:16.429
So you basically can choose
that in each of the subsystems,

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.159
and it doesn't really
affect directly

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:21.620
any of the other
subsystems-- indirectly, yes,

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.600
but not directly.

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.130
And then we have the y's here.

00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:30.000
The y's are the outputs from
one subsystem to another.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.940
So drag, lift, NZ is
your maximum load factor,

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:38.360
your range, your specific fuel
consumption, your wing twist,

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.510
and so forth.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.250
So those are outputs from a
subsystem or discipline that

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:45.170
either matter at
the system level

00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:49.550
or are required as inputs
by another subsystem.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:52.580
And then finally, the
last group here, these

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.010
are known as the shared
design variables,

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:57.470
so the wing aspect
ratio, the altitude,

00:34:57.470 --> 00:35:01.460
mach number, wing sweep.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:05.920
Those are basically required
by more than one subsystem, so

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:09.050
two, three, or
four, in this case.

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.980
Then they are considered
as shared variables,

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.970
and they would be considered
system level variables

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.540
because they matter for
more than one subsystem.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.750
So what this
particular method does

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:25.450
is essentially
decompose the problem

00:35:25.450 --> 00:35:28.900
into the various subsystems,
so in this case, again,

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:32.330
aerodynamics, propulsion,
structures, and range.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.610
And these subsystems are sending
this information to each other

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.430
and are all tied together
at the highest level

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:41.560
through the shared
variables, the shared design

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.760
variables that are shared
by at least two subsystems.

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.590
So again, local
variables are only

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.490
unique to a specific subsystem,
and then for the wise,

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:54.520
these outputs, internal
outputs, there's

00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:58.300
a distinction between
the Y stars, which

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.750
are coupling variables that are
input to a particular subsystem

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:04.360
and then the Y hats
are coupling variables

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:07.990
that are output from a
particular subsystem.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:12.610
So let's zoom in now on
just one of the subsystems,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:17.000
let's say, aerodynamics,
and see how this works.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.800
So here we're zooming
in on one subsystem,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.750
and that's the aerodynamics.

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:24.700
And the idea that
you can actually

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:29.480
optimize just the aerodynamic
subsystem by itself.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.930
So what are the inputs into it?

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:40.390
We have aspect ratio, wing
twist, and W. So what is W?

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:42.480
And this is key to this
particular method--

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.430
the W are the
weights, the weights

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.750
that you give to the outputs.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.600
So what you're optimizing here
is some objective function, f,

00:36:52.600 --> 00:37:01.780
shown here below, which is W1,
Y1, plus W2, Y2 plus W3, Y3.

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:04.460
So you're either maximizing
or minimizing that.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.410
And what is this here?

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.460
It's lift, drag, and
the lift to drag ratio.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:12.100
So what's really cool
about this method is

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:17.050
that what it essentially
is telling the subsystem

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.340
is how to properly weight these
different outputs in order

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.890
to optimize the
subsystem, taking into

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:27.140
account the system
level objective.

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.350
So the weights are
not pre-defined,

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:33.310
but the weights themselves
are a design variable.

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.950
And so you can see the
formulation on the right side.

00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:41.960
So given Q, which is
your shared variables,

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:43.930
the Y stars, which
are the inputs

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.780
from the other subsystems,
and the weights,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:51.820
minimize your objective function
by varying your local design

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:56.660
variables subject to a
bunch of constraints, OK?

00:37:56.660 --> 00:38:00.490
And so what is one
of the consequences

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:02.830
of being able to formulate
the problem this way?

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:07.330
So this could be a very high
fidelity, aerodynamics model,

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:11.800
computational fluid dynamics,
or it could be what?

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:18.710
Or it could be a lower
fidelity code, right?

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:22.100
As long as the inputs and
the outputs are the same,

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.200
you can now plug in, you know,
different fidelity levels

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:31.010
of analysis, you know
something simple or something

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:33.470
based on experimental
results, you

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:36.890
know, panel method,
very high fidelity CFD.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:38.960
This becomes very modular.

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.550
The other thing
you can do is you

00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:44.700
can pre-compute a lot of
these responses, right?

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.160
So for a given
set of inputs, you

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:53.190
can pre-compute over a whole
range of input variables

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.040
what the response of
that subsystem will be,

00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.290
and you can store
that information

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.840
and then use what are
known approximation

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.570
methods, like response
surface models,

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:06.900
to save that information,
such that when

00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.980
you do the full
system optimization,

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.090
you don't have to rerun,
you know, the detailed codes

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:12.810
every time.

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:16.040
You can just pull
from the approximation

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.390
you've pre-computed already.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.520
So that's one of the
really powerful things

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.120
about this method.

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.880
And that's what's shown
here, is you substitute--

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:29.700
you have a series of
approximation models, one

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.710
for each of the
outputs of the system.

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:32.580
You see that?

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.860
So these little
wiggly things here

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.200
are essentially an
approximation of

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.100
that input/output relationship
at the subsystem level.

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:44.730
Could be an empirical function,
a neural network, a response

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:48.540
surface method, or you
know, simplified engineering

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.860
analysis.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.400
So you do a lot of this
work offline ahead of time

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:55.590
for each of the subsystems.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.060
Does that make sense?

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:58.980
Any questions at EPFL?

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.340
Is that clear how this
works, at least in theory?

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:07.520
AUDIENCE: Everything's
fine, thanks.

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:12.500
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, so what
we have now is essentially

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.570
these subsystem approximations,
and now we can use them

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.470
for system level optimization.

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:23.770
So now let's look at the
system level optimization.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:27.430
So that's essentially
given approximation

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:30.970
models for optimized
subsystem outputs,

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.070
we want to minimize
some objective function.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:38.920
So F, here in this case, which
is a function of our shared

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:45.820
variables, our relevant outputs,
Y star, and the weighting

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.370
factors, right, the omega--

00:40:48.370 --> 00:40:51.760
not the omegas, the W's, which
are the weighting factors given

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.920
to each of the subsystems.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:57.670
And we of course, have
to satisfy constraints

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.080
at the system level.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.780
So let me show you an example
then of what this looks like.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.250
So here's our supersonic jet.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.590
This is our cycle zero,
our initial condition.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:14.890
Here's the planned
form of the jet,

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:16.900
and I'm going to show
you down here range

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:21.160
and just one of the design
variables, or a set of design

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.200
variables, which is our
wing box sheet thickness.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:29.320
So you go through this, and
it converges after 10 cycles

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.340
already.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:34.660
So this is what our business
jet looks like after 10 cycles.

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.050
And you know, you see there's
a pretty big difference.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:40.360
So the fuselage is much longer.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.810
This by the way, this is
the same in ships, right?

00:41:42.810 --> 00:41:46.900
Your speed that you can
reach, your max speed

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:51.040
is driven by your fuselage
length, your water length.

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:54.430
You can see the wings have
a pretty high sweep angle.

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:58.060
This is a supersonic jet.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.370
And if we look at
the details, we

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.520
see that the range
here, the range

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.960
is about 3,000 nautical
miles, and what

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.920
you see is that the exact
range that can be achieved

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:14.210
and the approximate range merge.

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:18.850
So the approximation models
that you have in this method

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:19.900
are only approximate.

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.430
There's some error.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:23.950
And you know, as you run
the model several times,

00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:26.050
several iterations,
the difference

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.710
between the approximation and
the actual high fidelity result

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:33.310
gets less and less, so that
it's actually a feasible design.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:36.340
And then over here, we see
the different thicknesses

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.770
for the inner wing
box, the mid span wing

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.900
box, and the outer wing box.

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.320
And you can see that early
on in the first four or five

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.840
six iterations, things
are kind of moving around,

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.570
but then they're settling out.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:54.190
And so for this maximum
objective of range,

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:59.290
you can see that the inner, mid,
and outer wing box thicknesses

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:01.160
are quite different.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:04.930
So that's the general idea
here is that this result--

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:10.630
this is a fairly detailed design
was produced based on a system

00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:13.450
level optimization that
included consideration

00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:18.370
of aerodynamic structures,
propulsion, and so forth.

00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:19.870
And there are several
other methods,

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.170
but this is just one
of the methods that's

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:27.010
been actually quite helpful.

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:30.130
The challenges now in MDO,
in this multidisciplinary

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.530
optimization are
different trade-offs.

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:35.920
So one trade-off is between
fidelity versus how expensive

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.290
is it computationally.

00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:39.760
So fidelity is over here.

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:42.580
So high fidelity
means, you know,

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:45.970
3D finite element model
analysis, computational fluid

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:46.999
dynamics.

00:43:46.999 --> 00:43:48.790
Then you have sort of
intermediate fidelity

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.610
or low fidelity
empirical models.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:55.060
And then on this axis, we
have just doing trade studies,

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.070
meaning you have sort
of a baseline design

00:43:57.070 --> 00:43:59.960
and you just explore from
that baseline design.

00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.460
You do limited optimization
or iteration or full MDO,

00:44:03.460 --> 00:44:05.770
exploring the full space.

00:44:05.770 --> 00:44:08.230
And traditionally,
you had to choose,

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.300
am I gonna use high
fidelity models?

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.850
But then I can only
look at a few points.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:16.210
So then the question
is can you do better?

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.730
Is there a better
solution out there?

00:44:18.730 --> 00:44:21.760
Or you can do lower
fidelity models

00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:24.610
and explore the design
space very widely,

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.050
and then the
question is, can you

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.510
believe the results
because you've done

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.360
this with approximate models?

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.840
So the real challenge here is we
would like to do high fidelity

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.370
and explore the
full design space.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:40.750
So that's one of the big
research areas in MDO

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:45.730
is high fidelity but also very
computationally efficient.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:49.160
And then the other
challenge is quite similar.

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:52.150
So it's again the
fidelity here, but then

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.730
should you just focus
on one subsystem?

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:57.070
How many of the subsystems,
including, you know,

00:44:57.070 --> 00:45:01.150
the financial, operations,
manufacturing considerations,

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:02.950
so how many of those
subsystems do you

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:06.130
include in your optimization?

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:10.930
And so you know, ideally, you'd
like to do the complete system,

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.600
but then you may
have to sacrifice

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.740
on some of the fidelity.

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.440
So that's the breadth
versus depth trade-off.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.860
OK so any questions about--

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.640
I know this was very fast.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:30.450
I do not expect you, by the
way, for assignment four or five

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.840
to do MDO on your CanSat.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.950
This is really more to give
you a feeling for, you know,

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:40.860
how far things
have come and some

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.420
of the computational
frameworks that

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:46.980
exist to get you to a really
fine tuned optimized design.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.050
If you are interested
in this, you know,

00:45:49.050 --> 00:45:50.910
we have the spring class.

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:56.400
And you know, I hadn't offered
this class at EPFL in the past,

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:59.100
but we actually do
offer a distance version

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:00.810
with the SDM program.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.890
So there may be an option to
do this at a distance as well.

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.190
We'll discuss it.

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:07.860
But any questions about MDO?

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.550
What it is, how it works,
at least in principle?

00:46:11.550 --> 00:46:14.160
Has anybody done
MDO kind of work?

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.347
Sam, go ahead

00:46:16.347 --> 00:46:18.180
AUDIENCE: I just had
one question about if--

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:21.920
so here, we're looking at
optimizing on one attribute, so

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:25.850
range, but if we have
multiple attributes,

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:28.280
it's still up to
someone to decide

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.340
how important those
attributes are in the end.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.000
OLIVIER DE WECK: That's correct.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.630
That is exactly
right, unless you

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:40.040
have a way to combine all these
into one objective function.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.180
And to be blatant
about it, to be-- you

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.080
know, in the commercial
world, that's actually clear.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.550
It's profit or
net present value.

00:46:50.550 --> 00:46:53.740
So if you're designing
a commercial product

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:58.220
in a competitive
industry, you can actually

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.880
pretty easily combine
all this into a long--

00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:05.780
you know, as long as you include
sort of the key drivers of,

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.880
you know, your
manufacturing costs.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.970
If the product is not as
optimal and not as performant,

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:14.640
well, probably, you're not
gonna be as successful.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.304
Your market share
might be lower.

00:47:16.304 --> 00:47:17.720
So in the commercial
world, people

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:21.800
are doing MDO with profitability
as the ultimate objective

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:23.000
function.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.470
Now, for situations where it's
not about profit necessarily,

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:32.626
but it's about a bunch
of other considerations,

00:47:32.626 --> 00:47:34.000
then you can't
easily combine it.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.960
You can still do utility.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.650
You can do a utility, you
know, combine it in utility.

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:42.020
But I agree with you, I think
a good practice is then,

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:44.930
in that case, to do
the multi-objective,

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:47.630
and then you're gonna have
a bunch of solutions that

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.750
are all non-dominated, right?

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.150
And then it's a human
decision making process

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:56.185
to pick among those.

00:47:56.185 --> 00:47:58.090
Any other questions or comments?

00:47:58.090 --> 00:47:59.500
What about at EPFL?

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:03.360
MDO, anybody have
experience with this before,

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.660
multidisciplinary
design optimization?

00:48:09.532 --> 00:48:11.020
AUDIENCE: OK, no one, again.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.900
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
that's all right.

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:17.620
So just to tell you, this is
really a big deal in practice.

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.500
So you know, the structural
optimization has been around,

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:24.430
that's pretty standard
practice, and you know,

00:48:24.430 --> 00:48:26.800
optimizing control systems.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.150
So we've optimized individual
subsystems for a long time now,

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.690
at least two or three decades,
but optimizing at the system

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:36.620
level is relatively new.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:39.670
And I think the best companies,
the best organizations that

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:43.150
are out there, they're really
investing in this technology,

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:44.810
and they're quite good at it.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:47.110
And that's where you can
really distinguish yourself

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.620
from the competition.

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.200
So let's talk about
concurrent design facilities.

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:57.850
And so I'm actually going to
use some material here from EPFL

00:48:57.850 --> 00:49:00.490
because they have
a very nice CDF,

00:49:00.490 --> 00:49:03.910
and I want to give
credit here to Dr. Anton

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:09.670
Ivanov at the Swiss Space Center
for some of this material.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:13.380
And actually one of the papers
is also related to this.

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:15.310
Anton used to be at JPL.

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:21.400
He worked at JPL for close to
a decade before going to EPFL.

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:24.940
So what is a CDF, a
concurrent design facility?

00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.010
It's essentially an
environment where

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:28.600
engineers of
different disciplines

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.730
come together to
perform, you know,

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.130
a system engineering
study for a project.

00:49:33.130 --> 00:49:35.740
Key elements that you need
is the team, the process,

00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.510
the physical environment,
which includes

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.690
the A/V and the software,
and then also some way

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:42.970
to do knowledge
management, meaning

00:49:42.970 --> 00:49:48.730
capturing the results of prior
studies and ongoing studies.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:52.930
And I'll show you
some examples of CDFs.

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:54.620
We also do this in academia.

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:56.890
There's challenges for
doing this in academia,

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.530
a short learning curve, you
know, synchronizing this

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.390
with the academic
schedule, and then

00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:06.560
a lot of turnover, of course, as
students graduate and so forth.

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.230
So there's challenges.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.790
And in practice, what we
essentially have is, in a CDF,

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:18.050
we have a set of models that
are linked to each other.

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:20.200
And these models can
be, for example, here's

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:23.310
some Simulink models shown.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:27.520
Here, there is
some Excel models.

00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:29.140
You can have CAD.

00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.750
And one of the tricks is, you
know, to link this together

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:35.230
in a way that you can quickly
execute different designs

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:38.870
and look at the
results from that.

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:43.120
So in industrial settings,
probably the most famous CDF

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.540
is the one at JPL, at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:52.600
called Team X. Team X has been
around for about 20 years,

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:58.900
and they just had an anniversary
where they celebrated

00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:05.560
their 1000th study that was
done at Team X. A typical Team X

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:07.780
study is about a week.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.570
So you do a little
bit of preparation,

00:51:10.570 --> 00:51:14.110
but people work together in
the facility for about a week,

00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:16.300
and at the end of
the week, you have

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:21.970
basically a conceptual design
pretty well worked out.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:23.870
And the results have
been impressive.

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:26.470
So studies have shown
that the cost estimates

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:30.550
that Team X came up with were
within 10% of final mission

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:34.540
costs, for those missions that
were actually built and flown.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.710
So of the 1,000 studies that
Team X did, a handful of them

00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:40.820
were actual flight missions.

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:46.960
But every proposal
that is written

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.480
starts now as a Team X study.

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:52.120
So it's really a big deal.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:57.310
The European Space Agency
ESTEC has a similar facility

00:51:57.310 --> 00:52:00.360
in Noordwijk in the Netherlands.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.020
As well, all the ESA projects
are going through their CDF.

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.100
So one of these is
[INAUDIBLE] which

00:52:06.100 --> 00:52:09.430
is a space-based observatory.

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:11.350
EPFL is involved
in that project.

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:15.290
That went through
the CDF as well.

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:19.420
Most NASA centers and then
commercial applications

00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:21.730
in medical devices,
painting, shipbuilding.

00:52:21.730 --> 00:52:23.740
And like I mentioned
in my introduction,

00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:26.350
even consumer packaged
good companies

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:29.920
are now building their
version of a CDF,

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.550
such that they can, you know,
very quickly, within a couple

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:38.590
weeks, come up with a new
proposal for a product and all

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:41.140
the major aspects, you
know, the underlying physics

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:45.650
and chemistry, the packaging,
the business case, everything

00:52:45.650 --> 00:52:48.490
is considered at the same time.

00:52:48.490 --> 00:52:49.630
Yes?

00:52:49.630 --> 00:52:51.532
AUDIENCE: I was wondering why--

00:52:51.532 --> 00:52:55.550
what makes the cost estimate
so accurate with this method?

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.160
OLIVIER DE WECK: So there
are three major ways

00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.840
of doing-- oh,
Veronica should answer

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.500
that question, since
she's launching on cost

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.810
modeling for her research.

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:08.346
There are three major
cost estimation methods.

00:53:08.346 --> 00:53:10.970
One is bottom up, you know, you
have the product decomposition,

00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:13.100
and you add up all the costs.

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:16.100
One is called
costing by analogy,

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.980
where you look at a prior
mission or a prior product

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.930
and then you look at the deltas.

00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:23.960
And then the third one is
based on so-called CERs,

00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:26.000
cost estimation relationships.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.650
It's a parametric method.

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:29.570
You can also blend these.

00:53:29.570 --> 00:53:32.930
And you know, I think one of
the reasons why it's accurate

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:34.130
is because--

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:36.880
there are two reasons
why, I would say.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.410
So you always have a cost share.

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:41.390
One of the subsystems
is costing.

00:53:41.390 --> 00:53:44.440
So you have really people who
been doing this for a while.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.660
They know these
models, and so there's

00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.390
some legacy information.

00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:55.070
And the more missions we fly,
the more products we make,

00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:58.880
the more robust, essentially,
these cost estimates become.

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.650
And then the second, I think,
is because people that typically

00:54:03.650 --> 00:54:07.430
work in a CDF,
they're non-advocates,

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:09.950
meaning it's kind
of neutral ground.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:12.140
So rather than pushing
a particular idea

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.660
or trying to be
overly optimistic,

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:18.290
you know, usually in a
CDF, the calculations

00:54:18.290 --> 00:54:21.470
that are done are
pretty non-biased,

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:23.760
and that's not always the case.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.152
So that's one of the advantages
of the CDF is you're getting--

00:54:27.152 --> 00:54:29.360
you know, people are trying
to say, but really, let's

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.590
make it look a little better.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:34.170
No, no, we can't do this,
because the model says,

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:38.510
you know, it is gonna cost $280
million to do this satellite.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.910
And that's based on, you
know, within prior models,

00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:43.670
and if you overlay
different models,

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:46.550
you know, with some
error or confidence.

00:54:46.550 --> 00:54:48.360
That's the right answer.

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.490
So it's these two reasons.

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:54.470
There's experience, there's
data, and non-advocacy, really

00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:58.010
taking a kind of neutral,
unbiased position.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:01.430
So benefits are, you know,
improvements of quality,

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:04.970
quick turnaround for ideas,
better cost estimates,

00:55:04.970 --> 00:55:09.720
and then increased creativity
and productivity in a company.

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.730
So let me give you a
couple examples here.

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.000
This is a CubeSat.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:18.530
So this is the ability to
design quickly new CubeSats.

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:20.030
This picture here
I'm showing you

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:23.510
is the Swiss Cube that was
launched in 2009, still

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:24.230
operating.

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:26.750
I think it's the longest
operating, continuously

00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.850
operating CubeSat so far.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:32.060
There's like over six years
of operational data now.

00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:34.520
And so you know, for the
next generation, which

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:39.821
is shown here, how would you do
a Cubesat in such a facility?

00:55:39.821 --> 00:55:40.820
And there's three steps.

00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:42.890
You define your
decomposition level.

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.840
So you have your system
level, your subsystem level,

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:48.410
and then at the lowest
level it's called equipment.

00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.960
These are the actual components.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:53.660
And you have your product
decomposition here,

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.730
and then for each
of these components,

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:58.670
you have different sheets
that give you either component

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:04.220
choices or give you different
parameters like mass power

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:06.680
with margins that allow
you to then choose

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:11.490
from this like a menu and pull
together your overall design.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:13.457
So that's a Cubesat example.

00:56:13.457 --> 00:56:15.040
But I want to talk
to you a little bit

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:19.250
in more detail through a design
of a suborbital space plane

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:22.850
that was done in
that CDF, and this

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:26.360
was a project known as K1000.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.240
So some of you may have heard
of the Hermes, the Hermes space

00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.100
plane.

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:35.240
This was a project that the
European Space Agency had

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:39.650
starting even in the
'80s, and it wasn't built,

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.780
but there was a lot
of studies done.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.310
And this is essentially
a Hermes-like vehicle

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:48.060
but for space tourism,
that's the basic application.

00:56:48.060 --> 00:56:51.800
And so you know, how would
you design a space tourism

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.690
vehicle in a CDF?

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:56.150
Well, you have to start
with requirements, right?

00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:59.581
Without requirements, you're
just-- it's like, you know,

00:56:59.581 --> 00:57:00.080
setting--

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.420
my analogy for designing
without requirements

00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:06.800
is like taking your ship and
going out to sea without a map,

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.310
without a chart, with no
destination port in mind.

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:12.990
You're just drifting
in the ocean.

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:14.810
You've got to have requirements.

00:57:14.810 --> 00:57:17.150
So here are the high
level requirements

00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:18.980
for this particular vehicle.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:20.540
Level one
requirements-- you have

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:25.280
to reach an altitude of at least
100 kilometers over sea level.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:26.930
Why is that?

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:29.270
Where does the 100
kilometers come from?

00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:34.000
Why is it not 80 or 90 or 150?

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.050
AUDIENCE: That's where
space is defined.

00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:38.600
OLIVIER DE WECK: Right,
and what happens to people

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:41.032
who go above 100 kilometers?

00:57:41.032 --> 00:57:42.740
AUDIENCE: They get
their astronaut wings.

00:57:42.740 --> 00:57:45.050
OLIVIER DE WECK:
They get their--

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:47.450
you have gone to
space, and like,

00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:49.490
you know, you can
claim that you've gone

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:52.610
to space if you go above 100.

00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:54.770
If you don't, if you are
at 80 or 90 you don't.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:57.080
That's kind of
internationally accepted.

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.580
So that's really where that
requirement comes from.

00:58:01.580 --> 00:58:04.640
The second one is
a zero g phase.

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.920
You should experience
weightlessness

00:58:06.920 --> 00:58:09.480
for at least several minutes.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:12.430
Who's done a parabolic
flight before here?

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:15.100
The zero g, you know,
the Vomit Comet?

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:16.680
Anybody?

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.100
Wow, we have to get
you guys out there.

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:21.630
At EPFL, are you still with us?

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:27.230
AUDIENCE: We are.

00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:29.690
OLIVIER DE WECK: Has anybody
done parabolic flights?

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:32.960
I know there's a flight campaign
coming up in Switzerland

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.580
later this year?

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it will
be next year, I guess,

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.710
but unfortunately, no one
has done this right now here.

00:58:39.710 --> 00:58:41.960
OLIVIER DE WECK: All right,
guys, we have to fix this.

00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:43.070
This is unacceptable.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:46.500
I mean, we have to work on this.

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:50.060
So it's very cool to do
these parabolic flights,

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:52.550
but you only get about
20 seconds, right?

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:54.590
20 seconds at the top.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:57.560
It's like riding a big
roller coaster, basically.

00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:00.320
And then you go down, and
then you suffer, you know,

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.880
1.7 g's or whatever.

00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.220
Then you come back up.

00:59:04.220 --> 00:59:05.540
But we want several minutes.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:12.160
And then the next requirement
is that the passengers

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.710
should carry-- there should
be six passengers carried

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:16.940
on this vehicle.

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.520
Those are the top
level one requirements.

00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:23.270
Lower level-- level two
requirements-- safety.

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:28.040
Don't exceed six g,
positive six g's.

00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:31.140
The vehicle must be
controllable at all times.

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.180
So when you're out
of the atmosphere,

00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:35.180
you have to be able to
control the vehicle, that

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:37.490
has certain implications.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:39.140
The customer
experience-- you should

00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:42.550
be able to see the Earth's
curvature and atmosphere,

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:46.010
that thin layer, at all times.

00:59:46.010 --> 00:59:48.680
The spacecraft impact
on the environment

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.540
should be as small as possible.

00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:53.210
And then the mass budget,
the spacecraft mass

00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:57.050
should not exceed 11.6
tons with propellants.

00:59:57.050 --> 00:59:59.060
Where do you think
that comes from?

00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:01.250
What kind of a
requirement is that?

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:02.970
What flavor of
requirement is that?

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:03.470
Yeah?

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.554
AUDIENCE: Transporting it
for proper [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:05.554 --> 01:00:07.220
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Right, so in this case,

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.100
it's actually a
piggyback, right?

01:00:09.100 --> 01:00:11.890
You either have
a vertical launch

01:00:11.890 --> 01:00:15.270
or you have a first stage,
an airplane from which you

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:16.180
are dropped right?

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.980
So that's sort of an
interface requirement.

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.400
OK, so once you know
your requirements,

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.950
you can really start
developing your models.

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:31.880
So here's a model of essentially
the kinematics of the vehicle.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.090
So you have your environment,
your atmospheric model,

01:00:34.090 --> 01:00:38.850
atmospheric density, pressure,
mach number, speed of sound,

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.530
a gravity model.

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.580
Then computing the forces and
torques acting on the vehicle

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:50.170
itself, looking at the
derivatives, integrating that.

01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:51.730
This is essentially
the equations

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.910
of motion of a vehicle
in its environment

01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:57.160
that it's operating
in, and then updating

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:01.060
that with a certain
time step, delta T.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.250
So you can zoom in
on one of these,

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:08.400
for example, this force model,
computation of the forces.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.760
And there's two frames.

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.170
There's the Earth
reference frame

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.910
and, then there's the
body centric frame

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:14.680
of the vehicle itself.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:19.330
So you have, in this case,
the aerodynamic coefficients.

01:01:19.330 --> 01:01:22.690
You have the forces, lift,
drag, pitching moment,

01:01:22.690 --> 01:01:25.270
and then you have the actuation.

01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:28.540
This is assumed, you know, the
pilots are here in control.

01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.690
The rocket engine itself,
secondary propulsion,

01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:34.810
the rudders, and then
attitude thrusters.

01:01:34.810 --> 01:01:37.675
You need those especially--

01:01:37.675 --> 01:01:40.480
you know, once you're out of
the atmosphere, the rudders--

01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.750
the aerodynamic surfaces
are no longer effective.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:45.550
And we knew this in the '60s.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:48.670
Vehicles-- like the
X15 is very famous.

01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:50.500
Well, it had thrusters
that you could

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:54.620
you could actuate once
you're out of the atmosphere.

01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:56.620
So you know, you can go
pretty detailed in this.

01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:02.920
You would then design the
vehicle in a particular way,

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.560
you know, particular engine,
wing dimensions, aspect ratio,

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.920
a particular flight
profile, and then

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:15.130
that would be a typical result
that you would get in a CDF.

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:16.990
There's two curves shown here.

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:21.050
The blue curve is essentially
altitude and kilometers.

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:23.320
So you see there's
the 100 kilometers.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.760
We need to get
above this, right?

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.540
This was our requirement.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.820
So we go above 100.

01:02:27.820 --> 01:02:28.390
That's good.

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:29.750
We satisfy that requirement.

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.560
So looks like a
parabola, and then we

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:35.860
have a-- we glide here,
essentially, to the ground.

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.810
The whole mission takes about
900 seconds, 15 minutes.

01:02:40.810 --> 01:02:44.800
And then the yellow curve here
is your load factor, your NZ,

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.030
your vertical load factor.

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.500
And you can see that's a
little noisier as a curve.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:55.990
So we have higher acceleration
as we accelerate to altitude.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:59.650
And you can see that
roughly here, roughly

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:04.770
in the middle of the parabola,
the load factor starts to--

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:06.160
you're basically in free fall.

01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:10.840
You're basically ballistic,
and the peak acceleration

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:16.210
is about 4.3 g's here, so
we satisfy that requirement.

01:03:16.210 --> 01:03:20.050
And the whole reason we're doing
it is for this period here,

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.360
that zero g experience.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:26.410
So when the load factor
goes to zero, or near zero,

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:28.130
that's when you
get weightlessness.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:31.240
And it turns out for this
particular flight profile,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.910
we would experience 184
seconds, about three minutes

01:03:36.910 --> 01:03:40.380
of weightlessness.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.110
This is pretty similar
to the flight profile

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:47.440
that Virgin Galactic is
pursuing, by the way.

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:54.100
So you know, looking at
this result, you would say,

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:57.480
well, I don't know about
the mass here, but from,

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.750
you know, reaching
100 kilometers keeping

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:07.180
accelerations below six g, this
looks like a feasible profile.

01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:10.090
Of course, the other
thing that we care about

01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:13.600
is the view, since this
is for space tourism.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.920
We want to make
sure that, you know,

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.590
that the experience
is great, not just

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:23.230
from an experiencing
weightlessness, which

01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:26.950
you can do in a closed can but
you actually see something.

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:31.480
So this was essentially
coupled with a virtual reality

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.980
visualization.

01:04:32.980 --> 01:04:35.170
So you can see, you
know, the landing here.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.000
You can see these
three views here.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.430
And you can see
the vehicle itself.

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:44.710
So the pilots are up
front, and then here

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:46.660
is our six passengers.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:51.034
Every one of the passengers
gets their own window.

01:04:51.034 --> 01:04:52.450
So this is the
view that you would

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:55.910
get from the front window.

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:58.150
This is the view from
the middle window.

01:04:58.150 --> 01:05:00.970
And then this is the view
from the back window,

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:04.030
from that last window here,
which is closer to the back,

01:05:04.030 --> 01:05:05.570
to the engines.

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:09.330
So what would you, looking
at these pictures-- you know,

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:13.740
this comes directly out of
the simulation and the CDF--

01:05:13.740 --> 01:05:15.630
what would you say
looking at this?

01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:19.240
Anything you notice?

01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:21.580
EPFL anything you guys notice?

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:24.460
Look at the view from
the front, the middle,

01:05:24.460 --> 01:05:25.570
and the back window.

01:05:28.755 --> 01:05:30.380
AUDIENCE: From the
front, looks better.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.650
I guess it will be
more expensive, again,

01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:34.360
for the customer.

01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:37.920
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yeah, so that's
exactly what I was asking.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:42.790
So it looks like either you
need to redesign the vehicle so

01:05:42.790 --> 01:05:46.330
that the view is the same, more
or less, from every window,

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:49.450
or you need to start
charging differential prices.

01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:54.310
Because clearly,
from the back window,

01:05:54.310 --> 01:05:59.167
half your view is obstructed
by the wing structure, right?

01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:00.250
Would you agree with that?

01:06:03.610 --> 01:06:06.430
Would you charge different
ticket prices for this ride,

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.170
depending on which seat you get?

01:06:11.770 --> 01:06:14.110
AUDIENCE: I guess
that's offer and demand?

01:06:14.110 --> 01:06:16.030
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Supply and demand, yes.

01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:17.260
That's right.

01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.150
Go ahead.

01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:22.240
AUDIENCE: It could also merit
a change in flight plan.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.820
If your structure blocks
the downward view,

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:27.160
you might want to
consider flipping over

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.030
if like the Earth is what
you're trying to see from above.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:34.390
So it may have broader
implications for the mission.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:37.150
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK,
so the point here,

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:41.830
is there a way to operationally
improve the experience,

01:06:41.830 --> 01:06:43.670
keeping the vehicle
design the same?

01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:45.670
Absolutely, but
what that means is,

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:47.650
you would have to
put the operation--

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:50.440
so the orientation
of the vehicle,

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.620
you'd have to put that
into your design vector

01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.610
if you want to change it.

01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:57.310
OK, so I don't know.

01:06:57.310 --> 01:06:59.000
I think this is pretty cool.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.610
So you can actually do a lot in
this kind of CDF type setting.

01:07:03.610 --> 01:07:08.620
And by the way, of the things
that spun out of this project

01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.860
is this company called S3.

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:15.070
Their headquarters in
Payerne in Switzerland.

01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:17.350
This is actually-- I did a
lot of my military service

01:07:17.350 --> 01:07:18.730
at that airport.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:20.680
Their goal is not
space tourism, you

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.630
see there's no windows
on this vehicle,

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:25.720
but deployment of small
satellites, custom

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:29.280
deployment for small satellites
with a reusable vehicle.

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.900
So you know, I think it's
a very interesting concept,

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.330
but the question is,
is it feasible, right?

01:07:37.330 --> 01:07:42.280
Is it feasible-- the
aerodynamics, the economics,

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.100
structurally, engine reuse?

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.030
There's a lot of--

01:07:45.030 --> 01:07:48.100
this is a great
picture, but you know,

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:49.490
the devil is in the details.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:53.230
So really working out the
details of such a design,

01:07:53.230 --> 01:07:58.720
that's what a CDF is for,
and you can really go deep.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.260
OK so any questions about this?

01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:05.380
I'd like to do a little
partner exercise here.

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:06.700
Any questions?

01:08:06.700 --> 01:08:12.910
So let's do a partner
exercise, and the question is,

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:16.090
what are your experiences with
concurrent design facilities

01:08:16.090 --> 01:08:17.750
so far?

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:21.279
Whether you've done an
internship at ESA or JPL,

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:24.729
or some other place that
has a facility like this,

01:08:24.729 --> 01:08:28.840
or even if you
haven't been there,

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.560
kind of speculate and discuss
what it would be like.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.920
Maybe, you know, what would
be your favorite chair?

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:42.609
Would you pick propulsion or
costing or flight trajectory?

01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:46.250
You know, just sort of speculate
and discuss with your partner,

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:49.210
so for which project or
application did you use it?

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:49.960
What went well?

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.010
What did not?

01:08:51.010 --> 01:08:52.120
What could be improved?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.700
And again, if you don't
have much experiences,

01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:57.799
just think ahead what
it would be like.

01:08:57.799 --> 01:08:59.590
What would you like to
get out of it if you

01:08:59.590 --> 01:09:02.460
have no experience in it?

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:06.100
AUDIENCE: So there is at ESA,
a concurrent design facility,

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:12.250
and I was talking with Katya
that maybe also United Nations

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:16.250
can be considered, like,
the facilities there

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:20.120
can be considered a
concurrent design facility.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.510
I don't know if it
worked, this approach.

01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.490
OLIVIER DE WECK: Do
you mean in Geneva,

01:09:24.490 --> 01:09:28.066
United Nations in Geneva
or London or New York,

01:09:28.066 --> 01:09:29.149
or do you mean in general?

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.950
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:31.569
OLIVIER DE WECK:
But do they actually

01:09:31.569 --> 01:09:35.859
have a physical facility
with models and screens,

01:09:35.859 --> 01:09:39.590
or are you saying this
more metaphorically?

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:40.840
AUDIENCE: Metaphorically more.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.130
OLIVIER DE WECK:
OK, but you know I--

01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.999
go ahead.

01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:44.630
Go ahead.

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:48.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we're referring
to the layout, to the site,

01:09:48.220 --> 01:09:49.870
we're looking at the
ESA layout, where

01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:52.665
you have one big room, where
you have all the people coming

01:09:52.665 --> 01:09:54.790
together, all the different
models coming together.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.050
So that's like all
the different experts.

01:09:56.050 --> 01:09:58.530
Then you have subrooms for
different project rooms,

01:09:58.530 --> 01:10:00.680
and then you have, like,
a big conference room.

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:05.470
That's kind of the structure of
the layout of the facilities.

01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:08.320
OLIVIER DE WECK: But you know,
maybe a place like the UN

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.430
could really benefit when they
deal with a refugee crisis

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:15.850
or with, you know, climate
change negotiations.

01:10:15.850 --> 01:10:17.410
I like this idea.

01:10:17.410 --> 01:10:18.610
Great suggestion.

01:10:18.610 --> 01:10:19.960
What about here at MIT?

01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:21.370
Any experiences, thoughts?

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.730
Yeah, please go ahead.

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah, AFRL, we have
a rapid innovation officer.

01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:30.880
He's like a general equivalent
as a civilian, a LOC BOS,

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:36.070
and he basically is tasked with
breaking all the rules in AFRL.

01:10:36.070 --> 01:10:39.460
Whereas most projects
take years to complete,

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.880
he fields questions from
the field, from the theater,

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.010
from war fighters, and
they have an urgent need.

01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:49.550
And he gets them a solution
in under 12 months.

01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:54.610
So he pulls in all these
experts from industry, academia,

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:55.750
wherever.

01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:58.150
He'll lock them in
a room, and they

01:10:58.150 --> 01:11:00.370
don't leave until they
come up with a solution.

01:11:00.370 --> 01:11:03.460
And he has the money
and the influence,

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:05.699
the backing by the AFRL
Commander to get it done.

01:11:05.699 --> 01:11:07.240
OLIVIER DE WECK:
And what does that--

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:09.040
I mean, if you
can share, roughly

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.470
what does that facility
look like roughly?

01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:15.520
Does it have, like, models
and computers and screens?

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:19.050
AUDIENCE: Just white walls,
like, whiteboard walls,

01:11:19.050 --> 01:11:22.112
and they will just be covered
with everybody's ideas

01:11:22.112 --> 01:11:23.320
by the time they leave there.

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.445
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, I see.

01:11:24.445 --> 01:11:27.170
So it's not as much
computationally supported.

01:11:27.170 --> 01:11:28.405
It's more of a human process.

01:11:28.405 --> 01:11:29.220
AUDIENCE: That's right.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:29.860
OLIVIER DE WECK: Cool.

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:30.310
OK.

01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.810
Great.

01:11:30.810 --> 01:11:34.150
Interesting.

01:11:34.150 --> 01:11:35.980
Any other experiences?

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:39.250
Anybody been at JPL or
seen a commercial facility

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:42.340
in a commercial company
that does this kind of work?

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.782
Please, go ahead, Justice.

01:11:46.490 --> 01:11:48.327
AUDIENCE: Well it's
less of a commercial--

01:11:48.327 --> 01:11:50.910
I was interning at the Aerospace
Corporation this past summer,

01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:53.240
and I was working in their
concurrent design center.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:58.970
And it uses a similar layout
as JPL's Team X's design, where

01:11:58.970 --> 01:12:01.010
it's basically using models.

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:04.205
That they have, like, a group
of engineers who sit at desks,

01:12:04.205 --> 01:12:06.080
and there's multiple
engineers per subsystem,

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.430
and they just discuss.

01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:09.620
They're given a
mission objective,

01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:12.990
and they discuss how they can
best design the system based

01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:13.490
on that.

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:15.870
And they model it and
optimize it in the subsystem,

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:18.635
and then they feed it back
to a systems level design.

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:20.510
OLIVIER DE WECK: Did
you participate in that?

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:21.230
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:24.410
OLIVIER DE WECK: So what
did you think of it?

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:26.000
AUDIENCE: A lot--
it's a lot to take

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.100
in at first just
trying to understand

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.480
how each of the models work.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.280
You're not necessarily
supposed to work on each model,

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.330
but as an intern, they
wanted me to kind of see

01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:39.602
what each of the models would
do and not necessarily exactly

01:12:39.602 --> 01:12:41.810
how the optimization techniques
work because I didn't

01:12:41.810 --> 01:12:44.030
necessarily understand
it, but just more

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.960
of have an idea of how it
actually works as a whole.

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.490
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, good.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:54.140
Anybody else at EPFL want
to share any experiences?

01:12:58.410 --> 01:13:01.960
AUDIENCE: Apparently not, but
just a problem with the sound.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.640
We didn't hear anything on what
the guy before just told us.

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:09.000
OLIVIER DE WECK: OK, Justice,
did you push the mic button?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.260
OK, yeah, so
basically, he worked--

01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.760
let me try to summarize.

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.710
He worked at the
Aerospace Corporation.

01:13:14.710 --> 01:13:16.900
He interned at the
Airspace Corporation.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.240
Was it in Virginia
or California?

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.280
California, in California.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:24.580
And Aerospace Corporation
is like a think tank,

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:28.900
and it was a very similar set
up with different subsystem

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.910
experts, different models.

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:33.670
And Justice was saying
one of the big challenges

01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.610
is so much information,
taking it all in

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:40.280
and understanding all the models
and coupling, and so forth.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.860
So and I agree.

01:13:41.860 --> 01:13:42.700
It takes a while.

01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.770
If you haven't been working
in this environment,

01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:47.540
it takes a while to
really get used to it.

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:52.180
So the last thing I'll
say here is that--

01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:53.090
well, two things.

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:55.390
One is-- and they're
linked-- one is

01:13:55.390 --> 01:13:59.230
that these CDFs are not cheap.

01:13:59.230 --> 01:14:02.380
If you really want a
high-functioning CDF,

01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.260
you have to have people
that are dedicated to this.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:08.230
You know, the software
licenses expire.

01:14:08.230 --> 01:14:10.420
The technology gets old.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:12.250
You need to not
just use it, but you

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:16.480
need to constantly refresh
a CDF, keep it up to date,

01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:19.250
and it just doesn't
happen automatically.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:21.760
You've got to have
budget for that.

01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:24.310
You have to have people who
are dedicated to updating

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:28.280
the models, updating the
facility, and so forth.

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:31.120
So it's definitely
something that

01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:34.900
needs to be invested
in on a regular basis.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:39.310
So what happened to us
here at MIT in air astro,

01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:41.650
actually, when I
was sitting where

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:44.170
you are sitting
as a grad student,

01:14:44.170 --> 01:14:47.320
we created a CDF
in the mid '90s.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.770
And you know, it was
just like the one at JPL.

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:55.840
We had desktops, you know, with
labels-- thermal, propulsion.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:59.870
And we used it quite
actively for maybe five, six,

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:04.030
seven years, but we didn't put
the budget into it every year.

01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:06.610
We didn't have a dedicated
person who was really.

01:15:06.610 --> 01:15:07.840
looking after it.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:13.240
So what happened to our CDF
is that entropy took over,

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:15.490
and it sort of got
more and more dated.

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:17.530
And when you go and
look in this room now,

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.330
it kind of looks like a
regular conference room.

01:15:20.330 --> 01:15:22.810
So all the desktops
that we had are gone.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:25.180
I guess they'd be
pretty old by now.

01:15:25.180 --> 01:15:31.360
And there has been a pretty
strong debate among the faculty

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.960
whether actually we need this.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:34.690
Should we recreate one?

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:36.880
And the argument
goes as follows,

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:43.010
the proponents say that a CDF
is really something special.

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:47.510
When you enter in the CDF, you
know this is a special place.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.960
This is a facility that's
designed specifically

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.630
for doing rapid studies.

01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:55.000
All the information
you need is there.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:58.630
The walls are plastered
with reference information.

01:15:58.630 --> 01:16:02.170
You know, really,
that's what it's for.

01:16:02.170 --> 01:16:08.030
The counter argument is that
this is no longer the mid-'90s.

01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:11.020
Now, everybody has laptops.

01:16:11.020 --> 01:16:13.330
Everybody does mobile computing.

01:16:13.330 --> 01:16:16.840
All the models and data
should be on the cloud,

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.170
not sitting anymore in a
dedicated server facility,

01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.580
but it's sitting on the cloud.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:24.760
And therefore, you
know, physically,

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:27.820
a facility that's dedicated
is no longer needed.

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:30.670
What you do is you
get together in a more

01:16:30.670 --> 01:16:33.280
kind of flexible ad hoc way.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.080
Everybody brings their laptops.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.600
You have the big white
walls, like you said.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:41.740
And you can just create
a CDF on the fly, right?

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.900
Everybody brings their
computing resources.

01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:47.200
Stuff is on the cloud.

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.380
And then you get a lot done,
and then you disband again.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.020
You clean the white
boards and you're done.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.740
Therefore, no longer
needed a dedicated CDF.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:17:04.410
Those are the two countervailing
opinions right now.

01:17:04.410 --> 01:17:09.570
My view is, I think a CDF
still has value today.

01:17:09.570 --> 01:17:14.650
I think it is valuable
as a dedicated facility,

01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:16.030
but it needs to be updated.

01:17:16.030 --> 01:17:18.570
So yes, the models
should be on the cloud.

01:17:18.570 --> 01:17:20.760
Yes, you can bring your
laptops, but it is still

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:23.940
valuable to have dedicated
computing resources, again.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:30.250
So I now think a hybrid model
is actually the right way to go.

01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:33.940
So we'll see where it goes, but
it's a pretty active debate.

01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:35.820
There have also been,
you know, theses

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:39.880
written on CDFs, comparing
different CDFs and so forth.

01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:45.840
So take a look at the Anton
Ivanov paper in the reading

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.730
and just think about this.

01:17:47.730 --> 01:17:51.210
I think this is a
big deal, and it's

01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:53.910
going to be even more important
than the future, whether you're

01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:57.390
doing space missions,
aeronautics,

01:17:57.390 --> 01:17:59.550
whether you're designing
commercial products,

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:03.420
you know, or in the
military, these facilities

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:06.030
that allow you to make these
design decisions in a very

01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:09.420
interactive, very
quick way are gonna

01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:11.130
be more and more
important in the future,

01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:15.205
and this is a big part
of system engineering.

01:18:15.205 --> 01:18:19.700
Any final thoughts on
this before we move on?

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:26.400
OK, so here some lessons
learned from the EPFL CDF.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.970
So this is particularly in
the university environment,

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:33.960
so you know, giving access
to a wide body of students.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.810
You need to adapt this to
the university's schedule,

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:43.410
the learning curves, the analogy
of a smoke-filled room or war

01:18:43.410 --> 01:18:46.080
room, optimal team size.

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.680
You know a CDF with 50 people
on it is not as effective as one

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:52.800
with, you know, seven
plus or minus two.

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.660
And then distributed CDFs--

01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:56.860
they don't typically
work as well.

01:18:56.860 --> 01:19:00.780
So I almost wore my--

01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:03.720
I have a shirt that's
almost the same.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.390
Anybody know who this is
or where this is from?

01:19:07.390 --> 01:19:10.090
This is Sheldon Cooper
in the Big Bang Theory,

01:19:10.090 --> 01:19:12.310
his virtual reality presence.

01:19:12.310 --> 01:19:18.100
So the point here is that
virtual reality is OK.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:23.380
So you can imagine a CDF where
half the people are in the room

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:26.290
and half the people are
dialing in remotely,

01:19:26.290 --> 01:19:30.720
but it's never quite as good as
everybody is there physically.

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.140
So human interaction
is critical.

01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:39.380
OK, the last thing I want to
talk about today is the CDR.

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:41.240
This is a big, big milestone.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.860
This is a very big deal.

01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:46.520
The critical design review,
the main purpose of it

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.720
is to approve the final
design in all its glory,

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.530
in all its details.

01:19:52.530 --> 01:19:56.240
So generally, the
way we talk about it

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:00.470
is, if you pass the CDR, you've
got the green light to quote,

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:02.210
end quote, cut metal.

01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:06.750
Of course, you know, our systems
have software and hardware.

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:10.520
So the cut metal is
essentially a euphemism

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.420
for you can go ahead and
manufacture the system now.

01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:17.450
CDRs are typically
the biggest review.

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:22.400
The largest number of people
you will have at the CDR.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.260
You know, if you had
10 people at the SRR

01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:28.850
and 20 people at the
PDR, you're gonna

01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:31.790
have 50 or 100
people at the CDR.

01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:35.480
Because any question that
comes up on any of the parts--

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.460
say, is this really right?

01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:40.490
Well, what could be the
impact of this detail

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:41.990
on the rest of the systems?

01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:45.070
Somebody should be there
who designed that part

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:48.290
or who can answer the
question at least.

01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:51.620
And CDRs are typically
longer than one day.

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.810
In fact, for a
big project, a CDR

01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:56.300
can be a whole week of reviews.

01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:58.850
So people get really tired.

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:01.880
Big CDRs are very,
very detailed.

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:05.660
You really have to drink lots
of coffee and stay awake.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.140
So here's the description
of what a CDR is.

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:13.670
One of the guidelines is
that approximately 90%

01:21:13.670 --> 01:21:16.640
of the engineering drawings
are approved and released.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.860
So it's OK to have a CDR if
you have not 100% of everything

01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:25.880
done, but you need to have
at least 90% complete.

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.870
You can't do a CDR, with, you
know, half the drawings done.

01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:34.070
And it happens at the end
of phase C, the final design

01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:35.840
phase C.

01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.450
For very large projects,
you can have sub CDRs.

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:44.450
You'll have a system
level CDR, and then you

01:21:44.450 --> 01:21:47.810
can have sub CDRs for
every major subsystem

01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:49.760
in your project.

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:52.100
So an example, I
put a link here.

01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:58.640
This is from late 2014, the
CDR for the James Webb Space

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.710
Telescope that I
mentioned earlier.

01:22:00.710 --> 01:22:03.440
They passed the last
major element level

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.220
critical design review,
which was a big deal.

01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:11.090
So launch is planned for 2018.

01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:14.420
But for big projects,
what I'm trying to say is,

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:16.350
there may be more
than one CDR. There

01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:19.520
may be the master CDR
for the whole thing

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:22.670
and then sub CDRs for
different subsystems.

01:22:22.670 --> 01:22:25.860
Now, if you don't-- well, let me
get to this on the next chart.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.450
Yeah, go ahead.

01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:30.900
AUDIENCE: Are the, like, CDR
slides for NASA projects,

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:34.950
are those available
anywhere as a public entity

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.199
and can you get access
to any of that stuff?

01:22:38.199 --> 01:22:39.365
OLIVIER DE WECK: It depends.

01:22:42.870 --> 01:22:46.440
Not always, because especially
if commercial companies,

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:50.550
like, you know, Lockheed-Martin
or somebody is doing, like,

01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:53.550
the spacecraft bus, they
would consider those details

01:22:53.550 --> 01:22:55.330
proprietary.

01:22:55.330 --> 01:22:58.770
So in general, I would say no.

01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:04.080
But for CanSat, actually, you've
probably already found them.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.080
For CanSat, you can
actually find a lot of this.

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:10.870
So prior PDRs and
CDRs, you can see that.

01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:12.820
I encourage you not
to look too much.

01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:15.236
You know, you kind of want to
come up with your own thing.

01:23:15.236 --> 01:23:18.030
But you know, for
projects that don't

01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:21.090
have a commercial interest
or proprietary technology,

01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:23.610
it's often available.

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:28.610
So to show you just-- this is
a table from the Handbook, page

01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:30.710
178.

01:23:30.710 --> 01:23:35.480
This is the entrance criteria
and the exit criteria for CDR.

01:23:35.480 --> 01:23:39.560
So entrance criteria means what
do you have to have in order

01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:43.610
to be allowed to go
forward with a CDR?

01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:45.380
And it's mainly three things--

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:49.100
successful completion of
the PDR, and responses

01:23:49.100 --> 01:23:52.550
made to all the
PDR RFAs and RIDs.

01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:56.960
RFAs and RIDs are essentially
deficiencies, open items

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.250
that came up in the PDR.

01:23:58.250 --> 01:24:00.170
So you have to close them out.

01:24:00.170 --> 01:24:02.570
A CDR agenda, and
then number three

01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:05.450
is all the technical
work packages.

01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:07.970
And so you see, it's
a huge list here--

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:11.010
baseline documents,
specification, fabrication,

01:24:11.010 --> 01:24:14.450
assembly and integration,
technical data package,

01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:18.020
acceptance criteria,
verification and validation

01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:21.740
plan, launch site selection,
and operations plan--

01:24:21.740 --> 01:24:24.140
super, super, super detailed.

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:26.240
This is a lot of information.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.320
And at the CDR, you're
gonna go through all this.

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.650
So you can imagine
what that means.

01:24:34.650 --> 01:24:36.890
And then success
criteria, on the right,

01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:42.380
is, you know, in order to
successfully pass the CDR,

01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:47.270
these are all the things that
you have to basically have.

01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:49.970
You have to have approval
for all these things.

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:54.740
Now in reality, just
like a PDR, at a CDR,

01:24:54.740 --> 01:24:56.480
things will come
up that you missed

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:58.640
or that people have
concerns about.

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:02.270
And so you will make
a list of those,

01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:04.790
and then you have to address
these action items coming out

01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:08.570
of a CDR. If those action
items are serious--

01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:13.250
if they're really serious, you
could fail the CDR and say,

01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:15.200
you know, this is
not gonna work.

01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:19.610
We should not proceed.

01:25:19.610 --> 01:25:20.720
And they send you back.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:22.490
Or they cancel the project.

01:25:22.490 --> 01:25:24.620
That's happened also.

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.370
More likely, is that they'll
ask you to do a so-called delta

01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:31.250
CDR. So they'll
have you, you know,

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:33.290
it's like retaking
an exam or something.

01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:35.840
They'll have you
come back, and you'll

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:41.150
have to do a CDR again but
only on the delta, the portion

01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:43.730
that raised concerns
at the main CDR.

01:25:43.730 --> 01:25:45.800
You don't have to
do everything again.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.570
That's called a delta CDR.

01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:50.990
OK, any questions about CDR?

01:25:50.990 --> 01:25:53.400
This is really the--
this is the big one.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.980
This is the big milestone.

01:25:54.980 --> 01:25:58.490
And obviously, you know, the
concept or the architecture

01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:02.640
you chose at the PDR turns
out not to be a good one,

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.800
it's very difficult to make
changes to that here, right?

01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.040
You're kind of locked in to
whatever design or architecture

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:11.180
you chose at PDR.

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:14.004
That's why PDR is also
so important, even

01:26:14.004 --> 01:26:15.170
though you have less detail.

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.071
Yeah, Sam, go ahead.

01:26:17.071 --> 01:26:19.070
AUDIENCE: Do you have to
have contracts in place

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:22.267
already for the, like,
manufacturing and operations?

01:26:22.267 --> 01:26:23.600
OLIVIER DE WECK: Oh, absolutely.

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:27.500
I mean, basically green
light CDR, the next day,

01:26:27.500 --> 01:26:28.760
you start manufacturing.

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.775
So you know, every portion,
all the components,

01:26:31.775 --> 01:26:34.040
all the manufacturing,
all of that

01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:38.750
has been bid,
selected, contracted.

01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:43.590
Everything's in place
contractually, absolutely.

01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:46.830
OK, any questions
at EPFL about CDR?

01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:49.710
Who has actually gone
through a CDR on your end?

01:26:49.710 --> 01:26:53.460
Has anybody done a CDR
for any of the projects?

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:55.970
OK, go ahead.

01:26:55.970 --> 01:26:57.330
What was it like?

01:26:57.330 --> 01:27:01.950
AUDIENCE: I did also a CDR
because I had the PDR last time

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.290
at the [INAUDIBLE] program.

01:27:04.290 --> 01:27:06.030
And one comment I want to make.

01:27:06.030 --> 01:27:11.670
So the teams were allowed to
fail the PDR and still fly.

01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:16.510
If they failed the CDR,
then they didn't fly at all.

01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:19.452
So it was very
strict and demanding

01:27:19.452 --> 01:27:20.910
OLIVIER DE WECK:
Yeah, so would you

01:27:20.910 --> 01:27:25.050
say that the CDR is more
strict than the PDR?

01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:27.090
AUDIENCE: The CDR
is more strict.

01:27:27.090 --> 01:27:28.740
OLIVIER DE WECK: Yes, I agree.

01:27:28.740 --> 01:27:29.430
I agree.

01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:30.740
Definitely.

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.810
OK, anybody else?

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:40.902
Are any of you working in
systems other than aerospace,

01:27:40.902 --> 01:27:44.170
like, I don't know, medical
devices or you know,

01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:45.670
scientific instruments?

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.160
So the reason I bring
this up is because you

01:27:53.160 --> 01:28:00.600
know, medical devices have to
be approved by, here in the US,

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.542
it's the FDA, the Food
and Drug Administration,

01:28:03.542 --> 01:28:05.625
and then in Europe, there
is equivalent, you know,

01:28:05.625 --> 01:28:07.170
European level thing.

01:28:07.170 --> 01:28:08.850
It's very, very detailed.

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:10.330
It's really not that different.

01:28:10.330 --> 01:28:13.020
So presenting your
medical device design

01:28:13.020 --> 01:28:14.580
to a panel of experts--

01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:23.410
doctors, you know, people in
medical safety, regulators--

01:28:23.410 --> 01:28:26.921
it is like a CDR. You basically
are going through a CDR

01:28:26.921 --> 01:28:29.170
when you're trying to get
your medical device approved

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.430
for sale and use.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:35.350
So it's not often called a CDR,
but it effectively is a CDR.

01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:39.280
So this is, especially
in industries

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:43.600
where there's a lot of
money at stake and people,

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.830
you know, safety, people's
health is at stake,

01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:50.560
this is common practice.

01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.570
OK, so let me summarize here.

01:28:52.570 --> 01:28:55.770
So this is the detailed
design phase we discussed.

01:28:55.770 --> 01:28:57.790
It's very important.

01:28:57.790 --> 01:29:00.250
Basically, you take
your PDR level design

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:04.180
and you go define all the
details in full maturity.

01:29:04.180 --> 01:29:06.760
You create design
documents and models.

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:10.510
And you know, as we
talked about last time,

01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:12.250
we're sort of in
this transition phase

01:29:12.250 --> 01:29:15.130
of producing documents
versus producing models.

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:18.220
Typically, we have both now.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:21.520
Examples would be detailed
bill of materials,

01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:25.120
computer-aided design files--
we'll talk about CAD next week,

01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.590
computer-aided design--

01:29:26.590 --> 01:29:28.660
software and control
system definition,

01:29:28.660 --> 01:29:32.420
user interfaces, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:36.326
Multidisciplinary
design optimization

01:29:36.326 --> 01:29:40.360
is a very powerful
concept to optimize

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:42.680
at the system and
the subsystem level

01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.730
and trade off between
disciplines and objectives.

01:29:45.730 --> 01:29:49.040
The CDFs are the concurrent
design facilities,

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:52.880
and they've now become standard
practice both in aerospace

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:55.880
and product design companies.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:59.720
If you have not had the
chance to experience and work

01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:03.200
in a CDF, I really
encourage you to do this.

01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:05.750
I think it's a
life-changing experience.

01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:10.100
It really-- it's not easy,
because like, you know, Justice

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:12.740
said, there's a lot of
information to absorb.

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:16.040
But once you've done
this and experienced it,

01:30:16.040 --> 01:30:19.260
you realize if you
don't have a CDF,

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:23.750
if you don't design products
this way, you really should.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:26.150
And then CDR is
the big milestone,

01:30:26.150 --> 01:30:30.520
the last gate before, quote,
end quote, cutting metal.

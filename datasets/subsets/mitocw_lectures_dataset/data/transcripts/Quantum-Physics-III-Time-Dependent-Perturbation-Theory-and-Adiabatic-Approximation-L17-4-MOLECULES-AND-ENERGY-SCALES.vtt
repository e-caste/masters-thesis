00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:14.590
PROFESSOR: The molecules and
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.660
OK, we all know
that molecules are

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.370
a lot harder to
solve than atoms,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.790
and even atoms are
not that easy once you

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.890
have more than one
electron because

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.570
of the electrostatic
repulsion, but molecules

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.110
are significantly different
in that one of the greatest

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.200
simplicities that
we had with atoms

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.230
is that the atom is such
that the potential created

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.280
by the nucleus is
spherically symmetric.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.440
When you have a molecule
you have separate nuclei

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.460
and therefore your
spherical symmetry is gone,

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.380
and whether you
have one electron

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.000
or more than one electron,
there is no spherical symmetry.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.450
All our tools of angular
momentum don't help us much.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.450
We have to start
the problem anew.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.580
So the difficulty with
molecules is basically

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.090
that the potential for the
electrons, where they move

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.450
is not spherically symmetric.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.220
There is another
thing that helps

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.690
us, however, is that there's a
nice separation of mass scales.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.410
You have the mass,
little m, of the electron

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.660
and the nuclear mass, this
could be the mass of one nucleus

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.570
or a mass of a few
nuclei or doesn't matter,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:10.460
but this is small, and typically
it is 10 to the minus 4.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.850
You know, an electron is
about 2,000 times lighter

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.260
than a single proton.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.530
If you already have a nice
nucleus with a couple of them,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.390
you're several
thousandths already there,

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.150
so this is a nice number.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.670
So we want to understand the
scales of the physics of this,

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.710
so let's assume we
have a molecule,

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:39.310
maybe a has few centers and
then there's electronic cloud,

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.660
and it has a size
of the order of a.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.310
So we can estimate
at first sight what

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.800
are the energies involved here?

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.980
What is the energy of the
electron, for example?

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.400
And you can say the
momentum of the electron

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.055
is of the order of h bar
times the size of the cloud.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:17.300
It's an estimate, and the
energies, the electron

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.380
energies, are
basically determined

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.040
by the size in which
there are confined,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.270
which is a, h bar, and
the mass of the electron.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:36.530
Those are the electronic
energy, so h squared over

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.600
m a squared, those
are the right units,

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.030
is p squared over m, the units,
so it's natural like this.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.400
So this is the
electronic configuration

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.280
and typical electronic
energy, so what

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:07.860
is the approximate picture
of the physics of a molecule?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:16.260
Basically you have nuclei, and
the nuclei repel each other,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.060
they want to be away.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.019
Now the electrons
come in and then they

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.410
fly around the nuclei, and the
electrons attract the nuclei

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.010
and attract the nuclei, so the
electrons, reasonably placed,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.240
compensate the
repulsion of the nuclei

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.810
by creating some new attraction.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.640
At the end you get some
kind of equilibrium.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.320
It's not classical because
you cannot create stable

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.750
equilibrium between
classical particles.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.460
This is one of the amazing
things about quantum mechanics.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.220
You know very well
an atom would not

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.970
exist without quantum
mechanics, you

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:06.930
would have stable classical
orbits, circular orbits,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.720
but they radiate
energy so they decay.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:15.180
If you have a molecule you
have two repelling positive

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.110
charged particles.

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.880
In [? E&M ?] you
saw the case when

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.130
you put the negative
charge in the middle

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.420
and you create equilibrium,
but that's absolutely unstable.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.640
You move that electric charge
a micron and then off it goes,

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.980
the whole thing is unstable.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.550
But quantum mechanics
solves those problems

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:41.730
and our physical picture is
that of repelling nuclei,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.970
an attracting cloud
of electrons creating

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.340
an equilibrium in which
the nuclei are reasonably

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.970
well-localized, they're
quantum particles

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.490
but they're reasonably
well-localized,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.590
while the electrons are
completely delocalized.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:07.300
That is our picture, they
are moving in that way.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.200
So our picture will
be-- we have that

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.220
and we have slow vibrations
of the nuclei that

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.230
are mostly localized.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:27.260
And you can imagine calculating
the electronic configuration

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.460
for any particular
separation of the nuclei

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.800
and that's the cloud
for this separation.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.020
As the nuclei vibrate, the
electronic configuration

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.780
probably adjusts
adiabatically to this thing

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.130
in the instantaneous
eigenstates,

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.850
and they work that way.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.190
We're going to do that in
trying to understand things.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.800
I also want to
emphasize this kind

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.690
of remarkable property
of an electron

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:05.960
to create the bound state.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:14.380
So we are not amazed on the
fact that if we have a proton

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:23.050
and we can have an electron
here, we create a bound state,

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.120
and that's a hydrogen atom.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:37.860
But suppose I bring in
another proton from infinity.

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.340
Well, I-- if I
bring it, I'm going

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.850
to start bringing it here,
this kind of is neutral

00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:51.510
but eventually this proton
is gonna polarize this thing.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.420
OK, I'm going to bring it
and then if I come too close

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.680
it repels it so it will
be a force repelling it

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.200
and we have to figure
out what it does.

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.020
Suppose I try to bring it in.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:15.960
Do you think that an electron
is capable of stabilizing

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.940
two protons?

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:26.490
Can they create a cloud in which
an electron stabilizes the two

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:27.180
protons?

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:29.870
Is that possible
or not possible?

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:34.870
There's a lot of protons
for one single electron.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:36.900
Is that possible or not?

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.575
All right, you say yes,
yes, any other opinions?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.930
Can that happen?

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.992
Can the electric produce a bound
state of two protons like that?

00:08:51.992 --> 00:08:53.450
AUDIENCE: Isn't
that just hydrogen?

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:54.158
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:56.204
AUDIENCE: Isn't
that just hydrogen?

00:08:56.204 --> 00:08:57.120
PROFESSOR: It is what?

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.614
AUDIENCE: Isn't
that just hydrogen?

00:08:58.614 --> 00:09:01.610
Or [INAUDIBLE]
hydrogen [INAUDIBLE]??

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.510
PROFESSOR: OK, yes,
it can produce it,

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:10.210
and this would be called,
with an electron here,

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:14.098
the hydrogen
molecule ion, so H2+.

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:21.220
It's a hydrogen molecule
that had these two things

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:26.410
and it lost one electron,
and yes, this can be done

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.500
and we'll analyze it.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.490
And now you can
get greedy and say,

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:37.950
can you get an electron to
stabilize three protons?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.740
Yes or no?

00:09:45.274 --> 00:09:50.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:54.280
PROFESSOR: No, cannot get
it, it's just too much work

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.000
for an electron.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.650
It cannot do it.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.800
There are theorems
like that, Elliott

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.846
Lieb, a mathematical
physicist, has proven

00:10:01.846 --> 00:10:03.220
all kinds of these
things, and we

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.650
might discuss some of
that in the homework,

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.410
it's kind of nice stuff.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:13.870
So we will be looking at
the physics of those things

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:15.230
with a little detail.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.270
So now of let's go
back to our molecule

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:30.005
here and estimate the
vibrational nuclear energy.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.570
So we have this picture,
the electrons are there,

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:40.680
the nuclei are kind
of semi-classical,

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.880
they are roughly localized
and they're varying,

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:50.700
and how would we estimate the
nuclear vibration frequency?

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:58.240
So estimate nuclear vibration.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.590
So we think of a
harmonic oscillator,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:09.920
b squared over 2
mass of the nucleons,

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:20.900
plus a restoring force,
H subnuclear oscillation.

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.820
So this is an estimate so
it's not very rigorous,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:29.120
but I think it will
be clear enough.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.670
Now this restoring
force has to do

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:36.320
with the cloud of the electrons
that adjusts and does things.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.860
As you separate
the nuclei you have

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.720
to restore the
restoring energies

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.800
due to the electrons
and the Coulomb forces,

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:53.390
but it does not depend on the
mass, M, the restoring force.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:59.210
So this k depends on the
electrons and Coulomb forces

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:03.810
but definitely not on the
mass of this quantity.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:13.290
So k has units of
E over L squared,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.550
and for energy we
have this energy

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:22.850
of the electron and
length, the length,

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:28.280
the scale of the molecule,
so k is proportional to h

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.240
squared over ma to the fourth.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.840
It just cannot depend on
the mass of the nuclei,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:38.900
that's definitely not the
origin of the restoring force,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:43.100
so if the only mass you can use
is the mass of the electron it

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.770
can only be that.

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:50.330
But then the frequency,
omega, is square root

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:54.530
of k over M, that is
the mass of the nuclei,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:58.940
so the nuclear
frequency is this,

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.970
and it's therefore
equal to h squared

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:10.800
over ma fourth one
over M, that was k,

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:23.080
and this is square root of
little m over capital M times

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:29.020
square root of h squared over
m squared a to the fourth,

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:34.980
I borrowed a little m
up and a little m down.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:42.180
So from here we get
that h bar omega

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:48.900
nuclear is square root of
little m over capital M,

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.450
h squared over ma squared.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:58.750
If you take the square root here
you get h bar over ma squared,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.930
but there was another
h bar I put in.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:07.180
And now we get a
sensible equation

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:16.180
in which we see that the
nuclear energies for oscillation

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.660
are much smaller,
significantly smaller,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:30.310
so E nuclear oscillations go
like square root of m over M

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.590
is 10 to the minus 4,
we say square root is 10

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:37.150
to the minus 2,
times E electronic.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:51.170
So it's considerably less which
is this, so if you think--

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:56.680
I want to make another
observation here on timescales,

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:06.160
so omega n, we have
it here, omega n,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:13.730
or we have it here as well,
is equal to this times

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:17.360
this quantity, so let
me say it this way.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:23.330
The omega electronic
for vibrations

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:30.680
is the electronic energy divided
by h bar, I need h bar over ma

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:39.070
squared, but here we see
that that's precisely

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:46.480
that square root, so
the omega nuclear is

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:54.250
equal to little m over
M omega electronic.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:01.300
Now that is nice because it says
that the frequency associated

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.260
to the nuclear thing
is much smaller

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:11.030
than the timescales associated
with electronic changes.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.490
So this is a good reason
for our idiomatic thinking

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:21.190
that as the nuclei
slowly oscillate,

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.880
the electronic cloud remains
in that particular eigenstate

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.310
and thus and jump.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:31.250
It's our use of the
adiabatic approximation.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:37.090
A last comment is that
the rotational energy

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:42.670
of the molecule goes like
the angular momentum squared

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.670
over twice the
moment of inertia,

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.900
L squared is h squared
times some numbers,

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.170
as usual, L times
L plus 1, and here

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:57.250
you get the mass of the
molecule times the size squared

00:16:57.250 --> 00:16:59.200
of the molecule.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:09.099
These energies are like
little m over capital M times,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:16.780
this is roughly h squared
over little ma squared,

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.060
and therefore the
rotational energies

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.930
are even smaller than
the electronic energies.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:28.270
The rotational energies
go like little m

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:31.375
over capital M times
the electronic energies.

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.860
So you have the electronic
energies, the nuclear energies

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.890
of oscillation, which
go like square root,

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.590
and then finally
the smallest of them

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.470
are the rotation, in
which the molecule rotates

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.540
like a solid object.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.900
We'll continue this next
time and calculate a few more

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.350
things and molecules.

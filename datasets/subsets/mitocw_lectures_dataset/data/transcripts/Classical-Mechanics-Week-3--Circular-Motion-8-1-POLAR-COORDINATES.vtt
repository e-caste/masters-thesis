00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.060
There are many physical problems
in which a body undergoes

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.770
motion about a central point.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.350
And when that happens, there's
a natural coordinate system

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.150
to describe that motion,
which in two dimensions

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.820
is polar coordinates.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.390
So let's consider the
orbit of an object.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.172
For instance, the best
example is a circular orbit.

00:00:22.172 --> 00:00:24.770
If we have a circular
orbit of an object,

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.632
there is a central point,
which we'll call P.

00:00:27.632 --> 00:00:31.920
Now given this type of
motion with an object,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.770
it naturally makes sense to
choose a coordinate system

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.540
called polar coordinates.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.200
The way that coordinate
system works is as follows.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.440
First off, we need to
choose a reference angle.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.510
And so we'll choose
a horizontal line.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.310
And we'll draw a ray.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.880
And we'll show a direction
of increasing reference angle

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.140
theta.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.050
In this example, theta
will go from 0 to 2 pi.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.980
Along with the reference
angle, we have a distance

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.390
from the central point.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.910
And that distance
we'll refer to as r.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.910
So the coordinates of our
point are r and theta.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.960
Now the variable r is
always greater than r

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.520
and can go to infinity--
greater than 0.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.990
So this is our polar
coordinate system.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.930
When you have a
coordinate system,

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.420
remember, at every
point in space,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.440
there has to be unit vectors.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.830
So at this point right here,
how do we choose unit vectors

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.170
for polar coordinates?

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.240
We always choose
the unit vectors

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.620
to point in the increasing
direction of the coordinate.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.030
Take the r-coordinate.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.039
That increases radially outward.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.390
So our unit vectors
here will have a r hat

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.970
pointing radially outward.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.660
What about the theta direction?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.940
Tangential to the circle,
in this particular case.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.390
Because theta is increasing
in this direction,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.190
we choose our
tangential unit vector,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.600
which we're going to call theta
hat, which is at right angles

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.460
to r hat, to point in the
direction of increasing theta.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.130
And so at this point, we now
have a set of unit vectors.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.170
Now one has to be very
careful in polar coordinates

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.720
for the following reason.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.420
Suppose that you're at
another point over here.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.740
Now because we have
two different points,

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.660
let's just give some
names to these points.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.300
We'll call this s1
and this point s2.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.110
And the unit vector's over
here where r1 and theta were.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.300
When we're at the
point as 2, we have

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.240
to choose unit vectors
exactly the same way.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.454
r hat 2 points in the direction
of increasing r, and theta hat

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:56.290
2 points in the direction
of increasing theta.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.210
So what we see in
polar coordinates

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.150
is that r hat 1 is
not equal to r hat 2.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.420
Why are they not equal?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.720
They both are unit
vectors, so they both have

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.950
the same magnitude, but they
point in opposite directions,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.660
in the same way that theta hat
1 is not equal to theta hat 2.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.950
So unlike Cartesian coordinates,
in which at every single point

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.210
had the same unit vectors,
in polar coordinates,

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.829
the unit vectors depend
on where you are in space.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.829
And that will make our
analysis on polar coordinates

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.039
a little bit more complicated.

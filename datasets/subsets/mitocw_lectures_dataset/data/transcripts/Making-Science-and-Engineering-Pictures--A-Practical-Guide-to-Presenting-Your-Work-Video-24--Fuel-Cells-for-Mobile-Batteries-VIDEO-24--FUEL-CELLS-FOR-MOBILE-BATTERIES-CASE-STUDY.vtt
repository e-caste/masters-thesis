00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.650
Here's another example,
not as dramatic,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:11.160
of creating a photo
illustration out of photographs.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.710
But in this case, this
is also showing evidence

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.100
that you are fabricating
the pieces in your device.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.180
This particular image is a CAD
image used by the researchers

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.440
to show their device showing
the various fabrications,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.320
and this is how they used it
in their patent submission.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.320
But this is done in CAD.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.640
They also made a
picture of their device,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.240
but you really
can't see very much

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.770
about their very
sophisticated ability

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.100
to make the various layers.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.540
And so what I did was
I took that device

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.980
and separated it into
the initial pieces

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.400
that they did fabricate.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.239
I laid them out on a
background and decided

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.500
to try to use these images
showing the layering of how

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.380
the device is made.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.690
So out of these
images, I constructed

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.100
a photo illustration of
those pieces using software.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.330
But these are real images that
you've just seen from before.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.360
Here's another way of
showing it, making it

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.670
somewhat three dimensional.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.539
But basically, this is
a photo illustration

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.009
of the layers of this
device not only showing

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.470
how it works (with the
right labeling of course),

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.300
but also showing that they did
indeed fabricate the layers.

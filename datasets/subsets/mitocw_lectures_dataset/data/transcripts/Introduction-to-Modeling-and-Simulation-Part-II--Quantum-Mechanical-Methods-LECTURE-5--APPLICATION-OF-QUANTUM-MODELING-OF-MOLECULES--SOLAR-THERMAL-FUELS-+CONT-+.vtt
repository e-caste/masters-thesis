00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.320
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: All right.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.570
So we are here.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.580
I'm highlighting
two, because I really

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.040
want to keep talking
about solar thermal fuels,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.170
mostly because it really
captures a key problem

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.480
that only quantum
mechanics can solve.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.980
OK?

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.930
So I really want to
hit that home hard.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.560
Also, because it's the
topic of your next homework,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.830
and also because I'm biased.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.553
I'm more excited
about this than this.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.970
But I want to tell you a little
bit about hydrogen storage

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.450
too, and why I think
that's a perfect problem

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.000
for atomic-scale
computational modeling.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.960
OK?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.030
So we're going to do a lot
more of solar thermal fuels,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.370
picking up where we did
before, and then a little bit

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.540
of hydrogen storage.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.930
Now, before we do that,
I want to keep blending

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.280
in some reinforcement
of key basic concepts

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.760
that we have touched on,
and we need to make sure

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.890
we feel good about them.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.240
So we're going to
feel good today

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240
about energy levels, first
bullet of the outline,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.243
feeling good.

00:01:30.243 --> 00:01:31.660
It's a good way
to start, I think.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.900
I didn't need to put
that there, because you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.430
would have felt good anyway.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.180
Right?

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.740
But there it is in writing.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.248
We're going to feel good
about energy levels,

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:45.540
and then we're going to keep
talking about solar fuels.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.440
And we'll do a few
calculations, more calculations

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.150
on the nanoHUB together.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.780
Right?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.510
Again, no better
way to pass time.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.140
OK?

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.720
And then we'll talk
about hydrogen storage.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.960
That's our plan.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.880
Now, like I said, I want
to keep reinforcing--

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.180
I did this, and it
put me off balance.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.470
It's excitement.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.430
That's a little bit
more than my usual even.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.080
It's also, I think,
just old age.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.420
I think sometimes, you
get a little off balance.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.410
Anyway, now, point is
that I think probably I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.510
like watch the NBA so
much, because I still

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.620
don't want to give up the
idea that I could someday

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.990
be in the NBA myself.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.490
So I'm not letting
go of that dream,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.070
but anyway, I want to go back to
one of my original excitements

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.430
here about materials
design which

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.020
is one of the
things I really want

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.300
to make sure we
capture in this class,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.530
designing materials
and computers.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.030
Right?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.930
So I want to take
carbon, and I just

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.180
have two or three slides here.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.920
So I want to touch
on what I think

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.750
is a really exciting
example of materials design,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.810
and you all know this.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.310
Right?

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.518
You know carbon can do this
and this, and many of you

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:07.610
know that carbon can do--

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.860
well, where are my fullerenes?

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.700
Well, there's some nanotubes.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.720
There's fullerenes inside
of nanotubes, p-pods.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.650
Right?

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.320
Now, there's all kinds
of forms of carbon

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.720
that there didn't used to
be, or there used to be,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.590
but we didn't see them, and
we couldn't control them.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.010
OK?

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.330
And I want to give
you a really, I think,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.510
interesting analysis of one
thing you can do with carbon.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.260
OK?

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.100
And then another thing you can
do with it, when you design it,

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.480
when you can do
materials design.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.280
So this is what we do with
carbon now that we find in oil.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.090
Right?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.440
We burn it, and there's 1.73
megawatt hours of energy

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.150
when you burn a barrel of oil.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.138
Right?

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:51.430
I didn't show you this example.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.150
Did I?

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.780
OK.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.920
Because I think it's
a really neat one.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.920
So that's how much energy
is in a barrel of oil,

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.300
and it's a lot of energy.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.840
That's a really nice--

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.490
oil is amazing.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.040
It's like this incredible
energy-dense, safe,

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.040
transportable, storage system.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.910
Right?

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.910
It's solar powered.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:15.410
Right?

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.079
You all know that
it's made by the sun,

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.420
but it's not renewable,
which is a problem,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.300
but it's a really
beautiful fuel.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.437
Now, oil has a lot
of carbon in it

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:29.770
which is what's burning there
and giving you that energy

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.265
release.

00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:33.640
But there are other things
you can do with that material,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.310
and one thing you can do is
you can make these other forms

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.660
of carbon from the oil.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.420
In fact, that's how we
make a lot of our plastics.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.110
OK?

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.750
We make a lot of
plastics using oil.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.290
If I take 1%, just 1% of the
carbon in these 159 liters

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:55.390
of oil, just 1% of it, and
I make that into plastic,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.170
then because I know how to
design carbon to be something

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.000
else, like fullerenes, I can
make polymers and fullerenes

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.300
out of that same element
carbon and put them together--

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.430
gesundheit, whoever that was--

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.610
and make solar cells,
new kinds of solar cells,

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.600
in fact, solar cells made
out of mostly carbon.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.350
If I take 1% of that
carbon that was in here,

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.620
and I turn it into this,
which we now know how to do,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.540
then I can make really
bad solar cells.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.200
5% efficient, not so
good, die in one year,

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.220
not so good. right?

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.390
The efficiency goes down.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.580
Most solar cells, you
get a 20-year warranty.

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.180
This one, one-year warranty,
then efficiency is gone.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.940
Even in that case,
this solar cell

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.150
over that one year of
really crappy efficiency

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.070
will give me 10,000
times as much energy than

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.060
by burning the carbon, 10,000.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.340
Now, these are hand-waving
arguments that are

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:59.870
back-of-the-envelope
calculations,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.050
but when you've got five orders
of magnitude to play with,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.370
things are good.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.970
Right?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.550
And this is an example
in the energy space.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.350
This is why I get so excited
about designing materials,

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.360
and this in particular, this
is only 100 nanometers thick.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.070
Right?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.653
The solar cell's
thicker, because it's

00:06:19.653 --> 00:06:22.330
packaged but the active layer,
the part of the material that's

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.150
making the sun turn into
electrons and holes,

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.590
something we're going to talk
about in our next example,

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.820
in a few weeks.

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.890
That part is 100
nanometers thick.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.050
That's atomic scale.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.430
That's the atomic scale.

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.560
You can't pack that many
polymers and fullerenes

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.300
into 100 nanometers.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.230
Things at the atomic scale and
the quantum mechanical aspects

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.410
of that material are
critical, and designing

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.420
that material is
something you can

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.430
do using atomistic modeling.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:52.690
So this is what I mean.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:58.820
You want to give elements
completely new possibilities,

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.510
and you can see the
power of doing that.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:06.580
It changes the way we know
how to use those elements,

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.490
and I think that's just
a very powerful concept.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.770
OK.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.220
Any questions
about that example.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.320
So that's my little my material
design example of the day,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.340
if you will.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.190
We should make like a
calendar, each day a new--

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.680
OK.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.940
Now, I want to pause and feel
our oneness with energy levels

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.300
and basis sets.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.970
So this is, again, going back
to some important key elements

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.455
of the computations,
and then we're

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:37.705
going to come back to the
calculations and the example

00:07:37.705 --> 00:07:39.130
of the solar thermal fuels.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.570
OK?

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:45.580
Now these are things that
we have talked about,

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.220
but they're so
important that I want

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.720
to talk about them again and
make sure there's no questions.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.690
Make sure that we are
all on the same page

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.190
and know what these things mean.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:54.760
OK?

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.630
So I want to give you,
this is my attempt

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:04.430
at summarizing our beautiful
path to the energy level.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.930
OK?

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.620
So let's make sure
we're with it.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:07.270
All right?

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.590
So it all started back
in the day in lecture one

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.420
with the Schrodinger equation.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.070
Does everybody recognized that?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.710
Now, that is the
equation we're solving.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:20.320
When you click
Simulate to calculate

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.010
the energy versus separation
in say, I don't know,

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.000
n-2, then the equation that's
being solved in a computer

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.370
is this one, the
Schrodinger equation.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:32.840
Now, what are you getting
out of that equation?

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.734
Well, what you're
getting are what?

00:08:35.734 --> 00:08:38.247
These, what are these?

00:08:38.247 --> 00:08:39.289
AUDIENCE: Wave functions.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:40.289
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:43.490
Thank you, and why
do I want those?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.440
What do they tell me?

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:47.940
AUDIENCE: Probability.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.330
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:48.630
Yeah.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:50.922
The tell me the probability,
and they tell me more than

00:08:50.922 --> 00:08:53.230
that which is what we need
to make sure we understand.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.045
So you see, solving
that equation gives me

00:08:57.045 --> 00:09:03.390
wave function, and the wave
functions, well, they're waves.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:03.890
Right?

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.340
They have some shape to them.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.190
They may change in time.

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.100
Do we care about that?

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.390
Not in this class, not in
this class, in this class,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.900
its all time independent.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.560
So we're doing like a snapshot,
but they may change in time.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.090
But they certainly vary
in space, and that is psi.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.020
Right?

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:30.250
Now, what we talked about
is how these wave functions

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.390
themselves, we don't know how
to draw physical meaning from.

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.250
That doesn't mean that
they're meaningless,

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.380
and this is a really
important point

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:42.590
that we have to feel good about.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:43.090
OK?

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.070
So I'm going to
come back to that,

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:47.770
but we know that when you square
them, we know what they mean,

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.550
and that's this.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:49.440
Right?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.844
So what are These do you
guys remember what these are?

00:09:51.844 --> 00:09:53.740
AUDIENCE: Orbitals.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:56.330
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Orbitals, such a bad name,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.120
but anyway, because
why is it a bad name?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.870
AUDIENCE: Because they
don't really orbit.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.630
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Yeah, totally, but anyway,

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:04.950
these are orbitals.

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.350
So these are those wave
functions squared for what?

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.836
Who knows what-- but
what system is this?

00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:18.700
These are the atomic
orbitals of a hydrogen

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.240
atom, one electron, one proton.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.670
OK?

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.441
You can solve that analytically.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:34.560
Now, so we said, OK,
well, this gives us

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.380
like an electron sitting in
one of these little wiggles.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:38.880
OK?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.670
We said that they
go up in energy.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.440
They have different energies.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.390
That's really important.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:48.910
Each wave function you solve
for has a different energy.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:49.410
Right?

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.290
So you get these functions, and
they have different energies,

00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:54.960
and there it is for
hydrogen. There's

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.290
the energy for hydrogen. It just
depends on 1 over the principle

00:10:58.290 --> 00:10:59.700
quantum number squared.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.720
Right?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.670
Remember, we talked
about how it's quantized?

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.470
But these little wiggles,
when you square them,

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.850
they give you the picture of
where that electron is going

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:14.610
to be, where it's likely to be.

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:16.845
And we looked at how the
shapes got more complicated,

00:11:16.845 --> 00:11:18.345
and what are these
type of orbitals?

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:19.382
AUDIENCE: P

00:11:19.382 --> 00:11:20.340
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: p?

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.810
And then it goes to other
things, d and then f.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.210
And then we said,
OK, that's nice.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.890
That's great, but also there's
this thing called spin.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:34.870
OK?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.360
And somebody remind
me what spin is.

00:11:40.186 --> 00:11:42.070
AUDIENCE: Property
of the material.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.060
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Property
of what thing in particular?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:46.673
Yeah?

00:11:46.673 --> 00:11:48.590
AUDIENCE: It's some
intrinsic angular momentum

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.840
that a particle has.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:51.470
AUDIENCE: Regardless
of its motion.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.178
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
And if that particle

00:11:53.178 --> 00:11:56.110
happens to be an electron,
what are your options?

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.778
AUDIENCE: In the first one?

00:11:59.778 --> 00:12:00.820
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yes.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:01.900
AUDIENCE: Plus or minus.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.358
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Plus or minus.

00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:04.990
It can only be--

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.910
or as we like to say
up or down or as we

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:13.670
like to draw this or that.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.270
Lots of ways of doing this,
but I think you get the point.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.540
And then we talked
about poly which

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:26.130
gave us rules for how
electrons can be together

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:29.180
in one of these orbitals.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:30.210
OK?

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:32.730
So you have wave
functions that wiggle.

00:12:35.283 --> 00:12:37.200
We don't know how to
interpret what they mean,

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.320
but we know that their square
gives you the probability

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.560
distribution of that electron.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.990
And we know that
these electrons also

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.710
have another important quantity
associated with them, a spin,

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:53.710
and the spin can only be one
of two values, up or down.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.660
OK?

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.960
That is the information we
need to go to energy levels.

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:00.460
OK?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.560
To this point, this is a
review, but it's about to be--

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.083
well, maybe
something some of you

00:13:09.083 --> 00:13:11.000
know, but it's about to
be a little different.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.550
OK?

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:14.140
So I want to make sure
we all understand this.

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.650
Once I know that you can
have two kinds of spin,

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:20.920
and once I know that you get
energies out of this equation,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.860
then the answer to
the energy levels,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.370
to what energy
levels are, is there

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.382
are these things that you fill.

00:13:29.382 --> 00:13:31.630
There are these things that
you fill with electrons.

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:33.450
How do you fill them?

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.500
I keep blocking the screen,
but it's fun to go in there.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.660
It makes me feel
important maybe.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:40.500
I don't know.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.240
Never mind.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.070
How do you fill them?

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.640
I'll use this.

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.770
Oh, yeah.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:51.210
What do you do here?

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.160
What's going on?

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.250
I want to fill these orbitals.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.000
Do I fill this one

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.542
AUDIENCE: You start
at the lowest end

00:13:58.542 --> 00:13:59.840
and work to the highest.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.380
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Yeah, and when do I stop?

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.540
AUDIENCE: When you
run out of electrons.

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.450
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: When
you run out of electrons.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.420
How many electrons did I have?

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.920
AUDIENCE: 29.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.970
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It depends
on the atom or molecule which

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:18.690
is where we are now or solid.

00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.410
Now, that is really
in a way-- the reason

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.430
I'm focusing on it is this
is the key quantum mechanical

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:37.750
nature thingy,
property of materials,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:40.000
I want you to come away with
being able to understand

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.720
and calculate in this class.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.220
OK?

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.290
It's these energy levels.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.750
This is the most important
thing I want you to come away

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:47.290
with from this class.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.890
Why?

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:49.600
Well, we can calculate
other things,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.520
and I've talked about that.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.733
We can calculate energies.

00:14:53.733 --> 00:14:55.150
We can calculate
binding energies.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.970
We can calculate
all kinds of things,

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:02.020
but these energy levels are
purely quantum mechanical.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:02.710
Right?

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.160
There where those electrons
want to be in energy,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.990
and they matter so much to
the properties of materials.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:13.630
So I want to focus on
these and connect them

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.610
to real exciting problems.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.330
OK?

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.830
And make sure that
you understand

00:15:17.830 --> 00:15:22.030
where they come from and
also how to calculate them

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:23.830
and what they can mean.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.160
So that's where we are.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.360
So that's why I keep
drawing things like this.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.350
You see me just drawing this.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.035
Right?

00:15:30.035 --> 00:15:30.910
Now, what did I draw?

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.570
I don't know.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.700
I drew a bunch of levels.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.380
Right?

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:43.230
If I'm a little more
careful, and I do this,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.550
now what am I drawing?

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.130
What is that?

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.060
AUDIENCE: Energy diagram.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.190
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Energy diagram.

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:56.970
OK, good.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:03.310
What is it though?

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.125
Do we know?

00:16:06.125 --> 00:16:08.000
AUDIENCE: Like there's
no electrons in there.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.540
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
OK, and it's

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:12.895
the solution to which problem?

00:16:12.895 --> 00:16:14.520
Actually, this is
infinite square well.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:16.970
So that's not the
hydrogen atom, but those

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:19.580
are the energy levels
you get for the solution

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:21.670
of the hydrogen atom.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.270
OK?

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:25.120
Now, if I ask you what this
is though without putting

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.210
any electrons down, we don't
know, but what if I do this?

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:34.070
Now, what is it?

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:37.046
Hydrogen, what about now?

00:16:37.046 --> 00:16:38.820
AUDIENCE: Lithium.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:42.930
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Lithium, what is this?

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:43.980
Oh, I love this one.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.090
AUDIENCE: Carbon.

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.000
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Carbon, carbon,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.030
it's a beautiful material.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.280
I love carbon.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:55.647
OK?

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:57.480
I almost feel like you
need a little moment.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.446
When you draw the
energy levels of carbon,

00:16:59.446 --> 00:17:03.160
you need a little
moment of respect.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.089
Now, but you see,
this is what we did.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:08.880
We solved for these wiggles.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:13.170
We got energies, and
we put them in order

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.589
from lowest to highest.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:16.547
And then we said how many
electrons do we have?

00:17:16.547 --> 00:17:18.030
Six, OK, fill them,
and then there

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.322
are rules that we talked
about about how you fill them.

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:21.990
Now, why am I
going through this?

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:28.500
Well, because that is only
good for what kind of material?

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.040
That is only a correct picture
for what kind of material?

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:44.700
Atoms, that's an atomic picture.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.730
We solve for the atom, and
this is true-- and remember,

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.880
I said that we can solve
for the hydrogen atom

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:53.340
and see the whole
periodic table.

00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.030
Right?

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:58.723
Powerful stuff, but
this is only an atom.

00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:01.140
These are how you would fill
the energy levels of an atom,

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.390
and we've talked about this.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.270
But see now, we're going
onto other things, where

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:09.010
you bring atoms together,
and you form molecules.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:10.320
This is not a chemistry class.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.160
So I'm not going to spend
a lot of time telling you

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.470
about sigma orbitals, pi
orbitals, bonding orbitals,

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:20.580
antibonding orbitals.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.160
That's not what
we're about, but I

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.660
do need you to understand that,
when you bring atoms together,

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:32.550
the orbitals from those
atoms come together

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.590
and form new orbitals.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.810
They form molecular orbitals.

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:37.920
OK?

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.350
Now, in this case, you're
seeing the H2 molecule,

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:43.680
and this is from this website.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.347
There's lots of great
websites that talk

00:18:45.347 --> 00:18:47.130
about molecular orbital theory.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.580
OK?

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.760
And in this case, you
brought two s electrons

00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:56.390
together, see, from a hydrogen
atom over here and a hydrogen

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.300
atom over there, and they
drew those energy levels.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.850
And then they brought
them together,

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:03.410
and it turns out, when
you bring to 1s levels

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:08.690
together to form a molecule,
you get two new levels.

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:09.190
Right?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.990
And the chemists love names, and
so they gave this one a sigma

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.420
1s, and that's a sigma star 1s.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.040
Those are just two
new levels that

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.370
are formed, when you bring
these atomic levels together.

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:30.800
Now, all the same rules-- and
one of them, ah, two points--

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.400
one of them is a
bonding orbital.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:38.120
See, this actually looks like
I brought two circles together,

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.380
and they overlapped.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.940
That's a bonding orbital.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:43.370
OK?

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:48.880
Another one of them, though,
is an antibonding orbital.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.220
All right?

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.050
And an antibonding orbital
is higher in energy.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:54.480
So it's going to come up higher.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:57.510
Its energy is going to be
higher than the bonding orbital,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.000
when you bring two
orbitals together.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.205
And often, an
antibonding orbital

00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:04.260
will actually have
a node, which means

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.020
there's zero chance
of any electron being

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.390
in between, exactly in between.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:13.050
That doesn't sound
very binding-y.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:14.210
Right?

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:16.290
Doesn't have a lot of
appeal for bonding,

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:23.400
if there's like a
plane of no existing.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.590
Now, why would that be possible?

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.870
Doesn't it seem
from this picture--

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:32.320
I took to 1s orbitals, and
I brought them together.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.820
Right?

00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.440
How can I get a
node between them?

00:20:37.709 --> 00:20:40.168
AUDIENCE: Is it [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:40.168 --> 00:20:41.460
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Not quite.

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.684
What is it?

00:20:42.684 --> 00:20:43.967
AUDIENCE: Coulomb repulsion.

00:20:43.967 --> 00:20:45.050
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:20:45.050 --> 00:20:47.500
It is actually.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:49.250
It does have to do
with Coulomb repulsion,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:53.400
but there's something
more basic here at play.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.920
How is it that I can
bring two spheres,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.900
probability spheres
like this together

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:03.170
and have two orbitals
that form, one of which

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.920
has a node in between,
and one of which is

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.190
like really nicely happy bound.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.350
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Not quite, any other?

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:14.268
Yeah?

00:21:14.268 --> 00:21:16.560
AUDIENCE: It looks like the
infinite square well there.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.852
You've got the ground state
that doesn't have any nodes

00:21:18.852 --> 00:21:21.690
and then the first excited
state does, the same deal.

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:22.898
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:21:22.898 --> 00:21:25.330
Well, so that's exactly right.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.680
We're not bringing together
probability distributions.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:29.310
OK?

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.143
That is not the right
way to think about it.

00:21:31.143 --> 00:21:33.010
I won't stand in front anymore.

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:36.180
We're not bringing together
probability distributions.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.510
We're bringing together
wave functions,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.910
and then when those
come together,

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:46.200
they form a probability
distribution or two,

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.480
in the case I just showed you.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.180
And we all know that,
when waves come together,

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.210
they can do what and what?

00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.190
AUDIENCE: Construct
and deconstruct.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.810
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:03.515
They can construct, and they
can deconstruct one another.

00:22:03.515 --> 00:22:04.890
Sounds like they're
going to have

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:09.030
like a philosophical discussion.

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.650
So that's what's happening.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:14.160
We're bringing the
wave function together,

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.500
when we bring atoms together
and molecules together.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.750
We're bringing
their size together.

00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.170
Oh, size, you can't get away
from size being so important,

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.630
and we're solving for
the collective psi.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:28.740
And when you bring waves
together, they have phase,

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:31.240
and they can form constructive
and destructive interference,

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.660
as we talked about in
lectures one and two,

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.320
and that's what's
happening here.

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.950
And then you square those,
and you get new orbitals

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.380
which have those properties.

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:40.880
OK?

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.820
So this is the simplest
example which is H2 molecule,

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.400
and then we fill those orbitals.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.730
And when we fill these
orbitals, when we draw them

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.390
for a molecule, very often,
I'll lose this notation,

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:55.380
because there isn't--

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.770
and I'm not going to go
through this notation,

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.640
mostly because I can't
remember past sigma and pi.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.170
But there's a whole
lot of notation

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:05.700
out there for
molecular orbitals,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.980
and it depends on the
symmetry and the group

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.395
symmetry of the molecule
you're working with,

00:23:11.395 --> 00:23:13.020
and there are rules
and all that stuff.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.728
But all we're going
to need in this class

00:23:14.728 --> 00:23:17.880
is to know that, when
you have a molecule,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:22.810
and you calculate
this wave function

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:24.630
which gives you the wiggles.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.030
And then you square it,
you get the distributions,

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.758
and that helps set
the energy levels.

00:23:28.758 --> 00:23:31.050
It tells you where those
energy levels are going to be,

00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:32.508
that will just draw
them like this.

00:23:32.508 --> 00:23:35.250
Right?

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.740
Now, this is how
I'll draw molecules,

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.150
the energy levels of molecules,
and again this is it.

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.600
This is one of the most
important properties

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.850
I want to focus on,
because this is everything.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.860
This is where those electrons
are in energy space,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.420
and I can plot them.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.510
I can look at their energy,
and there's all kinds

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.400
of important information here.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.810
OK?

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.900
And so what this
means is usually I'll

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:01.860
leave a space here.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.104
Does anybody know
what this is called?

00:24:04.104 --> 00:24:06.270
AUDIENCE: Gap.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.980
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Right.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.610
This is the gap,
because that's how many

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.310
electrons I had in my molecule.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.420
Not my atom, but in my molecule.

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.430
So I do the same thing.

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:23.050
I calculate energy levels,
I fill them up, and I stop.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:27.070
I apply some rules,
like you wouldn't

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:34.120
have one level with two
electrons up, Pauli exclusion.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:34.620
Right?

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.160
And then I stop,
and then there's

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.720
another level beyond that.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.233
Oh, that's important.

00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:44.900
So we're going to
talk about that today.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:47.990
There's another level beyond
that that's not filled,

00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:50.600
but the distance in
energy between these

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.060
is called the gap, and
it's really important.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:55.760
And the energy gap is
what determines all kinds

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.440
of properties about a material.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.840
It determines how
it absorbs light.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.760
It determines how
it conducts charge.

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:11.160
It can determine things about
its magnetic properties,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.290
certainly transport properties.

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.378
And what's going to
happen, and that's

00:25:15.378 --> 00:25:16.920
why I really want
to make sure we all

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.570
understand this for a molecule.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:20.730
What's going to happen
is, when we go to solids--

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.438
on Thursday, we're
going to start talking

00:25:22.438 --> 00:25:23.910
about moving to solids--

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:25.140
this is going to happen.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.360
These are no longer
simple lines.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:34.783
These go like this,
and that's really cool.

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.450
That happens because
you're putting them

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:38.010
in a periodic arrangement.

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:40.430
That's called a band structure.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:41.970
It doesn't happen for molecules.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:44.320
They're just little flat
lines, like they are in atoms.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:45.900
OK?

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:48.390
So are we all good with this?

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:49.770
Are there questions?

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:54.990
Energy levels,
energy levels, need

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.670
to know about energy levels.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:58.760
No questions?

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.520
Yeah?

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:03.250
AUDIENCE: So when you
put up every central gas

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.640
and you calculated
all the total energy,

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.117
if you like have big molecules--

00:26:08.117 --> 00:26:09.200
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.878
AUDIENCE: --you got huge gap and
it's harder to identify that.

00:26:12.878 --> 00:26:14.170
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Which one?

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:16.660
What's harder to identify?

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:17.425
AUDIENCE: Ammonia.

00:26:17.425 --> 00:26:21.330
Because if you have one
more unit, for example--

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:22.580
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: One more.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.160
AUDIENCE: --some group.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.180
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: OK.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.550
So you put an electron here?

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:29.810
Or what do you mean?

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.977
AUDIENCE: So when you
calculated the wave function--

00:26:31.977 --> 00:26:33.060
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.580
AUDIENCE: --how did you know
the electron wave function

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.700
for this type of ammonia?

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.170
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Well, that's--

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:39.670
Yeah.

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:49.460
So that's where really
lecture three covers that.

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.030
Where basically, you need
to use an approximation

00:26:53.030 --> 00:26:55.585
to the Schrodinger equation,
and that approximation

00:26:55.585 --> 00:26:56.960
that we're using
in this class is

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.640
called density function theory.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.290
But then you simply what
goes into that equation

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:05.870
is the approximations
you choose,

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:10.340
and the positions of the atoms
and the number of electrons.

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.940
And once you have
that, you basically

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:13.940
are solving for the psi.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.980
You're solving for these.

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:17.480
Right?

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.440
And you get them and
their energies out,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.710
and it's in the outputs
of the nanoHUB runs.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:24.790
OK?

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:28.870
Now, one last thing before
we go back to solar fuels

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.660
that I want to make sure
we feel our oneness with

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.220
are these basis functions.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:39.130
So this is a slide from another
lecture, an older lecture,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.800
but I just want to
be sure we understand

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.770
what we're doing here.

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:43.690
OK?

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:53.480
So we said we needed to
make size for our materials.

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.850
We need the code to give us psi.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.000
Now, for a hydrogen atom,
these are analytic functions.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:27:59.540
Right?

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.130
They're like sines, cosines,
but for more complex material,

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:08.180
a complex atom, they
can look like this.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.220
They can be really complicated.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:13.080
OK?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.900
So but a computer
can't just draw lines.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:16.890
Right?

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.000
A computer can't do that.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.390
It needs to have some
mathematical representation

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.890
for that function, and
that's what a basis set is.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:27.990
But as I stressed
last week, this

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:36.000
is a new sort of not
a problem, but it's

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.930
a parameter that is not present
in classical simulations.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.390
But it's one you have to
be very carefully aware of,

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.460
and you have to know
when you've converted it.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:46.440
OK?

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.800
And the question
came up last week

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:52.865
of when is a basis
set converged?

00:28:52.865 --> 00:28:53.365
OK?

00:28:57.058 --> 00:28:57.850
And what do I mean?

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.360
Well, I can make a
basis out of anything--

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.130
Gaussians, exponents,
plane waves.

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.950
I can make a basis
out of wavelets

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:13.040
which are really interesting
hat-like functions.

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:16.910
But I can take any function,
and if I add enough of them

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:22.550
in the right places, and they
have the right width and size,

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.190
I can recreate a curve.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.780
That's what we're
doing, but I want

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.760
to have as few as possible.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.270
OK?

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.290
So this is a basis set
study that somebody did

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:38.610
and randomly put on the
web, which I randomly

00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.920
found and didn't credit,
which I should have.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.060
Anyway, this is the
number of basis functions

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.360
going this way, number
of basis functions,

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.380
and that's the energy.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:56.430
And you can see that the
energy is going to change,

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:58.920
as you increase the
number of basis functions,

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.020
and there's this thing
called the basis set limit.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.530
Sometimes it's called the
complete basis set limit,

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:08.650
and that complete basis set
limit is basically just saying,

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.470
hey, I've represented
my wave function

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:13.170
now numerically correctly.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:17.070
So infinite number of basis
functions should give you that.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.705
We don't have
enough computer time

00:30:18.705 --> 00:30:20.580
to have that many basis
functions, because it

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.230
gets really long and slow.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.260
So we don't do that.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.070
Usually, we do calculations out
here, and maybe we extrapolate.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.020
OK?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.300
Or we just do a few
cases, and we say,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.930
well, my results are converged.

00:30:35.930 --> 00:30:38.470
But when is a basis
set converged?

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.600
It's a really important
point of quantum mechanical--

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.640
hey, that would be like
a good quiz question.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.650
Right?

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:47.580
Like it's a really
important part of quantum

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.430
mechanical simulations are
always a quiz question.

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:51.450
It's not a bad one.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.330
Is it converged here,
or is it converged here?

00:30:59.330 --> 00:31:01.695
You know what answer
I'm looking for.

00:31:01.695 --> 00:31:03.070
AUDIENCE: Depends
on the problem.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.410
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: It depends.

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.930
I love that answer
for this class.

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.780
It depends, because
here, I'm plotting

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:16.890
the total energy of
the whole system,

00:31:16.890 --> 00:31:18.820
but is that what I want?

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.060
Is that what I'm calculating?

00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.080
I don't know, maybe, but what if
I'm actually calculating this?

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.840
What if I'm calculating the gap
between the highest occupied

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.550
and lowest occupied level?

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:33.060
Well then, I should plot
that versus the basis set,

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:41.400
and that, this line, the total
energy may converge like this.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.540
Whereas, if I do the gap, it
kind of goes-- maybe it's here,

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.250
and then I get
another value here,

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:50.670
and then everything is fully
converged all the way in.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.185
So the gap value
converged there.

00:31:53.185 --> 00:31:53.810
You don't know.

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:57.380
Different properties will
converge differently,

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:58.880
and you start to
get a feel for it,

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.840
as you do more calculations.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.500
I'm not expecting you to get
to that point in this class,

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:04.950
but I want you to
understand this.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.300
It's really important.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.510
OK?

00:32:07.510 --> 00:32:10.210
So basis sets must be converged.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:11.470
That's one point.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:13.630
This can lead to big tables.

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.850
Chemists love big tables.

00:32:15.850 --> 00:32:19.190
So it's actually a perfect fit.

00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:20.860
So you see papers like this.

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:28.550
Oh, you can go to bse.pnl.gov,
and let's see, maybe I can just

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:29.970
go there really quickly.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:32.230
And you can see,
oh, look at that.

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.800
There's the nanoHUB.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:34.550
We're coming.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:38.000
We're coming, and look at this.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.230
Oh, this is beautiful.

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:44.080
See, many basis sets have
been made over the years.

00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:44.580
Right?

00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:49.600
And so here, they are.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.300
Look at all these basis sets
for different-- and you see,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.530
I can scroll down here.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:54.580
Look at these basis sets.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.360
You have a few of these to
choose from in the nanoHUB,

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.730
but look at how many there are.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.320
These are all
published basis sets,

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.030
and you can go to
a place like this.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:09.880
And you can click on one, like
3-21G*, and you can click on--

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.290
well, I don't think that--

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.310
and you can say what
code am I going to use?

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.130
Right?

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:19.100
And then, you can say get the
basis sets, and there they are.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:22.150
And there are the papers,
where basically, they're

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.530
trying to say what is the
fewest number of Gaussians

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:31.230
that we can use to
represent these atoms?

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:35.720
So basis sets are fit to
atomic orbital wave functions.

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:37.910
OK?

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:39.620
And this is just a
certain form, where

00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:42.470
you have the exponent
of the Gaussian

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.110
and a coefficient
of the Gaussian.

00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:47.570
And I'm not going
to go into details,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.810
because we don't need them.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:49.310
OK?

00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:55.420
There's a lot of
work on basis sets.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.330
There's also a
lot of papers that

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:03.800
were published in the 1970s
and also '80s using basis sets,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:08.120
like this, that show
really good answers using

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:10.969
like Hartree-Fock theory or
density functional theory

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:14.780
even but for the
completely wrong reason.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.960
Because they used a level of
theory that wasn't accurate

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.480
and a basis set that
wasn't converged,

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.030
because the computers couldn't
go to larger basis sets,

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:25.280
and so the errors canceled.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:28.909
So there are many papers
with really nice agreement

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:34.139
with experiment from theory
that are complete nonsense,

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:39.080
because they're using very
inaccurate theory and really

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.280
bad basis sets.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:45.050
And so the errors cancel, and
you get beautiful results.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:50.659
It's something that
we need to be aware of

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.600
and understand in this
class, but we're not

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:57.287
going to go into great detail in
all these different basis sets.

00:34:57.287 --> 00:34:59.120
But you can go there,
and there's just a lot

00:34:59.120 --> 00:34:59.995
of information there.

00:34:59.995 --> 00:35:03.170
And you can play around, and you
can make big tables like this.

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.940
I don't recommend
that you do this.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.490
But this was a study, this
is like the kind of thing--

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:13.620
I think that some people
really like big tables.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:16.460
This one goes on and
on and on, by the way.

00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:17.360
It never stops.

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.790
It almost never stops.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.682
And you see, different
levels theory here.

00:35:24.682 --> 00:35:26.140
These ones we
haven't talked about.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.640
That's LDA, Hartree-Fock and
then different basis sets.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:31.270
You see?

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:33.700
And some property,
the binding energy

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.070
and some other properties
that they care about.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:37.990
OK?

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:39.570
Yeah.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.370
Not expecting you
to do that, but I

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:43.990
want you to be aware
of how big of a concern

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.130
this is in quantum
mechanical calculations.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:50.850
Any questions about basis sets?

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.410
Basis sets.

00:35:52.410 --> 00:36:00.270
The last theory
point, last question

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:05.330
I want to ask, so we
asked, with basis sets,

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:06.830
how do we know when
we're converged?

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:09.650
Well, it depends.

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:12.320
When you add more basis
functions or do a larger basis

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.750
and things don't
change, your converged.

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.250
But there's another
bigger question,

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:20.640
which is how do we know when
the calculation is right,

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.470
that we talked about here.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.840
Now, this is very
important, and it

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.520
goes to the point I just made.

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.650
Just because you
agree with experiment,

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:31.990
if you're not doing your
calculations carefully,

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.190
it can be still dangerous.

00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.810
OK?

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:37.090
But let's suppose that you
have done your calculations

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.540
carefully, and you have
converged your basis set.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.220
And you have checked everything
else about your code,

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.020
and you're asking
the question of which

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.850
of these structures of carbon--

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:51.330
remember, I really like carbon.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.280
Which of these three
structures-- a ring,

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:56.800
a kind of bowl, or a cage--

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.520
gives you-- is most
stable for 20 atoms?

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.560
That's a pretty simple question.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.850
Right?

00:37:04.850 --> 00:37:08.900
This is the question I asked
as a second-year grad student,

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.570
a few years ago now.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.210
Who laughed?

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:12.710
Sam?

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.290
And it was really
cool, because see,

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:19.880
you could try one
level of theory

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.280
and work really hard to
converge it completely.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:24.680
And you'd get, for
example with LDA--

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.540
something you can
do on the nanoHUB--

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:30.870
you would get that the cage,
this guy, is the lowest energy.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:33.320
This means the most stable.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.440
And then you would do another
level of theory, Hartree-Fock

00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.780
or this other thing
that you also have,

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.580
this is called the GGA.

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:43.100
It's another flavor of
density function theory,

00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.990
and you would get
exactly the opposite.

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.510
You would get that the
ring is the most stable,

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.040
and the cage is
the least stable.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:54.710
So what's going on?

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.420
What's going on?

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:59.840
Two different DFT
functionals gave me

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.324
completely different answers,
and I've converged everything.

00:38:06.868 --> 00:38:08.160
AUDIENCE: Two more functionals.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.980
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Two more functionals.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.560
Now, that's actually
a really good idea,

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:16.020
and it's actually
what people do.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.880
OK?

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.010
In fact, you see, if you go to--

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:23.890
I think I left
this web page open.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:26.290
Here's one of the
codes that does

00:38:26.290 --> 00:38:28.690
density functional theory
and other quantum chemistry

00:38:28.690 --> 00:38:29.300
calculations.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.175
It's called Gaussian.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.802
And if you look in
their 2009 version,

00:38:36.802 --> 00:38:38.260
this is a code you
have to pay for.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.560
There's lots of codes
that are free, by the way.

00:38:41.560 --> 00:38:45.430
NWChem, if anybody wants to
play with a code, download it,

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.140
that does quantum
chemistry, that's

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:52.150
a pretty darn good one that's
free which you can download,

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:53.080
and there are others.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:56.320
I'm happy to provide a list.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.790
But look at the
number of functionals

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.240
you have to choose from.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:02.830
OK?

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:04.663
Here's a little bit
about density functional

00:39:04.663 --> 00:39:08.230
theory and the methods, and
then here are the functionals.

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:09.880
exchange functionals.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:15.970
You see S, XA, B, PW, G96, PBE.

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.220
That's one of the
ones on the nanoHUB.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.060
Right?

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:24.632
And correlation functionals,
VWN, LYP, B95, and so

00:39:24.632 --> 00:39:26.590
what you wind up getting--
and then it goes on,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:30.580
standalone functionals,
hybrid functionals.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:31.120
OK?

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:31.840
Here's some more.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:38.890
User defined functionals, you
can actually make up your own.

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:39.550
Right?

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.360
So here's a short list
of some of the keywords

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.960
you can enter and get
different functionals out.

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.620
So now, what do I do?

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:50.930
AUDIENCE: All of them.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.610
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
All of them.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:40:00.070
Well, sadly, I think
some researchers do that.

00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.160
So here's the broader point.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.290
OK?

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:10.980
Density functional theory is
an approximation in the way

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:13.910
that we use it in our codes.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.760
The actual theory
itself could be exact,

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.910
but the way that it
has to be implemented

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:23.730
requires this
approximate functional,

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:26.160
as you learned in lecture three.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.960
OK?

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.600
What functional do I use?

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.170
Well, some of these
have been well tested

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.060
for broad classes
of materials and are

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.210
known to do well for certain
properties, certain materials,

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.910
and known to do not
as well for others,

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:45.120
but it's mostly empirical in
terms of our understanding.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.640
It's because it's been
tried for many systems.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:48.270
OK?

00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:52.320
And so in a way,
we're a little bit

00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.420
back to the classical world.

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.810
In the sense that
density functional theory

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.700
is a beautiful theory,
but to make it practical,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.060
you have to make
approximations that make it

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.570
so that you have almost
an empirical nature to it,

00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:10.600
or a semi-empirical
nature which is what you

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.220
have in classical force fields.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.020
Right?

00:41:13.020 --> 00:41:15.460
In classical force
fields, the potential

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:22.000
is as good as the
complexity of the potential

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.650
and what you fit it to.

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.780
Right?

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.350
Density function theory is,
I think, much more powerful,

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:32.340
in the sense that
you can really solve

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:34.190
for the electronic
structure, but we

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.170
have the same kind of problem
in density functional theory.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.860
So the functionals that I've
given you on the nanoHUB

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:44.730
are some of the
most popular ones,

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.610
but you always
need to be aware--

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:52.910
[NON-ENGLISH]---- of the fact that
we're making an approximation.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:57.280
And yes, one way to check
is to try two functionals,

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.480
and if they don't disagree
too much, you may be OK.

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.580
That's not the most
gratifying way to do it.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.967
Another way would be to
compare with experiment,

00:42:07.967 --> 00:42:09.800
and that's actually the
most gratifying way.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.480
Once you converge
everything else,

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.870
if you're functional
agrees with experiment

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:16.580
for the kind of
problem you're trying

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.120
to solve, then that's a pretty
good indication that it's

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.750
an accurate solution to
the Schrodinger equation,

00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:26.270
but you are making
a approximations.

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.150
OK?

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:32.890
And that is something
that we won't--

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.500
as you can see, I don't
give you much options

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.530
on the nanoHUB, because I
don't really want to go there,

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:40.280
but I do want you
to be aware of this.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.430
We are not solving
quantum mechanics exactly.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:46.390
We cannot, and with
density functional theory,

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.930
there are some systems.

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:53.320
So in my graduate days,
I worked on a method

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:55.690
that goes beyond density
functional theory inaccuracy.

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.810
So it's a very accurate method,
very slow but very accurate.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.720
And so I was
purposefully looking

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:07.720
for systems where DFT fails, and
I was very happy with this one,

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.520
where you basically
don't know the answer.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:10.978
You can try
functionals, and you'll

00:43:10.978 --> 00:43:14.060
get all kinds of
different results.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.060
So the only thing you
can do in that case

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.350
is go to a higher
accuracy method.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:18.850
OK?

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.980
What I found out is
that this method here

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:27.340
is the most accurate one, that
actually none of the functions

00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.810
were right, and the bowl
was the most stable.

00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.830
So it's pretty cool.

00:43:32.830 --> 00:43:34.330
It was exciting.

00:43:34.330 --> 00:43:37.070
What can I say?

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.320
I was a physicist at
the time, so you know.

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.040
I won't say anything more.

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:44.540
OK.

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:48.520
Now, let's go back to our
first application example.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:56.120
Does everybody remember
this from last week?

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.810
OK.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:01.190
So let me make sure we know why.

00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:03.505
OK.

00:44:03.505 --> 00:44:04.880
I want to make
sure we understand

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.920
why this is such an important
problem for quantum mechanics.

00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.550
OK?

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:16.740
So sun shines on a molecule,
the molecule changes shape,

00:44:16.740 --> 00:44:21.190
and that changed shape
is a higher energy.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:25.080
So if you draw the
reaction, if you

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:31.960
draw the reaction
coordinate for this system,

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.370
It looks like this.

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:33.870
OK?

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.060
So that would be the trans
state and the cis state,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.350
and this is the higher
energy that that forms,

00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:43.020
and it stores that much
energy in the molecule.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.960
OK?

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.300
Now, what we found
is that there's

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.100
all these molecules
that do this,

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.760
but they're not very
good solar fuels.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:52.260
OK?

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:54.930
So there's lots of
them that do this trans

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:57.990
to cis photoisomerization.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.680
So the sun makes it go, or light
makes it go, from one state

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:02.550
to another.

00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:05.020
None of them are good
solar fuels on their own,

00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:11.713
but we found this way of making
them in general into good ones.

00:45:11.713 --> 00:45:13.380
And this is a slide
I skipped last week,

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:17.670
so I want to just very
quickly explain this again.

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:21.600
Because it's really
important to understand why

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.080
we're so excited about this.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.740
If you put these molecules
that switch back and forth

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:30.150
onto a template, and the
template can be anything,

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:31.470
but here it's a nanotube.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:34.080
But if you put them onto it,
and you covalently bind them--

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.210
that means you attach
them really strongly,

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:37.770
so they're not
going to come off.

00:45:37.770 --> 00:45:40.950
Then, what you've done is
you've packed them in a way

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.200
that they're not
able to get out of.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.800
So you've packed them
together, and they're not

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:49.830
allowed to get out, because
they're covalently bound.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.970
Some self-assembly
work is weakly bound.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.200
Some is not.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.920
Here, it's really
strongly bound.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.310
So they're really forced
into this packing.

00:45:59.310 --> 00:46:00.610
Now, what does that mean?

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:02.140
Well, look up here for a minute.

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.580
It's a little busy,
but look at that cyan

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.540
curve, the light blue.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.750
This is the spacing that they're
packing on on this template.

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:14.610
This is it, 4.2 angstroms.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:15.620
OK?

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:20.120
And that's also exactly the
minimum of that molecule,

00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:22.790
when it's in the T state, here.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:26.950
When it's in the T state,
it's happy at that spacing.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:29.020
It's happiest.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:29.560
Right?

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.330
But when it's in
the cis state, you

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.510
see the cis state has
a different spacing

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:35.470
that it wants to be at.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.700
That's the red curve.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.350
Right?

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.725
These are the
kinds of curves you

00:46:38.725 --> 00:46:43.060
should be getting in your
homework for problem two.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:44.810
That's the curve
for the cis state,

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:47.650
and you can see that it's a
happy place is much further

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:49.990
out, but it can't
be much further out.

00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:52.850
It does not have that
flexibility anymore.

00:46:52.850 --> 00:46:55.240
So you've constrained
it to always

00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:00.570
be in the trans, happy place,
in terms of its spacing.

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.690
Now, what that means is that,
you can see right away, what

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:06.920
that means is that, when
it's in the cis state,

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.120
the energy of the cis state
is going to be higher.

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:12.740
So already, what you've done is
you've made this state go up,

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.750
because you've sterically
inhibited it just

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:20.070
by forcing it to be this
close and never further apart.

00:47:20.070 --> 00:47:25.720
In the gas phase or in solution,
when it goes back and forth

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.740
between trans and cis.

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:28.660
It's always going to
find its happy place.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.230
They're not going to worry
about this, but here they can't.

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:36.640
But as I mentioned last week,
much more importantly even,

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:41.200
when you're in this highly
confined geometry, this highly

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.350
constrained rigid packing,
what you can do now

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.480
is you can play
chemistry between them.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:50.530
So I can actually
create functional groups

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.190
on these molecules that
bond them to each other

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:57.190
and to themselves
in different ways,

00:47:57.190 --> 00:48:00.160
depending on whether they're
in the cis or the trans state.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:00.910
OK?

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:03.430
And what that does
is that allows me

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:09.170
to lower this and lower this.

00:48:09.170 --> 00:48:10.290
That's the key.

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:11.210
OK?

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:13.880
So now, because the
key is, remember,

00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:26.300
goal is to increase
this and this barrier.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:32.067
Going back, we want to be
able to tune it separately.

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.250
And you can see that, if you
just look at this reaction

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:42.390
coordinate, if I
increase delta H,

00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:44.900
it looks like I'm going
to probably decrease

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.450
the activation barrier
which is not a good thing.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.600
Because that's related to the
stability of the fuel, when

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:52.830
it's charged, the lifetime.

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:54.620
These molecules
on their own last

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.930
in the charged state
for a few minutes.

00:48:56.930 --> 00:48:57.992
That's not very useful.

00:48:57.992 --> 00:49:00.200
So what we'd like to do is
to be able to change both,

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.360
and this trick
allows us to do that.

00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.970
We push this up from
steric inhibition,

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:07.260
but we pull it back
down from reactions.

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:11.470
We pull this, from interactions,
we pull this down even more,

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.570
because we can customize
the interactions that

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:16.640
happen between these molecules
and within the molecule.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.770
So that's the key.

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:21.150
That's the magic sauce.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:21.650
Right?

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.800
Now, all that is fine,
except that, as I--

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.300
OK.

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.070
So we have this new
class of materials

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:31.150
we're very excited about.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:32.650
We're making them in the lab.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.690
We're designing
them on a computer.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.870
They're going to save the
world, or maybe they'll

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:42.670
just de-ice windows, but
anyway, that's very exciting.

00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:52.250
Now, all of that can be done
using classical force fields.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.620
You can calculate
delta H. You could

00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:59.983
try to get a good model of
potentials for these molecules.

00:49:59.983 --> 00:50:01.650
You could maybe try
different potentials

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:04.170
and see when it agrees with
experiment and all that

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:08.100
and try to explore this phase
space using classical force

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:09.060
fields.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:10.050
That is accessible.

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:15.030
You may not-- gesundheit--
you may not be accurate.

00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:16.860
You may have some
worries about validating

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.000
the potentials and
all that, but you

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.860
can do this with
classical force fields.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.920
You can get energies as a
function of these twists

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:26.070
in the bonds and try to
engineer it this way,

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.370
but you cannot talk about
the optical properties.

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:32.530
You cannot do that using
classical potentials.

00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:36.300
You need the electrons, and this
goes back to our energy levels.

00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:36.940
OK?

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:43.640
So now, it will come
in to play here.

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:47.290
We're going to go
back to energy levels.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:49.570
You see, I can make
a really dense energy

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:53.790
fuel, a really highly
energy dense fuel,

00:50:53.790 --> 00:50:56.640
but if it doesn't absorb
the sunlight efficiently,

00:50:56.640 --> 00:50:59.010
then I can never charge it.

00:50:59.010 --> 00:51:00.420
Right?

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.220
So that's a critical
part of this.

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:06.330
If it doesn't absorb sunlight
well, it's useless to me.

00:51:06.330 --> 00:51:07.380
OK?

00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:11.460
Now, so this is the thing
that we've been talking about,

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.140
but that part can be looked at
with potentials, if you wanted.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.750
This part here, where you
absorb the light, cannot.

00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:21.090
So here's the light that
comes down to Earth.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.600
Right?

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.475
We talked about this.

00:51:22.475 --> 00:51:25.290
That's the solar flux.

00:51:25.290 --> 00:51:30.685
And the key point here is that--

00:51:30.685 --> 00:51:32.620
I keep that?

00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:34.285
We don't need that anymore.

00:51:34.285 --> 00:51:39.520
The key point here is that those
molecules have energy levels,

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.510
like this and like this,
and they have a gap.

00:51:46.930 --> 00:51:47.530
Right?

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:55.390
These are what we call occupied,
and these are unoccupied.

00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:58.180
Unoccupied levels,
occupied levels,

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:01.090
I just don't want
to draw the arrows,

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.070
and that's the energy gap.

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:06.310
Now, why does the energy
gap matter with respect

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:07.090
to this picture?

00:52:12.590 --> 00:52:14.510
Yeah?

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:15.540
At the same time--

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:17.930
one, two, no.

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:19.070
Go ahead.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:20.570
AUDIENCE: Because
all the absorption

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:23.435
are at certain frequencies--
or certain light

00:52:23.435 --> 00:52:26.765
coming in at frequencies
with great enough energy that

00:52:26.765 --> 00:52:28.408
surpass the energy gap.

00:52:28.408 --> 00:52:29.450
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Why?

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:30.242
That's really good.

00:52:30.242 --> 00:52:31.547
That's exactly right.

00:52:31.547 --> 00:52:32.630
AUDIENCE: So it's too low.

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:34.463
It's not enough
energy to shut it off

00:52:34.463 --> 00:52:35.630
from occupied to unoccupied.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:36.520
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:37.460
AUDIENCE: I mean,
too low of energy.

00:52:37.460 --> 00:52:39.502
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Too
low of an energy, right?

00:52:39.502 --> 00:52:41.120
So this is energy going--

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:43.350
this is wavelength
going that way.

00:52:43.350 --> 00:52:45.060
So energy goes this way.

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.600
OK?

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.020
Right?

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:58.980
So there is going to be some
minimum energy below which

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.540
you can no longer absorb light.

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.000
The molecule is transparent.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.310
That is the energy gap.

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:07.770
That's this energy gap here.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:10.200
Any energy that that
molecule receives

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.550
that's from those photons--

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:14.130
and this is the energy.

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:17.010
Wavelength, as we know
same, as the energy.

00:53:17.010 --> 00:53:21.180
Any photons it receives
from the sun that's less

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.220
than this just go right past.

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.300
They cannot get absorbed.

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.200
If I don't absorb a
photon, I don't do this.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.710
I don't switch.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:31.210
OK?

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:33.820
So this is important.

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:37.060
Now, the question
is what do I want?

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:41.740
Well, do I want the material to
have a very high gap or a very

00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.350
low gap?

00:53:43.350 --> 00:53:46.160
Out here would be a
very low energy gap,

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.500
and over here, it would
be a very high energy gap.

00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:51.480
What do you guys
think I want here?

00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.930
How would I get-- and I'm
going to collect energy only

00:53:54.930 --> 00:53:56.040
above the gap.

00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.470
So if my energy
gap is here, it's

00:53:58.470 --> 00:54:01.110
only going to be this part
of the sun I can collect.

00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:04.960
So where do you think
I want my gap to be?

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.060
Over here?

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.650
That's definitely
what you would think.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.880
Why not just make this
material have almost no gap?

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:13.420
Right?

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:21.230
If it had almost no gap, then
if this were the gap, then

00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:27.790
any little bit of sunlight
would excite electrons up,

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:30.010
and you'd absorbed the photon.

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:33.073
Why is that not a
good solar fuel?

00:54:33.073 --> 00:54:34.198
AUDIENCE: They fall easily.

00:54:34.198 --> 00:54:35.698
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Say that again.

00:54:35.698 --> 00:54:37.240
AUDIENCE: They fall
back down easily.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.865
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well, they
certainly could fall back down,

00:54:39.865 --> 00:54:42.110
and actually usually, they'd
be absorbed say up here,

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.780
and they'd usually trickle
down to here anyway

00:54:44.780 --> 00:54:46.370
to the LUMO state.

00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:49.190
That's called thermalization.

00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:51.860
They could also fall back
down to the homo state

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:52.940
and re-emit a photon.

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:56.120
That's absolutely right,
but there's another reason.

00:54:58.958 --> 00:55:00.380
AUDIENCE: Lower energy density.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:00.620
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:01.120
Why?

00:55:04.890 --> 00:55:07.770
AUDIENCE: There's a band
gap in the partial delta H.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:09.040
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:09.540
That's it.

00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:14.600
So what are we doing
in storage materials?

00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.640
What are we doing with
electrons in batteries,

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.460
in solar thermal fuels?

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.405
What are we doing
with those electrons?

00:55:22.405 --> 00:55:24.452
AUDIENCE: Storing them.

00:55:24.452 --> 00:55:26.160
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
We are storing them.

00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:32.245
Yes, but what are we
doing to make them--

00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:33.870
what are we doing
when we convert them?

00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:35.682
Maybe I should say it that way.

00:55:35.682 --> 00:55:37.140
Same thing happens
in a solar cell.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:38.640
I'm doing something
to these electrons.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.990
AUDIENCE: Putting
them on a shelf.

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:41.073
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:55:41.073 --> 00:55:42.720
You know I love that analogy.

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.010
Yeah?

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:45.660
It's like pumping hydro.

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:48.030
Hydro pumping is one of
the best technologies

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.460
we know of to store energy.

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:53.910
It's even creating a little
stir here in the third row,

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:56.593
because he has read
the reports, and he

00:55:56.593 --> 00:55:58.260
knows that there are
certain areas where

00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.300
that's the only
game in town, pumped

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.840
hydro, a beautiful technology.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:04.830
It works.

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.540
You pump water up a hill.

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:08.400
When you got too much
energy, and you let

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.050
it roll back down
when you need it.

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:10.680
Right?

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.870
Now, that's all we're
doing with electrons.

00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:13.410
That's it.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:14.910
It's the same exact thing.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:17.360
We're pumping
electrons up a hill.

00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.340
We're using light to do it here.

00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.530
For a battery, when you
plug your electric car

00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:26.180
in, you're using current
and electrons, potential,

00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:30.515
voltage to do it, but you're
driving electrons up the hill.

00:56:30.515 --> 00:56:32.390
And then you're trying
to keep them up there,

00:56:32.390 --> 00:56:34.748
and then let them come
back when you need them,

00:56:34.748 --> 00:56:36.290
when you need them
to release energy.

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:38.260
OK?

00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:40.600
Now, if my gap is
really low, you

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:44.410
see, the hill, it's never
going to get to the top.

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.060
Here's my hill.

00:56:47.060 --> 00:56:49.220
OK?

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.340
If my gap is only
this much in energy,

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:54.410
then I'm just going
to roll around here,

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:57.750
and I'm never going to
get any amount of storage.

00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:58.250
Right?

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:02.870
So you want this to be
as large as possible,

00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:06.370
because that's how
much energy you store.

00:57:06.370 --> 00:57:09.580
But the gap can't be
any smaller than this,

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.310
or you're not going to give
those electrons enough energy

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:15.250
to get up the hill to go there,
so the material can go there.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:16.350
Yeah?

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.790
AUDIENCE: So let's see
you have some material

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:22.870
with some small
gap, and you just

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:27.490
have it exposed to sunlight
and then compare it

00:57:27.490 --> 00:57:29.950
with some material
with a large gap.

00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:33.400
Wouldn't they both on average
collect the same number

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:35.300
of high-energy photons anyway?

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:36.485
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yes.

00:57:36.485 --> 00:57:38.110
AUDIENCE: So with
the low-gap material,

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:41.260
you'd get some with height
that collect higher--

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:42.760
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Great question.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.490
AUDIENCE: High energy
photons, and then they

00:57:45.490 --> 00:57:47.920
have some excited state.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:49.593
And then the ones
with the high gap

00:57:49.593 --> 00:57:51.010
will also have
that excited state,

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:52.330
but the ones with
the low gap will also

00:57:52.330 --> 00:57:53.530
have these lower,
excited states.

00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:54.280
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yes.

00:57:54.280 --> 00:57:54.580
Yes.

00:57:54.580 --> 00:57:55.240
AUDIENCE: On top of that?

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.220
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
It's a great question,

00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:59.020
and what you're talking
about is such a cool idea

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:01.690
in solar PV called hot carrier.

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:04.120
What you'd like to do is get
those excited, really high

00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:07.860
energy electrons
out in solar cells,

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:10.740
before they come back down.

00:58:10.740 --> 00:58:15.360
In this case, they
come back down.

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.420
See in this case,
they thermalize,

00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:21.000
and the reaction happens in
the lowest excited state.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:25.700
But it also happens
in solar cells,

00:58:25.700 --> 00:58:27.825
because there are no hot
carrier solar cells today.

00:58:27.825 --> 00:58:28.850
It's a great theory.

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:30.390
It's a great idea.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:33.408
So this is the idea, and
there's a lot of active research

00:58:33.408 --> 00:58:33.950
in this area.

00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.420
And it's basically the
idea of multijunction cells

00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.170
which are cells that work, and
in fact, the highest efficiency

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:44.570
solar cells to date
are multijunction,

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:46.200
triple-junction solar cells.

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:49.550
Where basically, you have
different band gaps together,

00:58:49.550 --> 00:58:51.950
and those different band
gaps do exactly what you say.

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:52.460
OK?

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.670
They let you take some
electrons out here,

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:58.460
and then you have another
material with a higher gap,

00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.110
and you can take them out here.

00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:01.880
And then you have
another material

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.910
with an even higher gap, and
you can take those electrons out

00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:05.870
there.

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:06.560
OK?

00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:08.990
And see because
otherwise, what happens?

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.110
Otherwise, all the electrons
will-- in each case--

00:59:12.110 --> 00:59:14.630
all the electrons
cascade down to here.

00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:17.630
They all wind up in that
conduction band or that LUMO

00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:19.130
state, if it's a molecule.

00:59:19.130 --> 00:59:23.240
No matter what, that's just
the dramatic and traumatic loss

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.280
of solar materials.

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:27.120
Right?

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:31.320
Solar conversion, solar capture,
those electrons thermalize,

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.720
because that process
of thermalization

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:37.650
is so fast, that it's
very hard to beat.

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:40.110
The way you beat it in
multijunction solar cells--

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:44.250
42% maybe is the record,
something like that.

00:59:44.250 --> 00:59:48.150
The way you beat it
is you literally just

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:50.040
stick a level in there.

00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:52.200
So it's sort of a
cheat, but that's

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.200
the only way to do it that we
know technologically today.

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.870
If there were other ways
of extracting electrons out

00:59:57.870 --> 01:00:00.540
at their higher energies,
you could do wonders

01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:02.910
in solar capture and storage.

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:07.800
In the molecule, the
electron thermalizes down,

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.690
and the reaction goes in
that lowest excited state.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:14.460
So that gap has to be
bigger than delta H. OK?

01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:17.347
Does everybody see that?

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.430
It's a very good question.

01:00:21.830 --> 01:00:23.770
So it's this
beautiful, constrained

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:25.000
optimization problem.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.940
I love those, because
constrained optimization

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:30.040
problems, I want this
to be really big,

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:33.280
but I want this to stay not
less than an electron volt.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.170
But then if this
is really big, I

01:00:35.170 --> 01:00:37.070
can't absorb any of the light.

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:37.570
Right?

01:00:37.570 --> 01:00:42.260
If I made delta H
huge, then I'd have

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.660
to have a gap that
was like here,

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.430
and I'd get almost
no solar efficiency.

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:49.850
These are beautiful problems
for materials design

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:53.480
and for computation,
because they're constrained,

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.980
but they're not
that constrained.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:58.070
And using computers,
you can get your way out

01:00:58.070 --> 01:00:59.870
of that, those
constraints, sometimes.

01:00:59.870 --> 01:01:01.220
OK?

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.170
And that's what's, I
think, really exciting.

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:05.930
That's what your homework
is going to be about, and so

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.190
let's calculate one of these.

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.690
OK?

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:15.180
Because that is the key
to the optical efficiency.

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:16.140
Yeah?

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.506
AUDIENCE: So is the gas thinner
than the just delta H or delta

01:01:20.506 --> 01:01:23.362
H plus the base?

01:01:23.362 --> 01:01:25.733
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: That's
a very good question, and--

01:01:25.733 --> 01:01:26.900
AUDIENCE: He told me to ask.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.290
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:27.790
Yeah.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:29.810
It's a very good question.

01:01:29.810 --> 01:01:33.230
So in general,
most of these kinds

01:01:33.230 --> 01:01:34.760
of photoactive molecules--

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:39.410
I've already talked to a
chemist, so I'm well armed.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:43.260
Most of these
photoactive molecules

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.180
need the gap plus the
activation barrier,

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:50.040
because in the excited state,
you'll get a similar barrier.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.110
It's not clear that's
always true though,

01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:56.240
and so that puts more
constraints on this.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.700
So it's even less of the
spectrum you can absorb,

01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.210
basically.

01:01:59.210 --> 01:01:59.960
Right?

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:01.910
If you want to store
1 1/2 electron volts,

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.280
and you need an electron volt
of an activation barrier,

01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:07.220
that's a 2 1/2 v-gap minimum.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.550
Which means you're closing
in on the UV, which

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:14.540
means your optical efficiency
is probably at most 5%, 8%, 10%,

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:15.650
at most.

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:16.220
Right?

01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.170
That doesn't mean it's
a deal breaker at all.

01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:21.622
But there are also
cases where you

01:02:21.622 --> 01:02:23.455
do change the barrier
in the exciting state,

01:02:23.455 --> 01:02:26.580
and so we're looking into that.

01:02:26.580 --> 01:02:30.380
Now, I want another concept
here to come across which

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.580
is really important.

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.300
OK?

01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:38.000
And that is nothing more than
these levels smoothed out,

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.320
and it's called the
density of states.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.100
OK?

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:49.140
So if you do a calculation
of one of these molecules--

01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.690
let me go back to here.

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.600
Oh, yeah.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.990
You know we love this.

01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:59.670
Have you all rated this
say a 10 out of 10?

01:02:59.670 --> 01:03:02.450
Come on.

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:06.320
You know it's a 10 experience.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.350
AUDIENCE: Someone gave it a 9.5?

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:09.350
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: No.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.300
That's an average.

01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:11.830
OK.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:13.623
I want to start using--

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:16.040
we're going to use a different
tool for our next homework.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:18.310
We're going to use DFT
for solids, surfaces,

01:03:18.310 --> 01:03:19.210
and molecules.

01:03:19.210 --> 01:03:20.110
It's called SIESTA.

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:24.520
It's another free software
that you can download.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.740
And it's solving
the same equations,

01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:29.950
but it uses different
approximations, different basis

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:31.050
sets, and so forth.

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:31.780
OK?

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.888
But here, and you
see that basis sets

01:03:33.888 --> 01:03:35.680
are called different
things, but I've still

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:39.670
tried to help by saying really
bad, mediocre, and OK, in terms

01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:40.840
of the quality.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.520
OK?

01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:46.030
Again, that's not the
focus in this class.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.710
Let's look at it, and we're
going to do a molecule here--

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:50.410
Uh-oh, there we go--

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.030
a molecule.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:56.080
And I'm going to upload one,
and you're going to get these.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:03:58.037
We'll give these
with the homeworks.

01:03:58.037 --> 01:03:59.120
We'll put them on Steller.

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.600
So here's a trans state.

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.810
Let's do the phenyl.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:04.890
Here's a trans state.

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:08.010
We're going to upload
it and simulate.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:08.620
OK?

01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:11.310
And this is doing just
what the other code does.

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:14.490
It's doing this self-consistent
cycle, where it's

01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:16.300
solving for the wave function.

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.922
OK?

01:04:17.922 --> 01:04:19.380
And it's getting
the wave functions

01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:24.280
of all these levels for the
molecule I just entered.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.490
So it's going to give
me all these levels.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:28.170
That's what I want.

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:31.950
Now, the way this plots
it though is in something

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:33.570
called the density
of states, and all

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:36.870
that is, as we'll see in a
minute, is you take these,

01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.240
and you turn it on the side.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:39.960
OK?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.750
So let's take a look.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.040
Is it done?

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.990
Yes.

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.670
There it is.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.510
Oh, this is a
beautiful solar fuel.

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:52.140
It's actually got two
photo-switchable molecules

01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:53.820
hanging off the same
azobenzene ring.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:00.690
But anyway, and this--

01:05:00.690 --> 01:05:02.760
where is the-- there we go.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.330
OK.

01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:07.380
So the key outputs, so
it tells you some things,

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:09.690
and then you can go
to Density of States,

01:05:09.690 --> 01:05:16.070
and this is a very
important property.

01:05:16.070 --> 01:05:16.850
OK?

01:05:16.850 --> 01:05:21.930
This is the way that we like
to look at energy levels,

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:23.962
especially in solids.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.670
So we're going to be
looking at DOS plots

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:27.030
when we get to solids.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:27.770
OK?

01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:30.050
But in molecules, you
can look at the DOS plot

01:05:30.050 --> 01:05:32.660
as well, and
basically, what it is

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.000
it's just these levels
turned on their side.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.780
So if there's a bunch of
levels near each other,

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:43.490
you'll get a higher
peak in the DOS.

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:46.910
You want to think about
it as averaging over

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:51.910
the likelihood of finding
states at these energies.

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.860
Has anybody seen a DOS plot?

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:56.890
How many of you have seen a
DOS plot, a density of states?

01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:58.130
One or two?

01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.780
That's OK.

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:01.730
They're energy levels
turned on their side.

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:02.380
Right?

01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:06.388
Now, when we do solids,
it gets really fun.

01:06:06.388 --> 01:06:07.930
It gets really fun
when we do solids,

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:09.555
because when we do
solids, like I said,

01:06:09.555 --> 01:06:13.415
these things go like this in
a space yet to be determined.

01:06:13.415 --> 01:06:15.040
And then you turn
those on their sides,

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.740
and you still get the
same kind of DOS plot.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:21.455
But for molecules, this is
what it would look like.

01:06:21.455 --> 01:06:23.080
So there's a little
smoothing going on,

01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.480
but you're also
representing how many states

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.720
you have near these energies.

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.720
So that's why it's called
the density of states.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.420
Right?

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:33.280
Gesundheit.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:35.980
Does everybody see that
this is that energy gap?

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:37.090
This is it.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.860
That's the energy
gap, but there's

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.280
more in the density of states.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:40.780
OK?

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.850
So the energy gap, now I can--

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:45.820
watch this-- I can go
back, and I can magically

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:53.650
put on some functional groups
and go to the amino benzene

01:06:53.650 --> 01:07:00.300
case, and I can do
that simulation.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.060
How many people really want
to hear about hydrogen storage

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.740
or don't care?

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.880
Be honest.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.920
Really want to hear
about hydrogen storage?

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.730
In the back.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:19.420
Because I really want to make
this point, because also,

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:21.400
this will be the basis
of your homework.

01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:25.340
But I can also take the
first 10 minutes of Thursday

01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.257
and talk about hydrogen storage.

01:07:27.257 --> 01:07:29.840
Hydrogen storage, nobody cares
about hydrogen storage anymore,

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.950
do they?

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:35.660
In the back, we have
one hydrogen storage.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:40.170
The hydrogen economy,
it was a big myth.

01:07:40.170 --> 01:07:44.730
Well, it's not a myth,
but it's a long way off.

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:46.965
That we'd all be--

01:07:46.965 --> 01:07:48.840
I'm not sure I would
use that-- that we'd all

01:07:48.840 --> 01:07:51.570
be driving hydrogen-powered
cars in this decade

01:07:51.570 --> 01:07:55.120
was a little bit of an
exaggeration, to say the least.

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:55.920
So here's this guy.

01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.630
Now, what I did
is I decorated it.

01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:03.730
I did some, like I
thought-- oh, by the way,

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:06.780
your computation is only
as good as what's up here.

01:08:06.780 --> 01:08:07.440
Right?

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:09.810
So you need to think about
what you want to simulate,

01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:13.390
and here, we thought,
well, we had this one.

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:13.890
OK?

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:17.310
We had this one, and it's
not quite the same angle,

01:08:17.310 --> 01:08:18.250
but it's close.

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:18.750
OK?

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:20.100
So these guys are
going to switch,

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.183
when the sun shines on
them, and store some energy

01:08:22.183 --> 01:08:22.950
and switch back.

01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:25.529
But I decided that I wanted
to try to do something

01:08:25.529 --> 01:08:30.260
about the strain in this state.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:35.399
Again, you're trying
to lower, remember--

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:37.680
you're trying to
lower these states,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.210
or change them, figure
out how to tune them.

01:08:40.210 --> 01:08:40.710
Right?

01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:44.000
So what I did is we
put a group in there.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.750
You can see, you put
a group in here which

01:08:45.750 --> 01:08:49.140
is going to cause some bonding,
when it's in the trans state.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.640
And you put another
group here which

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:53.310
causes some bonding
between those OH

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:56.490
groups and the nitrogen,
and that adds to the energy.

01:08:56.490 --> 01:08:57.420
It lowers the energy.

01:08:57.420 --> 01:08:58.200
Right?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:01.300
Now, as I said, we do that
with quantum mechanics,

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.300
because it's actually not
that big of a problem,

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.550
but that doesn't
tell me whether--

01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:07.800
I may have made this a great
solar thermal fuel that

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.300
can never absorb light.

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:12.960
And so you got to go, and you've
got to look at these things,

01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.330
like the density of states.

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:14.910
OK?

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:21.770
And so here they are together,
and you can see that in--

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:22.420
so that's one.

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:22.920
OK.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:26.510
So one is now bold, and you can
see that my modifications have

01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:28.850
done some interesting things.

01:09:28.850 --> 01:09:30.770
My chemical
modifications have really

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:34.899
changed where those
energy levels are.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:38.135
Now, remember, they're
getting filled from here.

01:09:38.135 --> 01:09:39.010
Remember the filling.

01:09:39.010 --> 01:09:39.510
Right?

01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:43.390
You draw from the bottom, the
most energy favorable ones,

01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:45.279
all the way up, and
then you fill them up,

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.180
and you stop filling here.

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:47.680
Right?

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.970
You stop filling here,
and that's your gap,

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:54.000
and you can see that the gap
has changed considerably.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.500
So the gap has
changed considerably,

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.830
and that changes
what kind of sunlight

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:00.980
that molecule can absorb.

01:10:00.980 --> 01:10:04.820
Now, what's nice about
having the density of states

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.010
is that, you see,
I'm getting-- in all

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:12.340
of the energy levels-- is I'm
getting more than just the gap.

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:12.840
Right?

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:14.340
I'm getting other things.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.870
I'm getting shapes and peaks,
and here's a double peak.

01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:18.030
There's a single peak.

01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:20.850
Here's a little narrow peak,
but there's a really broad thing

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.670
with like three
peaks and a shoulder.

01:10:23.670 --> 01:10:25.460
Right?

01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.440
That matters too.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.320
That matters a whole lot.

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.380
OK?

01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:36.900
And the reason is that to a
very, very crude approximation,

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:40.920
you can consider these peaks in
where the states are in energy

01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.350
as the places where
this molecule will

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:46.580
be able to absorb light.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.090
OK?

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:53.060
And so you can match this
up with the solar spectrum.

01:10:53.060 --> 01:10:53.560
Right?

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.110
Because what you want
is for the molecules

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:59.230
to be able to absorb light,
where there's a lot of light.

01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:01.875
And you don't really care
about them absorbing light.

01:11:01.875 --> 01:11:04.000
You don't necessarily need
them to have huge peaks,

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.330
where there's no sunlight.

01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.830
Right?

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.740
So now, you have an
interesting comparison

01:11:08.740 --> 01:11:12.100
of where these molecules
tend to absorb light

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.910
and where the light is.

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:14.650
OK?

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:18.650
So let's go back
to this and make

01:11:18.650 --> 01:11:23.020
sure we know where I'm going.

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:23.590
OK?

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:29.620
So see, we talked about--

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:31.600
just another five
minutes or so I think

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:36.180
to finish this discussion.

01:11:36.180 --> 01:11:38.730
We talked about how,
well, you don't want--

01:11:41.340 --> 01:11:44.940
there are constraints on just
thinking about how big of a gap

01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:45.480
you want.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:47.700
Because it's a
constrained optimization

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.010
problem with this thing and
this thing and this stuff.

01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:50.820
Right?

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.140
We just talked about that.

01:11:52.140 --> 01:11:56.330
Now, I'm going to tell you
there's another problem,

01:11:56.330 --> 01:12:02.110
and that is that this
state is also photoactive.

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:08.750
So this state can absorb
light which makes it go back.

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:09.920
Well, that's a bummer.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:10.940
Right?

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:13.040
That is a bummer.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:15.470
Now, what that
means is that, when

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.140
I shine light on
this material, I

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:21.240
will never get it
all to convert.

01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:23.430
I will never charge
all of the material

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:26.350
and make it all go
from here to here,

01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:30.130
because there's constantly
a competition at play.

01:12:30.130 --> 01:12:32.410
Some of it will be going
this way, and some of it

01:12:32.410 --> 01:12:33.730
will be going that way.

01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:37.450
And what holds the key to
determining how much of which

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:41.570
one is made?

01:12:41.570 --> 01:12:44.428
What holds the key?

01:12:44.428 --> 01:12:47.423
AUDIENCE: The ratio
of delta H plus EA.

01:12:47.423 --> 01:12:49.590
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Well,
actually, but the delta H

01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:52.320
and EA are out of
the picture for now,

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:56.430
because I'm only talking about
the absorption efficiency.

01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:02.010
What type of photons it
could absorb and what else?

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.430
What type of photons
it can absorb and?

01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.843
Yeah?

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:10.760
AUDIENCE: How many of
those types of photons--

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:11.300
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN: Exactly.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:12.383
AUDIENCE: Your solar cell.

01:13:12.383 --> 01:13:15.670
JEFFREY C. GROSSMAN:
Exactly, and this.

01:13:15.670 --> 01:13:16.750
Right?

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:20.650
So you're given this much
photons on planet Earth.

01:13:20.650 --> 01:13:23.780
You're give given the yellow,
if you go up a little bit.

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:24.320
Right?

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:26.610
We're not going to charge
our fuels in space.

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.330
So this is what you
got, the red, and that's

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:33.260
where the photons are in
energy, in wavelength energy,

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:34.530
same thing.

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:41.450
Now, I'm giving you the
fact that some molecules--

01:13:41.450 --> 01:13:42.410
let's go back here.

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:48.380
I can't just delete one, can I?

01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:53.870
I'm going to do one more
simulation while I talk.

01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:58.400
I wish it wouldn't show
my picture everywhere.

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.410
I'm going to do the cis state.

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.910
OK?

01:14:05.300 --> 01:14:13.500
You see, some molecules
in their cis state,

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:16.650
they're still photoactive,
which means they go back here,

01:14:16.650 --> 01:14:18.430
when you shine light on them.

01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:23.490
What that means is that there's
going to be a stationary state.

01:14:23.490 --> 01:14:26.070
When I hold the
fuel out in the sun,

01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:30.420
the light is converting this
into this, as well as this

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:33.660
into this with some
efficiency in both directions.

01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.400
And there will be
a stationary state

01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:38.370
that gives me a
percentage, or a yield,

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:39.960
or as it's called
in the literature

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.410
a quantum yield, of
charged material.

01:14:44.410 --> 01:14:45.130
How much is it?

01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:48.280
Well, in isolated azobenzene,
when you don't do anything

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:49.900
to it, it's 25%.

01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:54.020
I can only charge
25% of this stuff

01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:59.210
in the photo-stationary state,
when I hold it out in the sun.

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:02.360
And you can see why this
is such an important part

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:04.790
of the problem, I
will remind you,

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:07.850
a purely quantum mechanical
part of the problem.

01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:11.630
Because if I increase this, I
work so hard to increase this

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:14.727
by a factor of three
or four, and then I

01:15:14.727 --> 01:15:16.310
can only charge a
fourth of it, that's

01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:17.760
a whole factor of four hit.

01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.760
If you can only charge a
fourth of it at a time,

01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.930
it's four times less useful.

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:25.170
So it's effectively changing
this by four times back.

01:15:25.170 --> 01:15:25.670
Right?

01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:27.630
So this is critical.

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:29.390
How much of this can you charge?

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:30.020
Right?

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.770
And that comes from
the quantum mechanics.

01:15:31.770 --> 01:15:36.560
Now, the way that you
get it is by looking at--

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.937
and I'll go through
the equations

01:15:37.937 --> 01:15:39.020
on the next line a minute.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.660
So here it is now in
the charged state.

01:15:44.660 --> 01:15:45.290
OK?

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:46.220
So it's flipped.

01:15:46.220 --> 01:15:47.180
It's done its flip.

01:15:47.180 --> 01:15:50.000
You can see, it's rotated
those nitrogen bonds.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:54.230
It's a beautiful thing, kind of
an emotional moment in a way.

01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:58.010
And you go back to here,
and you look at your DOS,

01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:59.520
and now this is
kind of hard to see.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.020
Isn't it?

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.170
One of these is the cis
state that I just mentioned,

01:16:06.170 --> 01:16:07.662
and it's different.

01:16:07.662 --> 01:16:09.245
I can't see, because
there's two trans

01:16:09.245 --> 01:16:12.680
states here and one cis state.

01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:15.710
I don't think there's any
way to just do simulations

01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:19.020
two and three, but I think you
know what I'm talking about.

01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:22.280
There's a density of
states for the trans.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:27.337
These levels here
turn on their side,

01:16:27.337 --> 01:16:29.420
and there's a density of
states for the cis state.

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.060
And matching that
with the solar flux

01:16:32.060 --> 01:16:34.610
is what will give you the
photo-stationary state.

01:16:34.610 --> 01:16:37.620
It will give you the quantum
yield of the material.

01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:38.120
OK?

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.700
That will be your
second homework.

01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:50.670
So this, let's see, this is
two ways that you could do it.

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:52.600
OK?

01:16:52.600 --> 01:17:00.290
One way is you could just assume
that all of the photons higher

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:05.400
in energy than the gap are
absorbed and lead to a switch.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.030
And if you do that, then the
fraction of the molecules

01:17:08.030 --> 01:17:11.190
in the cis state, if
you let them be x,

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:12.980
you can show that
it's just going

01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:15.740
to be a simple integral
over the solar spectrum,

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.728
that this I function,
up to the gap times x.

01:17:20.728 --> 01:17:22.270
That's how many are
in the cis state.

01:17:22.270 --> 01:17:23.940
Gesundheit.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:28.260
[NON-ENGLISH] Equals the number
that are in the trans state,

01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:32.850
1 minus x, times the integral
over the number of photons that

01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:36.770
convert the trans.

01:17:36.770 --> 01:17:37.390
OK?

01:17:37.390 --> 01:17:39.640
That's just
stationary-- that's just

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.190
telling you that the change
in the concentration of cis

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:42.850
is the same.

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:47.060
It's like a reaction
kinetics equation,

01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.040
the rate of going from
one state to another times

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:53.950
the number in that state equals
the same as the other way.

01:17:53.950 --> 01:17:55.180
That's all we've done here.

01:17:55.180 --> 01:17:58.570
But it gets more interesting if
you use the density of states,

01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:02.550
because now, you
have the absorption--

01:18:02.550 --> 01:18:03.960
what I'm calling the absorption.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.970
Again, it's a
crude approximation

01:18:05.970 --> 01:18:08.620
for the absorption, but
let's just call it that--

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:15.160
of the cis state as a
function of the wavelength,

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:20.280
convoluted with, or
times, the solar spectrum.

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:23.550
Where you have states in
both is where it matters.

01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:24.510
Right?

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:28.200
Where you have states in both
is where you hit the integral,

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:30.030
and it's when those
are taken together

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:33.150
that you can calculate
more accurately than just

01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:34.440
using the gap.

01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:38.700
You can calculate the
photo-stationary yield,

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.070
and you get this all
from those energy levels,

01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:44.010
those beautiful energy
levels that we started

01:18:44.010 --> 01:18:45.840
this lecture talking about.

01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:46.350
OK?

01:18:46.350 --> 01:18:52.050
That yield is so important,
because it can kill your--

01:18:52.050 --> 01:18:53.880
great idea for improving
delta H can get

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.450
killed if the yield isn't good.

01:18:55.450 --> 01:18:55.950
OK?

01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:01.710
Maybe I'll spend 10 minutes
on hydrogen storage.

01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:05.190
Nobody raised their hands,
but we'll do another poll.

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:07.590
And we're going to start
moving now-- you'll

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:09.660
have a homework on this.

01:19:09.660 --> 01:19:12.240
It'll be lots of fun, and
then on Thursday, we're

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:14.360
going to move into solids.

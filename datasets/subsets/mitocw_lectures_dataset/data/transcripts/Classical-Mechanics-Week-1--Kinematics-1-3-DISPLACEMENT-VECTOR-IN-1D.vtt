00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.510
Now that we've described the
position vector of the runner,

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.540
let's try to describe
what happens in time

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.510
as a runner moves
along our road.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.480
Suppose at a later time our
runner has gone down the road

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.000
just a little bit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.060
And so the runner has
moved a little bit.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.330
Remember, at time t, we
described the position vector

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.060
r(t) was equal to the
coordinate function

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.070
x as a function of time i hat.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.060
And this distance
here was our x(t).

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.530
Now, our position vector
a little bit later.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.570
So here we are at
time t plus delta t.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.430
The runner has
moved a little bit.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.380
And we'll now describe
the position vector--

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.570
because I don't
want to overlap it--

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.670
that center point is up here.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.260
It's going to point
in this direction.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.950
And this is what we
call r(t) plus delta t.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.830
In that vector,
r(t) plus delta t,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.980
the coordinate function
is no longer at time t

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.880
but t plus delta t i hat.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.720
And we would now
like to describe

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.620
the displacement vector.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:23.520
So our next step is to describe
the displacement vector

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.890
for the interval t
to t plus delta t.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.300
And that displacement vector
is defined-- we use the symbol

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.280
delta r, and what we
mean is the vector r(t)

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.750
plus delta t minus
the vector r(t).

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.940
Now, what that
vector corresponds to

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.200
is the vector right here.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.130
This is our delta r.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.850
And if we now use our
two definitions here,

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:04.030
then this becomes x(t) plus
delta t minus x(t) i hat.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.100
And this quantity here we
refer to as the component

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.270
of the displacement vector.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:21.530
So delta x is the component
of the displacement vector.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.450
And as before, the
component can be positive,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.180
which would correspond
to the person moving

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.540
a positive component,
positive i hat direction,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.180
in the positive x direction
as shown in this figure.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.040
If the displacement
of vector is zero,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.450
the person could
have run forward

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.510
and come back and at
time t plus delta t

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.040
be in exactly the
same spot as time t.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.240
The displacement vector
is zero in that case.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.060
The displacement
vector could have

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.430
a component that's negative.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.600
And what negative means is at
the end of this interval-- t

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:08.460
plus delta t-- that the person
is to the left of the runner.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.250
And so this quantity
would be negative.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.470
And so this is our crucial
displacement vector that

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.890
describes only the difference
in positions between the person,

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.828
between time t plus
delta t, and time t.

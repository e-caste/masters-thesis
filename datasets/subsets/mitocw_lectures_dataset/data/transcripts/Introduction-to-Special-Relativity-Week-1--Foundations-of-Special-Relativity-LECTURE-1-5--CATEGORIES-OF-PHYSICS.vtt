MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20 Special Relativity.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.360
In this short
video, you're going

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.340
to see how special
relativity, here shown as SR,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.060
fits into the general
landscape of physics theories.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.980
Very likely you have listened
to 8.01 last semester

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.460
or some previous time
in your career at MIT.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.250
And once we enter the discussion
of special relativity,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.770
it might seem to you
that what you learned

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.170
there was simply incorrect.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.950
A better way to look at this
is that each of those physics

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.580
theories, they have
a range of validity,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.960
a range in which the
theory works and describes

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.730
physical phenomena.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.100
And so here in this
picture, I'd like

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.270
to point out that even
special relativity has

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.490
its own range of validity.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.080
But let's start with
classical mechanics.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.950
So classical mechanics
describes the motion

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.120
of objects, a collision of
objects, a rotation of objects.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.440
In 8.02, you are
studying electrodynamics.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.700
But you do that typically at MIT
in those courses at velocities

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.600
which are modest--

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.730
small velocities,
small velocities

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.950
compared to the speed of light.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.400
Once you accelerate,
once you have velocities

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.540
which are really, really large,
then the description breaks.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.820
The validity of those
theories breaks.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.580
And that's where special
relativity comes in.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.290
And it's especially
important when

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.030
you discuss very fast moving
bodies, fast moving reference

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.860
frames, or behavior of light.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.870
And so this is what
special relativity does.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:55.020
The range of validity is
basically fast-moving phenomena

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.250
with high speed.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.320
But special relativity
by itself doesn't

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.120
help you to understand,
for example,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.470
object of small scales.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.930
In order to have a
proper description here,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.120
you need to study
quantum mechanics.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.669
If you have object
of very mass large

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:12.850
or with large
accelerations, you need

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.670
to enter a generalized
view, general relativity.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.520
And if you, for example,
combine high velocities

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.750
and small scales, you have to
study quantum field theories.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.940
So the point of
this slide is really

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.280
to point out that special
relativity has a specific use

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.780
case.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.490
It's limited.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.340
It describes
fast-moving objects.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.500
It doesn't describe
large accelerations.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.920
So that is the
generalization you get when

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.520
you study general relativity.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.610
So in summary,
special relativity

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.060
is a complete description
of physical phenomena

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.440
at high speed.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.690
It is consistent
with 8.01 and 8.02.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.140
And you will later see that
whenever we find integration

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.350
of motion for object
at high speed,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.600
if we use smaller
velocities, we'll

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.818
find the solutions
of 8.01 and 8.02.

00:03:10.818 --> 00:03:13.890
When we combine
special relativity

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.170
with quantum mechanics,
it describes quantum field

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.070
theories.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.500
And as I was saying,
the generalization

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.350
of special relativity, SR,
is general relativity, GR.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.860
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So while
we're waiting for the phone--

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.090
I mean, for the microphone,
a little bit of catching up

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.940
from the previous lecture--

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.210
on the slide over
there is a telescope.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.590
So I don't want to spend
too much time on it.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.200
You wanted to see the telescope
at least in one homework

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.420
problem of the previous set,
so you're familiar with it.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.850
Then, once you
alluded to it earlier.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.230
So it is kind of opposite than
the microscope in the sense

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.480
that, OK, both instruments are
similar because they magnify,

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.010
but they magnify what?

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.040
In the case of a microscope,
we see very small detail.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.540
Thank you.

00:01:10.128 --> 00:01:12.420
We've got a new battery now,
so we're back in business.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.700
So in the microscope,
the object appears small

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.090
because it is
physically very small,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.160
and it is available nearby.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.380
That is a definition
of a microscope.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.950
In the case of a
telescope, the object

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.990
appears small, not because
it is physically small,

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.090
but it is-- but because
it is very far away.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.250
So for example, a star--
a star is humongous,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.830
and it may be several thousand
times bigger than the Earth,

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.310
but it appears very small
because it is also maybe

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.100
thousands of light years away.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.230
So this is the situation
where we typically--

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.180
where we use a telescope.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.300
So you see there the function
of the telescope here.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.020
So if this is the
case of a telescope

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.600
with an object with a finite
location, so in this case,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.540
the object is physically big.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.580
It appears small
because it is far away.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.640
So the telescope,
in this case, it

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.990
is actually very similar
to the microscope,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.240
to the way it works.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.400
It creates an image of this
object in the following sense,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.770
that each point in the object
becomes a parallel ray bundle

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.970
at the output of the telescope.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.460
So therefore, the
observer-- again,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.370
recall that the
final, final image

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.690
is produced by the lens of the
observer's eye on the retina.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.090
So the eye of the observer picks
up this parallel ray bundle

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.140
and focuses it on the retina.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.320
Now, if you extend
the rays backwards

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.770
through the final
eyepiece of the telescope,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.630
you can see that the
telescope actually

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.220
is creating a virtual image
that is magnified with its back

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.820
to the original object.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.830
And that's why-- that's
how the telescope magnifies

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.840
this remote object.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.690
It is more common
to use a telescope

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.990
as shown in the second case,
where the object is actually

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.470
at infinity.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.600
And that is the classical case
of a telescope, where now,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.810
instead of having
spherical waves arriving

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.260
from points in the object,
now I have plane waves.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.230
So to a good approximation,
to an excellent approximation,

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.200
star is located at infinity.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.870
But not necessarily--
even terrestrial objects

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.840
that are located, say,
more than 100 meters,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.150
so a kilometer
away, they satisfy

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.950
this approximation quite well.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.700
So they produce these
almost parallel ray bundles.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.600
So the telescope, in this
case, it is afocal in the sense

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.540
that the output of the
scalar telescope, again you

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.647
produce a parallel ray bundle.

00:03:58.647 --> 00:04:00.230
And the reason, of
course, is that you

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.660
want the observer to form an
image with unaccommodated eye.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.580
That means that still the
image must be at infinity

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.930
so that the eye--

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.800
without any strain, the eye
can focus it to the retina.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.450
And since that is the case,
it means that the total--

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.220
now, let's be a
little bit careful

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.350
with the terminology-- the total
power of the telescope is zero.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.530
That is, the telescope
has no optical power.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.870
Its focal length is infinity.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.660
However, it does have
magnifying power.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.840
What a telescope does
in this case, the angle

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.010
between a chief
ray and the axis,

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.740
the telescope
magnifies this angle.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.010
And this is now by
definition the magnification

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.630
of the telescope,
and you can see

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.270
that by virtue of
magnifying this angle,

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.590
the telescope also magnifies
the final real image that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.470
will be produced on the retina.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:01.753
And in order to be afocal--

00:05:01.753 --> 00:05:03.170
this was the topic
of the homework

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.657
that I gave you guys a few--

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:07.490
I don't know-- I think
it was two weeks ago.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.910
In order to be afocal, the
distance between the two lenses

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.100
must equal the sum
of the focal length.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.510
It is very easy to convince
yourselves in this case

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:22.430
that an instrument such as
this one, then in the imaging,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.820
in the matrix of the instrument,
the matrix will look like this.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:33.460
And it will have a 0
in the 1, 2 element.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.630
In the first row, second
column, it will have a 0.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.330
If that is the case-- whoops--

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.030
if that is the case,
then it is called afocal.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.330
So by satisfying
this condition, d

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:54.220
equals f objective
plus f eyepiece, we

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.690
ensure that this is the case.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.860
So there's a number of
different types of telescopes.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.900
I just picked one here.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.520
The textbook lists all of them.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.730
There is the Keplerian,
Galilean, astronomical

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.570
telescope.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.910
They all have different
combinations of lenses.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.060
I picked one here that
is composed exclusively

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.850
of mirrors, and it is
very common actually

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.050
in observation--
in observatories.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.940
It is called the Cassegrain.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.980
It is also the same
type that, if you

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.380
go to the Discovery
Store, for example,

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.470
and buy a telescope for
your nephew or your niece,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.370
this is the type.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.030
You look at it, and,
you know, the tube

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.680
is oriented horizontally, and
you look at it from the top.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.860
And this is the schematic here.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.570
The object, or the
sky, is on this end,

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.220
and you place your eye this way.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:53.910
So the telescope itself
consists of a large first mirror

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.270
that functions as the
primary, and then there's

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:00.130
a second mirror.

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.260
So if you look at the--

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.960
from this side, if you
look into the telescope,

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.960
you will see a small
block in the front face

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.990
of the instrument.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.780
So that is the secondary mirror.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.390
So the combination of primary
and secondary-- of course,

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.060
you use two of them to get
even higher magnification,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.820
and the combination
is the objective.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.320
And then, there's
an eyepiece, which

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.820
is where you stick
your eye, and you

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.710
see the-- you see
the image of the sky.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.400
So this is composed
purely of mirrors.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.310
So last time, we're going to
call this kind of instrument

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.960
catoptric.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.308
Then, there's another
type of telescope.

00:07:38.308 --> 00:07:39.600
Actually, it's not a telescope.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.370
It's a kind of a method for
correcting optical systems

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.830
called Schmidt--

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.445
Schmidt telescope or
Schmidt optical system.

00:07:49.445 --> 00:07:51.230
So let me say why you use this.

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:56.840
So you recall that the ideal
mirror surface to give perfect

00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.710
focusing of an object at
infinity is actually parabolic.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:03.380
Now, suppose that we
cannot make a parabola,

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.328
so we have to make a sphere
instead of a parabola.

00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:08.120
Well, in that case, a
little bit of thought

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.260
will convince yourself
that the sphere, because it

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.000
is more highly curved than
the parabola near the edges,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.280
away from the
paraxial region, it

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.650
will actually bend the rays
that are far from the axis.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:27.050
They will bend more
than they should.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.990
So the result is the failure
to reach perfect focus.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.530
This is what we
have already seen,

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:34.909
and we'll call it
spherical aberration.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:37.010
So Schmidt basically
came up with an idea

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.730
to correct this
spherical aberration

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:42.460
by sticking a slightly--

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.180
a glass surface at
the front pupil here.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:59.310
He put a glass surface
which is slightly shaped.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.352
It has toroidal shape,
and the purpose--

00:09:02.352 --> 00:09:04.185
I don't know if you can
see it in the image.

00:09:04.185 --> 00:09:07.280
It was a-- perhaps I should
have exaggerated more.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.570
It is too subtle.

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.420
But what it does is
it takes this ray

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:16.400
and sends it slightly higher,
so this kind of functions

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.810
like a negative lens, actually.

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:21.280
You can think of it this
way, with a very small power.

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:24.470
And then, because
this hits the surface

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.380
at a different point
with a different angle,

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.100
then, basically, by engineering
the shape of the surface here,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.280
you can make sure that
most-- that all of the rays

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:38.790
will actually meet ideally
at the focal point.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.090
So this is a very simple
way to correct for this.

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:42.965
I don't know if it is
simple, but, anyway, it

00:09:42.965 --> 00:09:46.880
is a way to correct for
spherical aberration.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.550
So this is called
catadioptric because it

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.980
contains a reflector, as
well as a refractive element.

00:09:54.980 --> 00:10:00.250
So according to our terminology,
that's what we call it.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.280
So that's all I had to
say about telescopes.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.810
Are there any questions or--

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.820
either about telescopes
or microscopes

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:10.210
or any of the optical
systems that we saw?

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.650
So next, I'm going to
shift gears a little bit,

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.200
and I'm going to expand
on the very last topic

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.540
that we saw, the
topic of aberration.

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.240
So we saw quite extensively--
we mentioned several times

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.880
this spherical aberration.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:52.150
It turns out it is
not the only one,

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:55.950
and we'll see a number of
different types of aberrations

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:57.730
today.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.150
So to do a little
bit of organization

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:03.940
and classification, we start by
classifying them as two types.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.770
One is chromatic, and this we
have also seen in the past,

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:10.230
in the context of
a prism primarily.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.990
And it is due to the fact
that the index of refraction

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:14.460
has a variation with wavelength.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.020
So if you apply the lens maker's
formula, or any of those,

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.200
in order to design an element
with a given focal length

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.900
at the given wavelength,
you have no guarantee

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.200
that the focal length
will be the same

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.275
at the different wavelength.

00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:33.660
That fact is called
chromatic aberration.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:36.030
Again, this comes
from a Greek word.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.750
I had to do this, and I sound
like this movie, My Big Fat

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:43.410
Greek Wedding, but since I'm
Greek, I guess it is natural.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:50.050
So chroma-- in Latin, this
would spell the chroma,

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.190
with the accent here.

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:56.360
It means color in Greek.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.000
So that's where the term
chromatic comes from.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.270
The second time-- or for the
second type of aberration

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:07.190
is called geometrical.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.400
And there's a long definition
here, but I will go back to it,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:14.030
and perhaps this long
definition will make more sense.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.920
Let me start with
chromatic because this

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.900
is easy to deal with--

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.460
OK, not easy to deal with,
but it is easy to understand.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.430
So as I said, we have
seen this type of plot

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:28.790
before, where the horizontal
axis is the wavelength.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.670
The vertical axis is
the index of refraction.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.160
And forget this dashed
line for a moment.

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:36.710
Just look at the solid lines.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:39.170
So these are the
index of refraction,

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:42.410
this function of wavelength,
for different glasses.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.778
You have seen this before
in the context of a prism.

00:12:45.778 --> 00:12:47.070
This is, of course, a disaster.

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:51.850
It means that if you have
a lens like this one, which

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.290
you designed for a
certain focal length,

00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:57.220
say, somewhere in the
middle of the spectrum,

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.880
say, near yellow,
then this means that--

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.120
well, as you can see, the index
in the red wavelength for sort

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.760
of normal materials-- this
is actually called normal

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.000
dispersion--

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.630
the index is smaller
at the red wavelengths.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:20.410
So if you remember the
lens maker's formula,

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:23.140
smaller index means that
the focal length is what?

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:35.590
OK, the lens maker's
formula says that 1 over f

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.440
equals n minus 1, the
difference in radii.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.590
So if n goes down, it means
that 1 over f goes down.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:49.670
It means that the f goes up.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:52.460
So it means that the
focal length is longer.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.300
And this is also what you see
in this picture over here.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:14:01.930
You'll see that if you
have a white light coming

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:05.560
from infinity, you'll see
that the red rays focus

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:09.280
at the longer distance
than the blue rays.

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:20.650
So that is the evidence
of chromatic aberration,

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:24.370
and it turns out there's
a way of correcting it,

00:14:24.370 --> 00:14:28.630
which is to stick two
lenses, one of them with a--

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:32.630
that is a positive lens and
the other a negative lens.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.880
And first of all, they have to--

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.330
the two lenses have to have
a slightly different indices.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.550
Otherwise, it wouldn't
even make sense, right?

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:44.950
Then this would be
just one element.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.700
So they have different
indices, different dispersion

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.400
probably, so one can pick, for
example, between these glasses.

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.630
You could pick one
lens out of this one,

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.240
another out of this one.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.880
This is how one designs
this kind of element.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.610
And then, the way to understand
it is because one of them

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.240
tries to focus the rays.

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.360
The other, because
it is negative,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.760
it will try to
actually defocus them.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.570
You can imagine how
one can compensate

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:12.550
the action of the positive
lens with the action

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.290
of the negative
lens and eventually

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.290
cancel, or at least
approximately cancel,

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.900
a chromatic aberration
over a relatively

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.430
long range of wavelengths.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.600
I used to give you this
problem as a homework.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.230
I don't do it anymore.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.650
But, anyway, it is a fairly
straightforward thing to do.

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.990
And if you go over
the textbook, there's

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.170
an entire section where
he tells you in detail how

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:36.997
this kind of thing can be done.

00:15:36.997 --> 00:15:38.330
Conceptually, it is very simple.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.670
All you do is you
balance the focal length.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:43.510
So you basically make sure
that the composite has

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:47.430
a focal length that is
the nominal focal length,

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.620
and then you balance
the chromatic

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:54.540
by use of the two
elements of the composite.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.190
The geometrical
aberrations, they're

00:15:56.190 --> 00:16:00.720
more interesting because,
conceptually, they're actually

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:06.950
much richer than chromatic, and
also, algebraically, they're

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.400
much more difficult to handle.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.790
So people have come up with
all kinds of clever tricks

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.150
in order to understand and
express geometric aberrations.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.140
So again, let me remind
you that at the exit

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.740
of an optical instrument,
the ideal wavefront should

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:25.930
be spherical.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:28.810
So this is the dashed
line over here.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.980
If you draw normals to this
spherical wavefront, of course,

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:36.430
there will be the radii of
the corresponding sphere,

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.920
and they will meet at
the center of the sphere.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.650
So if I actually produce
a spherical wavefront,

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.470
then I can expect a
perfect geometrical focus

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.045
at the center of that
spherical wavefront.

00:16:47.045 --> 00:16:49.420
So the problem, of course,
these are optical instruments,

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.360
as we saw repeatedly in a
number of cases in the past,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.640
including the
spherical reflectors,

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.450
spherical refractors,
and so on and so forth,

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.860
they don't produce spherical
wavefronts at the action.

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.140
They produce wavefronts
that, in general, may

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.599
be some complicated surface.

00:17:08.599 --> 00:17:10.609
So in this case,
you see the eye is--

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.040
of course, are exaggerated--

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.859
I made it terribly
aberrated, and this

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:17.082
is the solid line over here.

00:17:17.082 --> 00:17:25.030
So the difference between the
actual aberrated wavefront

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:30.180
and the ideal wavefront, which
is, of course, spherical,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.640
this difference is by
definition the aberration.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:37.040
So I tried to be
fairly loyal here.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.240
So I-- again, this
is a cartoon, but I

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.480
took the difference between the
solid line and the dashed line,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.610
and this is what you would get.

00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:47.460
Typically, you measure it
in optical path length,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.740
and it doesn't have
to be very dramatic.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:55.030
The vertical axis here can be
as small as a few wavelengths,

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:57.520
and that is often
sufficient to destroy

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:01.130
the quality of the image
formation in an optical system.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:07.620
In fact, the book has the story
of the Hubble telescope, which

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.540
is kind of famous,
or I should say

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:15.390
infamous study of a disaster,
and heroic, in optical design.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:19.650
The telescope was sent to
space with a serious error

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:20.550
in the design--

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:23.220
actually, in the
assembly, that caused

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.280
a huge spherical aberration.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.680
And then, they had to send
another spacecraft to fix it,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.180
and so on.

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.700
Anyway, they actually
succeeded, which is impressive.

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.480
But, anyway, so what the book
says is that the error was--

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.860
actually turned out to be--

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.780
I think it was half
a wavelength or so.

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.570
Whatever that had was
sufficient to destroy

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.102
the quality of the images that
were beamed from the telescope.

00:18:47.102 --> 00:18:49.310
So one has to be very, very
careful in this business.

00:18:52.312 --> 00:18:53.770
So as you can
imagine, if you tried

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.980
to express this kind
of complicated surface

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.110
or its difference
from a sphere, you

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:03.740
will probably get a very nasty
trigonometric expression,

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:05.720
so for a number of reasons.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.040
One of them has to
do with the ability

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.840
to compute
analytically, which is

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.770
kind of an old-fashioned problem
because now we have computers.

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.230
So that's one reason,
but the second reason,

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.990
because of the desire
to get intuition

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.660
about how these things work.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.660
People normally
express aberrations

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.610
in the form of a Taylor series.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.200
And, of course,
you are dealing now

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.450
in-- this is a surface, not
just a curve, as I show here.

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:41.440
The Taylor series
is high dimensional.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.180
You actually have many terms for
each order in the Taylor series

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.810
expansion.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.870
So these terms are actually
grouped into orders,

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.040
and the aberrations that--

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.490
and the terms that we
consider as a first step

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.970
in an optical system are
the third-order aberrations,

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:05.270
that are also known
as Seidel aberrations.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:09.140
And, of course, the
second-order aberrations

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.760
disappear because we assume
rotationally symmetric optics.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.360
That kills all the second-order
terms in the Taylor series

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.860
by definition.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.330
And the first-order aberration
is actually only one,

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:23.790
and that is the focus.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.340
So the first-order aberration
is actually paraxial.

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.370
It is something we've
already considered.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:31.400
And then, it is the
third order that we

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.017
deal with in optical design.

00:20:34.017 --> 00:20:36.350
So there's all-- after you
go through all the symmetries

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.350
and all that, it turns out that
the further the aberrations,

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.640
it's five of them.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:44.600
One we've already
encountered, it is spherical,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.510
and the other four are
coma, astigmatism, curvature

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.960
of field, and distortion.

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.840
And what you see here is
the aberration wavefronts,

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.230
so this probably
doesn't mean very much.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.120
What we'll do next
is we'll actually

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.490
see a ray diagram of
all of these aberrations

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:03.500
and what they look like.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:07.070
So the spherical, these diagrams
are straight out of the book.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.440
We have seen actually
several times,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:13.880
and the way spherical aberration
looks like, it basically

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.570
happens when the rays that
are away from the axis,

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.970
they receive more curvature than
rays that are near the axis,

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:23.260
or more or less.

00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:24.910
So in both of
these cases, you'll

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:29.530
get the situation where the
rays from away from the axis,

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:35.040
they focus before or
after the paraxial focus.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:38.300
And it is interesting,
the way-- but

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.880
if you look at this
kind of system,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.670
you wonder what exactly
is the focal spot?

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:47.440
And that's not an easy
question to answer,

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.270
so if you look at the
marginal ray over here,

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:54.490
the size of the
beam that you create

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.800
is, of course, defined
by the marginal ray.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.210
So you see that the marginal
ray kind of focuses here, then

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.890
starts to focus less.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:05.890
Then it reaches a
minimum size, and then

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.820
starts to expand again because
now this aberrated ray takes

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.000
over.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.900
So there's a minimum width
in this optical beam,

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.790
in this aberrated
optical beam to produce,

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:20.700
and that is called the least--
the circle of least confusion.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.590
It is kind of a compromise
to see whether this system is

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:26.900
approximately in focus.

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.140
Another thing that I want to
emphasize from this diagram

00:22:30.140 --> 00:22:37.010
is that, as you can see, near
the edge here of this bundle,

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.460
there is a congruence
of rays that approach.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:43.100
So if you-- this-- you can
only see a few rays here,

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.405
but if you imagine that you
fill up the space with rays,

00:22:46.405 --> 00:22:47.780
then you would
see that you would

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.740
get a very tight intersection
of successive rays that

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.420
trace a curve here.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.780
This curve is called
a caustic, and, again,

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:00.520
that's another Greek word.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:16.505
[GREEK] means
something that burns.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:34.020
And the reason it is called
caustic or the reason it

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.150
alludes--

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.740
the word alludes to burning
is because this congruence

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.610
of rays, if you were
to put a piece of paper

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:44.700
there, if you wanted
to put an element,

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:48.120
it would create and increase
the intensity of light

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:52.410
near the edge of this bundle.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.510
And therefore, it would
cause, presumably,

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:57.540
elevated temperature since
you have more light energy,

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.200
and that might actually
result in burning.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.390
Caustics are very
interesting things.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:06.240
I will say a little bit
more perhaps next time

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:11.670
about caustics, but
they occur often when

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:15.000
you deviate from a perfect
spherical wavefront.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.310
When you pick
different wavefronts

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:19.920
other than spherical,
these caustics

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.640
have a tendency to occur.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.640
And there's a very beautiful
mathematical theory

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:24.992
that describes that.

00:24:24.992 --> 00:24:26.700
It is a little bit
advanced, so we're not

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:30.300
going to-- it is kind of
beyond the scope of this class.

00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:35.100
But I thought since also
the book has mentioned it,

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.140
I thought it would be
interesting to point out

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.940
the existence of this caustic.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:46.170
When it comes to
spherical aberration,

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.910
there's only several
things one can

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:51.930
do in order to control
the spherical aberration.

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.690
One is the actual
shape of the lens.

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:58.797
If you'll go back to
the lens maker formula,

00:24:58.797 --> 00:24:59.630
this one over here--

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:00.960
I've already written it--

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:05.820
you can see very easily that you
can get the same focal length

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.660
with a number of different
combinations of radii

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:14.470
for the front and the
back surface of the lens.

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:19.930
So from the paraxial
point of view,

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.670
it makes no difference
whether you pick--

00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:27.700
for example, whether
you pick a plano-convex,

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.520
or whether you pick
a biconvex lens,

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.230
or whether you pick a meniscus,
and so on, from the paraxial

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.570
point of view, they're
all the same because--

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.180
as long as you have
the same focal length.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.310
However, because this
theory now-- we've

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:44.440
gone beyond the
paraxial approximation--

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:47.180
this theory is non-paraxial.

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:51.810
Actually, the shape factor of
the lens makes a difference.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.500
And then, forget the
definitions here.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:57.670
This plot is the
most interesting one,

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.560
where you can see
different lens shapes.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:04.300
This is a meniscus, kind of
that the-- a convex meniscus.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:06.130
Then, this is plano-convex.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.310
This is biconvex,
again plano-convex,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.530
but flipped the
other way around,

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.160
and then a concave meniscus.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.950
And this plot was
computed so that all

00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:19.660
of these different
shapes, they have

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.950
the same paraxial focal length,
but on the vertical axis,

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:27.070
you kind of see the amount
of spherical aberration

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.240
that you receive.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:31.900
And you can see that it is
very different, of course,

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.110
and it actually has a minimum.

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:37.560
It is not quite zero,
but it is a minimum,

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:46.040
and the minimum occurs typically
near the plano-convex shape

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.800
for an object of infinity.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.950
So why is that?

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:51.440
Well, the reason is--

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.800
this is kind of nicely
illustrated by another diagram

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.335
that I stole from your textbook.

00:27:00.656 --> 00:27:03.810
If you place the
plano-convex lens such

00:27:03.810 --> 00:27:07.140
that its flat surface
faces the plane wave coming

00:27:07.140 --> 00:27:09.810
from infinity, then,
basically, refraction

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.530
occurs only at this
spherical interface.

00:27:13.530 --> 00:27:14.440
So you have no hope.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.590
You will get very strong
spherical aberration

00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:20.070
because, as we learned
earlier, this spherical surface

00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:24.430
is very far from ideal
as a focusing element.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.820
So this case is very
highly aberrated.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.320
Now, you can do a
very simple thing.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.900
You can flip the lens so
that this spherical wave

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:31.890
meets this spherical--

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:33.570
I'm sorry-- so
that the plane wave

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:35.640
meets this spherical surface.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.080
If you do that,
then you actually

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.990
get refraction to
occur in two steps.

00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:43.680
And because the
first step produces

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:47.655
an aberrated spherical wave,
but the second step also

00:27:47.655 --> 00:27:51.870
incurs some spherical aberration
because of the nonlinearity

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:55.830
in the Snell's law, it turns
out that, in this case,

00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:00.970
the second surface, not
exactly, but closely

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.420
compensates the
spherical aberration.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:08.230
And you get a much better
focusing quality over here.

00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:11.430
So this is very good, practical
advice that we give to the sort

00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:15.290
of first-year graduate students
when they go to the laser lab,

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.580
is that when you have--

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.460
when you try to focus a plane
wave, you always orient--

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.250
but for A, you use a
plano-convex lens, not

00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.710
a biconvex, and B, that
you place it in this way,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:35.310
so that the spherical
surface of the lens

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:37.368
meets the planar wavefront.

00:28:37.368 --> 00:28:39.660
And, of course, it goes-- it
goes the other way around.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.657
If you have a point source, and
you want to collimate it, then

00:28:43.657 --> 00:28:45.240
again, you have to
make sure basically

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.540
you can reverse
the rays over here.

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:49.890
And you have to
orient the lens so

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:55.770
that the planar part of the
lens faces the point source.

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.250
So this is an example of doing
a very simple trick in order

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:06.090
to not quite
eliminate, but reduce

00:29:06.090 --> 00:29:09.300
the spherical aberration.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.380
It turns out that-- yes?

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:13.470
Push the button, please.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:16.980
AUDIENCE: He didn't
push the button.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.022
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:29:19.578 --> 00:29:21.120
AUDIENCE: In that
graph, how did they

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:24.600
actually measure the spherical
aberration in different lens

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:25.377
shapes?

00:29:25.377 --> 00:29:26.460
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.090
So the way to-- thank you.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.310
I should have mentioned that.

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:31.880
So you can characterize
a spherical aberration

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.250
based on one of these
parameters here.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:39.570
One is-- so it's called
the longitudinal spherical

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.670
aberration, and
it is the distance

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.120
on axis between
the paraxial focus

00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:49.960
and the focal point of the
last-- of the marginal ray.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.820
Right?

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:53.100
Another way to do it
is to basically measure

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.052
the size of the least confusion.

00:29:56.052 --> 00:29:58.260
So any of these-- if you
think about it, all of these

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.030
are proportional to
each other, so you

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.940
can put any of these quantities
on the vertical axis here.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.500
I'm not sure what he did here.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.810
I think it says
axial here, so it was

00:30:06.810 --> 00:30:10.560
the longitudinal distance here.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:11.270
And I thank you.

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.478
I should have mentioned that.

00:30:12.478 --> 00:30:16.520
This way of characterization
is common for all

00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.135
of the aberrations that we'll
see in the next two slides.

00:30:21.135 --> 00:30:21.635
Yeah?

00:30:21.635 --> 00:30:22.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.540
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Button.

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.330
AUDIENCE: We knew
which is the lengths.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:29.030
Do they specify paraxial
or focal length,

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:33.417
or circle of least
confusion as a f?

00:30:33.417 --> 00:30:34.500
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.708
That is a real good question.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.200
If it is a sort
of high-end lens,

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.590
it should be well corrected.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:53.160
So then, what it will specify
is actually the least confusion

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.670
focal end, but it is
pretty close to paraxial.

00:30:57.670 --> 00:31:00.640
If it is a poor lens, then
most likely what they specify

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.330
is the paraxial focus, and
then it is kind of up to you

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:05.210
to position it.

00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.490
Any other questions?

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:19.160
The--

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:19.770
AUDIENCE: In the previous--

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:20.230
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yes.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.440
AUDIENCE: Hi, George.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.810
In the previous slides,
what is the curve

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:29.833
in the third and previous at--

00:31:29.833 --> 00:31:32.250
hold on.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:34.680
Yeah, what is the curve
in the third graph?

00:31:37.537 --> 00:31:39.620
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: The
curve in the third graph?

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:40.245
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:40.245 --> 00:31:43.550
So the vertical axis is H,
and horizontal axis was--

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:44.800
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: This one?

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.430
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I
don't remember, actually.

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:51.080
I think it is the--

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:54.010
I suppose it is the amount
of spherical aberration

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:55.780
as a function of
position in the field.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:58.388
I'm not really sure.

00:31:58.388 --> 00:31:59.430
Maybe you can check that.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:00.750
Actually, I have the book.

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.237
You can check the book, huh?

00:32:02.237 --> 00:32:03.820
This came-- is
directly from the book.

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:10.730
I think it is the amount
of spherical aberration.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.253
It makes sense because-- here.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:21.888
Any other questions?

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:34.090
So it turns out that
what we said before,

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:37.960
and, actually, Colin made that
point when I was discussing

00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.750
ellipsoid, that the fractals
and so on and so forth,

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:48.400
and what we said before, that
a spherical surface produces

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.170
spherical aberration,
it is not always true.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:58.030
There is one condition where
a spherical surface does not

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:02.320
produce spherical aberration.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.060
And this condition
is given here.

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.670
That's another diagram I got--

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.290
that I got from the book.

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:13.070
And you can see here,
basically, the condition

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.240
says that if the radius
of this field is R,

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.600
the index of refraction
of this field is n2.

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:24.590
The index of refraction
outside this sphere is n1,

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:31.980
and you place a point source
at the distance R n1 over n2.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:34.762
Then, of course, the point
source is inside this sphere.

00:33:34.762 --> 00:33:36.720
If you think about it,
this is a negative lens.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.120
It will produce a virtual image.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.690
This virtual image
is located over here,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.990
and it is free of
spherical aberration.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:47.010
I will not prove this.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:49.440
This is actually in the book.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.850
It is given as a
problem in the textbook,

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:56.760
and the problems in
the textbook are solved

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.380
at the end of the textbook.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.580
That's why I never assign
problems from the textbook.

00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.330
And anyway, you can
look at it afterwards.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:06.000
It is a very simple
geometrical proof of this one.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.880
So we'll skip it here.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.810
But the point of this is
that there is actually

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:17.449
a single combination of image--

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:20.389
I'm sorry-- of
object image pairs,

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:22.670
for which the spherical
aberration is canceled

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.960
for this spherical surface.

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.770
And again, I want to emphasize
that if you place the object

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:34.510
point elsewhere,
it will still form

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.280
an image in the paraxial sense.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.389
This lens will remain
a lens, but it will not

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.429
be free of spherical aberration.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:49.576
It will only be free if this
condition here is satisfied.

00:34:49.576 --> 00:34:51.409
And actually, this
distance that I mentioned

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:52.826
is from the center
of this sphere.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.110
All right, so the
reason for that--

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.790
so this now has a
number of implications.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:08.080
For example, this is one
reason why meniscus lenses are

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:10.930
very popular in photography,
or at least in very

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:15.700
old-fashioned cameras
that were very expensive.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.330
Now, we're talking about cameras
in the '20s and '30s, you know,

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.630
the type of camera that
the cameraman would

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:26.110
go under a black hood and
then going, and then click.

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:30.130
And, you know, the family
would be sitting with the--

00:35:30.130 --> 00:35:33.295
whatever, with the
children, all that stuff.

00:35:33.295 --> 00:35:36.280
And so these cameras, they would
typically use a single meniscus

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.500
lens, and the reason was exactly
that the meniscus, at least

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.050
if you designed it for
the typical distance--

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:49.390
remember, again, this was a
camera for a photography shop.

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.750
So it has-- you
can kind of predict

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.350
the location of the object
because the camera's already

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:59.210
always sitting in the same
distance from the-- wherever

00:35:59.210 --> 00:36:02.020
you place the family to
take the family picture.

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:04.450
And then, in that case, you
can engineer the meniscus

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.340
to minimize this
spherical aberration

00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.763
for this particular distance.

00:36:07.763 --> 00:36:09.180
It turns out the
meniscus also has

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.597
some other interesting
properties,

00:36:10.597 --> 00:36:13.010
but I will not go into that.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.510
So of course, in that case, you
cannot really put the family

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:19.800
in glass, so you're going to
have exactly this situation

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.792
over here.

00:36:20.792 --> 00:36:22.500
But, nevertheless, if
you think about it,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:26.340
you don't need-- you know, you
can satisfy this condition,

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:29.850
even if you have two
spherical surfaces, provided

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:32.780
that, as you go from
one surface to the next,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:34.860
you have to satisfy
the same condition.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:39.625
It is the same condition that
you have to satisfy twice.

00:36:39.625 --> 00:36:41.250
And I forgot to
mention, this condition

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.137
is called the
aplanatic condition.

00:36:44.137 --> 00:36:46.470
Actually, that, I don't know
why it is called aplanatic,

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.660
but it sounds like a--

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.810
you know, Colin, why--

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:51.450
where that comes from?

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:53.130
Aplanatic means non-planar.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.720
It makes no sense
at all, but, anyway,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:55.762
that's what they call it.

00:36:58.976 --> 00:37:04.470
And it is also used in
oil immersion microscopy.

00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:06.630
In this case, we mentioned that.

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:09.540
Actually, it was also a topic
of one of the homeworks.

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.750
Oil immersion means that you
put the liquid, the droplet,

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:17.100
between the objective and
the sample in the microscope.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.470
And in this case,
again, you can kind of

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:23.603
make sure that when you apply
the aplanatic condition--

00:37:23.603 --> 00:37:25.020
because, again,
in the microscope,

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:29.700
you have very good control over
the distance between the exit

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.430
pupil and the object.

00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:35.700
And you can make sure that
the aplanatic condition is

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.980
satisfied for this
particular distance,

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:42.690
and you can use the index
of refraction of the oil

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:47.260
in order to satisfy the
aplanatic condition.

00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:49.200
So now, that's the
case where you exactly

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.645
cancel the spherical aberration,
so it is very interesting.

00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:54.270
It is different than
the previous case.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:56.940
Here, we exactly
cancel it by using

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:00.163
this particular condition.

00:38:03.870 --> 00:38:09.730
The next aberration I
wanted to discuss is coma.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.940
So coma is different than
spherical in the sense

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.346
that spherical occurs even if
you have on-axis incidence.

00:38:18.346 --> 00:38:25.840
Coma actually occurs for
off-axis incident rays.

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.190
So this is the typical image,
or the typical sort of depiction

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:31.990
of coma that you see in books.

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:35.410
Again, you have a plane
wave coming from infinity,

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:39.190
but it is incident
at an angle of focus.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.860
So it is likely quite
possible that you

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.883
might have spherical aberration
as well in this case.

00:38:44.883 --> 00:38:46.300
But in this
particular case, we're

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:48.460
only concerned
for the aberration

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.720
due to the fact that you are off
axis, and that is called coma.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.950
So if you work out sort of
the non-paraxial imaging

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:01.750
for this case, you will discover
that at the focal plane,

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.690
sort of up to here,
what you see is

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:11.230
a cross-section of the system
in the meridional plane.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:16.570
And this is what you would see
as a front view on the imaging

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:19.600
plane, and it turns out that
you can also see it here.

00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:22.090
This is perhaps
a better picture.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:24.460
It looks like a
teardrop, and this is

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.810
where the term coma comes from.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.330
It is not a condition
that you enter

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:30.790
after a very serious
accident, but it

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:35.530
is rather from the
punctuation symbol, a comma.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.290
In old-fashioned books, kind
of the comma looks like this.

00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:42.410
So ah, I don't know
how good my drawing is,

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.580
but this teardrop
shape is kind of

00:39:45.580 --> 00:39:50.930
reminiscent of the
punctuation, a comma.

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:52.550
So this is what it looks like.

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:57.310
And now, the geometry of this
is a little bit complicated.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:59.260
You can basically
calculate the shape

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.110
of the coma in the
meridional plane

00:40:02.110 --> 00:40:06.160
and the sagittal plane,
perpendicular to that.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.400
So the meridional
plane is this one,

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.950
the one that you
see over here that

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:14.950
is-- if you take the
plane of incidence,

00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:18.700
it is the plane that cuts
through the center of the lens.

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.710
And then if you
rotate by 90 degrees,

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.697
that would be the
sagittal plane.

00:40:22.697 --> 00:40:24.280
So according, because
we are off axis,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.697
the two are not
symmetric anymore.

00:40:25.697 --> 00:40:28.330
On axis, they are symmetric,
but off axis, they're not,

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.390
so that's what gives rise to
the strongly asymmetric nature

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:32.980
of the coma.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:35.680
And it turns out, if you
do some simple geometry,

00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:40.480
you find out that the
length of this comatic shape

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.900
along the tangential,
the meridional plane, it

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.390
turns out to be three
times the length

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:49.060
along the sagittal plane.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.350
So this follows from geometry.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.560
To be honest, I never quite
went through the derivation

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:57.820
of this one, but,
anyway, someone did it.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.210
And these derivations,
by the way,

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.200
they have a way of
becoming very complicated,

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.500
even when they give
very simple results,

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.760
like this case over here.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.015
Whether we'd like to--
there's a few things

00:41:12.015 --> 00:41:13.930
I would like to say about coma.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:16.210
One is, of course,
that it also depends

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:19.600
on the shape of the lens.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.010
So here you see what this
spherical aberration and coma

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:28.480
plotted for lenses of
the same focal length,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.300
but different shape factor.

00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:35.870
And you can see that,
fortuitously, there's

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:39.200
a region over here, where,
above the spherical-- actually

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.630
the coma is
completely eliminated,

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.040
and this spherical
is close to zero.

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.020
So this means that this
is a good design point,

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:51.050
if you want to
simultaneously minimize coma

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.400
and this spherical aberration.

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.360
Now, you might wonder--

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.490
let me skip for a
moment the discussion

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:00.790
of the bottom figure over here.

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:01.800
I'll come back to it.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.230
But you may wonder how it can
be that coma is completely

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:08.330
eliminated.

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:13.990
It turns out that--

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.880
and, again, this is something
I will give without proof.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:22.780
It turns out that there is a
condition that, indeed, you

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.630
can cancel coma.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:28.200
So this is called
the sine condition.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:30.290
Sine, now, this is
not a Greek word.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:32.650
It is actually a
Latin word, [LAUGHS]

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:36.880
and it is the same sine as the
sine we have in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.650
And this requires a
little bit of explanation,

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.940
so we'll do that, and
then we'll quit for today.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.215
So the sine condition
follows from another result

00:42:47.215 --> 00:42:50.080
for the optical sine theorem.

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:52.930
Interestingly, for those of you
who are mechanical engineers

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:55.150
and know thermodynamics,
this theorem

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.767
was proven by a kind of a hero
of thermodynamics, Clausius.

00:42:58.767 --> 00:43:00.850
There was-- I think there's
some kind of something

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.480
called Clausius Inequality,
or something like that.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:06.640
It's a very big, important
result in thermodynamics.

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:09.280
So he proved it first,
and then two other people

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:13.360
associated with optics more
closely, Abbe and Helmholtz,

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.420
they derived it
independently 10 years later.

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.780
So what is it this theorem say?

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:25.580
Well, here's again the
geometry of an optical system.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:31.670
We use the notation alpha as
before to denote the angles,

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:32.600
and y--

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.690
for some reason, the
book uses y, not x,

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.930
to denote the elevation of rays.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:41.410
So this is not an exact
result. It is not quite axial,

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:44.830
but it says that if you
satisfy the imaging condition,

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:53.020
then the index of refraction,
the ray elevation, and the sine

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:57.130
of the ray angle
in the object space

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.820
are the same as the
product of this-- actually,

00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:02.800
I should've said the
product of the three

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.770
is the same as the product
in the image space.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:11.970
So you can see these quantities
over here, all of them,

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:13.520
a sub i--

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.270
I'm sorry-- this is a sub i, a
sub o, and so on and so forth.

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.690
Why is this significant now?

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:27.010
If you take the ratio of
y at the image plane--

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:31.420
so this is y sub
i over y sub o--

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.230
that ratio is the magnification.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:35.710
So you see a problem here.

00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:38.130
The problem is that
if you calculate

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:42.537
the ratio from this
quantity, the ratio

00:44:42.537 --> 00:44:43.620
would turn out to be what?

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:52.260
I could do-- turn out to
be something like n i--

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:07.490
sine alpha i over n
object sine alpha object.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:09.590
And because of the
presence of the sines

00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:14.570
here, you can very easily deduce
that the magnification is not

00:45:14.570 --> 00:45:16.160
the same.

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:19.180
The magnification
that you had depends

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.820
on the size of the
object, which, of course,

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.200
very annoying.

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:26.380
We did not see that in the
paraxial approximation,

00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:28.310
but, of course, this
is non-paraxial.

00:45:28.310 --> 00:45:31.040
That's why it happens,
but it is very annoying.

00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:34.270
It is-- and it is the
reason why coma happens.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:38.160
You can also see it over here.

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:43.660
You can see a very-- you can
see sort of the different rays.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.970
They attempt to reach-- to
focus at different locations

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:51.295
in the image plane.

00:45:51.295 --> 00:45:52.170
So that's the reason.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:57.100
So the sine theorem says, boy,
if I could actually make--

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:02.050
I'm sorry-- if I could
actually make this ratio,

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:06.070
sine alpha in the object
over sine alpha in the image,

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:09.130
if I could make equal to
the corresponding paraxial

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:11.570
quantities, then
I would be happy

00:46:11.570 --> 00:46:13.420
because then the
magnification would

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:19.000
be the same, independent
of object elevation.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.870
And therefore, I
would be free of coma.

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:23.640
So that is the sine theorem.

00:46:33.984 --> 00:46:38.480
So basically, the reason
coma can be eliminated here,

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.970
it is because, for this
particular lens configuration,

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:45.550
the sine theorem is
actually satisfying.

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:50.500
So you basically get a complete
elimination of the coma.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:02.170
So unless there's any questions,
I think we should quit here,

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:03.730
and we'll continue
with the remaining

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:06.930
aberrations on Wednesday.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:07.680
AUDIENCE: George--

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.010
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:47:08.010 --> 00:47:09.960
AUDIENCE: --can I make
a comment about the--

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.840
I've been thinking about
this aplanatic word

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:13.980
that you mentioned.

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:18.298
If you go back a couple
of slides to the--

00:47:18.298 --> 00:47:19.590
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Maybe far?

00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:20.215
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:20.215 --> 00:47:23.410
That-- yeah, that one will do.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:26.300
I think that-- now I'm thinking
where that word comes from.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:28.630
I've never really thought
about it before, but the--

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.150
that, of course, the
aplanatic condition

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:34.090
will be satisfied not
just at one point,

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:37.720
but on a complete
sphere, with center

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.480
at the center of the
spherical surface.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:45.130
And the perfect image will be
formed on another sphere, also

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:47.810
with its center at the center
of the spherical surface.

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:52.090
So I think maybe that's
why it says not plane.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:56.770
It's because the image
on a spherical surface

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:59.633
is going to be formed perfectly
on another spherical surface.

00:47:59.633 --> 00:48:02.050
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah,
because with a virtual surface,

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:03.700
as we'll see a little bit later.

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.200
Yeah.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:05.853
Yeah.

00:48:05.853 --> 00:48:06.770
Yep, that makes sense.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:08.320
AUDIENCE: Hmm.

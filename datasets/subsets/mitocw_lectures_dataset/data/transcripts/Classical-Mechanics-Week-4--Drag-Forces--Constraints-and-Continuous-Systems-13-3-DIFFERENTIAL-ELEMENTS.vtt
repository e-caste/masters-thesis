00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.170
In many problems
throughout this class,

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.640
we will find it
useful to consider

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.520
how the mass of an
object is distributed

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.990
throughout the object.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.590
To do this, we will define
a small piece of that object

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.480
and then consider the
mass that's contained

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.690
within that small piece.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.480
For an object in one dimension,
the differential element

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.512
of length is delta l.

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:23.220
And that length contains
a certain amount

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.170
of mass, delta m.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.990
We could also have
a linear object

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.820
in the shape of an arc or
just an arbitrary path.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.560
For an object in
two dimensions, we

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.620
have an area element, delta A,
that contains a mass delta m.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.420
For our volume, we have a
volume element, delta V,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.590
which contains a
certain amount of mass.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.330
In this case, we can write
the volume element delta

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:59.560
V as the area A
times this delta x.

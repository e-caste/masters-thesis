00:00:21.276 --> 00:00:21.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.400
First, welcome everybody
and good afternoon.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.120
So the question is about
the master equation.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.440
We know is that the
most general master

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.040
equation has to have
the Lindblad form.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.710
And the Lindblad form
has a jump operator

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.930
which is providing dissipation.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.890
In its simplest
case, a jump operator

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.430
is just the sigma minus operator
for spontaneous emission, which

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.400
takes us from the excited
state to the current state.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.740
And when we have the Linblad
form, the jump operator

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:58.210
and it's commission conjugate,
like sigma plus, sigma minus,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.220
appear on the right-hand
side of the master equation

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.200
with the statistical operator
here, here, and in the middle.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.110
There are plus-minus
signs in factors of two.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.240
So I don't have a
intuitive explanation

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.420
where the factors come from.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.670
They come from the derivation.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.210
But you have a question
about it, Nancy?

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.110
AUDIENCE: So after
writing the Linblad form,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.356
we get gamma [INAUDIBLE], which
we are saying for the r dot

00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:31.510
vector, we were
writing [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.350
And we said that
they are directly

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.796
coming from the first one?

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:37.420
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.914
So let's go right here.

00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:46.080
That's actually what we
were going to discuss today.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.840
We want to discuss, today,
solutions of the optical Bloch

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.140
equations.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.440
And just to remind you, we
derived a master equation

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.920
for the density matrix.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.100
And this master equation,
through the interaction

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.560
with the reservoir,
is acting a term

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.360
to the Hamiltonian evolution.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.060
And this is showing right here.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.495
These are the interactions
with the reservoir.

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:17.890
And in the case of the
optical Bloch equation

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.850
and spontaneous
emission, we have

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.110
only one Lindblad
operator, which

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.330
is Lindblad operator,
sigma minus,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.460
for spontaneous emission.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.360
So this here is
the master equation

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.070
for the two-level system
interacting with a vacuum

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.010
through spontaneous emission.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:50.180
And by substituting the
two-level density matrix,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.250
has three non-trivial
components-- sure, it's a 2

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.140
by 2 matrix, but the
craziest one-- and so

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.650
we can transform from the matrix
elements of the density matrix

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.000
to three other coefficient,
which come in very handy,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.020
because they allow a simple
geometric interpretation.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.540
And this is the Bloch vector.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.200
And so the master equation,
which is shown here,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.580
turns into a differential
equation for the Bloch vector.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.520
And those two equations
are identical,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.030
we've just done
those substitution.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.228
But your question is now about--

00:03:21.228 --> 00:03:26.120
AUDIENCE: Plus gamma, because
we have negative gamma over 2,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.024
which is from the
first and last term.

00:03:29.024 --> 00:03:30.960
But the gamma term should
be positive, right?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.180
PROFESSOR: This one here?

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.112
AUDIENCE: No.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.026
PROFESSOR: This one?

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:34.609
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.768
Because that's negative gamma
over 2 times negative 2.

00:03:39.768 --> 00:03:40.610
PROFESSOR: No.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.690
I mean, first of all, this
is a differential equation

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.680
for r dot.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.810
OK.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.420
This is a differential
equation for the Bloch vector.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.060
And we have here three
different relaxation rates,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.700
which are gamma, gamma
over 2, and gamma over 2.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.325
And they are all
negative, because they

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:03.840
are relaxation rates.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.380
This here is not
a perfecter of r.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.030
It is sort of a constant.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.700
And it means, in the
long time limit-- I mean,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.950
what happens if you have a
system which spontaneously

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.660
decay after a while?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.190
The r vector is not 0.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.430
The r vector is hanging down.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.640
The system is in
its ground state.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.850
And this is exactly that.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:29.010
Wait.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.710
Am I r dot?

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:34.280
Yes.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.370
The effect is the system,
the differential equation,

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.980
has to relax towards
the equilibrium.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.110
You can actually
re-write this equation,

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:51.300
r dot equals a matrix times
r minus r equilibrium.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.880
So here is the matrix of
the optical Bloch equation.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.060
So if you re-write that that
r dot is the matrix times r

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.910
minus r equilibrium,
then r equilibrium times

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.970
the matrix gives
something constant.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.850
And this is exactly this here.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.330
But it's a
mathematical identity.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.270
Just look at it.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.380
There is no assumption.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.215
It's an exact re-writing
of the equation.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.940
So it is this
equation which will

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.490
be in the focus of our
attention not only today,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.730
but also when we talk
about light forces.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.630
The first thing we
did is we wanted

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.480
to discuss the Mollow triplet.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.030
And just as a reminder,
we have talked about,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.990
at the beginning
of last class, we

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.080
talked about the fluorescence.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.390
An atom is excited by
mono-chromatic laser light.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:02.040
And at low intensity,
a delta function

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.790
emits exactly the same
frequency of light

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.820
which is provided
by the laser light.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.760
So the incoming and
outgoing photons

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.120
have exactly the same frequency.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.740
And this is simply a consequence
of energy conservation.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.070
But at higher intensity,
we have sidebands.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.170
And we understand
intuitively that we

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:25.400
have sidebands because the
system is Rabi oscillation.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.880
So same, classically,
we have an emitter

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.760
which has some modulation
that creates sidebands.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:42.990
But is rather easy
to understand is,

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.570
by diagonalizing
the 2 by 2 matrix,

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:52.990
we find that we have a splitting
of excited state with n photons

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.560
and grounds it with
n plus 1 photons.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.120
So we have sort of a
plus and minus state.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.590
And if we look at the
possible transitions,

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.850
we immediately find
the explanation

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.910
for the Mollow triplet.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.660
There are three
different frequencies

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.960
which can be emitted
in transitions

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.460
between rest states.

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.800
What is much more subtle,
what cannot be obtained from

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.590
a preterbative
treatment, is the width,

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:25.590
how wide are those peaks
in the Mollow triplet.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:34.390
And there is tens
and tens of pages

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.470
in atom photo interaction.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.020
But at least, for
two limiting cases,

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:43.670
I could show you what the width
of the peak is by first saying,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.120
if you have delta
equals 0 and g equals

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.380
0, the matrix, which
determines the dynamics,

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.115
has three eigenvalues,
gamma over 2, gamma over 2,

00:07:52.115 --> 00:07:53.280
and gamma.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:58.430
And now, if we detune, we
add a rotation along z.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:03.290
If you drive the system strong,
it corresponds to rotation

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.370
around x.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.980
You probably
remember, from 8.421

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.940
the spin in a magnetic field.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:10.440
It rotates.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.190
In a frame, rotating
with omega, it

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.180
rotates at the detuning delta.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.750
But if you drive it, we make
it flip along the x-axis.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:25.680
So we find exactly that here.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:31.010
And then, it's an intuitive way
to sort of matrix, if you want,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.870
solve the matrix mathematically.

00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:36.750
But intuitively, what happens
is, if you have a z-rotation,

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.950
we don't change in
this eigenvalue.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:43.090
And the rotation is just
aiding i omega-- omega

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.990
is the rotation-- to x and
y, because x and y are now

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:48.560
rotating.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:58.470
So therefore, we obtained
that, in the case of detuning

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.570
the z-rotation, we have minus
gamma, minus gamma over 2,

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.830
minus gamma over 2.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:07.160
And here, what appears here
is the rotation frequency.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.980
And then, if you rotate around
the x-axis, then, of course,

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.840
nothing happens, but what
used to be the x-axis.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.220
So we get one eigenvalue
with minus gamma over 2.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:25.210
But the y and z
eigenvector are rotated.

00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.990
And hand-wavingly,
I can tell you.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.820
But you can show
it mathematically

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.760
that this means the two
new eigenvectors have

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.540
the average of those
two damping terms.

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:46.230
And this is 3/4 gamma.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.580
So at least, for the two
cases for large detuning

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.970
and strong drive, I was, with
a little bit of intuition,

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.540
showing you and
deriving for you where

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.179
the non-trivial bits of the
Mollow triplet comes from.

00:10:01.179 --> 00:10:02.720
So I hope you're,
at least, impressed

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.210
that these optical Bloch
equations are powerful

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:07.230
and allow us to make
predictions which

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.240
would be difficult
to obtain otherwise.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.970
Any questions about that?

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:16.690
About the Bloch vector,
the differential equation,

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:19.970
and the spectrum of
the immediate light?

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:28.890
OK, we want to now discuss one
other aspect, which is actually

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.010
fairly simple.

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.300
We want to discuss
steady state solution.

00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:36.540
For the steady state solution,
we just go to the differential

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:40.620
equation and say, the
left-hand side is 0.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.760
That immediately gives us a
solution for the Bloch vector.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.090
It gives us a Lorentzian.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.030
But for strong drive,
it has a term here,

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.570
which we will
immediately realize

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.960
that this gives us
power broadening.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.200
And then the steady state
Bloch vector is g delta,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:13.730
g gamma over 2, delta square
plus gamma square over 4.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.670
So we can now use this
solution for steady state

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:22.970
and discuss everything we want
what happens in steady state.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.280
So one question is, if
you have an atom laser

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.560
beam in steady state, how
much light is absorbed?

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:42.610
Well, the basic equation is,
if you have a charged q which

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:51.710
moves in an electric field,
that means work is done.

00:11:55.330 --> 00:12:01.400
So therefore, the absorbed
power is related to that.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:08.260
And we can now combine q dr/dt.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.860
And this is nothing
else than the derivative

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.870
of the dipole moment.

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:19.320
And then we calculate
the average.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:25.190
So with that, we find the
result they the absorbed

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:44.460
power is given by--
just one second-- e0?

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:45.420
Yeah.

00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:50.650
We express now e0 by
the Rabi frequency.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.850
And h bar appears in omega.

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:59.270
But the important thing is that
we need now the dipole moment

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.070
or the derivative of
the dipole moment.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:07.180
And the dipole moment is
given by the coherences

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.840
of the density matrix.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.840
And that is, if you look
at the substitution,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.220
is the x and y component of
the optical Bloch vector.

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.340
But now what we
need, of course, we

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:26.540
need only the component of
the dipole moment, which

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.590
gives a non-vanishing
term with cosine omega t.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:31.510
That means, what we
need is-- I mean,

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:33.060
that's like an
harmonic oscillator.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.570
The component of
the motion which

00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:36.630
is responsible for
absorption is the one

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.540
which is in quadrature, which is
assigned only the d-component.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.040
And that, you have to go
back and look by inspection.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:52.210
But this is exactly what the
y-component of the Bloch vector

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.320
does for us.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:58.270
It will become important
later on for optical forces.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:03.280
So we have the
optical Bloch vector.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.070
We are in the rotating frame.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:10.370
And the one component,
which is the x-component,

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.110
is in phase with the light.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:16.030
And the y-phase is 90 degree
out of phases in quadrature.

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.980
And for absorption it's, of
course, the in quadrature

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.890
component which is
relevant and which

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:23.145
determines light scattering.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.780
OK, this is the absorbed light.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:34.620
And we don't measure
power in watt,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.390
we measure power in the
number of absorbed photons.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:40.190
This is the natural unit here.

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:45.000
And for that, we have to divide
the expression by h bar omega.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.310
And that means now that the
number of photons absorbed

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.790
per unit time is
given by the Rabi

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:59.000
frequency and the y-component
of the Bloch vector.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.030
Well, we can ask
another question

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.485
and ask, what is the
number of emitted photons?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:15.580
Well, the number
of emitted photons

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.830
is related to the population
in the excited state.

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:21.960
We take the population
in the excited state

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.610
and multiply with gamma.

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:28.020
This is spontaneous emission
out of the excited state.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:33.060
Now, the excited state can be--
the excited state population,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.110
you have to look up
at the substitution,

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.744
but is related to
the z-component

00:15:40.744 --> 00:15:41.910
of the optical Bloch vector.

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:44.300
To remind you, the
z-component is the difference

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.650
of population between
excited and ground state.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.680
But the sum of the two is one.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.900
So therefore, this is now
the excited state population.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.740
And here is our
steady state solution.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.470
Here is our steady state
solution for the z-component.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:15.510
And by using that
now, we find that we

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:24.080
have the result with the
Lorentzian denominator.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.310
And what we have here is
gamma g square over 4.

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.830
And now, of course,
if you compare

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:40.430
that with the
solution for our y,

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.080
for the number of absorbed
photons, you find-- well,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.870
it shouldn't come
as a big surprise--

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.520
that the number of absorbed
photon in steady state

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.960
is equal to the number
of emitted photon.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.490
So this is one case, one
important part of the solution.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:13.170
And I should have shown
that to you earlier.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:16.770
When we look at the
two components, the x

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:28.520
and y-component,
the y-component is

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.135
absorbed, if it is Lorentzian.

00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:36.145
Whereas, the x-component
is dispersive.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:54.890
Just by inspection if these two
expressions, here is a delta.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:18:00.770
And the delta makes the
x-component anti-symmetric.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.050
And the y-component is symmetric
with respect to the origin.

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.470
So what we see here is
we have a Lorentzian.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:15.190
The Lorentzian has a natural
line broadening by gamma.

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.600
So the full width
at half maximum

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:21.960
is gamma, but only in
the limit of 0 drive.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.000
When we drive it, we have
an additional broadening,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.520
which is called
power broadening.

00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:35.060
So for absorption, the
full width at half maximum

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:46.090
is 2 times gamma square
over 4 plus g square over 2.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:52.560
And this last term goes by
the name power broadening

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.655
or saturation broadening.

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:05.300
Just to avoid common confusion,
if you go to very high power,

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:08.390
that least term
doesn't play a role.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:12.645
How does the line width scale
with power in power broadening?

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.409
Linear in power?

00:19:22.409 --> 00:19:23.200
Quadratic in power?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.200
Square root of power?

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.565
AUDIENCE: Square root?

00:19:25.565 --> 00:19:26.930
PROFESSOR: Square root of power.

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:27.430
Yeah.

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.617
So in that sense,
yes, power broadening

00:19:30.617 --> 00:19:32.200
only goes to the
square root of power.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.590
It's, in essence,
the Rabi frequency.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.390
If you drive the system
at the Rabi frequency,

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.580
it gets power broadened
by the Rabi frequency.

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.380
And I think that's a pre-factor
which is 2 or square root 2.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.610
But in essence, power broadening
scales with the Rabi frequency.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.770
So let us quickly
discuss the case

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:00.770
when we go to very high power,
very high Rabi frequency.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.770
At that moment, you can just see
it in the solution on the page

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:05.850
above.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.660
The z-component of the optical
Bloch vector becomes 0.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.200
That means there is no
population difference

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:20.460
between excited and
ground state anymore.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:31.840
We often describe the
limit of high power

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:36.520
by introducing a
saturation parameter, which

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.610
is defined here.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.850
Saturation is discussed
in more details in Part 1

00:20:49.850 --> 00:20:51.490
of the course.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.240
But I want to relate
it here to the solution

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.920
with the optical Bloch vector.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.300
The z-component, which
is the difference

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.060
between ground and
excited state population,

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:11.290
now has a very simple
form, 1 over 1 plus s.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.780
The population to be in
the excited state is 1/2.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.350
That's what we get
at infinite power.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:20.580
And then, if the
power is finite,

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.030
it is multiplied by
s times s plus 1.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:30.230
In the power broadened line
width is the natural line

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:34.040
width, which gives
the line width

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.900
in the limit of
low power, and then

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.660
you multiply with the
square root 1 plus s.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:55.430
So what does it mean to have
a saturation parameter of 1?

00:21:55.430 --> 00:22:00.260
Well, if you just look
how it was defined,

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.730
if you have the ground and the
excited state at a saturation

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:08.050
parameter of-- first, at
a saturation of infinite,

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.010
you have 50-50 population.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.720
And at a saturation parameter
of 1, you are 1/2 way to 50-50.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:21.080
That means you have
3/4 population here

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.660
and 1/4 population there.

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:36.260
So at this case, the number of
photons emitted per unit time,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.210
which is always given
by this formula,

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.950
becomes now gamma over 4.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.950
So at a saturation
parameter of 1,

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:48.470
the emission rate
is gamma over 4.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.600
At a saturation
parameter of infinity,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.895
the spontaneous emission
rate is gamma over 2.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:05.860
Any questions about
steady state solution?

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.412
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:06.412 --> 00:23:07.995
AUDIENCE: So what
we derived right now

00:23:07.995 --> 00:23:09.547
is a spontaneous emission rate.

00:23:09.547 --> 00:23:11.380
Does the optical Bloch
equation say anything

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:16.007
about the stimulated emission?

00:23:16.007 --> 00:23:18.442
Or is that the fact that it
just doesn't have [INAUDIBLE]?

00:23:21.364 --> 00:23:25.750
PROFESSOR: Stimulated emission
is built in the optical Bloch

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.460
equations for negligible damping
contained Rabi oscillation.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.340
And Rabi oscillation is
the stimulated emission.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.910
So this is being built in.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:41.950
However, it seems to be
a describing the drive

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:47.490
field by a classical
field by a Rabi frequency.

00:23:47.490 --> 00:23:52.550
We are not really
accounting for the number

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.920
of photons exchanged with that.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:59.280
So in a way, the
driving field is always

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.280
treated in the
undepleted approximation.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.350
It's a C number.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.980
But in the drive through
system, but of course,

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.660
you can immediately lead
from the Rabi oscillation

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.657
the exchange of excitations
between the atomic system

00:24:12.657 --> 00:24:13.490
and the drive field.

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.590
So yes, the optical Bloch
equations contains that,

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.840
but not in the photon picture.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.550
AUDIENCE: If you have
Rabi oscillations,

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.299
you can kind of guess
that, every time you

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.330
go down you
simulated the events.

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.392
In space, say, you don't
have Rabi oscillations.

00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:33.430
Can you still somehow
extract the rate?

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.530
PROFESSOR: I hope the question
we answer will become crystal

00:24:39.530 --> 00:24:41.610
when we discuss quantum
Monte Carlo simulations.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.151
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:24:42.151 --> 00:24:44.200
PROFESSOR: In quantum
Monte Carlo simulation,

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.000
we have an ensemble of atom.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.410
And the atoms all do
Rabi oscillations.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.470
But in steady state,
they do it out of phase.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:53.400
So you have atoms
in your ensemble

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.930
which, at a given time, absorb.

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:59.410
And others emit in
a stimulated way.

00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:01.430
And the effect cancels
out in steady state.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.770
Other questions?

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:06.530
Yes?

00:25:06.530 --> 00:25:08.647
AUDIENCE: So you're
saying, in steady state,

00:25:08.647 --> 00:25:09.605
they kind of de-cohere.

00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:12.970
And you don't have any net
change in those populations.

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.002
Do you still get
the triplet lines

00:25:15.002 --> 00:25:21.830
if you don't have a modulation
of your intensity beam?

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.600
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.100
Absolutely.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.269
The Mollow triplet is a
feature in steady state.

00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:28.060
And maybe let me explain
that, because it's

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.110
an interesting discussion.

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:34.160
What will happen is, in
steady state in your ensemble,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:36.280
you don't have
Rabi oscillations.

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.280
But if you would
look at one atom,

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.130
you see Rabi oscillations.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.231
It's just when you average over
all atoms in your ensemble,

00:25:45.231 --> 00:25:49.280
the phase of the Rabi
oscillation has averaged out.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.500
So in other words, for
instance, what would happen

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.000
is the following.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.710
If you take a steady
state solution

00:25:57.710 --> 00:26:05.180
and you ask, what is the dipole
moment as a function of time

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.580
in steady state, you
will find that this is 0.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.270
So you would then
ask, hey, where

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.820
is the light emitted, because
isn't the light emitted

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.720
by a time-dependent
dipole moment?

00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.040
What you really
have to do is, when

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.050
you want to study light
emission in steady state,

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.060
you can't look at
expectation values

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.100
because they're not changing
as a function of time.

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:33.810
What you have to do is you
have to look at the correlation

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.200
function.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.780
And the correlation
function sort of

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.330
tells you-- let me just use
it for Rabi oscillation.

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:45.890
If one atom is in the excited
state, a Rabi period later,

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.860
it would be again in
the excited state.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.110
So although you are
in steady state,

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.280
you have correlations because,
if you look at your ensemble

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.220
and see there is a fluctuation
where the atom is excited,

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:01.652
you will actually find
a co-related fluctuation

00:27:01.652 --> 00:27:03.620
a Rabi period later.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.920
So in steady state, when
you want to study dynamics

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.090
like the Mollow
triplet, you should not

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.350
look at the solution
for the dipole.

00:27:12.350 --> 00:27:15.730
You should look for the
solution of the correlation

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.180
of the correlation function.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.670
And I made this cryptic
remark on Wednesday

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.540
that this correlation function
follows the same differential

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.830
equation as the
expectation value.

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:32.400
Therefore, when I try to
discuss for you the line

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.820
width of the Mollow
triplet, I simply

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.130
use the matrix for
the Bloch vector

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:41.390
knowing that it is the same
matrix, the same differential

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:45.580
equation which will describe
this correlation function.

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.600
But it is important here
that, in steady state,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.890
the average values are 0,
but we have fluctuations.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.720
And it is the
fluctuations which emit

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:01.110
the light, the fluctuations
which emit the Mollow triplet.

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.410
And fluctuations are described
by quantities like this.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.500
So it's a little bit beyond what
I want to discuss in the book,

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:13.154
but atom photon indirection has
a wonderful chapter on that.

00:28:13.154 --> 00:28:13.820
Other questions?

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.570
There is another important case
of the optical Bloch equation,

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:34.300
which is the weak excitation
limit, which is simple.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:39.460
But I've already asked you to
look at it in your homework

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:39.960
assignment.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:51.590
OK, let's now come to the
third aspect of master equation

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:54.170
solutions of optical
Bloch or master equation.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:29:04.770
And these are damped
vacuum Rabi oscillations.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.460
Yes.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.630
I really like this
example in this chapter,

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:31.240
so I hope-- well, I think
we have many highlights,

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.054
but this is a
really nice example.

00:29:33.054 --> 00:29:34.720
I learned it from
Professor [? Schwan ?]

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.050
when he introduced it.

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.070
And what I like
about it is I can

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.880
use it to show you what
other Lindblad operators may

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.960
be important.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.410
So you suddenly understand,
in a bigger context,

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.350
what the master equation is.

00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:52.460
And then we continue
with an atomic cavity.

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:55.490
And the damping is no longer
by spontaneous emission.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:58.690
The damping is by photons
sneaking out of the cavity.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.770
So we really learn
something which

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:02.840
is similar to optical
Bloch equation,

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.350
but in another context.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:07.780
And often, if you see two
different realizations

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:12.430
of similar physics,
you maybe realize more

00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:14.810
what is more generic and
what is special for instance

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.480
of spontaneous emission,
so I really like that.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.310
But also, I found
that this example

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:24.010
allows me to introduce to you
the concept of the quantum Zeno

00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:26.730
effect and the concept
of atypical elimination

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:27.480
of coherences.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:30.290
So it's a wonderful
example which connects us

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:34.270
with a number of
really neat concepts.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:41.720
So with that promise,
let me remind you

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:47.100
that, in the master
equation, when we derived it,

00:30:47.100 --> 00:31:01.140
we got an exact expression
when we did second order

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.620
perturbation theory.

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.760
And the structure which came
was this double commutator

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.460
between the interaction operator
and the steady state operator.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:18.590
Just to remind you, in the
interaction picture-- first

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:20.700
in the non-interacting,
in the normal picture,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:24.270
the derivative of the density
matrix is a commutator with h.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.430
In the interaction
picture, it's a commutator

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.380
with v with the interaction.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:31.560
But when we iterate an
equation to second order,

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.330
we plot the first result
into the equation.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.310
Then we get, in second
order, this structure.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:48.850
And if I, by expanding
the commutator,

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:52.160
we obtain the
following structure.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:58.390
And that gave rise
to the Lindblad form

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:05.900
of the master equation, which
is rho dot equals a Hamiltonian

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.750
part.

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:13.000
But then we have now a
sum, v, the interaction

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.380
with the environment,
can be a sum of mu

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.740
dot b and b-- and so
an external b field

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.880
times magnetization and dipole
moment times an electric field.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.920
It can have a number of terms.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:31.270
And therefore, in general, we
have more than one Lindblad

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.150
operator.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:39.190
But the structure
is always given

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:47.030
by this commutator in
the following form.

00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:47.890
OK.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:52.180
So we have this
general derivation.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:57.060
But until now, we
have only looked

00:32:57.060 --> 00:33:04.040
at a system which
is a simple atom.

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:08.390
And the environment
was the vacuum.

00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:10.720
So this is our environment.

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:15.510
And also, the environment was
always in the vacuum state.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:16.950
So these were our assumptions.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.470
And that means that the
only Lindblad operator,

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:27.020
the only jump
operator in this sum

00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:29.725
is sigma minus for
spontaneous emission.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.860
And by inserting
this jump operator

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.280
into the Lindblad form
of the master equation,

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.270
we find the optical
Bloch equation.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:49.420
But now let's do cavity QED.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.800
And there are lots
of experiments

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:04.580
going on in the research
group of Professor Vuletic.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:08.100
And in this situation,
our system is actually not

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.290
just the atoms, it's the
atoms and a single mode

00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:14.230
of the cavity.

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.400
This is our system.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.710
And the environment
are all other modes.

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:37.880
So in other words,
the atoms interacting

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:43.920
with a single mode of the
cavity, this is our system.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:54.400
And the environment
is now accessed

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:59.220
by emitting-- the
atom is emitting.

00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:03.010
Or there are photons
leaking out of the cavity,

00:35:03.010 --> 00:35:12.970
because the cavity mirrors do
not have 100.0% reflectivity.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:16.820
I will immediately reduce
it to one Lindblad operator.

00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:24.700
But we could now say that this
system, in its full glory,

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.950
has four different
Lindblad operators which

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.050
provide dissipation,
which provide coupling

00:35:31.050 --> 00:35:32.690
to the environment.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:38.820
The first one is simply
what we had before,

00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:42.050
spontaneous emission.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:52.850
However, if we allow that
the environment is thermal,

00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:53.732
we have to multiply.

00:35:53.732 --> 00:35:55.940
Well, whenever you have
emission and you have already

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.700
population in a
mode, and thermal

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.090
is a number of thermal photons
in every mode, on average,

00:36:03.090 --> 00:36:07.200
then you have an extra bosonic
or photonic stimulation term.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.470
That's stimulated emission,
but not by the laser beam.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:15.050
It's now stimulated emission
by a thermal occupation

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:16.380
of all the other modes.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:18.510
So just assume,
for that purpose,

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.690
that you have a cavity here.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:26.000
But the cavity is now
in a black body cavity.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.690
And everything, all
modes in the vacuum,

00:36:28.690 --> 00:36:29.932
are no longer vacuum modes.

00:36:29.932 --> 00:36:31.640
They are occupied
within thermal photons.

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.230
Of course, if this
is the case, we

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.700
have also the opposite effect.

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:44.090
You can see by
unitality, namely,

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:54.080
that we can have--
oops, n should be--

00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:01.080
but that we have an
absorption process.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.640
We absorb a photon from
the thermal background.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.780
But now, we have
two more processes.

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:10.290
And this is photons
leaking out of the cavity.

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.810
When a photon leaks out of
the cavity, this leakage

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:17.720
is not coupled to the atom,
it's coupled to the mode.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:21.880
We describe the mode
by a mode operator, a.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:25.550
So now, the leakage
out with the rate,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.640
kappa, is presented by that.

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:33.070
But in the case of
thermal photons,

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:36.650
we have stimulation by
the thermal photons.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:41.100
And also, if we have
thermal photons,

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.830
photons cannot only
leak out of the cavity,

00:37:43.830 --> 00:37:47.400
they can also leak
into the cavity.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:54.196
So we have assumed here that
we have n thermal photons

00:37:54.196 --> 00:38:01.855
in each mode of the environment.

00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:08.800
So in other words, if you
want to look at, for instance,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.510
Serge Haroche does experiment
in the wonderful experiments

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:14.130
in the microwave domain.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:19.520
He has cavities at, I think,
gigahertz frequencies.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:21.760
And even at cryogenic
temperature,

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:25.310
there are occasional thermal
photons in this mode.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:27.630
But you are now
expert enough that you

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:29.430
would know how to
set up a master

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.030
equation for that situation.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:35.230
But I want to discuss
simple limiting cases.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.620
So I think you are
glad to hear that we

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.230
are choosing 0 thermal photons.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:48.190
So therefore, we assume we
have a cavity in vacuum.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:54.370
And therefore, we only need the
Lindblad operators, L1 and L2.

00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:08.430
And we want to describe the
system which has only one

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.565
x, which has, maximally,
one excitation.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:19.930
We try to keep the
density matrix small,

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:24.380
so we only want to
consider three states.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:27.070
So when I said there
is one excitation,

00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:29.240
it is, of course,
the state which

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.950
has no photon in
the excited state.

00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:38.070
The state two is we have the
ground state and one photon.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:42.560
And those two states are
coupled by the cavity.

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:46.330
And since I really want to
discuss the simplest case which

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.700
already illustrates all
the concepts I want to do

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:54.300
is they are coupled by the
vacuum Rabi oscillation.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:56.590
And we have discussed
vacuum Rabi oscillation

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.200
in part one of the course.

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.340
But it's very simple.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.830
It's just two levels coupled.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.470
It's a 2 by 2 matrix,
so this is something

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:05.140
you are familiar with.

00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:15.300
But now, the master equation,
the Lindblad operator

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:18.970
bring in the third
level, which is

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:20.550
the ground state
without photons.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.710
And this can happen in two ways.

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:29.360
One is spontaneous emission.

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:32.110
The excited state emits,
but not into the cavity.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:33.990
It emits to the side.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.040
So spontaneous
emission can take us

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:41.630
down here, or when the
excitation is in the cavity.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:44.760
We have one photon
in the cavity,

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.490
this photon can leak out.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.390
And the rate that is kappa.

00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:59.650
And since we have talked
about spontaneous emission

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:04.990
so much with the
optical Bloch equation,

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:09.530
we want to discuss now the case
where gamma can be neglected.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:11.530
And we want to
understand what happens

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:14.060
when the only
dissipation of the system

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.595
comes by photons leaking
out of the cavity.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.900
Any questions about the
system and the motivation?

00:41:29.130 --> 00:41:32.670
So our system is now
an atom with a cavity.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.920
The environment is a vacuum.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.860
But the process of
dissipation relaxation

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.980
is no longer
spontaneous emission,

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.910
it is the photon leaking
out of the cavity.

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:47.770
And this realizes
different physics.

00:41:47.770 --> 00:41:51.510
And I hope, by experiencing
these different physics,

00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:54.450
you have sort of a nicer
picture what is dissipation

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.070
in an open system
and what is similar,

00:41:57.070 --> 00:41:59.363
but what is also different
or spontaneous emission.

00:41:59.363 --> 00:41:59.862
[? Koren? ?]

00:41:59.862 --> 00:42:04.500
AUDIENCE: If you're considering
only kappa, isn't there

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.060
an equivalent process of
order kappa that takes you

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.732
to ground of two
photons in the cavity?

00:42:09.732 --> 00:42:11.790
Don't you have to consider
that state as well?

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:25.074
That term would be of
order kappa as well.

00:42:25.074 --> 00:42:26.140
PROFESSOR: So great.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:32.100
The question is I
restrict the Hilbert

00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:35.370
space to maximally
one excitation.

00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.910
So this is how we start out
with our differential equation.

00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:40.610
AUDIENCE: Oh, this
isn't in a thermal bath?

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.230
I thought we were
assuming we had a--

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.290
PROFESSOR: Oh, sorry.

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:47.910
I first made
everything complicated.

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:49.830
But then I said, now,
let's make it simple.

00:42:49.830 --> 00:42:51.930
We assumed the
thermal bath is 0.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.080
So we reduced--

00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.500
In a way, yes, I told you here
are four Lindblad operators,

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.690
and you can describe
everything you want.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.800
But then I said, hey,
two of them become 0,

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.780
because we eliminate
the thermal bath.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.810
And now I make the approximation
that spontaneous emission

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:08.870
is negligible.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.540
And now we are back
to the situation

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.910
which is nice for
classroom discussion.

00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:15.140
We've only one
term left, and this

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.930
is the leaking of the
photon out of the cavity.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.780
So I will show to
you what happens.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:23.305
But ultimately, when we make
the cavity better and better

00:43:23.305 --> 00:43:27.120
and kappa smaller and smaller,
I will say, wait a moment.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.281
We now have to check that
our solution is still

00:43:29.281 --> 00:43:31.780
consistent with our assumption
that spontaneous emission can

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:33.197
be neglected.

00:43:33.197 --> 00:43:34.780
So that's sort of
what you want to do.

00:43:43.195 --> 00:43:43.695
Yes.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:54.870
Let's just get two more pages.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:03.640
OK.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.430
So what we want to
do is we want to look

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.030
for the dynamics of the system.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.580
We start out in state one.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:17.780
So we inject one excited
atom into the cavity.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.500
And what we want
to learn now is--

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:25.750
and it has a lot of
interesting physics in it--

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:37.065
what will happen as a function
of this new dissipation, kappa.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.980
Well, qualitatively, it
should be pretty clear.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:51.040
If kappa is 0, we have
vacuum Rabi oscillation

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.740
between state one and state two.

00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.380
If you then put a little
bit kappa into the system,

00:44:56.380 --> 00:45:00.380
you have a Rabi oscillation,
but they are getting damped.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:04.270
And like in any oscillator,
if you crank up the damping,

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:05.660
you go into an
overdamped regime.

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:12.410
And this is exactly what
the equations give us,

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:22.480
Rabi oscillation, damped
Rabi oscillation, and then

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:23.280
overdamped regime.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.120
And actually, the most
interesting regime for us

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.370
will be the overdamped regime.

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:32.950
That's something we
haven't encountered.

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:43.240
But let me just, before
we go there, write down

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:47.090
the master equation for you.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:58.100
So without the photon
leaking out of the cavity,

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:02.850
we have the following terms.

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.730
Without the photon leaking
out of the cavity, of course,

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:08.070
state three is not involved.

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:11.890
We simply have Rabi oscillation
between state one and state

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.990
two.

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:18.880
And this is actually also like
the optical Bloch equation.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.440
Without damping, it's simply
the Jaynes-Cummings model.

00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:37.750
Minus, that's this.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:44.120
And for the coherences,
we get omega 0

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:49.590
rho 1, 1 minus rho 2, 2.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.300
But now, we put in
the terms with kappa.

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.260
The state, which is
the state two, which

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:00.850
is the ground state
with the photon,

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.790
has now a damping term, because
the photon can leak out.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:12.150
We get, of course, an
equation for the ground

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:15.150
state, the population,
the photon leaks out.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:21.630
And we populate state three.

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:27.650
And the damping also
affects the coherences.

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:33.640
And the form of the master
equation, the Lindblad form,

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:37.660
gives us the following
damping term.

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:48.610
So there are two
new concepts which

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:50.960
I promised you to introduce.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:48:05.315
One is the idiopathic
elimination of coherences.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:21.745
And the second one is
the quantum Zeno effect.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.430
So first of all, if you look
at the differential equation,

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.710
and when kappa is small,
in particular, kappa

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:39.270
is smaller than 2 times
the vacuum Rabi frequency,

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:48.280
then the population to be in the
excited state, which is rho 2,

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.420
2, undergoes Rabi oscillation.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:56.810
And those Rabi oscillations,
this population

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:59.710
is damped by e to
the minus kappa t.

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:07.845
So what I want to discuss
now is the overdamped case.

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:18.350
And actually, before
I derive it for you,

00:49:18.350 --> 00:49:20.940
I wanted to ask you
some clicker question.

00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:24.290
I'm afraid I put the books
out, but somebody put it away.

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:27.370
So nobody took clickers?

00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:32.170
So why don't we just
pass them around?

00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.925
And I can already
formulate the question.

00:49:46.070 --> 00:49:59.080
I think you know by now
that I have a preference

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:02.260
to maybe ask you questions about
really simple quantum physics.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.060
Quantum physics is sadly
enough that nobody fully

00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:07.030
understands it.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.630
And we want to improve on that.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:36.110
So I want to test your intuition
by looking at the situation.

00:50:36.110 --> 00:50:38.320
We have an excited
state without photon.

00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:43.020
We have a ground state.

00:50:43.020 --> 00:50:47.410
So I want to test your
intuition in the following way.

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:51.525
We have Rabi oscillations
between two levels.

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.420
The case in the cavity is, it is
Rabi oscillation between state

00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.320
two and state one,
but it doesn't matter.

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:07.630
You can also assume that
it is Rabi oscillation

00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:09.910
between hyperfine levels.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:13.740
And the Rabi oscillation
is driven by an RF field.

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.690
And the one thing
we introduce now

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:21.820
is we introduce damping
kappa to this level.

00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:25.420
But we start out
the system with all

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.030
of the population in this state.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:36.436
And in the overdamped case, when
kappa is sufficiently strong,

00:51:36.436 --> 00:51:38.310
then we know an oscillator
will be overdamped

00:51:38.310 --> 00:51:41.406
and will no longer oscillate.

00:51:41.406 --> 00:51:47.510
And in this situation,
the probability

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:51.435
to be in the initial
state will decay.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:52:03.020
e to the minus kap-- e to the
minus-- how should we call it?

00:52:03.020 --> 00:52:04.430
gamma t.

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:09.630
So it decays with
the decay rate kappa.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:18.490
And my question for you is,
A, B and C, whether the decay

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:26.770
rate, kappa, is proportional
to the damping rate, gamma?

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:30.310
Proportional to the
inverse of gamma?

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.440
Or independent of gamma?

00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:41.030
So we've exacted this system.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:44.390
The system has possibility
of Rabi oscillation.

00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:46.380
I showed you the
damped Rabi oscillation

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:48.940
and in the limit of small kappa.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.380
But now you go to the
overdamped regime.

00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:55.040
And my question is, if
the system is overdamped,

00:52:55.040 --> 00:53:01.580
will this decay rate
increase with kappa?

00:53:01.580 --> 00:53:02.710
Decrease with kappa?

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:04.615
Or will it be independent
of a damped regime?

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:36.305
All right.

00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:43.250
OK.

00:53:43.250 --> 00:53:45.870
There's a clear neutrality.

00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:50.770
Let me not yet
discuss the answer.

00:53:50.770 --> 00:53:54.700
Let me maybe try to give
you another problem.

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.460
And you should maybe figure
out if those two problems

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.290
are related.

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.680
I want to ask you now
something simpler.

00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.800
There are not three
levels involved,

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:09.750
there are two levels involved.

00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:14.020
But one of the level
is broadened by kappa.

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.770
Call it an unstable state.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:21.510
Because it can decay with
the rate, kappa, and we

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:24.600
often show something
which is broadened.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:31.750
And now we have a matrix element
between the discrete level

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:35.430
and the broadened state,
which I call omega.

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.940
It's a matrix element
or Rabi frequency.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.620
And now you should
figure out what

00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:43.630
is the physical
picture which describes

00:54:43.630 --> 00:54:49.580
the coupling of a discrete
initial state to something

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.980
which is broadened.

00:54:51.980 --> 00:55:03.060
It's now the transition rate
from the original state.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:08.280
Does the original state decay
with a collectivistic rate,

00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:16.235
which is omega?

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:30.720
Or is it omega
squared over kappa?

00:55:33.650 --> 00:55:37.010
Or is it none of the above?

00:55:44.210 --> 00:55:49.370
So coupling between two
levels, very, very simple.

00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:50.565
But one level is broadened.

00:56:10.791 --> 00:56:11.290
OK.

00:56:16.110 --> 00:56:20.450
Yes, it's Fermi's Golden
Rule, what I'm asking you.

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.440
This is nothing else
than Fermi's Golden Rule.

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:28.890
We couple from one level into
some continuum of states.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:33.200
If I take one state and
smear it out over a width,

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:37.880
kappa, the density of states,
the density of modes which

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:41.340
appears in Fermi's Golden
Rule, is 1 over kappa.

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:45.010
And Fermi's Golden Rule
tells us that the coupling

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:50.380
is the matrix element squared
times the density of states,

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.470
which is 1 over kappa.

00:56:56.930 --> 00:57:02.970
So this is nothing else
than Fermi's Golden Rule.

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.240
OK.

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.160
Why don't we come back
to the first question

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.240
now where we have two
discrete levels, maybe

00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.450
two hyperfine states, which are
coupled by a Rabi frequency?

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.390
But then one of the
hyperfine states

00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:28.740
decays because there is
some leakage, or we--

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:31.890
I don't know-- we interrogate
this state with laser

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:32.780
beams or such.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:34.380
We make it unstable.

00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:38.700
We allow this state to
decay to another state.

00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:44.120
And the question is, if we
make the decay of that level

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:50.110
stronger and stronger, does
the decay of the initial state

00:57:50.110 --> 00:57:50.960
increase?

00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:51.510
Decrease?

00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:52.512
Or is of that?

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.990
Good.

00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:03.820
So what you have learned here
is that, actually, the more we

00:58:03.820 --> 00:58:08.070
damp the system on this
side, the longer-lived

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:11.260
is the initial state.

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:12.280
But it's trivial.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.610
It's just Fermi's Golden Rule.

00:58:13.610 --> 00:58:16.760
When you couple into a
level which is broadened,

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:19.784
the coupling becomes weaker and
weaker because, well, that's

00:58:19.784 --> 00:58:21.200
what Fermi's Golden
Rule tells us.

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:28.010
I want to now derive this
situation for you for our atom

00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:30.240
in the cavity.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.950
And I will say that this is one
example for the quantum Zeno

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:35.180
effect.

00:58:35.180 --> 00:58:36.860
But let me already
explain to you

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.260
what the quantum Zeno effect is.

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:41.490
Zeno is a Greek philosopher.

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:46.620
And the Greek philosophers
had some deep thoughts

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:49.910
about the nature of time,
the nature of motion.

00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:52.220
And I think, in the
Greek philosophy-- sorry.

00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:59.635
I didn't go-- I mean, I don't
have a strong background

00:58:59.635 --> 00:59:01.780
in philosophy, but
I think the idea

00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:05.640
is that motion is when
something moves around.

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:07.550
But it takes some time to move.

00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:10.180
So if you observe
it, it can't move,

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:13.514
because every time you observe
it, you localize something.

00:59:13.514 --> 00:59:14.180
That's the idea.

00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:17.610
If you see an arrow, the moment
you observe it, it's localized.

00:59:17.610 --> 00:59:21.170
And if you localize something
to often, it cannot move.

00:59:21.170 --> 00:59:23.590
And this is sort of
what you can say here.

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.700
The system wants to
evolve to a second state.

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:30.010
But kappa can actually
be a measurement process.

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:32.640
We can just shine a
strong laser on this state

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.360
and figure out has
something arrived here.

00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:41.340
And the more often we look, the
stronger our measurement is,

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:44.340
the less the system can evolve.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:47.970
So a measurement of what
arrives in this state

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:51.570
slows down the
dynamics to that state.

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:53.720
And this is called the
quantum Zeno effect.

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:56.450
It also goes by the name
of quantum Zeno paradox.

00:59:56.450 --> 01:00:00.680
But it's just quantum
mechanics, it's not a paradox.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:03.930
In the popular world, it
is sometimes paraphrased

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:09.470
as if you observe the tea
kettle, the water never boils.

01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:13.220
But you see now
where it comes from.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.200
OK, so this is the
quantum Zeno effect.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.470
And we want to now, by
looking at the master

01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:20.990
equation for an
atom in a cavity,

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:22.910
I want to show you the
limit that it really

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:25.640
comes out of the
master equation.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:26.850
Questions about that?

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:49.720
OK, so this is the
quantum Zeno effect.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:56.680
And well, one of the nicest
papers on the quantum Zeno

01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:00.820
effect-- well, I'm biased here--
but it was written by my group,

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:04.240
because we used the
Bose-Einstein condensate.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.450
We had an RF coupling to
another hyperfine state.

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:15.840
And then we used a laser beam
and observed the population

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.050
in the final state.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:21.070
And we saw that the
effect of the RF drive

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:23.820
became weaker and
weaker and weaker,

01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:28.278
the stronger we made the
measurement in the final state.

01:01:28.278 --> 01:01:32.860
And this is the reference.

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:37.160
And our work was the first
quantitative comparison.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.780
You can now do a
measurement by just

01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:42.530
using a strong laser in,
maybe, every millisecond or so.

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:45.570
Or you can use a weaker
laser beam continuously.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:50.010
So we showed in this work
that the quantum Zeno effect

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:53.910
is the same, whether you do
a pulsed observation, which

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.600
is a strong measurement, or
continuous weak measurement.

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:01.680
OK.

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.660
But let's now, after
this short interlude,

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.610
go back to the master equation.

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:19.550
So our job is now to
solve this master equation

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.240
for the limit of strong damping.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.860
And what we will
find, actually, is

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:27.180
we will find both the quantum
Zeno effect and another tidbit.

01:02:27.180 --> 01:02:29.700
We will also find
the Purcell effect,

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.570
which is enhanced spontaneous
emission to a cavity.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:41.570
Now the way how we solve
this master equation

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:48.450
in this limiting
case is by the method

01:02:48.450 --> 01:02:52.430
of idiopathic elimination
of coherences.

01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:56.110
And let me explain it to
you with that equation.

01:02:56.110 --> 01:03:01.120
What we have here is the
derivative of the coherences.

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.240
And when you look at
the right-hand side,

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:07.550
the derivative of the coherences
is kappa, a damping terms,

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.550
times the coherence.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.820
Well, if you have
an equation which

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:16.890
says a dot equals minus
strong damping times a,

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:19.575
you have a very rapid
exponential damping.

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:27.680
The system immediately
gets into an equilibrium.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:31.360
And the equilibrium is
given by the first term.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.990
So if you have a situation that
the population do not rapidly

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:42.710
change, then this
equation can be

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:47.820
written that we have
a very rapid damping.

01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:51.640
And ultimately, the
coherences settle

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:55.070
to an quasi-equilibrium
value in a time 1

01:03:55.070 --> 01:03:59.300
over kappa, which is
given by the first term.

01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:02.010
In other words, you
set the time derivative

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.110
of the left-hand side, 0.

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:07.680
And then the coherences
are expressed

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:10.800
in terms of the slowly
changing quantity, which

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:14.010
are the populations.

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:15.260
So let me repeat.

01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.760
If coherences are
rapidly damped,

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:23.280
we can neglect the
time derivative

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.070
of the left-hand side.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.550
And at any given
moment, the coherences

01:04:28.550 --> 01:04:32.910
will be given by an expression
which involves the population.

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:36.700
And if the populations
slowly change,

01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:40.110
the coherences
will slowly change.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:43.160
Or in other words,
the coherences

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.860
follow the population.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:48.550
And the lag time is,
at most, 1 over kappa.

01:04:48.550 --> 01:04:51.530
And we are in the
limit of strong kappa.

01:04:51.530 --> 01:04:54.950
This principle of
eliminating coherences and we

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:57.910
simply get a master
equation for population

01:04:57.910 --> 01:05:01.700
is called the idiopathic
elimination of coherences.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.760
It's also called by Eric
Hargan in his famous work

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:09.010
about synergy by the principle
that, if you have rapidly

01:05:09.010 --> 01:05:13.140
damped modes, they are
slaved by the slow modes.

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:16.280
In other words, the rapidly
damped degrees of freedom

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.890
follow the slow
degrees of freedom.

01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:22.090
And this is what I just said,
that the instantaneous value

01:05:22.090 --> 01:05:24.815
of the coherences is always
given by the population.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:30.620
So let me just write that down
and see where it takes us.

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:41.640
So we have the
situation that we want

01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:43.940
to now look at the
case of strong damping.

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:48.510
This is the overdamped case.

01:05:51.260 --> 01:06:05.680
And we use now the method
of idiopathic elimination

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:13.820
of coherences, because
they are rapidly damped.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.390
And there is a
wonderful discussion

01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:27.180
about this method in
Atom-Photon interaction.

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:35.800
It's the Exercise
18 on page 601.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:38.910
So mathematically,
what we assume

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:48.030
is that the population
vary slowly.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.305
For instance, they vary
at the Rabi frequency.

01:06:54.590 --> 01:07:04.410
So therefore, we can say that
over the rapid time evolution

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:15.160
of the coherences-- rho
1, 2 plus rho 2, 1--

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:18.860
so this is the rapid time
evolution of the coherences.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:27.740
But for times which are on
the order of 1 over kappa,

01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:29.300
the population are not changing.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.660
The population change over
the much longer time scale,

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.610
which is the period of
the Rabi oscillation.

01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:40.140
So therefore, for
the short time scale,

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.570
I can sort of pretend that
this term is constant.

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:50.200
And for obvious reasons, let
me now call this constant term,

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:58.220
or slowly varying term, it is,
at least for short time scales,

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:00.280
the equilibrium value.

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:02.180
So the way how we
should read it is

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.740
that the coherences
will very, very rapidly

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:08.140
damp to this equilibrium value.

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:15.240
And this equilibrium
value was given

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.769
by the population,
which may slowly change.

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:35.680
But that means, now, by
eliminating coherences,

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:40.930
we obtain a rate equation
for the populations only.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:54.100
So therefore, if you
neglect short transients

01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:58.760
over the short
time 1 over kappa,

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:01.649
the coherences are
always given by

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:04.939
this quasi-equilibrium
value, which

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:07.319
is expressed by the population.

01:09:07.319 --> 01:09:10.850
And therefore, we can go to
our master equation, which

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:14.120
was a master equation
for the of diagram matrix

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.990
elements of the density
matrix, and we can now

01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:20.729
replace the coherences
by an expression which

01:09:20.729 --> 01:09:22.390
involves only population.

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:27.149
So we get now closed equations
for only the population.

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:29.729
I'm sort of emphasizing that
because you may have asked

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:33.219
yourself, when you have the
rate equation a la Einstein,

01:09:33.219 --> 01:09:36.009
with the a and b
coefficient, these are just

01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:38.590
rate equation for populations.

01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:41.609
But here, in our class, we've
always talked about the density

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:44.270
matrix, how important
the coherences are.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:45.979
The coherences are important.

01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:50.689
Without coherences, you would
never absorb or emit light.

01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:54.340
But if the coherences can
be expressed by populations,

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.340
you don't need a differential
equation for them.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.020
OK.

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:09.090
So with that now, we
have our master equation

01:10:09.090 --> 01:10:11.680
for the population.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:22.230
And by just inserting
that, we find this.

01:10:22.230 --> 01:10:30.520
And we were interested
in the decay of rho 1, 1.

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:33.400
Or this is also the population
of the atom in the excited

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.110
state.

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.990
If we initially start
where rho 1, 1 is large,

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:42.260
we're interested in
the initial decay,

01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:47.560
then the population in
the ground state is small.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:52.090
And we find, indeed, that
there is exponential decay

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:54.970
of the initial distribution.

01:10:54.970 --> 01:11:00.940
And the decay rate,
gamma z, gamma cavity,

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:02.435
is given by this expression.

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.796
So therefore, what we
find is-- but you know it

01:11:08.796 --> 01:11:13.910
by now-- the effect that the
stronger we damp the cavity,

01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:17.850
the smaller, the weaker, is
the decay of the initial state.

01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:28.940
And I've already
explained to you

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:33.690
that one picture to explain
that is that we have the excited

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:37.780
state, we have the ground state.

01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:42.640
The ground state
gets damped by kappa.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:48.350
And therefore, the
time evolution,

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:51.360
which is given by the vacuum
Rabi oscillation, slows down.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.280
OK.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.100
Yes.

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:05.683
Any questions?

01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:18.010
So we have now resolved
for gamma cavity.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:21.980
We have a result
how the atom decays

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:23.480
in the presence of the cavity.

01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:30.840
And I want to rewrite this
for you in a very nice way.

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.230
Namely, I want to show
you the famous result

01:12:34.230 --> 01:12:38.070
that, when an atom
emits in a cavity,

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:43.140
that the atom can decay faster
than the spontaneous decay.

01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:45.440
Because if the cavity
has a resonance,

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:49.230
the cavity changes the
vacuum around the atom.

01:12:49.230 --> 01:12:51.450
It increases the
density of modes.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.160
And therefore, there
is a stimulation

01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.120
of the atom into the cavity.

01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:58.450
So I don't have to
do any other math

01:12:58.450 --> 01:13:03.550
than just rewriting our result
of gamma cavity in other units,

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:04.470
in other ways.

01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:08.419
And then we can compare it to
the natural decay of an atom

01:13:08.419 --> 01:13:09.210
without the cavity.

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:14.600
So what we want to
do now is we want

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:25.300
to take the cavity-induced
decay of the excited state,

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:33.170
and we want to compare with
the natural decay rate, gamma.

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:38.350
So I just have to rewrite
things in a few units.

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:43.250
The cavity-induced decay is
the vacuum Rabi oscillation

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.025
squared over kappa.

01:13:49.450 --> 01:13:57.350
So let me remind you that
the Rabi frequency is always

01:13:57.350 --> 01:14:01.320
given by an dipole moment
times electric field.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.710
It's a matrix element.

01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:05.770
Well, there's one of
those factors of 2.

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:08.680
And H bar keeps
the units correct.

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:13.030
And in the case of the
vacuum Rabi oscillation,

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:18.660
the electric field is the
electric field, so to speak,

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:24.230
of one photon in
the cavity volume.

01:14:24.230 --> 01:14:27.460
And there is a factor
of 2, so this is now

01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:30.600
the volume of the cavity.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:44.555
So therefore, the
vacuum Rabi frequency

01:14:44.555 --> 01:14:54.330
is a dipole moment
times 2 atomic resonance

01:14:54.330 --> 01:14:58.570
frequency epsilon 0 h bar v.

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:02.250
And that means now-- and
this is a nice result--

01:15:02.250 --> 01:15:09.540
that the cavity-induced decay
is omega 0 square over kappa.

01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:13.870
And I just use the above
result for omega 0.

01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:19.260
And for kappa, I
introduce the Q factor

01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:22.900
of the cavity, which is
the number of oscillations

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.130
before it is damped.

01:15:24.130 --> 01:15:26.310
It's omega over kappa.

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:31.200
And with that, I can rewrite
the cavity-induced decay

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:38.300
as 2d squared epsilon
null H bar v times Q.

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:41.620
And if you remember, from
part 1 of the course,

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.420
or standard textbook result,
that spontaneous decay is

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:59.923
a dipole moment squared times
frequency to the power 3,

01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:06.680
then we obtain
the famous result,

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:13.220
which is called the
Purcell factor, namely

01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:17.410
that the decay in
the cavity, compared

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:22.570
to the decay in free space,
is proportional to the Q

01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:23.295
of the cavity.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.550
There is a numerical prefector.

01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:33.080
But then, what enters
is the wavelength

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.240
of the photon cubed
over the volume.

01:16:42.670 --> 01:16:47.290
So the case of eta
larger than 1--

01:16:47.290 --> 01:16:51.010
and it's actually interesting
that this result is completely

01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:52.645
independent of
atomic properties.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.810
So in other words, every
atom you put in a cavity,

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:03.340
no matter what its
dipole moment is,

01:17:03.340 --> 01:17:11.360
it will decay with a rate
which is Q times larger.

01:17:14.387 --> 01:17:15.970
There are many ways
how to look at it.

01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:19.720
You can say, if the cavity
consists of two mirrors,

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:24.960
you create Q mirror
images of your atom.

01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.390
And you have sort
of an atom which

01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:28.280
has a Q times stronger
dipole moment.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.570
And therefore, because the
mirror images also radiate,

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:33.710
and therefore you get
a Q times faster decay.

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:36.990
So this limit makes sense in
many, many different pictures.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:39.720
And it's a general result
that, if an atom emits

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:43.050
in a cavity with finesse
Q, you get a Q times

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:46.780
enhancement of
spontaneous decay.

01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:55.680
So this is called
cavity-enhanced spontaneous

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.680
emission.

01:17:57.680 --> 01:18:04.420
It goes back to Purcell in 1946.

01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:11.850
And you can see the
whole field of cavity QED

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:16.730
depends on this effect, that you
can enhance spontaneous decay.

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:19.580
Or it's the opposite.

01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.430
If an atom has a
resonance frequency

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.450
between two modes of the
cavity, the spontaneous decay

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.930
is inhibited.

01:18:26.930 --> 01:18:29.710
And this is sort of what
is exploited in cavity QED.

01:18:32.770 --> 01:18:37.800
Let me just conclude
here by saying

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.656
that our assumptions
have to be consistent.

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:49.160
In our derivation,
we neglected gamma.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:51.780
When I said the two
Lindblad operators,

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:53.910
we only look at the
leakage out of the photon.

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:57.750
We neglect spontaneous decay.

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:02.120
So of course, this requires
that eta is larger 1.

01:19:02.120 --> 01:19:09.390
So this is the consistent range
of validity of our result.

01:19:09.390 --> 01:19:16.410
Secondly, we discussed
the limit of overdamping,

01:19:16.410 --> 01:19:20.420
which requires that kappa has to
be larger than the vacuum Rabi

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:21.900
frequency.

01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:32.090
And therefore, the above
result is valued for large Q.

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:34.770
Q has to be sufficiently large,
but cannot be larger than this

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:35.270
value.

01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:41.330
Any questions?

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:44.805
Nancy?

01:19:44.805 --> 01:19:49.170
AUDIENCE: For kappa, is that
the loss in the cavity--

01:19:49.170 --> 01:19:51.595
is there any difference
between the loss and the cavity

01:19:51.595 --> 01:19:53.050
because it's a cavity?

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:57.415
Or the loss is into other
modes of the cavity?

01:19:57.415 --> 01:19:59.810
PROFESSOR: Kappa is the loss.

01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:03.745
You can say kappa is the rate
at which a photon in the cavity

01:20:03.745 --> 01:20:04.430
is lost.

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:06.269
AUDIENCE: Is lost from
the cavity totally?

01:20:06.269 --> 01:20:09.213
Or is lost into another
mode inside the cavity?

01:20:09.213 --> 01:20:10.213
Is there any difference?

01:20:10.213 --> 01:20:15.143
Is v here just one
mode inside the cavity.

01:20:15.143 --> 01:20:18.290
PROFESSOR: Well, we
have not an element--

01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:22.390
OK, if the mirror
has imperfections,

01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:25.850
we usually think of light
leaking out of the mirror.

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:28.780
If the mirror is absorbing
because the coating has

01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:31.440
a tiny little bit
of absorption, you

01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.530
know, from the beam
splitter analogy,

01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:36.830
that a small absorption
is equivalent here

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:39.740
to a small transmission factor.

01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:43.200
Usually, we don't consider
that the light transforms

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.030
from one mode of the
cavity to the other.

01:20:45.030 --> 01:20:47.350
It's either absorbed
or leaking out.

01:20:47.350 --> 01:20:50.460
But if you assume that the
mirrors are not super polished

01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:52.440
and they scatter
light a little bit,

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.940
then you would have a mechanism
that the light in the cavity

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:56.330
scatters into other modes.

01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:58.780
And all those losses
are summarized

01:20:58.780 --> 01:21:00.730
in one coupling constant, kappa.

01:21:04.690 --> 01:21:08.860
Let me finish the class
today and this week

01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:14.050
by showing to you the recent
nature paper by the Innsbrook

01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:14.960
group.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:17.860
We've talked so much
about Lindblad operators.

01:21:17.860 --> 01:21:22.430
And the Lindblad
operators, the dissipation,

01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:25.230
tells us what is the
effect of the environment.

01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:28.210
And usually, you would say,
well, if you have an atom,

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:30.270
and it interacts
with the environment,

01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:33.110
what is the equilibrium state?

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:35.060
Well, if you just
have the vacuum,

01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:36.710
the atom goes to
the ground state.

01:21:36.710 --> 01:21:39.090
And the ground state
is the attractor,

01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:41.050
the stable state of the system.

01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:43.960
If you drive the system
with one laser beam,

01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:46.970
the attractor state where
the system goes into

01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:50.560
is the steady state solution
of the optical Bloch equation.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.700
That all sounds a
little bit boring.

01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:56.190
But in this paper, based on
this theoretical suggestion

01:21:56.190 --> 01:21:59.020
of Peter Zola and an
experimental realization

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.930
with trapped ions at
Innsbrook, they actually

01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:08.120
engineered an environment,
engineered Lindblad operators

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.770
in such a way that
the system of two ions

01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:15.930
was relaxing into a Bell state.

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:18.290
So you engineer
now the environment

01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:23.020
that therm-- I wanted to say
thermal equilibrium, no--

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:26.740
the equilibrium state with the
environment, the dissipation,

01:22:26.740 --> 01:22:29.640
leads to a Bell state.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:32.740
Well, it's a little bit
complicated how it is done,

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:39.340
but I just want to just look at
a few highlighted key messages.

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:44.120
So the idea is, here,
engineering of dissipation,

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:47.170
creating experimentally
dissipative operators.

01:22:47.170 --> 01:22:50.530
We usually manipulate quantum
system with Hamilton operators.

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:55.850
But here, it is manipulated
not by the H operator,

01:22:55.850 --> 01:22:58.670
but by the L operator.

01:22:58.670 --> 01:23:04.810
And so the idea here is to have
an evolution of the density

01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:07.900
matrix, a linear mapping that
the density matrix evolves

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.820
in a certain way.

01:23:10.820 --> 01:23:12.850
I think you'll
recognize partial trace.

01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:16.400
You'll recognize
a few equations,

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.840
a few results which
we have discussed.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.650
And what you see here is
exactly the Lindblad form.

01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:26.540
And what they did is, by
using a number of laser

01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:33.090
beams in quantum operation,
they designed operators, z,

01:23:33.090 --> 01:23:36.300
jump operators, Lindblad
operators, in such a way

01:23:36.300 --> 01:23:42.080
that the system was damping
out into a Bell state.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:46.730
So that seems a new
frontier for research.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:50.160
It goes by the title that we
can do quantum simulations,

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.880
using trapped ions and
cold atoms of Hamiltonians.

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.200
But we can also quantum simulate
very special environments.

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.560
Maybe environments
which it would

01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:03.190
be hard to find them
in nature, but they

01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:07.260
are quantum-mechanically
allowed possible environments.

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:09.040
And they may have
new features which

01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.290
have not been explored so far.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.780
I will add this
paper to the website,

01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:17.930
if you want to
read more about it.

01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:20.330
Any question?

01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:21.150
Then a reminder.

01:24:21.150 --> 01:24:23.260
No class next week.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:25.210
Monday is Patriot's Day.

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:27.850
I'm out of town on
Wednesday, but you

01:24:27.850 --> 01:24:30.330
have a homework to solve.

01:24:30.330 --> 01:24:33.510
I rather feel you should
continue to have a homework

01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:35.400
assignment every
week, because then you

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.350
have more time at the end of
the term for the term paper.

01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:40.100
I always have 10
homework assignments.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:43.045
So when we spread
them out more, there

01:24:43.045 --> 01:24:45.420
is less time left at the end
of the semester for the term

01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:46.190
paper.

01:24:46.190 --> 01:24:49.290
So I decided, since we have
covered enough material,

01:24:49.290 --> 01:24:53.750
we have a wonderful homework
assignment for next week.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.290
PROFESSOR: Now today's
lecture.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.570
First I want to talk a little
bit about what computer

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.720
scientists do.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.960
This whole course has been
about computer science.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.980
And I hope that at least for
many of you, it might have

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.610
persuaded you that there's an
interesting career out there

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.090
for you as a computer
scientist.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.370
And then I'll finish up with an
overview of what I think we

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.280
covered this term.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.260
So what do computer
scientists do?

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.170
Well, they look a lot like
that as you all know.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.680
In fact, it's amazing.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.360
There's almost nothing that
computer scientists don't do.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.350
So here I've just collected a
few of the different pictures

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.820
related to what computer
scientists in EECS are doing

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.760
these days, things like working
on the software that

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.990
keeps airplanes from falling
out of the skies.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.020
Quite a few people working in
the movie industry these days

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.180
doing animations in 3D and
that sort of thing.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.610
These days, computer scientists
don't get paid as

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.250
much as the actors.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.990
But they get paid a lot
to produce movies.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.150
Robots, of course.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.680
A lot of medical work,
particularly medical imaging.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.930
This is a picture where someone
has written software

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.520
to try and identify the tumors
in the human brain, and then

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.450
will draw little lines telling
the surgeon where to cut so as

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.450
to do the least damage
and the most good.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.090
A lot of work in genetics.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.640
And of course, core things
like making the internet

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.270
actually not crash.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.040
Fundamentally, what computer
scientists do is they think

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.980
computationally.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.240
And I hope that you've
understood that that's been

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.260
the theme of 6.00, is how to
formulate problems and think

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.300
computationally.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.650
This will be, I think, the most
important skill used by

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.740
certainly scientists and
engineers but, in fact,

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:38.330
everybody by the middle of the
21st century or sooner.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.090
People will just do everything
computationally.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.000
And just as once upon a time
maybe it's still important

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.100
everyone learn to read and
write and do a little

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.740
arithmetic, people will think
that computation is exactly as

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.570
important and that you'll have
to know how to formulate

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.010
problems computationally
to survive in society.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.470
The process, and this is what
we've been doing all term, is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.150
not an easy one.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.840
But it's not an impossible
one either.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.050
We begin by identifying and
inventing useful abstractions.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.430
Everything we do is an
abstraction of reality.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.250
And as we've gone through the
second half of the term,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.300
almost every interesting
computation we've designed

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.470
starts with inventing classes
that give us useful data

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.200
abstraction or functions that
compute useful things.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.170
And that's sort of what
we start with.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.130
We start with some existing set
of abstractions, and we

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.260
invent new ones that
will help us think

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.100
about the current problem.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.760
We then formulate the solution
to the problem as a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.690
computational experiment and
then design and construct a

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.540
sufficiently efficient
implementation.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.100
It doesn't have to be the most
efficient one possible.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.580
It just has to be efficient
enough that we can run it and

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.460
get an answer.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.930
Of course, before we trust
the answer, as with any

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.200
experimental apparatus--

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.500
and it is an experimental
apparatus, a program--

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.450
we need to validate the
experiment, convince ourselves

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.640
that when we run it, we should
believe the answer.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.310
That's the process
of debugging.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.950
And I'm sure it's a process
that all of you have spent

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.060
more time on this term then
you might have liked.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.806
I hope by now you feel you are a
little bit better at it than

00:04:38.806 --> 00:04:41.060
you used to be.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.500
Once we think we've got the
experiment put together

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.620
properly, we run it.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.680
We then evaluate the results.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.310
And then we repeat as
needed, the classic

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.516
iterative style of science.

00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:58.330
And a lot of this, of course, is
what you would have learned

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.200
in your chemistry lab or your
physics lab or the bio lab in

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.290
designing any experiment.

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.260
You have to go through
a lot of these steps.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.240
And the difference is these
are all computational

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.250
experiments.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.250
So we think of there
are two ways of

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.260
computational thinking.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.820
There's abstraction.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.490
You have to choose the
right abstraction.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.940
Typically, we operate in terms
of multiple layers of

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.520
abstraction simultaneously.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.670
And this is an important part
of thinking computationally.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.920
We have to be able to not worry
about, say, the details

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.970
of how floating point numbers
were implemented, but just

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.910
assume it's a good

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.850
approximation of the real numbers.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.230
That's one level
of abstraction.

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:51.410
And another level of
abstraction, we think about

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.570
bus stop queues.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.755
And maybe we have to implement
those ourselves.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.020
And then we have to think about
the relationships among

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.810
the layers.

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.930
A key thing that makes
computational abstractions

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:12.610
different from so many others
is we can automate them.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.270
So we often think about
abstractions as we go through

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.900
life and think about how to cope
with things that are too

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.120
complex to understand.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.020
We have these various
abstractions.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.110
Newton gave us some good
abstractions of the physical

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.630
world that let us understand
how things like levers and

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.880
such almost how they work.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.150
But here we get the big
advantage that we not only can

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.510
invent an abstraction,
we can mechanize it.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.570
We can do this for
two reasons.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:50.510
One, we have a precise and
exacting notation for

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.010
expressing the abstractions
for building our

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.510
computational models.

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.250
This term, that has been Python
and PyLab and NumPy.

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:01.840
But it could have been Java.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.370
It could have been C++.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.260
It could have been MATLAB.

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.290
Doesn't matter very much.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:11.350
What matters is that we have a
notation that's precise enough

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:14.270
that we can actually describe
a computation.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:21.100
And we have some machine that
can take a computation written

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.780
in that notation, or a set of
computations actually written

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.320
in that notation, and execute
them and give us results.

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.330
And that's been the big
transformation that has made

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.910
computation so important.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.850
We've had the notion of
computation long before we had

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.920
machines that could
execute them.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.760
The Greeks, the Egyptians
understood notions of

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:48.330
computation, as we've seen
before when we looked at some

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.530
early algorithms.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:51.920
Algorithms have been
around a long time.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.780
But nobody cared very much
until we had machines and

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.490
notations that would let us
actually run the algorithms.

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.610
That came along in
the late '40s.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.125
And then the world changed
dramatically.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.490
So some examples of
computational thinking.

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:17.220
How difficult is this problem,
and how best can I solve it?

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:20.390
And that's what theoretical
computer scientists spend

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:22.640
their time thinking about.

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.590
They try to give precise
meanings to these kinds of

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.310
questions so that we can ask
them in the context of, say,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.200
random access machines or
parallel machines or, more

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:40.120
lately, quantum machines, how
do we formulate those

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.440
questions precisely?

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.280
And how can we answer them?

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.180
And of course, thinking
recursively is very important.

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.640
Fundamentally, it's the key in
that what we try and do is we

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.840
try and reformulate a seemingly
difficult problem

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.720
into one we already
know how to solve.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.100
This is what we talked about
before, reduction to a

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.800
previously solved problem.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.040
And we've looked at different
ways of doing this.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.870
There is reduction,
as I mentioned.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:16.380
There's embedding, where, OK,
our problem is complex.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.320
We can't reduce it to
a different problem.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.350
But we can embed a different
problem in it as at least part

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:24.020
of the solution.

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.380
We can do some transformations,
take one

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.840
problem and transform it
to a different problem.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.250
Usually, a simpler problem that
we know how to solve.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.130
We've seen a lot of that.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:39.620
That's, of course, what you've
seen in the bus simulation

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.610
you're studying, I hope as--

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.820
I hope not as I speak, but as
soon as I finish speaking,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.240
you'll be studying it.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:52.600
We've taken a complex problem
and simplified it by

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.730
transforming it into
a simpler problem

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.910
that we can then attack.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:02.570
And we've used a lot of
simulation as a mechanism for

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:03.640
dealing with problems.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.850
So here's a little recursive
picture.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.880
Here's one of my favorite
illustrations of recursion.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.490
I don't know how they
did that, but I

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.920
think it's pretty cool.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.350
All right.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:18.250
That's a very quick
introduction, at a very

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:22.600
abstract level, what computer
scientists might do.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.460
I'm gonna spend some time now
on what one particular

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:28.570
computer scientist does,
and that's me.

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:30.490
Why did I choose me?

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.530
Well, not because I'm the most
interesting, but because I'm

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:34.400
the one I know the best.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.020
So it's kind of easier for me
to talk about my work than

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:38.880
about somebody else's.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:43.740
And the truth be told, it's
not actually my work.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:47.780
Like all professors, I claim
credit for the work that my

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.390
students do.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.970
So all of the work you're going
to see is actually work

00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:53.600
that my students have done.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.680
Mostly graduate students,
but also some

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:57.920
very productive UROPs.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.740
So, I won't give them as much
credit as I should, but you

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.390
should know in your heart that
I didn't do any of this

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.090
actually myself.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:06.360
All right.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.650
What do we do?

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:12.260
The goals of our research group
is the rather modest one

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.010
of helping people live longer
and better quality lives.

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:19.590
Other than that, we don't intend
to accomplish anything.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:22.770
And we do this mostly in the
medical area by collaborating

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:27.180
with clinical researchers and
practicing clinicians.

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:31.490
Along the way we have a lot of
fun pushing the frontiers, the

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.990
state of the art in computer
science, electrical

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:38.140
engineering, and certainly
medicine.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.570
We use a lot of the technical
kind of ideas you've seen this

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.200
semester and that you'll see in
almost any computer science

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.820
course you take.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.760
We do a lot of machine learning
and data mining.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.100
I'll explain why shortly.

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.920
We do a lot of algorithm design
because a lot of the

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:59.090
problems we're trying to solve
are too complex to solve if

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:02.000
you're not clever about
how you solve them.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.250
We do some signal processing.

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:06.430
I'll explain why we do that.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:10.290
And a lot of just plain-old
software systems are needed.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:12.405
Do we use databases?

00:12:12.405 --> 00:12:16.350
How we build software that
injects electrical signals

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:17.940
into people's brains?

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.110
So we spend a fair amount of
time trying to convince

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:24.110
ourselves it actually works,
doesn't inject the wrong

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:25.740
signals at the wrong time.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.880
But that might be fun too.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.800
And these are just the
logos of some of the

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.390
hospitals we work with.

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:36.310
So what are some of the problems
we try and deal with?

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.790
Probably our longest standing
project has to do with medical

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.310
telepresence.

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:45.270
These hands do not belong
to a basketball player.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.580
These are normal sized hands
like yours or mine.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.330
That is not a normal
sized baby.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.880
This is not a Photoshop photo.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.550
This is a real photo.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.310
This is a very small
premature baby.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.280
And we have spent a lot of
time working with groups

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.180
figuring out how to provide
better outcomes for these tiny

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:09.530
little, very delicate people.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:13.840
A problem is that a lot of
these babies are born--

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:17.870
if these babies are born in the
right hospital, Brigham

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:20.510
and Women's Hospital or
something close to Children's

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:24.610
Hospital or MGH, they have
very good outcomes.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:28.770
They tend to survive, and they
tend to grow up to be

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.540
relatively normal.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.740
If these babies are born in a
community hospital that does

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:38.240
not know how to take care of
these kinds of babies, they

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.420
have very bad outcomes.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.060
A lot of them die.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.840
Many of them who survive end up
being permanently disabled.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.090
Very sad.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:58.360
One of the shocking statistics
is that globally there's a

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.900
neonatal death every
10 seconds.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.770
Shocking number, I think.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.740
It's just tragic.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.830
And many of these
are unnecessary.

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:10.680
And they occur because there's
not adequate care at the point

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.330
where the baby is born.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:16.380
And so we've been trying to use
technology to link places

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.590
where these babies might be born
to places where people

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:22.770
can advise how to take
care of them.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.820
And it turns out to be a very
interesting set of computer

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.150
networking communications
problems.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.300
You can't just use Skype
for reasons I won't

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.850
have time to go into.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:34.400
But it's very exciting.

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:37.490
It uses a lot of computer
science, a lot of medicine,

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.210
but mostly computer science,
in this case.

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:43.810
And we're actually currently
running some trials in

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.050
conjunction with Children's
Hospital Boston where they're

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.970
actually trying to look at
babies born elsewhere.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.680
Another problem we've been
looking at is health-care

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:57.820
associated infections.

00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:03.210
Approximately 1 in 20 hospital
visits results in the patient

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:06.540
contracting an infection totally
unrelated to the

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:09.990
reason they entered
the hospital.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:13.430
And today it's among the top ten
leading causes of death in

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:15.670
the United States.

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.500
Somebody enters a hospital for
a reason x, picks up an

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.110
infection unrelated
to x, and dies.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.400
Not a very good outcome.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.950
And it's particularly
discouraging because, in

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:32.600
principle, these infections
should be preventable.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.560
You shouldn't acquire a
life-threatening infection

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.630
while you're in the hospital.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.890
But people do.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.580
We've been trying to
understand why.

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:46.320
We've been working on this
project with Microsoft, which

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:51.030
has provided us with data from
4.5 million different hospital

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:57.990
visits and about 2000 pieces of
information per visit, lab

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:01.670
tests, drug tests, who the
doctors were, who the nurses

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:05.580
were, what rooms they were in.

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:08.100
And we're trying to study--
these are pictures of some of

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:12.200
the most obnoxious of
these infections--

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:17.110
and we've been trying to figure
out what's causing them

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:20.220
and what can be done
not to cause them.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.600
This has been primarily a
machine learning project.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:28.660
We've been struggling with it.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.360
We've been dealing with exactly
some of the issues we

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.080
talked about in class.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.820
Which features are
most important?

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:38.390
How should you weight the
different features?

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.040
How can we reduce the number
of features so that we can

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.010
actually finish our
computations?

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.620
We've been using different kinds
of clustering, different

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:51.140
kinds of supervised learning,
many different techniques.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:55.510
And we're beginning to get a
handle here on, in fact, what

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:59.060
are some of the causes of these
infections and what

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.770
could they be done.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.069
Some of the things are
very disturbing.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:07.200
Some of them, a lot of them,
seem to be caused by drugs

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.480
that are given in
the hospital.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.050
And maybe we can substitute
one drug for another if we

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:14.300
understand that.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:17.609
At least in some cases they seem
to be related to things

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:24.300
like what room you happen to be
placed in, suggesting that

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.490
maybe they're not cleaning
the rooms adequately.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:28.220
Things like that.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.020
All right.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.010
Another project, probably our
biggest sets of projects, have

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:36.730
to do with extracting
information from

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:39.040
physiological signals.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.590
We've been focusing on the
heart, the brain, and the

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.240
connected anatomy.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.070
For those of you who don't
happen to be biology or course

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.630
20 majors, here's where the
heart and the brain are

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.030
located and what
they look like.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:57.340
Some of the examples we're
interested in are predicting

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.440
adverse cardiac events.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.960
And for that you can think
about death from a heart

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.760
event, heart attack.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.070
And we spent a lot of time
dealing with epilepsy.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:12.630
So let me give a little bit more
detail about these two

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:15.560
examples because each of
them relate to things

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.150
we've covered in 6.00.

00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:23.140
So epilepsy, an interesting
disease.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:30.210
Surprisingly, it affects about
1% of the world's population.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:33.030
When I first heard this,
I was astounded.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.250
Because gee, 1 out
of 100 people

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.750
that I know have epilepsy?

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.520
And the truth is, yes.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.180
I just didn't know it.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.830
I've been amazed, since it's
become known that I do

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.700
research in this area, the
number of people I've known

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:50.850
for years who come up to me
say, you know, I never

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.390
mentioned this before, but I
have epilepsy, or my kid has

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.560
epilepsy or my parent has
epilepsy, and I have some

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:59.120
questions now that you're
supposed to be

00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.110
an expert on this.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.440
And I give them the usual
caveats, you know, I'm not a

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.890
doctor, I just play
one on television.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.750
But then I tell them go talk
to one of my students.

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:13.550
They're not doctors either,
but they're really smart.

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.520
Probably smarter than
your doctor.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.770
All right.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.060
Why is it underestimated when
we do it ourselves?

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:25.110
Well, because they're
still some stigmas.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:27.940
A few hundred years ago, they
burned women in Salem,

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:30.870
Massachusetts, who had epilepsy
because they thought

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.970
the seizures meant they were
possessed by the devil.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:37.420
Today, if you tell the Registry
of Motor Vehicles

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.130
that you have epilepsy, they
won't let you drive an

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:40.720
automobile.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.440
So people tend not
to announce it.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.370
What's it characterized by
is a recurrent seizure.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.780
A seizure is abnormal electrical
activity that

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:56.060
originates and persists
in the brain.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.910
Number of causes.

00:19:57.910 --> 00:19:58.810
It can be acquired.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.380
It can be inherited.

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.020
There's manifest different
symptoms.

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:04.960
Most of them do not
look like what's

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:08.250
portrayed on the Simpsons.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.035
Slightly more realistically,
and maybe more horrifying.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.950
Here's a picture of a young
girl, a movie, you're gonna

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:23.500
see a seizure.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.930
It's not pleasant, I'm
gonna warn you.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:29.700
What I want you to notice
is two things.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.340
(1) She's all happy, and
the seizure seems

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.600
to come out of nowhere.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:36.930
She doesn't expect it.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:38.460
She doesn't know she's
going to have.

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.180
It just hits.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.765
That's very important.

00:20:41.765 --> 00:20:47.080
(2) She happened to be in the
clinic at the time wearing

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.140
this funny looking cap, with
it has electrodes in it.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.420
Just sits on the scalp.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.310
And here is a record of the
electrical activity at the

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:59.100
surface of her scalp.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.050
And what you'll see is a quick
slight change on it just

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:07.950
before the seizure hits, and
then enormous changes during

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.470
the seizure.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:11.730
Turns out that the enormous
changes during the seizure

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:14.130
have nothing really to
do with the seizure.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:16.530
They have to do with
muscle activity.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:20.950
As you'll see once the seizure
hits, there's a lot of ugly

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.890
muscle activity.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:22.220
All right.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.470
Let's look at it.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.040
Uh oh.

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.290
All right.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:34.640
Let's look at it--

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:41.670
I thought I had put the links in
here that should have done

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.610
it, but who knows.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.750
I know where to find them.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:38.630
PROFESSOR: So kind of scary.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.720
Certainly when I've been seeing
them actually happen,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:44.630
I've found it terrifying
to watch.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.875
That kind of-- it's called
a tonic-clonic seizure.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.830
They seem- I emphasize the word
'seem' -- unpredictable.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.250
The interesting thing about
these seizures, or an

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.200
interesting thing, is they're
self-limiting.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:03.740
In a few minutes, that young
lady or girl's seizure will be

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:07.040
over, not because anybody
intervened but because the

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.300
brain resets itself.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.280
Then it will take--

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:14.710
in this case, probably took her
about an hour to recover

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:17.370
and get back to normal,
which is not good.

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:21.070
But after that, everything was
as before the seizure.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:26.205
The difficulty is because
they're unpredictable, there

00:23:26.205 --> 00:23:28.040
are huge injuries.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.440
Imagine she'd been riding
a bicycle when that hit.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.620
Well, something catastrophic.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.010
Or more simply, imagine she'd
been going down a flight of

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:40.410
stairs or in a bathtub.

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.040
Any one of a number of things
would have resulted in this

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.660
potentially catastrophic
collateral damage after the

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.650
seizure or during the seizure.

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.440
And indeed people who
have epilepsy, you

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.520
can see their scars.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.890
It's awful.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:05.300
It can result in death, about
1 per 100 patient years.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.140
It's called the sudden
unexpected

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.580
death in epilepsy patients.

00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:13.100
So what we wanted to do is see
whether we could detect the

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:17.410
seizures and give a
little warning.

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:19.940
The notion being that even if
you couldn't do anything about

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:23.500
the seizure, if you could give
somebody, say, even five

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.950
seconds warning, they
could sit down

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.880
before they fell down.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.340
They could get out of the tub.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.130
They could back away
from the stove.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.050
All sorts of things.

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:37.160
Furthermore, if you could use
technology to signal to

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.560
someone else that there was
about to be a seizure, help

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:40.740
could arrive.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.890
Also potentially a good thing.

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:48.330
Turns out there are now some
fast-acting drugs that if you

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:51.610
put under the tongue can
ameliorate the seizure.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:55.580
These have not yet been approved
by the FDA, but soon.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:57.530
And we were particularly
interested in neural

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.370
stimulation.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.390
If we ejected electrical current
into the brain at

00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:06.130
exactly the right moment, could
we offset essentially

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.010
the effect of the seizure
and do a reset?

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.810
And maybe stop the seizure or
abort it, prevent it, or at

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:19.280
least reduce the long
term recovery time.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.180
The thing to keep in mind for
the seizure is there were two

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:25.020
distinct onset times.

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:28.430
What you saw if you're looking
at the girl was what's called

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.360
the clinical onset, when there's
some clinical event.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.650
If you were able to not look at
the person and instead look

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.730
at the EEG, not so easy, you
would have seen that there was

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:45.860
an electrographic onset that
preceded the clinical onset.

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:48.970
We know, in fact, since the
clinical effects are caused by

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.520
the electrical activity, there
will always be abnormal

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:55.210
electrical activity
prior to any

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.580
abnormal clinical activity.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.740
And so the hope was that we
could detect the electrical

00:26:01.740 --> 00:26:05.280
activity early.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.150
Now that's not so easy.

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:12.690
What makes it hard is
that the EEG, the

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:18.500
electroencephalograph, differs
greatly across patients.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.780
First of all, people with
epilepsy have abnormal

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:24.860
baseline EEG.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:28.650
Even when they're not having a
seizure, bizarre things are

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:29.960
going on in their brains

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.590
electrically, all unusual things.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:35.640
And so they don't
look like people

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.840
who don't have epilepsy.

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:44.040
And it varies tremendously
across patients.

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.770
So for about 35 years, people
attempted to build generic

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:51.470
detectors that would detect
seizures in everybody.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.290
And they've not worked
well at all.

00:26:54.290 --> 00:26:58.160
Every time a hospital buys an
EEG machine, it comes with a

00:26:58.160 --> 00:26:59.760
detector built in.

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:03.380
And usually the first thing they
do is they turn them off

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.340
because the false alarm rate is
so high that it's like the

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.330
boy who cried wolf.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.150
They're just saying seizure,
seizure, seizure, and people

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.870
start ignoring it.

00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:19.530
The good news is it's pretty
consistent seizure onset for a

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:21.750
particular individual.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.240
That suggests you should build
not generic detectors, but

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.410
patient specific detectors.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.370
And we've been working
on using machine

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.720
learning to do that.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.880
And in fact, it's been
highly successful.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.530
We've done several retrospective
studies

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.590
indicating that it works
really well.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:43.760
And we're now doing
a substantial

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.240
prospective study --

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.970
in progress at MGH.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:53.590
And as part of that, we're
actually working at turning on

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:58.770
a neuro-stimulator that we hope
will attenuate the effect

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.020
of the seizure.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.440
And I emphasize hope because we
don't have enough data to

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.180
know if it works.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.700
It's part of what goes
on in this business.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:10.280
But it's certainly been an
interesting project.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:10.730
All right.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:11.980
Heart attacks.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:15.750
Let's look at that.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:18.850
And I'll go to the easy
way to show them.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:25.720
I should warn you, you're gonna
see something that's not

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.460
very pleasant.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.760
You're actually gonna
see somebody die.

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:37.520
This was actually a person who
was playing in a soccer game

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:39.800
and died while the game
was being televised.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:43.760
All right.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:50.060
What I want to show you is this
didn't have to happen.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.700
We're now gonna see another
televised soccer game where

00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:58.340
the player had exactly the same
event but with a rather

00:28:58.340 --> 00:28:59.590
different outcome.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.240
So look at the upper center of
field and you'll see the

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.820
person has collapsed, much the
same way it happened before.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.980
Now watch the body convulse.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.200
You'll see the knees
kick up there.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.450
And now comes the miracle.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.930
He sits up.

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:29.980
He leaves the field and, in
fact, he later asked if he can

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.060
reenter the game.

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.435
The coach, to the coach's
everlasting credit, said no.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.020
Clearly the right decision.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:47.000
So it's amazing really
that this happens.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.890
So what was the difference
between the two?

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.540
well, we see this here.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.790
There are things you can do.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:04.370
So in acute coronary syndrome,
think of it as some sort of a

00:30:04.370 --> 00:30:05.040
heart attack.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.300
They're very common, about
one and a quarter million

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:10.500
per year in the US.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:14.140
15% to 20% of these people will
suffer a cardiac-related

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.700
death within the next
four years.

00:30:16.700 --> 00:30:20.400
If you could figure out who
were the people at highest

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:27.200
risk of different events and
choose the treatment properly,

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.950
for example, implant an
implantable cardiac

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:33.710
defibrillator, you could
save these lives.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:36.840
And that was what we
saw in our movies.

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.180
That the first patient, first
person, the one who died, did

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.580
not have a defibrillator.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.960
The second person, the one
who survived, did.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.280
So he collapsed on the field.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:55.440
The defibrillator sensed that
his heart had stopped, gave it

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.470
an electric shock.

00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:58.430
You've all seen this in
television where they put the

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:00.860
paddles on and they
say, clear.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.410
And then there's this moment of
drama where everyone stares

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.870
at the EKG machine, and it
goes from a flat line to

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:10.430
suddenly up and down, and
everyone goes, ah.

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:12.550
Well that's exactly what
happened here.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:16.100
And that convulsion was this
huge electrical shock getting

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.270
sent through the person's body
which restarted the heart,

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.250
saved his life.

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:26.260
Probably, if the other player
had had an ICD, he would not

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:28.160
have died either.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.810
So great technology.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:34.280
Well, yes and no.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.740
This was a study in the New
England Journal of Medicine

00:31:36.740 --> 00:31:41.490
not so long ago, a very good
control study, where they

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:46.500
matched patients with ICDs and
patients without ICDs and over

00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:52.070
72 months tracked which ones
lived and which ones died.

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:55.610
Well, the disturbing news is
there isn't much difference

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.120
between the red line
and the blue line.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:04.300
So these people had what was
essentially a, well, which was

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:09.830
about a $50,000 implant and
various kinds of risks and

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:13.560
inconvenience and discomfort,
et cetera, and on average it

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.810
didn't save lives.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.490
Oh, dear.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:23.030
In fact, 90% of the people who
got them-- and this is not

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:24.360
just in this study.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:28.050
This is in every study- receives
zero, actually less

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:31.430
than zero medical benefit
from the ICD.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:33.040
How do we know that?

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.540
Well, remember, it only turns on
when it senses the heart is

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.130
in trouble.

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.980
For 90% of the people who get
it, it never energizes because

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.776
the heart doesn't
get in trouble,

00:32:43.776 --> 00:32:45.920
or detectable trouble.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.080
So what we see, if we look at
a little more detail in this

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:58.850
study, is that for sudden
cardiac death, the kind of

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:03.990
death we saw in those videos,
or non-death,

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.890
the ICD reduces that.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:12.310
Unfortunately, it increases
other causes of death, for

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:17.180
example, infections related to
the surgery, et cetera, those

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.900
unfortunate hospital acquired
infections, for example, we

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:21.740
talked about earlier.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:26.980
So what we see here is we have
a technology that if we knew

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.690
whose heart was likely to
stop or go into serious

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:35.070
fibrillation, beating
uncontrollably, and we only

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.560
gave those people ICDs,
we could save an

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.740
enormous number of lives.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.350
But currently we don't know
who's in that population, and

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:47.600
therefore we don't know
who should get them.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.240
So we use other mechanisms
deciding who should get them.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.840
And we're wrong most of the
time, doing more harm than

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:58.770
good on those patients
for whom we're wrong.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:33:59.280
OK.

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.960
Well, how do the people
predict it today?

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.500
The usual things.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.490
Are you male or female?

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.930
Do you have high
blood pressure?

00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:07.730
Diabetes?

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.889
What's your cholesterol level?

00:34:09.889 --> 00:34:10.550
BMP?

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:12.960
Various other kinds of things.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:16.360
Electrocardiograms,
which look at--

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.900
it's an echo cardiogram
that looks at the

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:19.909
activity of the heart.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.770
Is the blood flowing
through it OK?

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:23.840
EKGs.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:26.719
Many different methods for
analyzing the electrical

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:28.360
activity, et cetera.

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:34.260
We played with many of
these techniques.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:36.429
The one I want to tell you about
today, because it's the

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:40.360
most closely related to 6.00
material, is what we think of

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.580
the Tolstoy approach to
risk stratification.

00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:47.400
So Tolstoy is famous for saying
that happy families are

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.550
all alike, but every
unhappy family is

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:53.699
unhappy in its own way.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:58.440
So we generalize that, or
specialized it maybe, to say

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:01.320
that happy hearts are all alike,
but every unhappy heart

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:05.200
is different, and then did some
fairly simple work to

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.310
quantify the difference between
electrical activities

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:17.250
in different people's hearts,
converting it to symbols.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.330
You don't have to worry
about that.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:22.470
We used dynamic programming as
an important part because we

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:24.920
were looking at roughly a
billion heart beats and so we

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.000
needed to make it run fast.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.070
And then we used clustering to
identify patients whose hearts

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:37.170
we thought were similar
to one another.

00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.340
Here are some results.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.590
These are people who had an
acute coronary syndrome.

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:46.480
So the dominant group, the
biggest group, the quote

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.200
"people who we thought were
most likely to be fine"--

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:51.190
because remember, most
people are fine

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.830
after a heart attack--

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:58.880
457 patients in this particular
data set.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.960
And you can see that they
did pretty well.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:07.300
A very small fraction
of them died.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.560
Can't see it from this angle,
but come out here.

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.410
Yeah, less than 1%.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.480
But then we looked at
people who were

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.710
in these other clusters.

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.000
And in fact, we used a glomerate
of hierarchical

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.276
clustering to do this.

00:36:21.276 --> 00:36:27.890
And in cluster A, which had 53
patients, well, 3.77% died.

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:31.475
If you happened to fall
in cluster C, you were

00:36:31.475 --> 00:36:32.725
at very high risk.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.130
And we can just see that there's
a big difference here.

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:43.340
And so the notion is could we
have used this to predict in

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.660
advance who was most likely to
benefit from the various kinds

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.020
of treatments?

00:36:50.020 --> 00:36:50.500
All right.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:54.020
Again, very quick just to
give you the details--

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.325
not the details, the overview
that the kinds of things that

00:36:57.325 --> 00:37:01.610
we cover in this course are
actually quite useful in

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:04.510
solving real practical
problems.

00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:06.060
All right.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.310
Let me wrap up the term.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:14.640
So I hope most of you feel
you've come a long way--

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.925
maybe you prefer this picture.

00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:26.810
That if you think about the
kinds of problems and

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:31.500
struggles you had three months
ago in getting tiny little

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:34.990
programs to work and think about
how easy those would be

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.300
for you today, you should have
some appreciation that you've

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.770
really taught yourself a lot.

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.690
And you really taught it to
yourself, by doing the problem

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.540
sets, in many ways, right.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.700
We've tried to help, but
learning is very much up to

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.580
the individual who's
doing the learning.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:58.120
But I'm certainly impressed in
looking at the kinds of really

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:00.745
pretty complicated problems
you guys can now solve.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.890
We looked at six major topics.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.910
Clearly, you learned a notation
for expressing

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:13.220
computations, and
that was Python.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.660
And I hope you don't think
that's the only notation you

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:20.100
can use and that if you take
a course that uses MATLAB,

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:21.720
you'll say, oh, this
is just the same.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.300
It's easy.

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.560
Or Java or anything else.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:27.080
Learning programming
languages is easy.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:31.450
Once you've learned one, the
next one is much easier.

00:38:31.450 --> 00:38:34.410
Harder was learning about the
process of writing and

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:35.660
debugging programs.

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:41.590
You've learned that, I think,
largely through experience.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.960
You've learned about the process
of moving from a

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:49.960
problem statement, something
as vague as should shuttle

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:54.650
buses be bigger or faster
to improve service, to a

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:58.980
computational formulation of the
problem and a method for

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:00.480
solving a problem.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:04.560
And we've looked at lots
of different methods.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:07.700
You've learned basic recipes,
algorithms, things like

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.480
dynamic programming, things
like depth-first search,

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.690
things like decision trees,
that you'll be able to use

00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:15.010
again and again.

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.920
The good news is there are only
a really small number of

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.800
important recipes.

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.540
And once you've mastered those,
you just use them over

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:27.860
and over again to solve
new problems.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.720
Spent a lot of time on using
simulations to shed light on

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.960
problems that don't
easily succumb

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:38.200
to closed form solutions.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.310
And I think that's really
the place where

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:43.500
computation is so important.

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.820
There are a lot of problems
where you can turn them into a

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.800
set of differential equations,
maybe solve the equations, and

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.980
you're done.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.300
Oh, we'll write programs to do
those because we're lazy.

00:39:54.300 --> 00:39:55.850
But in principle,
you could solve

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:58.920
those without a computer.

00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:02.650
But in fact, the thing you can't
do without a computer is

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:05.450
these messy problems that are
most of what goes on in the

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:08.860
real world, where there's
randomness, and things like

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:10.920
that, and there is no
simple formula that

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.390
gives you the answer.

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:15.390
And what you have to do is write
a simulation and run it

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:17.580
and see what goes on.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.730
And that's why we spent so
much time on simulation

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:23.280
because it really is
increasingly the

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.380
thing people use.

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.540
And we learned about how to
use computational tools to

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:35.820
help model and understand data,
how to do [?] plots, a

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:39.110
small amount of statistics,
machine learning, just

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.690
dealing with data.

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.310
Why Python?

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.530
It's pretty easy to
learn to use.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.860
Compared to most other
programming languages like,

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.280
say, C++ or Java,
Python is easy.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.710
The syntax is simple.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.820
It's interpretive, which
makes debugging easier.

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:02.070
You don't have to worry about
managing memory as you do in,

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:03.220
say, C, right.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.670
You get a big list or
dictionary, and

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.210
magically it exists.

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.610
And when you don't need it
any more, it's gone.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:12.220
It's modern.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.280
It supports the currently
stylish mode of

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:21.240
object-oriented programming in
a nice way with its classes

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.520
and things like that.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.920
So indeed what you would hear
about in a Java class, we can

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.780
cover almost all the

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.170
interesting things with Python.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.240
And it's increasingly popular.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.100
It's used in an increasing
number of subjects at MIT.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.360
A lot of course 6 subjects, but
also a lot of course 20

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.950
subjects, course 9 subjects,
over and over again.

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:48.000
It's becoming, probably, the
most popular language at MIT

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.710
and at other universities.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:53.090
Increasingly it's used
in industry.

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:57.590
And as you've seen with PyLab,
the libraries are amazing.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:01.660
And so PyLab, Random, et cetera,
there's just a lot of

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:03.790
stuff you can get for free
if you're living in

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.040
the world of Python.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.790
The main thing in writing,
testing, and bugging programs,

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.640
I hope you've learned, is to
take it a step at a time.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.560
Understand the problem.

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:19.660
Think about the overall
structure and algorithms

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.410
separately of how you express
them in the programming

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:24.980
language, right.

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.340
We can talk about dynamic
programming conceptually

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.280
without worrying about
how to code it up.

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.160
Always break the problem
into small parts.

00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:37.160
Identify useful abstractions.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:41.630
Code and test each unit
independently.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.260
Worry about functionality
first.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:45.270
Get it to work.

00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:46.540
Get it to give you
the right answer.

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.980
Then worry about making it
do that more quickly.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.880
But separate those things.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.230
Start with some pseudo code.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.220
Then above all, be systematic.

00:43:01.220 --> 00:43:04.990
When debugging, think about
the scientific method of

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:09.610
forming hypotheses, forming
experiments that can test the

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:12.110
hypotheses, running
the experiment,

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.980
checking the results.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.250
Don't try and do
it too quickly.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.890
Just be slow and careful.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:21.400
Slow and steady will win
the race in debugging.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.890
And when your program
behaves badly--

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:29.165
and the sad news is no matter
how many years you spend at

00:43:29.165 --> 00:43:31.850
it, you will write programs that
don't work the way you

00:43:31.850 --> 00:43:34.830
think they should
the first time--

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.670
ask yourself why it did what it
did, not why didn't it do

00:43:38.670 --> 00:43:40.560
what you wanted to do.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.960
It's a lot easier to debug
from the how come it's

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.740
behaving the way it is then why
isn't it behaving the way

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:47.990
I want it to behave.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.130
In going from problem statement
to computation,

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.860
break the problem into
smaller problems.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:59.240
Try and relate your problem to
a problem that somebody else,

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.420
ideally, has already solved.

00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.430
For example, is it a
knapsack problem?

00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:05.430
Is it a shortest path problem?

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:10.030
If so, good, I know how
to solve those.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:12.460
Think about what kind of output
you might want to see.

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:13.880
What should the plots be like?

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.250
I usually design the output
before I design the program.

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:22.640
Often you can formulate things
as an optimization problem.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.700
Pull back.

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.710
Say, well, can I formulate this
as finding the minimum or

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:31.040
maximum values satisfying an
objective function and some

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.070
set of constraints?

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.790
If I can, it's an optimization
problem, and therefore I know

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.490
how to attack it.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:44.830
And don't be afraid to think
about approximate solutions.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.870
Sometimes you're just gonna not
actually be able to solve

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:49.950
the problem you want to solve.

00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:53.010
And so you'll find a solution to
a simpler problem, and that

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:54.740
will be good enough.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:58.330
Sometimes you can actually solve
the problem by finding a

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.470
series of solutions that
approaches, but may never

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.740
reach, a perfect answer.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.130
Probably the third week in the
course, we looked at Newton's

00:45:06.130 --> 00:45:11.190
method as an example of
that kind of problem.

00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:12.340
And then there are algorithms.

00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:17.210
We looked at big O notation,
various kinds of algorithms, a

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.990
lot of kinds.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:21.450
You've already - I sent a list
of specific algorithms.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:25.780
And particularly, we looked
at optimization problems.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:29.200
We spent a lot of time on
modeling the world, keeping in

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.850
mind that the models
are always wrong.

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:36.290
But nevertheless, they're
often useful.

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.520
They provide abstractions
of reality.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.400
So we looked at two kinds of
simulation models, Monte Carlo

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.220
and queuing networks.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.040
We looked at statistical models,
for example, linear

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.150
regression.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:50.880
And we looked at some graph
theoretic models.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:53.840
Those are not the only
techniques, but they're very

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.090
useful techniques.

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.880
We looked at making
sense of data.

00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.710
We talked about statistical
techniques.

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:03.900
How to use them well.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:07.180
How to use them badly.

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.270
We looked at plotting.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:11.023
And we spent some time on
machine learning, supervised

00:46:11.023 --> 00:46:16.080
and unsupervised and feature
vectors, and spent a lot of

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:19.700
time talking about how do you
choose the features, because

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.370
fundamentally that's typically
the difference between success

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:27.640
and failure in the world
of machine learning.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.530
Throughout it all, the pervasive
themes were the

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:36.790
power of abstraction and
systematic problem solving.

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:39.900
So what's next?

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.580
Many of you have worked really
hard this semester.

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.290
We know that.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:47.650
And the TAs and LAs and
I all appreciate that.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.240
And I thank you sincerely
for the effort you

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.540
put into the course.

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.870
Only you know your return
on the investment.

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:57.690
I hope it's good.

00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:00.500
Remember as you go forward in
your careers that you can now

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.160
write programs to solve problems
you need to solve.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.130
Don't be afraid to do it.

00:47:06.130 --> 00:47:08.870
If you like this, there are
plenty of other CS courses

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:10.630
that you now could take.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:13.500
You're actually equipped,
probably, to take any one of

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.080
these four courses based upon
what you've learned in 6.00.

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:21.210
You could major in course 6 or
think about the new major in

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.950
computer science and
molecular biology.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.290
And you're certainly qualified
to go off and to look for

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:31.010
UROPs that involve serious
programming.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:31.870
All right.

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:35.630
Wrapping up with some famous
last words, these were words

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:39.630
that some famous people said
as they were about to die.

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:44.490
An actor, Douglas Fairbanks
senior, was asked by a family

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:45.570
member, how are you feeling?

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:47.240
He said, never felt better.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.430
And then that was the last
thing he ever said.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:54.670
In contrast, the last thing
Luther Burbank was reported to

00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:59.350
have said, a famous scientist,
was, I don't feel so good.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.010
He was a scientist rather
than actor.

00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:05.140
He had a better appreciation
of the state of the world.

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.960
Conrad Hilton, who you probably
think of as Paris

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.780
Hilton's grandfather, but
actually is more well known in

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:17.080
some circles for running the
Hilton hotels, his last words

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.530
when his family asked him-- they
knew he was dying-- is

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:20.720
there anything you
want us to know

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.430
about running the business?

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:24.780
And he said, yes, leave the
shower curtain on the inside

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.940
of the tub.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.090
And that's advice, I have to
confess, my wife has given me

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:31.340
on several occasions.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:40.050
Archimedes, basically before
he was taken away and

00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:43.280
executed, asked, could he please
finish solving the

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.080
problem he was working on.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.230
You know, I could imagine some
poor 6.00 student who's about

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:50.970
to be carted away by the police
saying, can I finish my

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.250
problem set first, please?

00:48:53.250 --> 00:48:55.910
Actually, I can't
imagine that.

00:48:55.910 --> 00:49:01.450
And finally, this US Civil War
general, John Sedgwick, was

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:02.270
reputedly--

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:05.800
and this is, I believe, a true
story-- said, talking about

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.770
the snipers from the other side
who were quite far away,

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.590
that telling his people, don't
be afraid, they couldn't get

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:15.700
an elephant at this distance.

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.780
And if you go to the site of the
battle, you'll find this

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.340
plaque describing the death of
John Sedgwick who was shot and

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:29.470
killed immediately upon saying
this by one of said snipers.

00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:31.670
It says something about generals
that probably is

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:33.180
still true today.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.760
All right, quick reminders
and then we're done.

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.140
There's a final exam.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.100
If you haven't done the
underground guide, go do it.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.940
These are things I said at the
beginning of the lecture.

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:45.480
I'm just repeating them.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:46.660
Thanks a lot.

00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:49.550
Good luck in the final 6.00,
all your finals.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.820
And then more importantly,
have a great summer.

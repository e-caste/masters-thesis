WEBVTT

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.190
PROFESSOR: I think it's about
five after the hour so we

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.670
ought to get started.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.610
Before we forge bravely ahead,
I'd like to make sure that

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.490
everybody has a copy of
the things that we've

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.710
been handing out.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.710
There is a copy of the
handwritten notes on the

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.893
derivation of the
17 plane groups.

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:28.150
Need a copy of that?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.200
There you go.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:43.220
And then there is, in addition,
a set of diagrams

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.030
from the international tables
that give very nice pictures

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.870
of all of the plane
groups in the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.120
arrangement of symmetry elements.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.550
That's the only other thing
that was handed

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.800
out up to this point.

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.090
For your continued edification
and amusement, I have another

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.459
problem set.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.720
And let me say something
about this problem set.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.650
The first problem gives you some
angles between crystal

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.010
faces and asks you to deduce
a possible set of lattice

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.410
translations which are
consistent with those angles.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.890
And in the days before
diffraction, that was what

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.660
crystallography was all about.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.190
It really was mapping the
geometry of crystals.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.560
And the interesting thing is,
you could measure these angles

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.330
very precisely with a device
called a reflecting

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.140
goniometer, Provided you had
a crystal with nice,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.690
shiny faces on it.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.960
You had a two circle instrument,
and you could

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.040
adjust the crystal so that a
light beam, a very finely

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.140
collimated beam of light, was
focused into an eyepiece.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.745
And you could measure angles to
within not one minute, but

00:01:57.745 --> 00:01:59.900
one second of arc.

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.940
And from this you could deduce
if you could assign Miller

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.130
Indices to the faces.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.389
You could deduce not the
absolute magnitudes of

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.310
translations, but you could
deduce the ratio of them.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.690
And along came x-ray diffraction
and shook

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.680
everything up.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.020
Turns out, sometimes you were
right and other times you were

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.720
wrong, because you had
determined a self consistent

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.480
set of indices, but not the
ones that were correct.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.520
So this is to give you a little
look at the early days

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.050
of crystallography, and to see
if using the way Miller

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.220
Indices are defined you can
calculate the ratio of axes.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.510
Not terribly demanding,
but worth doing.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.360
And we had talked earlier about
these combinations of

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.280
symmetry elements as
constituting the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.040
elements of a group.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.430
And in the second problem
I ask you to take a not

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.100
terrifically simple, but a
fairly complex point group,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.530
4mm, and show that, indeed,
the operations that are

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.820
present satisfy the
group postulates.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.600
And that is worth doing once so
that you convince yourself

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.090
these really are groups.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.740
And then the third problem is
easy to state and it is

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.350
diabolically tricky.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.690
So I'll let you have a go at it,
but don't beat your brains

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.210
against your desktop for an
entire evening over it.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.870
Try it.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.740
If you don't see the solution
to it, all will be revealed

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.220
later on in class.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.650
But it's based on the fact that
the plane groups, which

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.380
we've now derived, 17 of them,
these can be viewed as the

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.970
base level of a three
dimensional space group.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.370
And for each of them, you
could take another

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.360
translation, t3, that was
perpendicular to the plane of

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.200
the group, and just imagine all
of those rotation axes and

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.960
all of those mirror planes
not being two dimensional

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.930
operations, but three
dimensional operations.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.420
The only one where you could
pick the translation,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.330
generally, would be the oblique
lattice, p1, no

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.380
symmetry at all.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.180
And there you could pick the
translation in any orientation

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.130
you wished.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.580
But for each one of the 17 two
dimensional plane groups,

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.040
there is a corresponding three
dimensional space group.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.769
So we got 17 three dimensional
symmetries for free without

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.930
really doing any additional
work.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.120
However, there's one
thing that one

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.400
should not gloss over.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.150
We found that a rotation point
in a two dimensional plane

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.300
allowed only a very limited
number of lattices.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.660
But we were not thinking of
things in terms of three

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:41.500
dimensions.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.660
So what I'm inviting you to do
in the third problem is to

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.610
consider, now, that construction
that we did where

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.890
we showed that rotation angles
were restricted to values of

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.650
cosine of alpha equals
1 minus p over 2.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.910
Now generalize that to a three
dimensional situation, where

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.340
the translation does not have
to be perpendicular to the

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.790
rotation axis, but can
be inclined to it.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.420
Are there additional rotation
axes allowed?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.350
Are their fewer?

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.280
Something we ought to examine.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.450
But there's a little bit of
ingenuity that you have to use

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:20.210
in that proof.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.250
But I invite you to have
a go at it on your own.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.460
So with that tantalizing
introduction that will want to

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.390
send you running home and start
it as soon as we finish

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.580
our class this afternoon, let
me hand out, without any

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.040
further blather, problem
set number five.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.290
Pass that in the back corner.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.390
Last time, without saying much
about them, I handed out this

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:56.150
extract from the international
tables that summarized the 17

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.840
two dimensional plane groups
and their properties.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.770
And I'd like to spend a few
minutes going over the

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.300
considerable information that's

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.750
contained on these pages.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.940
Each one is treated in the same
way, and let me start

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.600
with one that's almost trivially
simple, and that's

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.190
the two-fold axis in
the oblique net.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.880
Across the top of the page you
find, in boldface, the symbol

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.040
for the plane group.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.430
And then, just counting in order
of increasing symmetry,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.620
the number of that particular
plane group in the set.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:39.130
And then a symbol that really
has its full meaning only in

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.760
three dimensions, but it gives
the symbol for the lattice,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:48.230
again, 2 and then a 1 and a 1,
which says that if this were a

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:53.710
three dimensional space group,
there would be a two-fold axis

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.090
in one direction and no symmetry
at all in the other

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.420
two directions.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.080
And then, next comes the symbol
for the point group of

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.780
the crystal.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.422
And we derived this particular
group by dropping point group

00:07:07.422 --> 00:07:09.320
2 into a lattice.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:16.270
And then the coordinate system
that is necessary to describe

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.020
the features of this plane
group, if you take the edges

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:23.660
of the unit cell as the basis
of a coordinate system.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.720
So this is something called
a crystal system.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.300
So for each of the plane
groups, you have this

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.690
information spread across
the top of the page.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:42.950
Then underneath that is a
diagram that, by means of open

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:48.690
circles, shows the way in which
that particular symmetry

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:53.810
moves a motif where atoms, in
the case of a crystal, moves

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.310
atoms around.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:08:01.010
And for p2 we have the pair of
motifs of the same chirality

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.130
related by a two-fold axis.

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.994
And that, then, is hung at
every lattice point of an

00:08:05.994 --> 00:08:07.790
oblique net.

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:14.490
And then, immediately to the
right, is the arrangement of

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:18.360
symmetry elements
in the group.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:22.200
Then, the way in which that
particular plane group can

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.120
move atoms around to generate
a structure is

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.880
summarized for you.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.470
And the first thing they have to
state is where you're going

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:31.720
to choose the origin.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.120
There is no unique
lattice point.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.460
It's convenient to take the
origin at a location of high

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.270
symmetry, and in this case the
smart thing to do is to take

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:47.710
the origin at one of
the two-fold axes.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.060
That's a non trivial question,
because there are some groups

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.600
that have different kinds
of rotation axes.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.350
P4 has a four-fold
and the two-fold.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.960
Taking the origin of the
coordinate system at a

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.370
location of high symmetry, then,
gives you the scope of

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:07.000
picking either a two-fold
or a four-fold axes.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.706
Yes,sir?

00:09:07.706 --> 00:09:10.562
AUDIENCE: On the left hand
figure, what's with the--

00:09:10.562 --> 00:09:13.710
those aren't mirror planes
[INAUDIBLE] are they?

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.015
PROFESSOR: On the--

00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:17.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.620
PROFESSOR: Here they
have this.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:23.570
That's just to split things up
into quadrants, so you have a

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:28.390
feel for how the atoms hung at
the lattice points split up

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:30.510
into different quadrants.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.440
That is a very good
point, though.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.910
Mirror planes are shown
as bold lines.

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:37.600
Sometimes the outlines of the
cell look pretty bold

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.580
themselves.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:43.400
So if you turn the page to pm,
if you have the notes with

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.670
you, can see the lines that are
reference lines for the

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.365
cells are lighter in their
weight than the symbols for

00:09:51.365 --> 00:09:52.290
the mirror planes.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.270
But it's a very subtle
difference.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:57.450
And when you Xerox it a couple
of times it becomes almost

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:59.486
indistinguishable

00:09:59.486 --> 00:10:05.410
AUDIENCE: Can you just say, one
more time, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:10.530
PROFESSOR: That means that this
is the location of 0,0.

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:15.600
And it is always assumed, but
nowhere stated specifically,

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.230
that the origin is in the
upper left hand corner.

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:32.555
And what is also assumed, but
never stated, is that the

00:10:32.555 --> 00:10:40.160
x-coordinate in the a-axis goes
down and the y-coordinate

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.960
in the b-axis goes from upper
left to the right.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.380
That is nowhere stated anywhere
in the international

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.720
tables, but that is the
direction that is assumed for

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:54.010
the reference axes.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:56.430
So we'll take our origin
of the two-fold axis.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.470
That's a sensible thing to do.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:02.210
And then there are two ways
you can look at how the

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:04.720
particular plane group
generates a pattern.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.670
You can do it with little
circles or little commas, or

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:08.590
something like that.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.970
In other words, do
it graphically.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:14.260
But a way to communicate the
atomic arrangement in a

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.700
structure, which is going to be
the most free of ambiguity

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.950
and rigorous, is to do
it analytically.

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.500
And that's what the tables
do for you next.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.760
They give an analytic
description of the way in

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.500
which the symmetry elements
will move an atom around.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.620
For this particular plane group,
things are very simple.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:42.270
This is the direction of x, this
is the direction of y.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:46.390
And if we plop one atom in
here, it will be at a

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.820
location x and y.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:55.270
So that's what happens when
you drop one atom in it.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.930
That atom gets hung at every
lattice point, and it gets

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.330
rotated by the two-fold axis.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.270
So you're going to get two of
them per lattice point.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.300
Somewhat arbitrary which
pair you take.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.714
The coordinates of this
atom are x and y.

00:12:19.714 --> 00:12:24.850
The coordinates of this atom
inside of the box is 1, minus

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.700
x and 1, minus y.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:35.200
That would do it, but it makes
sense, esthetically, and to

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.000
see that the atoms are related
by symmetry, if, instead, you

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.200
specify as the two atoms per
cell the two that are hanging

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.800
at the lattice point.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.130
And in that case, the
coordinates of the first, if

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:54.080
they are x and y, would be
minus x and minus y.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.780
If you have a pair of numbers,
0.283 and 0.456, then minus

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:05.280
0.233 and minus 0.456 leaves
no doubt that these are

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.550
positions that are related
by symmetry.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:13.990
If you have coordinates, like
0.2, 0.3 and then 0.8, 0.7,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:17.490
without doing some arithmetic
in your head, it's not clear

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:20.560
that those are going to be atoms
related by symmetry.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.510
So the coordinates that will be
stated for you, then, will

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:28.560
be the coordinate of the pair of
atoms at the lattice point,

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.450
and some of the coordinates
would be negative.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.220
This is something called
the general position.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.210
And that transformation of
coordinates is different for

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:47.080
every one of the plane groups.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.560
That's what makes
them different.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.170
They're different in the way
they move around an atom in a

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.910
general location and
fill space with it.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.030
So that's the general position,
and it is unique for

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.280
each plane group.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.830
And there are several ways in
which this information is

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.600
conveyed to you.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.740
Move this over a little bit;
x, y and minus x, y.

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:31.510
The first thing that's a
characteristic of the position

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.150
is the number per cell.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:41.660
So you get the number 2, or this
is sometimes referred to

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.100
as the rank of the position.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:52.810
Drop in 1 and you get a second
one out related by symmetry.

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:56.910
The next is, and I'll go to
the last next, this is the

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:58.160
site symmetry.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:09.930
And by definition, this is
always 1, no symmetry at all,

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:11.180
for a general position.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:26.410
So why make a big deal about all
of these characteristics

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:28.290
of the general position?

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.130
The reason is that there are
locations that are termed

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.070
special positions.

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:39.870
And let me clean up this right
hand part of my diagram.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:44.880
And say that, for plane group
p2 you will always get two

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.010
atoms per cell if you
place an atom in an

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.260
unspecialized location.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.260
What would be a specialized
location?

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.490
Suppose we would drop the atom
down right smack on top of

00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.740
that two-fold axis?

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:05.610
Then that two-fold axis is just
going to twirl the atom

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:09.810
around on its axis and it's
not going to map it into a

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.940
second location.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:15.190
So following the general
position is always provided to

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.120
you a set of special
positions.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.500
And what's special about them?

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.900
They are on a symmetry
element.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:41.250
You can look at the
characteristics of a special

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:45.090
position in two ways, either
geometrically or you can do it

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:47.700
analytically, as I'll show
you in just a moment.

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:56.800
Imagine that the atom is to
sit here, x and y migrate

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.800
progressively towards
the location 0,0.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:03.010
And then the other atom related
to it by two-fold

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:06.770
symmetry will move towards it
until finally the two of them

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.639
will merge into just
one single motif.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:16.450
So when that happens you get not
two per cell, you get only

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:18.180
one per cell.

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:21.540
And the reason for that is
the site symmetry is 2.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.790
It's on a two-fold axis.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.890
But there are other two-fold
axes as well.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:36.500
What if the element migrated
to the position 0, 1/2?

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.570
If that were the case, if the
representative atom moves to

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:44.630
here, this one up here will
migrate down and the two will

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:48.360
merge into one atom that
sits at just 0, 1/2.

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:55.072
So there'll be another type of
special position, one per

00:17:55.072 --> 00:17:58.400
cell, also, on a
two-fold axis.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:05.930
This one was at 0,0, and
this one is at 0, 1/2.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.610
You remember, we made a point of
saying that there are four

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:13.280
different kinds of two-fold axes
within this plane group.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:16.160
Different in how they're
positioned relative to a

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.490
pattern, different in that they
are not mapped into one

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.440
another by some other symmetry
element which is present.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:27.720
So each of these four locations
is a location of

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.870
another general position
of rank 2, sitting

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.250
on a two-fold axis.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:36.600
x and y migrate down to 1/2, 0,
and this one and this one

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.840
will come together.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.340
So there's another one, giving
you one per cell, sits on a

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:46.250
two-fold axis, and this would
be at the location 1/2, 0.

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.930
And finally there's another one
in the center of the cell,

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.890
and if you let the atom migrate
to that location,

00:18:53.890 --> 00:18:57.480
again, the atoms will coalesce
pair wise into a single one.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:03.120
So there'll be another one, one
per cell, and also on a

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:06.330
two-fold axis, and this would
sit at the location 1/2, 1/2.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:13.710
And those, then, are the
characteristics of this

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.320
particular simple plane group.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.240
There's another symbol that's
added, and this is something

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.750
called the Wyckoff symbol.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:37.390
Wyckoff was a crystal chemist
who attempted valiantly, back

00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:40.270
in the early days of the
century, when there were a

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:43.440
couple of dozen structures
determined per year because it

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.070
was such a grand, new adventure,
and few people knew

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.180
how to do it.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:54.620
But Wyckoff tried to summarize,
between one pair of

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.970
hard covers, all of the
crystal structure

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.400
determinations that had been
performed in a single year.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:05.250
And he went at this courageously
for perhaps a

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.950
dozen years, and then results
began to accumulate so rapidly

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.890
he just said, the heck with it,
clapped covers on it, and

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:13.520
that was the end of the
series of books.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.670
So they don't get very far,
but it was a real useful

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.500
contribution at the time.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:25.920
This is just a shorthand way of
referring to the position.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.640
And he starts with a for the
most specialized, runs the way

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:33.160
up through the alphabet until
you've assigned a letter to

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.650
each of the positions.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:35.740
This is a nicety.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.730
All these special positions, for
example, sit on a two-fold

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.430
axis, and you don't really
have to specify the

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.430
coordinates, because they have
to be either 0 or 1/2.

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:53.125
So this gives us a way of saying
you have an osmium atom

00:20:53.125 --> 00:20:57.860
in position 1a and you have an
oxygen atom in position 1c.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.990
And it's a nice shorthand way of
avoiding mentioning things

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.640
which could be calculated once
and for all and not stated

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.890
explicitly.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.470
So this, my friends, is the
language in which you will see

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:17.880
structural datas cited, when
people have determined, using

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:21.430
diffraction methods, the
locations of all of the atoms

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:24.500
within the units, some of
a particular material.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:29.940
If the coordinate is variable,
with today's techniques and

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:34.140
high speed computation, you can
get x as a fraction of a

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.330
cell to usually at least
plus or minus 1

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:41.150
in the fourth place.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:42.690
So it's data that can be

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:44.170
determined extremely precisely.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:45.826
Yes sir?

00:21:45.826 --> 00:21:49.242
AUDIENCE: I didn't quite get
the exact definition of the

00:21:49.242 --> 00:21:50.218
general position.

00:21:50.218 --> 00:21:52.660
It's a set of points
related by--

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.500
PROFESSOR: The general position,
it's a set of

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.476
equivalent positions that
are related by symmetry.

00:21:58.476 --> 00:21:59.726
Yeah.

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.800
And the general position,
yeah--

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.900
Each of these is called a set
of equivalent positions,

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:12.460
equivalent in the sense of being
related to one another

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.540
by symmetry.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:20.390
And the entire set is sometimes
referred to as an,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:21.920
singular, equipoint.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:29.500
Sort of a condensed jargon for a
set of equivalent positions.

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:32.730
So when one speaks about an
equipoint of rank 2, in this

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:33.980
case, or rank 1.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.660
Let me just, even for this
trivial two dimensional

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:45.780
symmetry, give you an example of
some information that falls

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.030
out of this immediately.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.210
First of all, you can
use these special

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.320
positions only once.

00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:00.000
If you put an atom in position
1c at 1/2, 0, it's used up.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.010
You can't put another atom in
there in a given structure.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:07.030
Secondly, if you think more
globally, not in terms of

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:09.400
atoms, which, to a good
approximation,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.490
are spherically symmetric.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:13.480
But think in terms of a
molecule, if you're a polymer

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.610
scientist or an organic
chemist.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.670
and not place an individual
atom, but

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.690
place an entire molecule.

00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:23.760
If there's one molecule per
cell in this particular

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:30.800
symmetry, that molecule has
to sit on a two-fold axis.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.840
And that means the configuration
of that molecule

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.470
is going to be limited to
having to conform to a

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.460
two-fold rotational symmetric.

00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.060
So just from the density in the
lattice constitute, if you

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.310
find there's one molecule per
cell, you know that molecule

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.870
has to have two-fold rotational
symmetry.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:52.380
So you can say something about
the structure of the molecule.

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.000
So there are lots of ways in
which the symmetry information

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.050
has something to say about
the arrangement of

00:23:58.050 --> 00:23:59.300
atoms in the structure.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.543
Any further questions?

00:24:06.543 --> 00:24:07.529
Yes?

00:24:07.529 --> 00:24:10.158
AUDIENCE: How did they decide,
between b, c, and d, which was

00:24:10.158 --> 00:24:12.459
the most special form?

00:24:12.459 --> 00:24:14.020
PROFESSOR: That is a
very good question.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:17.970
And the way it's decided is by
you getting there first before

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:19.170
anybody else did it.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:23.340
So everybody follows, now, the
conventions that are given in

00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.640
the international tables.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.320
That's sort of the dictionary
of all these terms.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.440
But you're absolutely right.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.560
What is more special about
this one than this one?

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:39.320
Well, they're all locations
of the same symmetry.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.960
You can turn one into another by
changing the origin of the

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.090
cell, where you're going to
define a lattice point.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:49.810
So they are thoroughly
arbitrary.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:54.890
What is generally done is to
take 0, 0 for your particular

00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.770
choice of origin
as position a.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:03.470
And then what should come
next, 0, 1/2 or 1/2, 0?

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:07.360
The truly observant among you
will notice I snuck a quick

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.280
peek at the international tables
before I wrote one of

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.210
these down.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.750
I can never remember
which is which.

00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:16.440
And it is arbitrary.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.130
Usually you end up with the one
that has both coordinates

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:24.930
non-zero, but that is code
that's embodied in the

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:25.840
international tables.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.160
But that's a good question.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.863
Yes, sir?

00:25:27.863 --> 00:25:34.765
AUDIENCE: How did you decide to
make the motifs [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:34.765 --> 00:25:36.260
special decisions?

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.590
PROFESSOR: Oh, I just changed
the value of x and y.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:42.540
Those are numbers that can be,
for the representative atom,

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.410
each of them can be
between 0 and 1.

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:51.400
So what I just said was, what
will happen if we let x and y

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.420
take on not general values,
but very special values?

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.970
And the special values are going
to be things like 0 and

00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.800
1/2, if I have picked my origin
at a two-fold axis.

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:07.350
It's another reason for picking
your origin at a

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:08.440
location of high symmetry.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.700
AUDIENCE: But how about the
other non-origins of these

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.680
special decisions [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:18.330
PROFESSOR: There are two
ways you can do it.

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:19.480
One of them we just did.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.310
We just looked at the geometry
and we said, if this

00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:25.270
representative atom, this is the
one we define as being at

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:26.670
location x, y.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.720
If x and y both approach 0,
this atom and the one over

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.450
here are going to migrate
towards the origin lattice

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:34.905
point and eventually
just coalesce.

00:26:39.010 --> 00:26:44.120
If I let x and y and migrate,
x go to 0 and y go to 1/2,

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.710
then this one and this
one will come

00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:47.720
together and coalesce.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.740
So that's why I did that,
because I knew that the number

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:55.840
I would generate would be
smaller than the number that I

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.120
would get for a set of
coordinates for an atom that

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:01.140
was off the symmetry element.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:02.650
I said there's another
way of doing it.

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:09.490
For something this simple it is
not really that profound,

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.990
but it is a way of checking
whether you've counted the

00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:14.030
same position twice.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:18.820
I said you can imagine these
special positions arising when

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.310
x and y assume special values.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:27.640
So let's let, for example, x
be 1/2 and y be 0 and plug

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:31.140
those coordinates
into my equation

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:32.620
for the general positions.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.570
So I'll put in 1/2 for x, 0 for
y, and then I'll put in

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:41.850
minus 1/2 for x and
minus 0 for y.

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:45.750
But what goes on at minus 1/2
has to be the same as what

00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:49.550
goes on at plus 1/2, if the
structure is based on a

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:50.920
lattice and periodic.

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:56.690
So what I'm really getting is
1/2, 0, 1/2, 0 twice, which is

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.190
the same as saying, if x is
1/2 and y equals 0, I'm

00:27:59.190 --> 00:28:02.700
putting two atoms together right
on top of one another.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.360
So you can do it analytically.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.910
And for the more complicated
symmetries, where there might

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:12.750
be for 20 or 48 atoms, that's
a good way to see if you've

00:28:12.750 --> 00:28:16.650
looked at the same
position twice.

00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:20.660
So we're going to do a couple
more before we move on, and

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.000
this one is almost
trivially simple.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.750
Any other questions before
we go forward?

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:36.070
Let's take one that is slightly
more complex.

00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:38.180
And I'll go to one of the
rectangular groups.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:51.240
And let me look at, let's take
plane group p2mm, which has a

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.110
fair amount of symmetry to it.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:02.970
So this is the group that we
got by putting 2mm into a

00:29:02.970 --> 00:29:06.840
lattice that had to be
rectangular, then.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:10.180
And across the top of the page,
this is number six,

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.720
you'll see that it
is rectangular.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.820
It has to have a lattice in a
rectangular shape because of

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.050
the symmetry.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.785
Next comes the short
hand symbol.

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.660
And I always feel a little bit
apologetic when I have to

00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:32.090
point out the existence of this,
and the reason is that

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.910
people who work with symmetry
are no more or less lazy than

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.510
any other human being.

00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:41.270
And some of the symbols become
really ungainly when we go to

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.230
three dimensional symmetry.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:52.770
And something like a 2 sub 1
over a 2 over m 2 sub 1 over d

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:54.180
is a mouthful.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.790
And actually what's done is to
just specify the minimum

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:01.290
amount of information, which
defines the symmetry.

00:30:01.290 -.780
So we'll see some more cases
where we can immediately state

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.134
that without further thought.

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:46.460
OK.

00:33:46.460 --> 00:33:49.160
There is something that we
might consider doing.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.900
I'd like to put it
off, though.

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.230
Here we start with
a mirror plane.

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:58.470
Can we replace the mirror plane
with a glide plane?

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.400
The answer is yes, we can.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:05.740
But it's not at all clear if I
take a fourfold axis and put a

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:08.840
glide plane through it, what
this plane has to be.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.710
So I'd like to leave this one
for now and come back to that.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:18.670
OK.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:24.560
In the notes, I've tried to do
all of these derivations

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.520
thoroughly and logically.

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.489
So if this is a bit fast or me
waving my hands, saying a

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:32.540
glide plane is here, and this,
that, and the other thing,

00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:34.980
when you can't really see what
I'm pointing at, I think if

00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:36.570
you refer to the notes
that'll be clear.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:37.699
But yes, you had a question?

00:34:37.699 --> 00:34:40.184
AUDIENCE: So you said that this
glide plane [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:40.184 --> 00:34:41.675
one-half T perpendicular.

00:34:41.675 --> 00:34:43.663
What did you write
underneath that?

00:34:43.663 --> 00:34:48.384
I guess that maybe is where
your T and one-half T

00:34:48.384 --> 00:34:49.850
perpendicular is where
the glide plane is.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:50.190
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:54.380
I was just demonstrating that,
in fact, for this mirror plane

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.760
with the diagonal translation,
the glide plane would come in

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:02.570
at one-half of the perpendicular
part of the

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:04.560
translation.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:09.000
And the part of the
translation that--

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.610
we were combining this fourfold
access with this

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:12.880
translation.

00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:16.310
So the perpendicular part of the
translation is half of the

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:17.770
body diagonal.

00:35:17.770 --> 00:35:20.840
And if a glide plane comes in
one-half of the perpendicular

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.335
part of the translation, that
put it parallel to the mirror

00:35:24.335 --> 00:35:27.760
plane and at one-quarter of the
way of the translation.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.640
So this little scrawl here
says it one-half of T

00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:40.570
perpendicular and one-half of
one-half of the body diagonal.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:42.490
So it's one-quarter.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.170
All this equals one-quarter
of T1 plus T2.

00:35:58.690 --> 00:35:58.960
OK.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:02.480
Now something unexpected
happens.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.770
If we would move along,
I skipped over 3m.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.690
We know what P3 looks like.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:20.420
And that is a hexagonal net,
an equilateral net.

00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.750
And we have a threefold axis
that we've added to the

00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:25.270
lattice point.

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:29.020
And then we found additional
threefold axes in the center

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:31.700
of these triangles.

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:35.410
And, once again, the pattern
that has this symmetry is just

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.310
a triangle of objects hung
at every lattice point.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:46.560
And now we want to add
a mirror plane to

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:49.010
that threefold axis.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:57.240
So we have a primitive
equilateral net plus the

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:05.560
two-dimensional plane
point group 3m.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:08.930
The question is, which
way should we

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:10.220
orient the mirror plane?

00:37:13.890 --> 00:37:16.950
Well, a mirror plane says, I
want to be along the edge of

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.110
either a centered rectangular
net or a

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.760
primitive rectangular net.

00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:23.250
There's nothing about this
lattice that looks

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:25.920
rectangular.

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.346
Yeah, there is.

00:37:27.346 --> 00:37:30.020
I see a couple of people
doing this, and they

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.460
have the right idea.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.560
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:39.340
If we go more than one unit cell
in this diagram, here's a

00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.140
lattice point.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:41.120
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.270
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:43.740
Here's a lattice point.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:51.090
Go down to here and
go over to here.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.350
And lo and behold, here is a
centered rectangular net,

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.320
hiding incognito in
a hexagonal net.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.010
Well, that helps.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:09.800
I can put in the mirror plane.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.680
But let me point out-- this is
getting very messy, so I'll

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.090
redraw it on a smaller scale.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:30.825
This will be worth doing so that
it's perfectly obvious.

00:38:30.825 --> 00:38:35.155
I'm going to draw a number
of equilateral nets.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.880
The reason I'm drawing more than
one cell, I would like to

00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:49.640
point out that here is one
centered rectangular net.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.240
And it has its edge
perpendicular to the

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.830
translations in the
hexagonal net.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:39:03.290
But there is also a rectangular
net that

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.835
goes down like this.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.740
That's a centered rectangular
net that has its edge along

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:18.790
one of edges of the unit cell.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.310
So I have two possibilities.

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.340
One is to draw the rectangular
net like this.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.470
The other one is to draw the
rectangular net like this.

00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:31.500
And having confused you
thoroughly, let me simply draw

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.415
this larger cell again.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.430
And say that I could, if I
wanted to, put the mirror

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:47.210
planes in in these directions,
along the edges of the cell.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.470
OK.

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:56.470
And in this case, if you're
convinced that there's a

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.285
centered rectangular
net sitting there.

00:39:59.285 --> 00:40:02.220
Let me clean this up.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.970
And here's one mirror plane.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.300
60 degrees away is another
mirror plane.

00:40:07.300 --> 00:40:10.580
And there'll be another mirror
plane at this lattice point

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.830
doing this.

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:21.540
So now I've got 3m at every one
of these threefold axes.

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:27.175
And I got all those simply by
repeating these mirror planes

00:40:27.175 --> 00:40:28.380
by translation.

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:31.940
But in one case, the mirror
planes are perpendicular to

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.120
the cell edge.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:37.350
This being T1, let's say,
and this being T2.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.600
In this case, the mirror
planes are along the

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.350
edges of the cell.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.000
This being T1, and
this being T2.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.880
So, holy mackerel!

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.220
One point group.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:53.220
Two different space groups,
which differ in the way in

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:57.845
which the symmetry is oriented
relative to the lattice.

00:41:00.470 -e symmetry m.

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:33.260
And that would be a pair of
objects that has x equal to 0.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:37.360
y is anything, so that's
this mirror plane here.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:42.220
And in that case we'd have a
pair of atoms, left to right,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:46.040
reflected by the mirror plane
that goes through the origin.

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:49.280
And then last one, thank
goodness, is one at a location

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:54.130
1/2, y and 1/2, minus y.

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:59.860
And this would be the mirror
plane exactly at 1/2.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.110
y can be anything.

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:09.050
x is 1/2.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:13.720
So that would be a pair that
sits somewhere on either side

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.940
of the mirror plane running
through the

00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:16.520
center of the cell.

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.700
That's also a site
of symmetry m.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:23.240
Now we assign the Wyckoff symbol
by working our way up

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:23.930
the alphabet.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:30.610
So this is a, this is b, this is
c, this is d, this is e, f,

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:34.350
this is g, this is h,
and finally we end

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:38.040
up at position i.

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:43.210
For all of these, we get
two atoms per cell.

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.720
These have rank 2.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.258
For each of these we get
just a single atom.

00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:53.994
AUDIENCE: Can you explain the
two atom per cell thing?

00:38:53.994 --> 00:38:55.244
How do you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.960
PROFESSOR: Which one would you
like me to do, that last one?

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:01.630
1/2, y?

00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:02.880
AUDIENCE:[INAUDIBLE].

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.570
PROFESSOR: So if x is 1/2 and
y is anything, that's this

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:10.040
locus here.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.050
And that is a mirror plane.

00:39:13.050 --> 00:39:18.710
And if we let this atom move
from its location, x,y, down

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:23.530
to this location, the one in the
lower part of the cell is

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:27.890
going to move up and these two
will coalesce to a blob that

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:28.816
sits there.

00:39:28.816 --> 00:39:30.440
AUDIENCE: That would be 2m?

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.110
PROFESSOR: So this would
be site symmetry m.

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:35.942
And instead of getting four per
cell I would get two per

00:39:35.942 --> 00:39:38.515
cell; this one and the one
that's reflected across.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.220
Now the other way of doing it is
to not think about it all.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:55.920
Say here is x,y, minus x, y, x,
minus y, minus x, minus y.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.900
And then let's make one of the
coordinates specialized.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.370
Let's let x be exactly 1/2.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:09.150
So I'll get 1/2, y, minus 1/2,
y, and then I'll get 1/2,

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:14.370
minus y and minus
1/2, minus y.

00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:19.090
Looks like four atoms, except if
I have one at plus 1/2, the

00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:21.640
one in the neighbor unit
cell is at minus 1/2.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.800
So actually I've had the atoms
coalesce pairwise, because

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:33.200
these coordinates are actually
identical to saying 1/2, y

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.480
plus 1/2, y, 1/2, minus y, and
minus 1/2 is the same as plus

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.650
1/2, minus y.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.790
So you can do it that way.

00:40:42.790 --> 00:40:46.730
Just put in a special value for
x or y, turn the crank on

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:49.140
the general position, and you'll
find you're going to

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:50.390
get the same thing twice.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:05.130
And if we look at position
a, which is 0,0.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:09.990
put in 0 for x, 0 for y, then
put 0,0 for all these other

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.750
four positid there'll have to be a glide
halfway between these

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:45.750
mirror planes, and a glide
that's halfway between these

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:47.150
mirror planes.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:50.060
In this case, the mirror
planes are this way.

00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.980
Again, a translation that's
inclined to the mirror plane.

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.630
We have to have a glide
that is midway between

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.070
these mirror planes.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:02.850
In this case, they're a little
easier to identify.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:06.450
They sort of make a triangular
box that surrounds the

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:09.230
threefold axis.

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:16.390
So now we see another difference
in the plane groups

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.390
and the reason why they're
so very distinct.

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:22.010
And that is the rearrangement of
the glides relative to the

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:24.560
threefold axes are quite
different in these two cases.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.500
So these are two quite
different symmetries.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:35.560
Notice that when we start
identifying special locations

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:38.910
in these two plane groups, here
there is a location only

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:43.520
of symmetry 3mm for a point
group, 3m for a point group.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.560
Here there are two different
locations, one that's symmetry

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.240
3m, the other one is
just symmetry 3.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.720
So this is location of point
group 3 and a location of

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.940
point group 3m.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.960
So the sort of special positions
that exist in these

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:02.610
two plane groups will be
very, very different.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:24.010
One more addition, and then I
think we can leave with a

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:25.950
light heart because
we should be done.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:35.190
What about a primitive
hexagonal net

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.980
combined with 6mm?

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.880
And if you think I'm going
to try to draw

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:42.730
that, you're crazy.

00:46:42.730 --> 00:46:46.410
But I can say quite simply and
hopefully convince you that

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:57.410
this looks like P31M plus P3M1
right on top of one another,

00:46:57.410 --> 00:47:01.370
because we've got mirror
planes that

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.830
are 30 degrees apart.

00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:09.840
So, as a schematic direction and
an invitation to do this

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:15.030
at home in your spare time, is
to take what P6 looks like.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.130
And that's sixfold axes
at the lattice points.

00:47:23.130 --> 00:47:24.660
Threefolds here.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:28.010
Twofolds here.

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.060
And then, directly on top of
this, place the mirrors and

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.910
glides in this orientation, and
the mirrors and glides in

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:35.090
this orientation.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:42.200
So we will have mirror planes
coming out like that, and

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.230
glide planes in between all the
parallel mirror planes.

00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:52.910
As I say, I'm heroic
but not foolish.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:53.305
Yes.

00:47:53.305 --> 00:47:55.110
AUDIENCE: Can you just explain
that derivation again?

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:56.990
Your P3 [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:58.880
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:04.380
The object of this additional
bit of confusion is to put in

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.180
the symbol the point group,
which is 3m, and then tell you

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:11.600
how the mirror plane in a
point group is oriented

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:15.090
relative to the edges
of the cell.

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.410
And we could call them anything
we wanted to.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:22.590
We could call them P3M
perpendicular, subscript

00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.580
perpendicular.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:26.970
Or P3M subscript parallel to
indicate mirror plane parallel

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:30.010
to the cell edge.

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.050
And mirror plane perpendicular
to the cell edge.

00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:35.840
Or we could call them some
obscenity, which would be very

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.580
descriptive, as well.

00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:41.660
But this is just a way of
keeping track of what's

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:43.210
parallel to the cell
edge and what's

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.460
perpendicular to the cell edge.

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:51.510
So, this middle symbol is what's
oriented perpendicular

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.600
to the cell edge.

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.910
And in this case, this is the
mirror plane and that is

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:56.820
perpendicular.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.460
All the mirror planes are
perpendicular to the

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:01.920
edges of the cell.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:04.770
And then parallel to the
cell edge, there's

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:07.350
no symmetry at all.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:08.500
So that's 1.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.020
1 stands for no symmetry.

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:14.050
In this case, the mirror plane
is along the cell edge, so

00:49:14.050 --> 00:49:16.520
there's an M in the
third position.

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:19.360
And perpendicular to the
cell edge, there's

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.130
no symmetry at all--

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:22.380
no symmetry plane at all.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:31.690
So it's purely arbitrary, but
we need some mechanism for

00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:34.380
distinguishing which one
we're talking about.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.750
That pretty much works
as well as anything.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.570
And it's a minor perturbation
of what we've done for the

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.520
additional plane
group symbols.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:47.100
All right.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:51.956
It's time for our midafternoon
break.

00:49:51.956 --> 00:49:55.020
It's a nice place to quit,
because you're probably

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:55.680
feeling good.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:59.530
We've done this, and we can
move on to something new.

00:49:59.530 --> 00:50:01.460
Actually, there's
one more trick.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:04.810
And unless you were really
clever, you wouldn't have

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.730
thought of it.

00:50:05.730 --> 00:50:09.510
But there's another small family
of plane groups that we

00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:12.510
can get through one
particular device.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:14.420
I shouldn't have told you that,
because you'll be less

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.860
inclined to come back now.

00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.730
But we're almost through.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.630
And I think it'll be very clear
what these additional

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:21.880
possibilities are.450 --> 00:48:23.750
Would this be a location for
a special position, this

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:25.665
two-fold axis?

00:48:25.665 --> 00:48:26.915
It was before.

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:31.680
Is it now?

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.850
Key point is independent
sites of symmetry.

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:37.900
There's a mirror plane here.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.620
What goes on here has to
be exactly the same as

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.110
what goes on here.

00:48:44.110 --> 00:48:48.265
So this is not an independent
special position.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.780
In the same way, there's
a mirror plane.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:07.280
And if I let the atom migrate
down to the mirror plane I

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:15.805
will have the mirror plane
at a location 1/4, y.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:23.740
And these will be on
a mirror plane.

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:32.670
1/4, y would be a first, 3/4,
minus y would be the second

00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:35.345
one that I get, and they would
coalesce pairwise.

00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:50.450
Is this is another mirror plane
that could be regarded

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:52.450
as an independent position?

00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:59.330
This mirror plane, again, is not
independent, because it's

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:02.800
related to the one we just
considered by the two-fold

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.080
rotation about the center
of the cell.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.850
So there's only one kind of
mirror plane in the structure.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:12.160
But, going back to the two-fold
axes, there is a

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:13.240
two-fold axis here.

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.970
There's another one that
is halfway along y.

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:21.110
So there's another two-fold axis
that is independent at 0,

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:24.060
1/2, 1/2, 1/2.

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.570
And this is the entire set.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:31.550
So there are three special
positions of rank 2,

00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:32.840
two atoms per cell.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.920
We make the most specialized one
be named a, work our way

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.280
up to c, and the general
position, then, is

00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:40.530
referred to as d.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:47.890
Again, so what I did was to say
that this mirror plane is

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:50.600
related to this one by symmetry,
and if there's

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.390
something on this mirror plane
as a special position, I'm

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:57.220
automatically going to get it
on the lower mirror plane.

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.210
This two-fold axis is the
same as this one.

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:03.500
So whatever is going on as a
result of specializing the

00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:06.870
location on this two-fold axis
is going to be provided for me

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.940
automatically at x equals
1/2 by the action

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:10.900
of this mirror plane.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:13.850
There's nothing that throws this
two-fold axis into this

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.400
one, though, so they're
both independent.

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.070
Now, one of the symmetry
elements that I steadfastly

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:26.310
ignored was the glide plane.

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:31.050
What happens if I place an atom
right on the glide plane?

00:51:31.050 --> 00:51:36.950
A glide plane, if you use a
motif that has some handedness

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:41.050
to it, we repeat the atom
by translating half of a

00:51:41.050 --> 00:51:45.620
translation, not yet putting
it down, first

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.110
reflecting it across.

00:51:47.110 --> 00:51:48.880
This is an enantiomorph.

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:51.750
Doing it again gives me an atom
that's related to the

00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:53.420
first by a translation.

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:02.135
What happens if I let the atom
migrate onto the glide plane?

00:52:02.135 --> 00:52:03.800
Let this atom move
down to here.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.730
Now it sits here.

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:09.610
This one, repeated from
it by glide, will

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:12.470
migrate up to here.

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:14.390
Nothing happens.

00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:17.090
It's just that the amount that
the atom is displaced from the

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:20.330
locus of the glide plane is
different in the two cases.

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:25.490
But there is no coalescence of
the atoms, because of this

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:29.080
translation component
to the glide plane.

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:37.890
So a conclusion, then, is that
glide is never a candidate

00:52:37.890 --> 00:52:39.935
location for a special
position.

00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:03.130
This is a good example of a case
where I can check what

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:05.430
I've done, and to see
if I counted the

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.540
same position twice.

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:10.290
I said that both of
these locations

00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:11.820
are not special position.

00:53:11.820 --> 00:53:13.860
The mirror planes are
related by symmetry.

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:19.150
Suppose I were not clever enough
to notice that, and I

00:53:19.150 --> 00:53:25.910
said, OK, there's going to be
a special position, 1/4, x,

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.970
3/4, minus y.

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:34.490
That's what happened if I
use this mirror plane

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:36.880
as a special position.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:50.900
What would I get if I took
3/4, y and 1/4, minus y?

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:58.140
Looks like a different
specialized position.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.960
But let me put this number into
my expression that is the

00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:03.350
formula for the general
position.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:09.940
If x is 1/4 and y is y, then
this position here would be

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:19.520
minus 1/4 and plus y, 1/2,
minus x would be

00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.880
1/4, and y is y.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:27.160
Over here, I got the same
thing back again.

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:34.630
And 1/2, plus x would be 3/4,
and minus y is minus y, minus

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:37.940
1/2 and 3/4, plus 3/4
are the same thing.

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:42.000
So what I've gotten is the
position 1/4, y, and 3/4,

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.250
minus y twice.

00:54:50.330 --> 00:54:53.915
So what this is telling me,
analytically, if I just plug

00:54:53.915 --> 00:54:57.650
in the coordinates of what seem
to be a distinct, special

00:54:57.650 --> 00:55:02.190
position is, I get the same atom
on top of itself twice.

00:55:02.190 --> 00:55:04.650
And it looks exactly
like choosing the

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:06.520
first mirror plane.

00:55:06.520 --> 00:55:08.630
So that's a good way of
checking, particularly in a

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:12.010
very high symmetry where there
are all sorts of sites of

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:15.500
possible point groups that could
cause coalescence, to

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.530
just crank out the coordinates
and see if, in fact, you have

00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:23.010
exactly the same pair with
the same coordinates that

00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:27.220
correspond exactly to the
x and y of some previous

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:28.710
location that you identified.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:40.340
I think, hopefully, you have
a feeling for how it works.

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:43.980
If you look at some of the
higher symmetries, the number

00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:51.030
of atoms that constitute the
full equipoint set of

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:52.180
equivalent positions.

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:57.510
For p6mm there are 12 locations
in the general

00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.830
position, and because the
coordinate system is oblique,

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.260
x and y get permuted
into linear

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.930
combinations of one another.

00:56:05.930 --> 00:56:10.100
So that's really, extremely
complicated.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.230
If you look at some of the
square symmetries, the number

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:17.650
of the special positions
is very, very high.

00:56:17.650 --> 00:56:22.350
There are two positions
in p4mm, there are two

00:56:22.350 --> 00:56:24.580
positions of rank 1.

00:56:24.580 --> 00:56:29.810
There is a position of rank
2 that sits on 2mm.

00:56:29.810 --> 00:56:33.770
Three different mirror planes,
and the general position with

00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:37.490
rank 8 requires working your way
all the way through g in

00:56:37.490 --> 00:56:38.460
the alphabet.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.792
Yes?

00:56:39.792 --> 00:56:42.272
AUDIENCE: I had a question about
the p2gg [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:45.744 --> 00:56:51.210
whether they're at the entrance
of the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:51.210 --> 00:56:59.360
PROFESSOR: For p2gg, the only
site of point symmetry is a

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:00.610
two-fold axis.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:06.390
So the only thing that you
could use for a special

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:11.550
position in p2gg is
a two-fold axis.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:16.630
And there are two different
two-fold axes.

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:21.950
They relate in a curious way
because of a glide plane.

00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:25.145
And this is a case where the
site of a special position is

00:57:25.145 --> 00:57:28.990
not related by rotation or
reflection, but by a glide.

00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:35.074
P2gg looks like this.

00:57:35.074 --> 00:57:41.800
Two-fold axes in the old
familiar places, 0, 1/2.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:49.000
The glide planes are here,
here, here, and here.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:55.550
So which two-fold axes
are equivalent?

00:57:55.550 --> 00:57:58.920
The glide would take this
two-fold axis, reflect it

00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.370
down, and slide it
over to here.

00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:06.260
So whatever goes on here goes
on at this two-fold axis.

00:58:06.260 --> 00:58:06.742
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:58:06.742 --> 00:58:10.598
I guess my question was, can
you put the glide planes at

00:58:10.598 --> 00:58:11.562
any edges of this sites?

00:58:11.562 --> 00:58:14.940
[INAUDIBLE], or--

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:15.440
PROFESSOR: You could.

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:21.490
You could, but you would lose,
then, the apparent similarity

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:24.011
in coordinates in that, if you
put the glide plane at the

00:58:24.011 --> 00:58:29.150
two-fold axis, if this is x,
y, this one over here is at

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:32.000
minus x, minus y.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.070
And then if you repeat it by
glide, that would slide over

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:39.020
to here and then be reflected
down here.

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:42.140
So there'd be one pair up here
and one pair down here of

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:50.270
opposite handedness, so you
would not see the similarity.

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:53.150
No, that's right.

00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:05.750
If you took the origin at the
glide plane, you would not see

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:09.420
the simple relation between the
numbers that you do when

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:12.680
there is that a rotation
axis of a mirror plane.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:16.840
But you can take the origin
anywhere you want.

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:20.150
And the advantage of doing it at
a symmetry element is then

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:24.990
the numbers that describe where
the atoms sit are simple

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:28.780
permutations of sign, or adding
1/2 to the number of

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:32.120
the preceding atom that was just
mapped to a new location.

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:43.400
I think you're more than
ready for a break.

00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:48.190
Let's resume in 10 minutes, and
we'll move on to something

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:49.440
completely different.

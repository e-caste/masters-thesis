WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
OK. So today we're going to
spend a little bit of time on some

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
elementary chemistry just to develop
our language that we use with one

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
another. And so when I say hydrogen
bond, you don't stare blankly at me

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and scratch your heads. Many
of you have had this already.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
For many of you this is a
review, but it's a useful review.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We believe here at MIT of teaching
things two or three times often,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
the same subject matter, but at
increasing levels of sophistication.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So I do this without apology.
Our first issue here is how are

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
atoms and molecules held together?
And the most familiar way by which

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
atoms and molecules are
held together is, of course,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the covalent bonds. And covalent
bonds have an energy of roughly 80

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
kilocalories per mole. And
that's a rather strong energy to

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
hold together two atoms because
the energy, the thermal energy,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that is the energy at, let's
say, body temperature is about 0.6

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
kilocalories per mole. And,
therefore, if you had a bond,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if there was something holding
things together that was in this

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
range or two or three or four
times higher then the simple thermal

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
energy at room temperature or at
body temperature would be sufficient

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to break apart such a bond.
But, in fact, this energy,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the energy of a covalent bond is
so much higher that it's highly

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
unlikely that thermal energy is
going to break apart a preexisting

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
covalent bond. And I was
just reading yesterday

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
about how people were analyzing
the mitochondrial DNA from some

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Neanderthal bones which were dug
up. The last Neanderthal lived around

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
30,000 years ago, our
recently demised cousins.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And they were analyzing the DNA
sequences. And they got out of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
those analyses stretches of DNA
that were 200, 300 nucleotides long.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And that really is stunning
testimonial to the fact that under

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
very difficult conditions,
nonetheless, complex biological

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
molecules are able to survive
over astounding periods of time,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
indeed those that are held together
by the covalent bonds like this.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Of course, you remember the film
Jurassic Park where they used PCR

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
reaction to resurrect the DNA
of dinosaurs. That's a bit of a

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
fantasy since dinosaurs left us, I
guess, about 150 million years ago,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
something like that.
There's a big difference,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
obviously, between 300,000
and 150 million year ago.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now, the fact is if you look at
the way that molecules are actually

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
hooked up, for instance, let's
look at a water molecule here.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Ideally there should be
no charge on this molecule.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And, in fact, there is no net
charge. But the truth of the matter

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is, if one wants to get frank,
that oxygen molecules, and we always

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
are here, that oxygen molecules
have a greater affinity for electrons

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
than do hydrogen atoms, i.e.,
they are electronegative.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And, therefore, what this means is
that the swarms of electrons that

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
are holding all this together at the
orbitals are drawn more closely to

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the oxygen and the hydrogen atoms,
i.e., the protons are relatively

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
willing to give up their electrons.
And what this means is that there's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
an unequal distribution. And,
as a consequence, there is a

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
fraction of a negative charge here
at this end of the molecule and

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
there are fractions of positive
charges here because it's not as if

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they've totally given up the
electrons, but the electrons are

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
shifted more in this direction.
And this molecule is therefore

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
called a polar molecule by virtue of
the fact that here it has a positive

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
pole and here it has a negative pole.
There are other pairs of molecules

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
which are relatively
equally electronegative.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
For example, here, if we
have a carbon and a hydrogen,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
these two atoms are roughly equally
matched in terms of their ability to

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
pull electrons away,
one from the other. And,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
as a consequence, there is
no net shifting of charge.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And keep in mind that this delta I
show here is only a fraction of an

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
electronic charge. It's
not the entire electronic

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
charge moved over. But this
has important consequences

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for the entire biochemistry that
we're about to get into both today

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and on Monday. Important
because polar molecules,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
such as water like this, are able
to dissolve certain compounds.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And nonpolar molecules, which have
large arrays of these kinds of bonds

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
or carbon-carbon bonds, these
are relatively insoluble in

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
water, and that has important
consequences for the organization of

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
biological membranes. We might
have a carbonyl bond here,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that is a C going to an O via
a double bond. And here we have,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
once again, a situation where the
oxygen is far more avid in terms of

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
its willingness and interest in
pulling electrons toward itself.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And, therefore, the carbon gives up
a little bit of the electron cloud

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and it becomes slightly electropositive.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Whereas, the oxygen atom
becomes slightly electronegative.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, the fact of the matter is that
there are also other bonds that are

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
noncovalent and are much
less energetic. For example,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
let's talk for a moment
about a hydrogen bond.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And it's perhaps easiest to
demonstrate a hydrogen bond by

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
looking at the structure of two
neighboring water molecules in a

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
solution of water of all things.
And, the fact of the matter is,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
let's say we draw one water molecule
down here and one water molecule

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
down here. What will happen is that
this oxygen atom over here by virtue

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of its electronegativity will have
a certain affinity for pulling this

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
hydrogen atom toward itself. And,
in fact, what actually happens

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in real life, whatever that
is at the molecular level,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
is that this hydrogen atom may
actually be bouncing back and forth

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
between these two oxygens. It
may be rapidly an interchange

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
between them. This interchange
causes a strong association between

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000
two neighboring water molecules.
And, indeed, represents the reason

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
why water does not vaporize at
room temperature because the water

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
molecules have a strong affinity
or an avidity for one another.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And, therefore, just to take some
illustrations out of the book,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
this is the way it's
illustrated in the book.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Probably good to have a screen down.
And here you can see the way that

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
water molecules are actually
arrayed in water. This is the lower

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
illustration here. Just
to indicate to you that the

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
hydrogen atoms are not really the
possession, the ownership of one

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
molecule of water. They're
just constantly being

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
exchanged back and forth. And
this back and forth exchange,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
this sharing of a hydrogen atom
is what enables a hydrogen bond of

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
roughly 5 kilocalories of energy
per mole to hold things together.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
5 kilocalories is not much.
It's only one order of magnitude

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
above 0.6 rather than being
two orders of magnitude.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And, therefore, if one raises the
temperature to the level of boiling,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
if the temperature is high enough,
the thermal energy is high enough to

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
rip apart these
kinds of associations.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Now, if we were to go back here to
look at this carbonyl atom we would

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
find the following sort of situation.
Here we have this unequal sharing

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of electropositive and
electronegative bonds.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Let's put an acidic group like
this. This is a carboxylic acid right

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000
here. Here we see a carbon
bond to a hydroxyl here via

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
this oxygen atom.
Here, once again,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
we have an electronegative atom.
And, in fact, if we talk about an

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
ionized acid, normally in the
absence of ionization there would be

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
a net zero charge right here.
But at neutral pH it may well be

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the case that the association,
for various reasons, between this

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
oxygen and this hydrogen will allow
the hydrogen, or rather the proton,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the nucleus of the hydrogen
atom to just wander away.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And, therefore, we can imagine
there could be a net negative

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
charge here. A whole,
this has one full electron,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
electronegative charge here,
the charge of one electron,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and this proton will have ionized,
will have left the carboxylic group

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
in which it originated, and
now we have an ionized acid

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
group. Either before or
even after this ionization,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
there is a strong affinity of the
carboxyl group with the water around

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
it because let's look at what
happened before the ionization

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
occurred. This carbon
here is strong and

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
electronegative. And,
therefore, it will participate

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in hydrogen bonding to
the water solvent here, i.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
., this proton will be shared a
bit between the oxygen of the water

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
molecule and the oxygen right here.
Similarly, here this oxygen will be

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
slightly electronegative for
the reasons I've just described.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And here, once again, there may be
some weak hydrogen bonding going on.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Although, not as effective as over
here where we have a double-bond

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
where we have a lot of concentration
of a cloud of electrons pulled

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
towards the oxygen atom. And
this begins to give us clues as

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to why certain molecules are soluble
in water and others are insoluble.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
For example, if we look
at aliphatic compounds.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Let's look at a compound
that's structured like this.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I guess most people
would call this

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
pentane. And we can call it
that, too. And this has no

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
electronegativity or positivity by
virtue of the equal affinities of

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
these two kinds of atoms, that
is the hydrogen and the carbons

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
for electrons. And
as a consequence,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
this will not be able to form any
hydrogen bonds with a solvent around

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
it if the solvent
happens to be water.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So there's not good bonding here.
And this will, in fact, also if one

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
puts this in a solution of water,
this will cause all the water

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
molecules to line up in a certain
way, almost a quasi-crystal around

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the aliphatic molecule.
They'll be ordered in a certain

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000
layer around the aliphatic molecule
without being able to form any

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
strong hydrogen bonds with them.
And this ordering represents a loss

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
of chaos, a loss of entropy.
Entropy is chaos. It's disorder.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
It's what happens, let's say, at
10:55 when we all leave the room,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
all of a sudden order
becomes chaotic. And here,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
before this lining up occurred,
the water molecules were chaotically

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
arrayed throughout the solvent.
After this lining up occurred there

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000
was a loss of entropy,
there was a loss of chaos.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And thermodynamics tells us that
generally the ordering of molecules

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is disfavored. And
consequently we now have two

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
reasons why this molecule doesn't
like to be in the midst of water.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
First of all, it's unable to form
hydrogen bonds with the solvent.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And second of all there is
a decrease in the entropy,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
in the chaos that occurs when this
molecule directly confronts water.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And because of those two reasons it
turns out that this molecule doesn't

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
like to be in water.
The aliphatic molecule,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
as one would call this in organic
chemistry, doesn't like to be in

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
water. And a dislike of water is
often called its hydrophobicity,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
or we often call it hydro,
might as well spell it right,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
hydrophobic, i.e., it
really hates to be in water.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
In fact, class, there's
a second meaning for

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
hydrophobia, or hydrophobic
has a second meaning.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Every five years I ask a class
to see who knows what the second

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
meaning of hydrophobia is.
This is really obscure. Sorry?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Rabies, right. The TAs
aren't allowed to answer that.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
If somebody has rabies, at one
stage of rabies, almost near

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
the terminal stage, the
individual becomes hydrophobic

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because he or she doesn't like to
drink water, for reasons that are

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
obscure at least to
me. Now, conversely,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
molecules that have carboxyl group
on it would be called hydrophilic.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And, as we'll see over this
lecture and the next one,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
these hydrophobic and hydrophilic
tendencies tend to have great

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
affects on the overall
behavior of molecules. Let's,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:55.000
for example, imagine a situation
where we have a long aliphatic tail

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
like this. In fact, these
tails can go on in certain

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000
aliphatic compounds. They
can go on for 20 or even 30

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
carbons. And at the end of this,
let's just put arbitrarily a

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
carboxyl group. And
let's say we ionized it.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So here's an acidic group that's
ionized. It's shed its proton.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It's actually acquired a negative
charge. And now we have something,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
this molecule is a bit schizoid.
Because on one end of it,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
it loves to be in water, the other
end of it hates to be in water.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And this has strong affects.
It's sometimes called amphipathic,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
but we don't need to
worry about that word. And,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
therefore, this carboxyl
head loves to stick its head,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to immerse its head in water.
And these things, the aliphatic

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000
portion hates to be in water.
Now, as a consequence of these

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
rather conflicted feelings that
these molecules have about water,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we can ask the question what
happens when we put such molecules

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
actually into water? And
what we see here is the

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
following. That if we were
to construct, for example,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
a molecule of the sort that has here,
in this case we're talking about a

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
molecule that has two hydrophobic
tails. We'll get into its detailed

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
structure shortly, but just
imagine for a moment two

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
long hydrophobic tails out here
ended with a hydrophilic head.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And under such situations, if
we put thousands of these or

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
millions of these molecules
into a solution of water,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
what we will then see is, no
pointer? All right. Pointer?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
All right. What we will then see
is that the hydrophilic head groups,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
which are here depicted in red,
will point their way outwards,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
they will want to stick
their heads in water.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And conversely the hydrophobic tails
fleeing from the water will actually

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
associate one with the other.
And so you have a structure that's

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
called, in this case, an a
micelle where you form this

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
little globular sphere where the
lipid tails are tucked inside.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And, therefore, are actually being
shielded from any direct exposure to

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
water. This structure down here,
the lipid bilayer, is actually, as

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
we will discuss in greater detail
shortly, the overall topology of the

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
way most biological
membranes are organized.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
In fact, virtually all of them.
Why is that? Because biological

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
membranes separate two
hydrophilic or two aqueous spaces.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Thank you, sir. A gentleman you
are. So here is an aqueous space

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000
and here is an aqueous space. And
as we see the hydrophilic heads

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
are immersed or sticking their
heads into the hydrophilic space.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
This is called a lipid bilayer.
And, obviously, it's highly

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
effective for separately
these two aqueous compartments.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
In eukaryotic cells, as I mentioned
last time, there is an enormous

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
premium placed on separating
and segregating different aqueous

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
compartments which is invariably
achieved through the device of

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
constructing these lipid bilayers.
Here's a vesicle. A vesicle is

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
more complicated than a micelle.
Because if you look at the membrane

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
lining the vesicle, you
see it's actually a lipid

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
bilayer, but one that in
3-dimensional space is actually a

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
sphere. And in the case of this
vesicle, we can well imagine that on

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
the inside of the vesicle
water is kept, can be stored,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
and on the outside of the
vesicle water can be stored.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And many of the membranes that we
see within the cytoplasms themselves

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
are actually constructed
on this kind of design.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
So when we draw, for example,
in this case the Golgi

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
apparatus, which I mentioned to
you in passing last time we met,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
each one of these membranes here,
it's obviously drawn as a double

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
line, but whenever you
see a membrane indicated,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
implicit in that drawing is the fact
that each one of these membranes is

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
actually a bilayer. There
are never any monolayers of

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
lipids in living cells. Each
one of these vesicles you see

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
here is actually a lipid bilayer
with an aqueous inside and,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
once again, aqueous on the outside.
Again, much of the thermodynamic

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
stability that allows these vesicles
to remain intact rather than just

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
diffuse apart is created by these
hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:45.000
which tie such molecules
together or will rip them apart.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Now, in truth there are yet other
kinds of forces that govern the

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
affinity of molecules to one
another. For example, let's imagine a

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:02.000
situation where we have an ionized
acid group of the sort we just

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
talked about before.
Now, by the way,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
here, let's say I'll draw the
negative charge on one of these two

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
oxygens, if you can see that. But
the truth is that the electrons

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
are swarming back and forth, and
so the negative charge is shared

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
equally, the negative one electron
charge is shared equally between

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
these two oxygen atoms. And
this is obviously an area of

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
great electronegativity.
Independent of that,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
let's imagine up here we have a
basic group, let's say an amine

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
group over here. And,
the fact of the matter is,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
amine groups, NH2 groups,
that's what an amine is,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
here's an amine group.
This is a carboxylic group.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And the amine group, which is
used very often in biochemistry,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
actually has an affinity. It has
an unpaired set of electrons on the

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
nitrogen, and so it likes
to attract protons to it,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
which makes it, causes
it to be called basic.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And this attraction, the
scavenging of protons,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
perhaps from the water, will
obviously give this whole group here

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
a net positive charge, a charge
equal to the charge of one

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
proton. Here, once again,
we can imagine this is

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
hydrophilic because this charge
group can once again also associate

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
quite intimately
with aqueous solvent.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Now, independent of any other
forces that might exist here,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
indeed one could imagine situations
where there is a sharing of a proton.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
And, therefore, a hydrogen
bond formed between these

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
two. Independent of that is the
simple electrostatic interaction of

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
these two groups. That is
the mutual attraction of

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
positive and negative groups,
one to the other. And the

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
electrostatic interactions, you
cannot quantify exactly how many

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
kilocalories a mole there is because
the energetic value in electrostatic

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
interaction is equal to one over
r squared where r is the distance

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000
between these two charged groups.
And obviously the further apart you

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
get the weaker the attraction with
one another. There are also what

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
are called van der Walls
interactions. There are largely of

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
interest to a very small
community of biochemists.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
You probably will never, you
may never hear this term again

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
in your life. And van der
Waals interactions come

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
from the fact that if we
were to have, for example,

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
two molecules over here which are
not normally charged in any way,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000
let's just talk about two aliphatic
chains again. And I won't put in

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
all the protons and everything,
but just imagine a situation like

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
this. What will happen is that
because of the fluctuations of

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
electrons, because the electrons are
swimming around here all the time,

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
moving from one area to the next
they're never equally distributed

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
homogenously over a long period of
time, there will be brief instance

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
in time, microseconds or even
nanoseconds when there happens to be

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
more electrons over
here than right here.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Just by chance. And
this area of unequal

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
distribution of electrons will in
turn induce the opposite kind of

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
electron shift in a
neighboring molecule down here.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Obviously, depending on
the distance between them.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
But the negative here will
repel electrons down here.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
The positive here will
attract electrons down here.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And so you will have these two
quasi-polar arrangements here and

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
here, very ephemeral, that
is lasting for a very short

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
transient period of time.
But, nonetheless, sufficient to

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
give a very weak interaction
between these two molecules which may

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
persist only for a microsecond
and then be dissipated because the

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
charges then
redistributed once again.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And, as a consequence of that, one
has very weak interactions which,

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
in the great scheme of things,
play only a very minor role in the

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
overall energy which holds
molecules together. Now,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
with that background in mind,
let's begin to elaborate on it,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
on how we can make molecules that
have interesting properties that

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
enable them, among other things,
to participate in the construction

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
of lipid bilayers, which
will be the first object of

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
our attentions today in
terms of actual biochemistry.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
So here's a fatty acid.
We see that up here. I,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
in effect, drew you the structure
of a fatty acid up here already once

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
before. And what we can see
is through a linkage known as

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
esterification we can create
this molecule. So what do I

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
mean by esterification? Well,
in this case we're talking

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000
about a situation here where we have
a carbon atom over here like this

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
with a hydroxyl group. You
see it over here. And what

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
we're doing is we're dehydrating
this, we're pulling out one net

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
molecule of water. And
each time we do that,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
on three separate occasions,
what we end up doing is to create

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
instead of this is to create a
covalent bond between these two.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
And so the end product
of dehydrating this,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
pulling out one net molecule of
water is that we end up with a

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000
structure that
looks like this.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And you see that happening on at
least three different occasions,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
here, here and here. Well, actually,
I should put a carbon over here.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
So here we have
three esterifications.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
The hydroxyl group in each case is
reacting with a carboxyl group here

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
pulling out one water, and
each case creating what's called

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
triacylglyercol or triglyceride.
Triglyceride refers to the fact

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
that we started here with a glycerol
and we have now esterified it.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Now, in fact, there are
two directions here in this

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
kind of reaction.
Esterification is the kind of

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
linkage that we just showed here.
And the truth is that vast numbers

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
of biochemical linkages are made
by esterification reactions and

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
reversed by reactions that
are called simply hydrolysis.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
And, in this case, what we're
referring to is the fact that if one

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
were to reintroduce a water molecule
into each of these three linkages,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
one, two and three, we would break
the bond and cause this entire

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
structure to revert to the
two precursors that existed or

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
preexisted prior to these
three esterification reactions.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
And time and again you'll
see, over the next weeks, that

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
esterification reactions are
important for constructing different

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
kinds of molecules. Now,
the fact of the matter is we

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
can do other kinds of modifications
of a glycerol like this.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Here what we've done, instead
of adding a third fatty acid,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
note what was done here. Here
through an esterification,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
let's look up at this one here,
instead of adding a third fatty acid,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
we've saved, we've reserved one of
the three groups of the glycerol.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Here's what we saw just before.
We've saved one of the three groups

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000
of the glycerol and put on instead
this highly hydrophilic phosphate

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.000
group, once again through
a dehydration reaction, an

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
esterification reaction. And
now what we've done is add

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
insult to injury because in the
absence of this phosphate it would

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
have a hydroxyl here which is
mildly hydrophilic. But now look how

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
strongly charged this is.
Here are two negative charges,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000
one electron each. And this is
already a bit electronegative.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
So here we have an extremely
potent hydrophilic entity.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
And here the degree of
schizophrenia between one end of the

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
molecule and the other is
greatly exaggerated. Here,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
in fact, this is
extremely hydrophilic.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
And, as a consequence of that,
this really likes to stick its head

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
inside water. And when we therefore
talk about, we draw the images of

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
different kinds of membranes,
like this I showed you before the

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
two tails. Here you saw the two
tails I drew before in that diagram.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Here's what we can imagine they
actually look like in more real

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
molecular terms. And the
hydrophilic heads sticking

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
in the water, this is just
repeating what we saw before,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:03.000
become even more hydrophilic if
we look at a molecule like this.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Let's look at this thing here.
Here's a very long hydrophobic tail.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Here are the two glycerols once
again. Here is the phosphate.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
And keep in mind that phosphate
obviously has these extra oxygens.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Phosphate can react with
more than just one partner,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
the glycerol down here. In
this case we've added this group

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
up here. And this group up here
is, once again, this happens to be a

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
serine which is an amino acid,
this also happens to be quite

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
hydrophilic. Here's
our old friend the basic

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
amino group. Here's the carboxyl
group. This is a bit hydrophobic,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
CH2. And then we once again
have the hydrophilic head here.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And, therefore, we imagine,
if we look at what's called a

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
space-filling model, and a
space-filling model really is

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
intended to show us what one
imagines if one had this vision,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000
which we don't have, how much space
each of these atoms would actually

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
take up if one were
able to see them.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
And here we see this space filling
model. This lipid molecule here is

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
actually slightly kinked with its
hydrophilic head tucked into the

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
water space. And so here's actually
the way that many biological

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
membranes look in terms of the
way that they are constructed.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Now, the fact of the matter is this
also affords the cell the ability to

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
segregate contents on one or the
other side of whatever lipid bilayer

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000
it happens to have constructed.
And here we can see about the

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000
semi-permeability, how
permeable these membranes are to

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
different kinds of molecules.
Permeability obviously refers to

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the ability of this membrane to
obstruct or to allow the migration

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
of molecules from
one side to the other.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Ions, and these ions we see
right here are obviously highly

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
hydrophilic by virtue of
their charge. That's explains,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
in fact, why, for example,
table salt goes so readily into

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
solution, because it readily
ionizes into sodium, NA and CL,

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000
which then are avidly taken
up by the water molecules.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
So these are highly hydrophilic
ions. And the questions is,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
can they go from one side
of the membrane to the other?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
And the answer is absolutely
not or highly improbably. Why?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Because these are so highly
hydrophilic, the water molecules

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
love to gather around them and form
hydrogen bonds and electrostatic

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
bonds with them. And if
one of these ions ventures

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
over here, it's going from an area
where it's warmly embraced by the

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
solvent molecules to an area where
these molecules intensely dislike

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
these ions. And, therefore,
thermodynamically the

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
entrance of any one of
these ions into the membrane,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
into the hydrophobic portion of
the membrane is highly disfavored,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
which makes the membrane essentially,
for all practical purposes,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
impermeable. The same
can be said of glucose

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
which happens to be a carbohydrate.
We'll talk about it shortly. But

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
it's also nicely hydrophilic.
It also can go in water. In fact,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000
it can go through. And
it's actually the case,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000
to my knowledge, that one doesn't
really understand to this day why

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
lipid bilayers are
reasonably permeable to water.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
You would say, well, water
shouldn't be able to go

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
through. It clearly
doesn't have to have a

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
net positive or negative charge,
but the physical chemist, if you

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
asked them why does water,
why is water able to go through

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
lipid bilayers?
They'll say, well,

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:41.000
we've been working on that and we'll
get you an answer in the next five

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
or ten years. And they said that
40 years ago and 30 years ago,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and they're still saying it. And
we don't really understand why

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
water goes through, which
is an embarrassment because

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
here's one of the fundamental
biochemical properties of living

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
matter that is poorly understood.
Gases can go right through.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
And amino acids, ATP,
glucose 6 phosphate,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
highly hydrophilic, can
also not go through. Now,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
the advantage of this is that a cell
can accumulate large concentrations

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
of these molecules either on the
inside or it can pump them to the

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000
outside. In other words, it can
create great gradients in the

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
concentrations of different
kinds of ions. For example,

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
in many cells, the concentration
of calcium, CA++ is a thousand times

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
higher on the outside of the cell
than on the inside of the cell which

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
is a testimonial to how impermeable
these lipid bilayer membranes are.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
The fact of the matter is I'm
fudging a little bit here because in

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
the lipid bilayers of the
plasma membrane of the cell,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
the outer membrane of the cell that
we talked about in passing last time,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
there are ion pumps which are
constantly working away pumping ions

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
from one side to the other overcomes
the little bit of leakage which may

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
have occurred if a calcium ion
happens to have snuck through in one

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
direction or the other. And
we end up expending a lot of

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
energy to keep these ion gradients
in appropriate concentrations on the

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
outside and the inside. In
fact, virtually all the energy

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.000
that is expended in our brain,
almost all of it is expended to

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
power the ion pumps which are
constantly insuring that the

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
concentrations of certain ions
on the outside and the inside of

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:36.000
neurons are kept at their
proper respective levels.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
It could therefore be that actually
more than half of our metabolic

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
burden every day is expended just
keeping the ions segregated on the

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
outside and inside of cells.
For example, potassium is at high

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
levels inside cells, sodium
is at high levels outside

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
cells, just to site some
arbitrary examples. There are also,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
by the way, as I mentioned
last time, channels.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
And channels are actually just
little doughnut shaped objects which

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
are placed, inserted into lipid
bilayers in the plasma membranes and

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.000
just allow for the passive
diffusion of an ion through them,

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
through the doughnut hole enabling
an ion, so if here's the lipid

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:22.000
bilayer, not showing its two things,
these kinds of doughnut shaped

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
protein aggregates will allow
the passage of ions in one

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
direction or another. And
here energy is not being

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
expended to enable this passage.
It may just be through diffusion.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
If there's a higher concentration
of ion on side of the lipid bilayer

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
and a lower one on this side, this
diffusion will allow the ion to

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000
migrate through the bore of the ion
channel from one side to the other.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
In fact, even though this does not
involve the expenditure of energy on

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
the part of the cell, the
cell may actually use a gating

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
mechanism to open or
close these channels.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
When the channels are closed
then the ions cannot move through.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
When the channels are gated open
then diffusion can take over and

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
insure the transfer, the
transportation of ions from one

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
side to the other.
Now, having said that,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
we can begin to look at yet
other higher level structures.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Here, by the way, is a better
drawing than the one I provided you.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
This comes from your book
of what a vesicle looks like.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Here's what it looks like under the
electron microscope and here's what

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
it looks like when a talented rather
than hapless and hopeless artist

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
like myself tries to draw it. So
let's just say that's our intro

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
into lipids and membranes. And
let's move onto the next layer

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
of complexity. And the
next layer of complexity in

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
terms of molecules
represents carbohydrates.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
And when we talk about a
carbohydrate amongst ourselves we're

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
talking about a molecule which,
roughly speaking, has one carbon

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
atom for every water molecule.
And we'll shortly indulge ourselves

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
in talking about all kinds of
different carbohydrate molecules.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Here is really one of the most
important carbohydrate molecules,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
glucose. And what should
we note about glucose?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Well, the first thing you should
see is that glucose has six carbon

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
atoms. And, therefore, as
a consequence it's called a

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
hexose. We're going
to talk about pentoses

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
very shortly. They only have five,
to state the obvious. Glycerol,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
which we talked about before,
is also considered in one sense a

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
carbohydrate, but it's been
called by some people a triose.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:53.000
It only has three carbon atoms.
And you can imagine, therefore, in

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
principal that there are certain
biochemical mechanisms which indeed

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
exist which enable one to
join two glycerol molecules,

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.000
one to the other, to create
something like a hexose, glucose.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
In fact, what we see from this
drawing, expertly drawn by yours

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
truly, is that the hexose molecule
isn't really a linear molecule in

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
solution. What happens is that
because of various steric and

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
thermodynamic forces it likes to
cyclize. So let me just mention,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
I've just used two words
that are useful to know about.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Steric or stereochemistry refers
to the 3-dimensional structure of a

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
molecule. And, obviously,
the stereochemistry of a

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000
molecule is dictated by the
flexibility with which participating

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
atoms can form bonds, whether
we have a trivalent atom

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
like nitrogen or a tetravalent
atom like carbon or a monovalent

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
like hydrogen. And
these structures,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
the stereochemistry is dictated both
by what atoms are present here and

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
by thermodynamic considerations
which cause this particular hexose,

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
indeed virtually all hexoses,
to cyclize. When I say cyclize,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
obviously I mean to form a circular
structure. Here we note one thing.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
You can see how the hydroxyl here
actually attacks the positively

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
charged carbon here in order
to form this cyclic structure.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
You see one of the six points on
this hexagonal structure here is

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000
oxygen. It's not carbon at all.
So there is one oxygen and five

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
carbons. And one of the carbons is
relegated, is exiled to outside of

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
the circle. It's sometimes called
an extracyclic because it's sticking

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
out from the actual circle. And
this is the structure in which

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:06.000
glucose actually exists
inside cells. And, in fact,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
there is, in truth, two
alternative ways by which

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
glucose can cyclize, whether
the oxygen attacks the

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
carbon on the carbonyl
group underneath or on top.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And you see that gives us
two alternative structures.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
What's different about them?
Well, if we think about this hexose

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
as existing in a plane, or
the hexagon is in a plane

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
In this case the oxygen is above the
plane and the hydrogen is below the

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
plane. With equal probability you
can have these two atoms reversed

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
where hydrogen is now above the
plane and hydroxyl is below the

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
plane. And both of these structures,
these alternative structures can

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
fairly be considered to be glucose.
Now, let's get a little bit more

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
complicated. Here we have
fructose and we have galactose.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:04.000
And what we see here is, by the
way, that we have exactly the

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
same number of carbon atoms and
hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms but

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
they're hooked up slightly
differently. And here now we begin

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
to get very picky about the
disposition, the orientation of

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
these different kinds of
hydroxyls and hydrogens.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
And note, by the way, here
that in many cases one doesn't

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
even put in the H for the hydrogen.
It's just implied by the end of

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
this line. And here,
if you were to look at

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
this, you'll see here now we
have two extra cyclic carbons.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Here's galactose which
is yet another hexose.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
These are all hexoses, but
their stereochemistry creates

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
quite different kinds of structures.
And it turns out that this

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000
stereochemistry is extremely
important. These molecules function

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
very differently,
one from the other.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
And, for example, to the
extent that glucose is used

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
in different kinds of energy
metabolism and to the extent that

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
galactose is not, there
must be certain biochemical

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
mechanisms in which one has
catalysts, the catalysts that we

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
call enzymes that ensure that one
can convert one of these hexoses

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
through an enzyme into, let's
say a less useful one into a

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
more useful one, glucose,
which can readily be burnt

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
up by the energy-generating
machinery. Here we've gone yet

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
another order of magnitude more
complex because we've gone from a

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
monosaccharide, i.e.,
one or another hexose,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
to a disaccharide. And
here's common table sugar.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
And here you see that it's formed
once again through an esterification

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
reaction, i.e. there is
a dehydration reaction

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
between this hydroxyl here
and this hydroxyl here.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
And biochemists take the
orientation of these hydroxyl and

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.000
hydrogen groups very seriously.
Now, you can say they're a bit

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
obsessive. Indeed
they probably are.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.000
But, nonetheless, we can
admit that the specific

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.000
orientations of all these things
dictate very importantly the

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000
difference between here, in
this case sucrose, and in this

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
case lactose. Why is this important?
Well, this is the sugar in milk

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
sugar. This is the dominant
sugar in milk sugar,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
lactose. And half the world,
as adults, cannot absorb this.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
All kinds of unpleasant things
happen when they actually

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
drink milk. How many
people here are lactose

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
intolerant? It's nothing to be
ashamed of. I'm married to a very

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
lactose intolerant person.
She's otherwise very nice.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
The fact is that the enzyme
to break down lactose,

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.000
it's an enzyme which is called
lactase. And here we have yet

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000
another nomenclature item.
So lactase is the enzyme which

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000
breaks down lactose.
And, by the way,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
this is just the harbinger of many
other enzymes we're going to talk

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
about in the future that
end in A-S-E. Whereas,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
carbohydrates, many of them end
in O-S-E, as you've already sensed.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
So it turns out that the enzyme
lactase is made in large amounts by

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
most mammals very early in life.
Why? To be able to breakdown the

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000
milk sugar that comes
in their mother's milk.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
But once mammals are weaned there's
no reason on earth for them to

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
continue to make lactase,
in their stomach for example.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
And, as a consequence, in most
mammals the production of lactase is

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
shut down later in life. And
for some weird quirk of human

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000
history, a significant proportion
of humanity has learned how to retain

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
the ability to make lactose
through adulthood. And,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
as a consequence, people
can go and have ice cream

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
until the age of 70, 80
or 90 without becoming very

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000
bloated. And we don't
need to get into all

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
the details, but you can begin
to imagine. And what happens is,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
therefore, the lactase enzyme
is shut down in their stomach.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
It depends. Sometimes they lose
it at the age of 10 or 15 or 20.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
And then, for the rest of their
lives, whenever they have a milk

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
containing product, in
fact, my son is also lactose

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
intolerant. I'm surrounded
by these people. Again,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
he is otherwise a tolerant person
but he's lactose intolerant.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
So this lactose molecule
will go into the stomach,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
it will remain undigested,
it will remain a disaccharide

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
instead of being cleaved
into two monosaccharides.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
The two monosaccharides are no
problem because they can readily be

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:47.000
interconverted. The
galactose can be readily

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
converted into glucose,
and glucose is the universal

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
currency of carbohydrate energy.
And so this disaccharide passes

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
through the stomach unaltered
and it gets into the intestines,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
in the small intestine
and the large intestine.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And it turns out we have more
bacterial cells in our gut than we

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
have our own cells in the
rest of the body. Imagine that.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
And there are a lot of bacteria
that are waiting around in the gut

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
for just a little gulp of lactose.
And they never get it because most

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
people break down their lactose long
before it gets into the intestine.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
But here we have these
lactose intolerant people.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
The disaccharide gets into the
gut and the bacteria go to town.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
They've been waiting around for
years, decades for a little bit of

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
lactose. And now it finally
arrives and they go to town,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
ad they start metabolizing it and
they ferment and they produce lots

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
of gas and other kinds of
byproducts. And, as a consequence,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
this makes people very
uncomfortable. Just to show you,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
now, the fact is that lactose
intolerance people can perfectly

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
well break down sucrose,
obviously. This is one of the great

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
energy sources from plants.
But they cannot break this down.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
And I emphasize that point to
indicate that the stereochemical

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
differences between different
kinds of carbohydrates makes a very

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000
important difference. An
enzyme like sucrase will break

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
down the sucrose but it
will not touch lactose.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
So there's a high degree of
stereospecificity as it's called in

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
the trade. Here we now go to
another step forward that we're

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
going to pursue in much
greater detail next time.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Because here, for the first time,
we talk about polymerization. We're

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
making polymers. Where the
large number of hydroxyl

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
groups on these monosaccharides
affords one many opportunities to

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
make very long linear aggregates
end-to-end like this or even side

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
branches. If you imagine that
each one of these hydroxyls,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:58.000
in principle, represents a site
for possible esterification,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:03.000
i.e., the formation of a bond
to a neighboring side chain.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Here we see these two linear chains
and here we see the branch which is

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
afforded, which is made possible by
the availability of these unutilized

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
hydroxyl side chains which are
just waiting around to participate,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
if the opportunity allows them,
in some kind of esterification

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
reaction to form a covalent bond.
Here is, by the way, glycogen,

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
which is the way we store
a lot of sugar in our liver.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Here's a starch, which
is what we get from many

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000
plants. And here's another
very interesting polysaccharide.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
It's called cellulose. And
we cannot digest cellulose,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
but termites can. And why they
can is something we'll have to wait

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
until next time to learn about.
Have a great weekend. See you on

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Monday.

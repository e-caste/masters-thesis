WEBVTT

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.860
MICHALE FEE: OK, good
morning, everyone.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.810
OK, so today we are
going to continue

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.600
the process of building
our equivalent circuit

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.060
model of a neuron.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.040
This model was actually
developed in the late '40s

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.350
and early '50s by Alan
Hodgkin and Andrew

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.180
Huxley, who started working on
the problem of understanding

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.680
how neurons make
action potentials.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.310
And so they studied
the squid giant axon,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.340
which is actually a
very cool preparation,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.520
because that axon is actually
about a millimeter across,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.300
and so you can stick
wires inside of it.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.620
And they did a bunch of
very cool experiments

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.368
to figure out how these
different ionic conductances

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:03.410
and how these different
components of the circuit

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.360
work together to make
an action potential.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.300
So that's what we're
going to continue doing,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.260
we're going to
essentially continue

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.050
describing and motivating
the different components

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.260
of this circuit.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.990
So today, we're going to
get through the process

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.280
of introducing a
voltage-measuring device,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.610
a current source, a
capacitor, a conductance,

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.930
and we're going to start
introducing a battery, OK?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.430
OK.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.260
So here's what we want
to accomplish today.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.070
So we want to understand how
kind of at the simplest level

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.780
how neurons respond
to injected currents,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.340
we want to understand
how membrane

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.120
capacitance and membrane
resistance allows neurons

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.670
to integrate their
inputs over time,

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.870
and to filter their inputs or
smooth their inputs over time--

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.620
and that particular model is
called a resistor capacitor

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.500
model or an RC
model of a neuron.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.140
We're going to go through how
to derive the differential

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.680
equations that describe that
model-- it's actually quite

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.260
simple, but some
of you may not have

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.780
been through that before,
so I want to go through it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.030
step by step so we
can really understand

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.300
where that comes from.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.935
And we're going to learn to
basically look at a current--

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:33.780
a pattern of current
injection, and we

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.780
should be able to
intuitively see

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.860
how the voltage of
that neuron responds.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.950
And we're going to
start working on where

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.280
the batteries of a neuron
actually come from, OK?

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.900
OK.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.490
So-- all right.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.760
So-- all right.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.345
So we're going to basically
talk about the following sort

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.340
of thought experiment, OK?

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.990
The following conceptual idea.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.300
We're going to take
a neuron and we're

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.090
going to put it in a
bath of sailing, OK?

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.850
A saltwater solution that
represents the extracellular

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.300
solution that neurons--

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.770
extracellular
solution in the brain.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.640
And we're going to put an
electrode into that neuron

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.710
so that we can inject
current, and we're

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.120
going to put another
electrode into the neuron

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.760
so that we can
measure the voltage,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.540
and we're going to study
how this neuron responds--

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.950
how the voltage of the neuron
responds to current injections,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.850
OK?

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.120
Now why is it that we
want to actually do that?

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.510
Why is that an interesting or
important experiment to do?

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.880
Anybody have any
idea why we would

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.997
want to actually measure
voltage and current

00:03:48.997 --> 00:03:50.080
for a neuron in the brain?

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:55.230
Yes?

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.050
AUDIENCE: Be able to use the
mathematical model [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.990
provided for us?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.130
MICHALE FEE: OK, but
it's more than just

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.760
so that we can describe
it mathematically, right?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.410
It's because these things--

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.120
something about
voltage and current

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.030
are actually relevant to
how a neuron functions.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.530
Yes?

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.140
AUDIENCE: Like the
resistance inside?

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.130
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.230
So that's an important
quantity, but we're

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.120
looking for something
more fundamental,

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.250
like why is it
actually important

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.300
that we understand how voltage
changes when a neuron has

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.990
current injected into it?

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.490
Habiba?

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.880
AUDIENCE: Equals [INAUDIBLE]
different like ion channels,

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.855
a different set of
voltages [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:35.855 --> 00:04:36.730
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.220
So ion channels are
sensitive to voltage,

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.900
and the way they function
depends very critically

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.830
on voltage.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.550
So many-- if not
most-- ion channels

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.550
are voltage sensitive and are
controlled by voltage, OK?

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.070
And that's exactly why.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.280
So nearly every aspect of
what neurons do in the brain

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.440
as you're walking around looking
at things and doing things

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.330
is controlled by
voltage, and that

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.340
goes through the voltage
sensitivity of buying channels,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.070
OK?

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:15.700
But what is it that changes
the voltage in a neuron?

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.530
Yes?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.620
AUDIENCE: The action potential.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.790
MICHALE FEE: That's
on the output side.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.290
Yes?

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.490
AUDIENCE: Is it
ion concentration?

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.500
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.300
That's correct.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.080
I'm looking for something
a little bit different.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.580
Habiba?

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.570
AUDIENCE: Do you have
pumps or [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.288
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, those
are all good answers.

00:05:42.288 --> 00:05:43.580
Not quite what I'm looking for.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.880
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.050
So the answer is that
the voltage of a neuron

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.270
changes because--

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.260
the reason current is important
is because the reason voltage

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.280
changes in a neuron is because
other cells are injecting

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.590
current into our neuron.

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.390
Sensory inputs are injecting
current into our neuron, OK?

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.050
Everything that a neuron
receives, all the information

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.380
that a neuron receives from
other neurons in the network

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.740
and from the outside world
comes from currents being

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.190
injected into that neuron, OK?

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.200
And so it's really
important that we understand

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.810
how the neuron transforms that
current input from other cells

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.790
and from the sensory periphery
into voltage changes that

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.670
then change the behavior
of ion channels.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:40.720
Is that clear?

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.310
That link of current
inputs to voltage output

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:47.170
is really crucial,
and that's why we're

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.090
doing this experiment, OK?

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.880
OK, and that's this
point right here.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.380
OK, so one of the
first things we're

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.320
going to see when we go
through this analysis

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.170
is that neurons can
perform analog integration.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:07.270
They can perform numerical
integration over time, OK?

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:09.130
That's pretty cool.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:14.470
Voltage is that integral over
time of the injected current.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.030
To first order.

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:18.252
It's the simplest
behavior of a neuron.

00:07:18.252 --> 00:07:19.960
So if you measure the
voltage of a neuron

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.410
and you turn on current and
you turn the current on,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.620
the voltage of a
neuron will ramp up,

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.320
integrating that
input over time, OK?

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.490
Pretty cool.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.590
So we're going to
see how that happens,

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.430
why that happens biophysically.

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:37.000
OK.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So let's come back to
our neuron in the dish.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.700
Let me just explain a little
bit how you would actually

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:43.640
do this experiment.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.790
So these electrodes are
little pieces of glass tubing.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:49.060
So you take a fine glass
tube about a millimeter

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.970
across you heat it up in
the middle over a flame,

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.610
and you pull it apart when
it melts in the middle,

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.340
and it makes a very sharp point.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.140
You break off the fine little
thread of glass that's left,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.440
and you have a tube that narrows
down to a very sharp point,

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.375
but it's still a tube, and
you can literally just--

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:10.750
there are some cells, like in
the old days people studied

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.203
large neurons and in
snails where the cells are

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.120
a millimeter across, you
can take an electrode

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.640
and literally just by hand
poke it into the cell.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.870
And then you fill that
electrode with a salt solution,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.510
and then you put a wire in
the back of that electrode,

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.440
and you hook it up
to an amplifier.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.170
Now we want to measure
the voltage in the cell.

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.789
Remember, voltage is
always voltage difference.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.380
We're always measuring
the difference

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.840
between the voltage in one place
and the voltage somewhere else.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.450
So this amplifier
has two inputs.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.630
It's called a
differential amplifier,

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:45.820
and we're going to hook
the electrode that's

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.680
in the cell to
the plus terminal,

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.620
we're going to put
a wire in the bath,

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:51.700
hook it to the minus
terminal, and this amplifier

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.310
is measuring the difference
between the voltage

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.490
inside the cell and the
voltage outside the cell, OK?

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.690
Any questions about that?

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.470
So we're going to take the other
half of that piece of glass

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.145
that we pulled, fill
it with salt solution,

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:07.270
stick it in the cell, and
we're going to hook it up

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.100
to a current source.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.270
Now our current source is
basically just a battery, OK?

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:15.440
But it's got some
fancy electronics

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.170
such that the current that flows
is equal to whatever value you

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:25.020
set, OK?

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.975
And of course,
remember, that voltage

00:09:26.975 --> 00:09:31.790
is in units of volts and
current is charge per second.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.150
Charge is coulombs, so
coulombs per second,

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.460
and that's equal to the unit
of current, which is amperes.

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:40.060
All right.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.770
Now let's take a closer look
at our little spherical neuron,

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.970
our little neuron.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.990
We've chopped all the
dendrites and axons off,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.860
so it's just a little
sphere, and you can basically

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:56.470
model a neuron just like any
other cell as a spherical shell

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:59.740
of insulating material, OK?

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.050
In this case, a lipid bilayer.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.050
This is a phospholipid bilayer.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.770
Phospholipids are just little
fat molecules that have a polar

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:11.530
head on one side-- that means
they're soluble in water

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.620
on this side, and they
have a non-polar tail,

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.780
so they don't like to be
in contact with water,

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.410
and the two polar
tails go end to end--

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.900
sorry, the non-polar
tails go end to end,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.320
the polar heads face
out into the water.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.480
Does that makes sense?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.330
And they are very closely
packed together so

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:32.880
that ions can't pass
through that membrane,

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.310
so it's insulating.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:40.290
It's very thin, it's only
about 23 angstroms across, OK?

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:45.100
An angstrom is about the
size of a hydrogen atom.

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.030
They're very thin, OK?

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.870
OK, we have saline inside.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.720
What is saline?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.505
What is it in our model?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.882
Remember on Tuesday what--

00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:01.590
AUDIENCE: A wire.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.340
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:07.090
It's a wire and we have saline
outside, which is also a wire.

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.160
So we have two wires separated
by an insulator, what is that?

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:19.530
That's a capacitor, because
it's two conductors separated

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:21.360
by an insulator, OK?

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:27.445
So an electrical component
that behaves like a capacitor--

00:11:27.445 --> 00:11:29.070
like if you were to
build one of those,

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:32.340
you would take like a
piece of aluminum foil,

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.220
put a piece of paper on it, put
another piece of aluminum foil

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.070
next to it, and
attach wires to that,

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.580
and you would squeeze the
stack of aluminum foil paper

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:45.450
and aluminum foil together, and
that becomes a capacitor, OK?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:49.760
And it has a symbol that
looks like this electrically.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:55.360
So this is now our equivalent
circuit of this model neuron,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.970
OK?

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.240
It's very simple.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:59.810
It's a capacitor
with one wire here

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.970
that represents the inside of
the cell, another wire that

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:08.160
represents the
outside of the cell.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.680
We have a current
source that connects

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.710
the outside of the cell
to the inside of the cell.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.180
When we turn on
the current source,

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:19.260
it takes charges
from inside of here

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.710
and sticks them
through the electrode

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.990
and pumps them into the cell.

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.900
Does that makes sense?

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.960
This is our-- this is sort
of a simplified symbol

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.690
for a voltage-measuring device.

00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:38.630
The voltage difference
between the inside of the cell

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:41.660
and the outside of the cell
is what we're measuring here,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.930
and that difference is called
the membrane potential.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:48.560
It's the voltage difference
between the inside

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.470
and the outside of the
membrane, all right?

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:52.970
Any questions about that?

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:53.670
Yes?

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:55.970
AUDIENCE: There's a narrow
resistance for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:56.727
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:12:56.727 --> 00:12:57.920
AUDIENCE: The resistance for--

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.610
MICHALE FEE: Yes,
but we're going

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.000
to do it one piece at a time.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.960
So we're going to
start with a capacitor.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.340
The resistor will
come in a few slides.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.098
Yes?

00:13:09.098 --> 00:13:10.535
AUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:17.455 --> 00:13:18.330
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.790
So we've simplified our
neurons so that it's

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.300
just an insulating shell, OK?

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.090
No ion channels, no
current anywhere else.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:31.020
If we want to inject current
into this simple model neuron,

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:34.700
we have to inject it through
this electrode here, OK?

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.730
So we're just going down
to the very simplest case,

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:42.780
because this is already
kind of interesting enough

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.190
to understand just by itself.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.996
Yes?

00:13:44.996 --> 00:13:47.170
AUDIENCE: So if the cell's
acting as a capacitor,

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:50.975
is their energy stored
in their myelin?

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:52.350
MICHALE FEE: The
energy is stored

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:54.270
in the electric field
that crosses the bilayer,

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.645
and I'll get to
that in a second.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.530
Any other questions?

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:02.868
OK, great questions.

00:14:02.868 --> 00:14:04.910
All right, so what happens
when we inject current

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:05.690
into our neuron?

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.740
As I said, the current
source is pulling charges

00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:13.936
from the outside and pumping
them into the inside,

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.672
all right?

00:14:16.672 --> 00:14:23.170
So what happens when goes on?

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.830
So what we're doing is we
are injecting current-- let's

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.580
say this is our capacitor.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:32.930
There are charges, there
are ions on the inside

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:36.380
that are just up against the
inside of the cell membrane.

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:40.250
There are charges
on the outside, OK?

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:43.560
And when we inject a charge
from the outside to the inside--

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:45.710
let's put one of those
charges right here.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.460
And we're going to push it
into this cell, when you inject

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:52.100
a charge, you get
an excessive charge

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.060
on the inside of the
cell membrane, OK?

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.260
And what does that do?

00:14:57.260 --> 00:15:02.120
You now have more positive
charges inside than outside,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.500
like-charges repel--

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:06.770
so it pushes one
of those charges

00:15:06.770 --> 00:15:10.453
away from the outside
of the membrane.

00:15:10.453 --> 00:15:11.370
Does that makes sense?

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.400
OK, that's kind of interesting.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:23.650
We took a charge, we pushed
it in, and a charge comes out.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.670
Right?

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.290
We have a current flowing.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:29.360
We have charges coming
in and charges leaving.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.130
We have a current flowing
through an insulator.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:34.510
How is that possible?

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:36.750
It's a capacitive current, OK?

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:40.650
No charges are actually
passing through the insulator,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.070
but it looks like you
have a current flowing.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.470
That's called a
capacitive current.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:51.320
And we represent that in
our diagram by a current

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.640
I sub C, capacitive current that
flows through the capacitor.

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.940
Pretty cool, right?

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.150
You have a current flowing
through an insulator.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.180
That's what a capacitor is.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:03.470
OK.

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.290
Now notice that you
have a charge imbalance.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.110
You have three positive
charges here and only

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.460
one positive charge here.

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:14.330
So there is an excess of two
positive charges on the inside.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.330
That's because we added a
positive charge to the inside

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:19.640
and took away a positive
charge from the outside,

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.680
so that leaves a charge
imbalance of 2, OK?

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:27.410
What do you get between positive
charge and negative charge

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:29.450
if you hold them
next to each other?

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.060
What is there in between?

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.482
AUDIENCE: It's attraction.

00:16:33.482 --> 00:16:34.940
MICHALE FEE: Good,
it's attraction,

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.010
but what is it that
causes that attraction?

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:40.880
Remember yesterday, we talked
about a something on a charge

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.178
produces a force, what is it?

00:16:42.178 --> 00:16:43.220
AUDIENCE: Electric field.

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:43.970
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.570
So there's an electric
field between the positive--

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:51.230
the excess positive charges here
and the excess negative charges

00:16:51.230 --> 00:16:52.790
here, OK?

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:55.790
That's an electric
field, all right?

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.140
And that electric
field stores energy.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.680
How do you know there's
energy in this system, though?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.870
What could you do to
demonstrate that there is

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:06.630
energy stored in that system?

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:07.460
Any ideas?

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.410
You have two plates, two
metal plates, let's say,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.170
in the metal version of this.

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:14.150
Separated by an insulator.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:18.280
What would happen if you
pulled away the insulator?

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.770
Those two things would do
that again, but louder--

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:21.640
boom.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.599
What does that take
to make that sound?

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:27.310
Energy, OK?

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.380
So there's energy stored
in that electric field.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.830
So there's a charge imbalance,
there's an electric field.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.928
What does an electric field over
some distance correspond to?

00:17:40.928 --> 00:17:42.220
AUDIENCE: A voltage difference.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.224
MICHALE FEE: A voltage
difference, OK?

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:51.650
Now, there's a charge imbalance
and a voltage difference,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.060
and they're proportional
to each other.

00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.510
So there's a
proportionality constant

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.830
that's called the
capacitance, all right?

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:04.990
If you can put a lot of charge
and have a small voltage

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.240
difference, that's
a big capacitor.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.740
Now you can get a big capacitor
just by having a big area.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:13.120
You can see, you can have a lot
of charges with a small voltage

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.610
difference if you have big
plates on your capacitor, OK?

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.760
So the capacitance is actually
proportional to the area

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.260
of the plates,
and it's inversely

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:26.060
proportional to the
distance between them.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.260
It's a very thin
membrane, which means

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.700
you can get a lot of
capacitance in a tiny area, OK?

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.930
That's pretty cool.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.910
All right, any questions?

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:44.080
So charge is coulombs, and there
are 6 times 10 to the charges

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:47.020
in a coulomb, the
elemental charges, electron

00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:51.908
or monovalent ion charges.

00:18:51.908 --> 00:18:53.950
Voltage is in units of
volts, and the capacitance

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.270
is in units of farads.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.020
Any questions?

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:02.640
All right.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:07.340
So we have our relation between
voltage difference and charge

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.770
difference.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.000
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.480
going to calculate this
capacitive current.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.760
How do you think
we would calculate

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.780
the capacitive current?

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.650
Well, the capacitive
current is just

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:29.900
the rate at which the charge
imbalance is changing, right?

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:33.160
Current is just charge
per unit of time.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:33.660
OK?

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.340
So we're going to calculate the
capacitive current as the time

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:38.900
rate of change of the charge--

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.570
and I've dropped
the deltas here.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:46.480
So capacitive current
is dQ/dt, all right?

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.725
And remember that Q is just
CV, so the capacitive current

00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:54.490
is just C dV/dt, and
the Vm here represents

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.130
the membrane potential, OK?

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.760
So the capacitive current
through a membrane

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.120
is just the capacitance
times the time rate of change

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.870
of the membrane potential.

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:10.038
Any questions?

00:20:10.038 --> 00:20:10.970
OK.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.930
Pretty straightforward.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:15.440
Now what we're
going to do now is

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.610
we're going to relate
the injected charge

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.730
to the-- sorry, the injected
current to the capacitor.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.680
And what does Kirchhoff's
current law tell us?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.970
It tells us that the amount of
current going into this wire

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.830
has to be equal to the amount
of current leaving that wire.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:33.330
OK?

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.720
So we can write that
down as follows.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.320
The difference in sign here is
because the electrode current

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.860
is defined as positive
inward, the capacitive current

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:46.968
is defined as positive outward.

00:20:46.968 --> 00:20:47.468
OK?

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.950
So you can see that
we just calculated

00:20:57.950 --> 00:21:00.110
the capacitive
current, it's C dV/dt,

00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:02.180
so we can just
plug that in here,

00:21:02.180 --> 00:21:04.370
and now we see this
very simple relation

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.250
between the injected
current and the voltage.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.960
And again, the current
has unit of amperes,

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.280
which is coulombs per second.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.110
OK, so we have that.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.940
Now we have a
differential equation

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.400
that describes the relation
between current and voltage,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.590
we can just integrate
it to get the solution.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.930
So that membrane
potential will just

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:39.130
be some initial membrane
potential at time 0

00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:45.190
plus 1 over C integral over
time of the injected current.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.300
Just integrate both sides.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.360
You get V here, you get
integral of I there,

00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:04.208
and divide both sides
by C. Any questions?

00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:08.570
It's either really
confusing or really obvious.

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:09.070
Yeah?

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.730
Everybody OK?

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:12.010
All right, good.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:12.910
Now what is this?

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:17.870
What is the integral
of current over time?

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:19.530
AUDIENCE: It's
charge [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:20.280
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:23.280
It's the amount of charge
you injected between time

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:25.680
0 and time t, right?

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:30.750
And what is the amount of charge
you inject-- if I tell you

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:35.190
that I injected an amount of
charge delta Q, how much did

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:36.130
I change the voltage?

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.960
Delta V is delta Q over
C, and that's exactly.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.870
So the voltage is just
the starting voltage

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.740
plus delta voltage.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.120
Does that makes sense?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.000
This integral here is just--

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.430
that part is just
the amount of charge

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:03.090
you injected divided by C gives
you the change in the voltage.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:08.340
So the voltage is just the
starting voltage plus delta V,

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.550
OK?

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:10.050
Yes?

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.888
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:11.888 --> 00:23:12.930
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:13.913
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:14.580
MICHALE FEE: Oh.

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:20.340
Because this equation
here just came from here.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.850
That was our charge--

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:26.130
our relation between charge
balance and voltage difference.

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:26.630
Yeah?

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:32.820
If it's not clear, just
please ask, thank you.

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.000
OK.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.730
There we go.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:45.040
So what is the
interval constant?

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.980
It's just some constant
times time, right?

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.250
So our voltage is just
some initial voltage

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.760
plus the injected current
over C times time.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.000
And so you can see where
this comes from, right?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.340
When you turn the
current on, the voltage

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:04.150
just increases
linearly over time

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:08.590
with a slope that's given
by the current divided

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:10.156
by the capacitance.

00:24:10.156 --> 00:24:10.656
OK?

00:24:18.782 --> 00:24:22.820
All right, any questions?

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.310
You guys are being very quiet.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:27.310
This is the point where
I start feeling nervous,

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.310
I went too fast.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.110
Yes?

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.360
AUDIENCE: You continually
draw the curve for a while--

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:32.068
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

00:24:32.068 --> 00:24:34.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.830
MICHALE FEE: Yes, it does.

00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:42.920
And it breaks at
about a volt or so.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.470
Because the electric
field gets so strong,

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:48.560
it literally just
rips the atoms apart

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.355
in the molecules of
the lipid bilayer.

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:54.450
Yes?

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:55.828
AUDIENCE: Why do you [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:55.828 --> 00:24:57.370
MICHALE FEE: Sorry,
I shouldn't say--

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:01.740
it doesn't rip the atoms apart,
it rips the molecules apart.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:04.650
You need much higher
electric fields to do that.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:05.460
Yes?

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:10.728
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:10.728 --> 00:25:11.395
MICHALE FEE: Oh.

00:25:11.395 --> 00:25:17.440
Because we're integrating
from time 0 to time t.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.460
We want to know the
voltage at time t, OK?

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.100
We're starting at 0, we're
integrating the current

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.660
from time 0 to time t,
which is where we're wanting

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:30.990
to know the voltage, right?

00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:34.010
So you have to integrate
the current from 0 to t.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:39.340
We can't use t in here.
t is the endpoint.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:39.980
Yeah.

00:25:39.980 --> 00:25:40.978
Does that makes sense?

00:25:40.978 --> 00:25:42.020
Good question, thank you.

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.590
OK, everybody all right?

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:55.770
I'm going to stand here until
I hear one more question.

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:56.270
Yes?

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.483
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:00.483 --> 00:26:01.400
MICHALE FEE: Oh, here.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.840
Because it's a
current of value I0.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.790
Great question.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.290
Yes?

00:26:08.290 --> 00:26:11.510
AUDIENCE: So to maintain this
constant current [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:15.270
the amount of [INAUDIBLE]
you're pumping it and--

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:16.410
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.040
That's right.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.920
This-- OK, I should have
maybe been more clear.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.150
This current source has a
knob on it that I get to set.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.670
I get to like--

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.140
there would be an
app now, and I'd

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:30.360
pull out my current
source app and I

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:31.938
type in 10 milliamps, boom.

00:26:31.938 --> 00:26:34.230
And this thing-- because
there's a Bluetooth connection

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:37.410
to this thing, and it like sets
this thing to 10 milliamps,

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.960
and it just keeps pumping
10 milliamps until you tell

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.120
it to do something else, OK?

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:44.620
Yes?

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] make the
right direction instead of it

00:26:47.690 --> 00:26:50.307
being constant current
state that usually--

00:26:50.307 --> 00:26:51.140
MICHALE FEE: Oh, OK.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.000
AUDIENCE: --that would
create some weird kind of--

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.150
MICHALE FEE: Sure.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:55.650
Yeah.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:56.880
What would that be, actually?

00:26:56.880 --> 00:26:59.685
If you put in a linear
ramp in current?

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:02.400
It would be a parabolic
voltage profile.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.600
Yeah, very good.

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:04.830
That's exactly it.

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:09.630
This current profile that
you-- this voltage profile

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.660
is literally just the numerical
integral of this function.

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:15.330
So all you have to
do is look at this

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:17.490
and integrate it in
your head, and you can

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.670
see what the voltage does, OK?

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:21.420
Great.

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:22.980
That's exactly right.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.280
So let's do another example.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.280
Let's put in a current pulse.

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.160
So we start at zero current,
we step it up to I0,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.580
we hold it there for tau,
then we turn the current off.

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.680
So let's start our
neuron right here.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.462
What's going to happen?

00:27:36.462 --> 00:27:37.170
What's your name?

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.420
I'm going to ask you
to do this problem.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.210
What-- yeah.

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:40.878
AUDIENCE: Sammy.

00:27:40.878 --> 00:27:41.670
MICHALE FEE: Sammy.

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:44.448
What's this voltage going to do?

00:27:44.448 --> 00:27:45.930
AUDIENCE: So I'd say constant.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.680
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.183
Because it's zero current.

00:27:48.183 --> 00:27:49.350
Then what's going to happen?

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:50.610
AUDIENCE: And it's
going to [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:51.360
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:53.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.294
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:27:54.294 --> 00:27:57.655
AUDIENCE: And then the
[INAUDIBLE] go back to constant

00:27:57.655 --> 00:27:58.620
at that point.

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:59.700
MICHALE FEE: Awesome.

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:00.370
That's it.

00:28:00.370 --> 00:28:03.240
It's that simple.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.755
OK?

00:28:05.755 --> 00:28:08.550
Good.

00:28:08.550 --> 00:28:09.120
All right.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.740
Now somebody brought
up resistors.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.020
Who brought up ion conductances?

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.700
Somebody mentioned that.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:19.340
So that's the next thing
we're going to add.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:23.580
This is sort of the zero
order model of a neuron.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.040
It has the simplest view and
it's often not so bad, OK?

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.000
For short periods of time.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.680
But neurons actually have
ion channels, all right?

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.540
Allow current to flow
through the membrane.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.300
So we're going to start
today by analyzing

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.880
the case of the simplest
kind of ion channel

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.610
which is the kind of ion channel
you get when you take a needle

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:47.670
and you poke a hole
in the membrane, OK?

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:52.030
It's called the leak
or a hole, all right?

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:54.680
And we're going to analyze
what our neuron does

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:55.410
when you do that.

00:28:55.410 --> 00:29:00.490
So what we're going to find
is that the ion channel--

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:04.400
a leak conductance, it can
be represented in our model

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.070
simply by a resistor, OK?

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.220
And we're going to have our
capacitive current, membrane

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:16.300
capacitive current, and a
membrane ionic current that's

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.700
due to ions flowing through ion
channels in the membrane, OK?

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:26.070
And that current will be--

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:29.130
we're going to call that
our leak resistance,

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:35.730
and that current will
be our leak current, OK?

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:38.490
So now, Kirchhoff's
current law tells us what?

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.060
That the leak current plus
the capacitive current

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:45.728
has to equal the injected
current, all right?

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:53.860
We know the capacitive
current is just C dV/dt,

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.140
so we just plug that
in, and now we have I

00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.160
leak plus C dV/dt equals the
injected electrode current.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.880
That is called membrane
ionic current, that

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.500
is called membrane
capacitive current,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.230
and that is our
electrode current.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:15.730
There's a sign convention
in neuroscience,

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:18.600
which is that membrane
ionic currents that

00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.850
are outward from the
inside of the cell

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:25.410
to the outside of the cell
membrane are positive in sign.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:29.720
Positive charges leaving the
cell have a positive sign.

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:33.010
It's just convention, it
could have been the other way.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:37.130
But you have to choose
something, so that's what--

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.860
I think it was Hodgkin
and Huxley, actually,

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.990
who decided that.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.690
Inward currents, positive
charges entering the cell

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:47.150
through the membrane going
this way from extracellular

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:51.533
to intracellular, are
defined as negative.

00:30:51.533 --> 00:30:52.950
Electrode currents,
the other way.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.410
Electrode current--
inward current is--

00:30:55.410 --> 00:30:57.482
into the cell is positive.

00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.440
OK, so we're going to poke
a hole in our membrane

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.860
and we're going to model that
ion channel using Ohm's law.

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:12.160
So the leak current is just
membrane potential divided

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.220
by resistance, leak resistance.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.850
So what do we get if
we plug this into our--

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:25.050
I leak plus I capacitance?

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.570
Capacitive equals
injected current.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:32.640
We get V membrane potential,
Vm over RL plus C dV/dt

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:36.295
equals injected current, OK?

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:45.460
We multiply both sides by
resistance, we get V plus RC--

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.320
that why it's
called an RC model--

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:52.260
dV/dt equals leak
resistance times

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.360
the injected current, all right?

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.740
Now that's looking a
little complicated,

00:31:58.740 --> 00:32:01.940
but we're going to
simplify things now.

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.970
Tau-- I'm sorry, RC is
resistance times capacitance,

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:09.270
and it turns out, that
has units of time.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.110
And so we're going
to call that tau--

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.767
got a little ahead of myself.

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:16.350
That's called tau,
we're going to make

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.920
that substitution in a minute.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.170
But first we're going to
calculate the steady state

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:24.050
solution to that
little equation, OK?

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:26.537
So bear with me, hang
on, it's all going

00:32:26.537 --> 00:32:27.620
to make sense in a minute.

00:32:30.947 --> 00:32:33.030
Does anyone know how to
calculate the steady state

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.650
solution of a
differential equation?

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.150
Yes?

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:37.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.040
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:38.610
What's your name?

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.360
AUDIENCE: Rebecca.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.910
MICHALE FEE: Rebecca.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.870
So you said the derivative--

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:44.270
so let's do that.

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:45.850
Set dV/dt equal to 0.

00:32:48.550 --> 00:32:50.640
And what do you find?

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.490
Sorry, we flashed
the answer up there.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:56.126
What do you get if you
said dV/dt equals 0?

00:32:56.126 --> 00:32:57.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:58.790
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:01.690
So you inject some
current, we're

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:04.530
going to hold the current
constant, let's say, OK?

00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:08.720
We've put some current in
and we hold it constant.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.210
The voltage will change,
and eventually things

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.630
will settle down and
the dV/dt will go to 0.

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.180
At that point, we
know the voltage.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:21.840
It's just RL times Ie.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.020
What is the voltage equals
resistance times current?

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.107
What is that?

00:33:26.107 --> 00:33:26.940
AUDIENCE: Ohm's law.

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:29.190
MICHALE FEE: Ohm's law.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:33.790
It's just when we inject
current, a bunch of stuff

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.720
happens, and when
the dust settles,

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.580
the voltage difference is
just the injected current

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.090
divided by the resistance.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.420
Does that makes sense?

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:46.920
Yes?

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:52.567
AUDIENCE: Where is [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:52.567 --> 00:33:54.650
MICHALE FEE: Well, right
now we just took a needle

00:33:54.650 --> 00:33:57.380
and poked a hole in our cell.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.450
So--

00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.700
AUDIENCE: How big the hole is?

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.490
MICHALE FEE: Yep, exactly.

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:03.530
It's how big the hole is.

00:34:03.530 --> 00:34:07.950
Now cells-- real cells
do have leak channels.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.630
They're actually
ion channels that

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:14.590
leak kind of any
ion that's in there.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:18.298
It's not very common.

00:34:18.298 --> 00:34:19.590
And you'll see why in a minute.

00:34:22.870 --> 00:34:26.139
Actually, that's not quite true.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:31.080
There are ion channels that
look essentially like leaks,

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:35.389
and it turns out
that the ion channels

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:39.590
that many neurotransmitter
receptors like

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.969
glutamate and acetylcholine,
the ion channels actually

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:45.350
look like little leaks.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:50.210
They pass multiple ions that
makes them look like leaks.

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:56.510
OK.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:35:02.210
So in steady state, the membrane
potential goes to RL times Ie,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.680
and we call that voltage
something special, V infinity,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.940
because it's the voltage that
the system reaches at time

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:14.760
equals infinity, OK?

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.850
Any questions about that?

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:19.070
OK.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:24.650
So we're going to just rewrite
this equation as Vm plus tau

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.670
dV/dt equals V infinity.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:30.170
And that equation we're
going to see over and over

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:34.050
and over again in this class
in many different contexts, all

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:34.550
right?

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.830
It's a first order linear
differential equation

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:42.700
and it's very powerful, so I
want you to get used to it.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.100
So what does this mean?

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.410
So let's rewrite this
equation a little bit.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:52.060
Let's move this term
to the other side

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:55.060
and divide both sides by
tau, and here's what you get.

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:59.950
dV/dt equals minus
1 over tau V minus--

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:03.835
times V minus V infinity.

00:36:03.835 --> 00:36:06.630
OK?

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:10.520
Now let's take a look at what
the derivative dV/dt looks

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.800
like as a function of voltage.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:12.300
Yes?

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.883
AUDIENCE: So why
couldn't we have said

00:36:13.883 --> 00:36:16.260
we didn't mean to [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:25.554
MICHALE FEE: V infinity
is defined as RL times Ie.

00:36:25.554 --> 00:36:27.350
AUDIENCE: Oh, so
that's a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:28.760
MICHALE FEE: It's a definition.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.900
Sorry, I should have put
like three lines there

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.610
to indicate that
it's the definition.

00:36:33.610 --> 00:36:34.490
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:35.240
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.690
Sorry, that's a very
important question.

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:38.676
What's your name?

00:36:38.676 --> 00:36:39.570
AUDIENCE: Rishi.

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:40.110
MICHALE FEE: Rishi.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:40.610
OK.

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.375
I'm going to make an
attempt to remember names.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.120
So is everyone clear about that?

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.420
V infinity is defined
as the resistance

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.080
times this injected current.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.780
So the injected current, when we
inject current into our neuron,

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.150
you're changing V infinity, OK?

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.103
You're controlling it.

00:37:04.103 --> 00:37:05.020
Does that makes sense?

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.190
OK.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:12.038
So let's look at how
the derivative changes

00:37:12.038 --> 00:37:13.830
as a function of voltage,
it's very simple.

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:14.530
Bear with me.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:17.020
All of this is
going to crystallize

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.220
in your mind in one beautiful
construct very shortly.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.063
Yes?

00:37:22.063 --> 00:37:25.444
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:25.444 --> 00:37:27.560
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:33.280
Resistance times capacitance
has units time, OK?

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.750
And so we call it tau.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.720
Tau is just a constant, OK?

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.610
So hang on, bear with me.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:44.550
The derivative is a
function of voltage.

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:49.850
And at V equals V infinity,
the derivative is 0, right?

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.530
That's the definition
of the infinity,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.576
it's the voltage at which
the derivative is 0.

00:37:59.576 --> 00:38:02.390
Yeah?

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:09.490
And the voltage is less than
V infinity, the derivative

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:13.270
is positive, right?

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.670
When the voltage is
below the infinity,

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:17.920
the derivative of
voltage is positive.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.820
So what is the voltage doing?

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.990
It's approaching V infinity.

00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:26.090
If the voltage is
above V infinity,

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:30.590
voltage greater than V infinity,
the derivative is negative.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.955
So voltage does what?

00:38:32.955 --> 00:38:33.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:34.870
MICHALE FEE: Yes, but it's--

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:35.787
AUDIENCE: Approaches--

00:38:35.787 --> 00:38:37.860
MICHALE FEE: It
approaches V infinity.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.860
So no matter where
voltage is, it's

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:41.300
always approaching V infinity.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.910
If it's below V infinity,
the slope is positive,

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.740
and it approaches V infinity.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.000
If it's above V infinity,
the slope is negative,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.240
and it approaches V
infinity from above.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.710
Pretty cool, right?

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:59.690
So V is always just
relaxing toward V infinity.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:00.980
And how does it get there?

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.630
Does it go linearly?

00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:04.310
Well, you can see
that the slope--

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.050
the rate at which
it approaches V

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:10.630
infinity is proportional to how
far away it is from V infinity.

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:13.970
And so it doesn't just go vroom,
boom, crash into V infinity,

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:22.360
it kind of slowly
approaches V infinity, OK?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.890
Anybody know what that
function is called?

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:26.890
AUDIENCE: Exponential.

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.430
MICHALE FEE: It's an
exponential, good.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:36.920
And it approaches with
a timescale of tau.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.430
So if tau is small,
it approaches quickly.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.600
If tau is long, it
approaches slow.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.970
You can see that if tau is
big, the derivatives are small.

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:52.004
If tau is small, the derivatives
are bigger, all right?

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.735
Any questions about that?

00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:02.980
Yes?

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.211
AUDIENCE: So a
tau usually is a--

00:40:05.211 --> 00:40:06.586
MICHALE FEE: Sorry,
say it again?

00:40:06.586 --> 00:40:08.290
AUDIENCE: --times
equals to tau--

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:08.998
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:40:08.998 --> 00:40:12.090
AUDIENCE: --is V
infinity plus 1 over e.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:15.646
MICHALE FEE: At time tau, the--

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:17.020
AUDIENCE: Times V0.

00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:18.520
MICHALE FEE: At time tau--

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:22.000
at time 0, the difference
between V infinity-- sorry, V

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.330
and V infinity is
V0 minus V infinity.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.820
At time tau, that
initial difference

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.320
drops by about a third.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.010
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:34.220
MICHALE FEE: About 1 over e,
which I think is 2.7-something,

00:40:34.220 --> 00:40:35.050
OK?

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:37.600
So in 1 tau, this
voltage difference

00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.250
falls by about a--
drops by about a third.

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:43.020
And in another tau, it
drops by another third,

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:46.970
it keeps going, OK?

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:47.470
All right.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.076
So let's just write down
the general solution.

00:40:51.076 --> 00:40:53.350
The general solution
for the case

00:40:53.350 --> 00:41:02.700
where you have constant
current, that voltage difference

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:05.370
from the voltage at
time t to V infinity

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:08.140
is just equal to the initial
voltage difference times e

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.775
to the minus t over tau, OK?

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:19.950
So if t is equal to tau, then
this is e to the minus 1,

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:23.730
so the voltage difference will
be 1/3 of the original voltage

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:24.630
difference.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.290
Is that clear?

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.790
OK.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:31.930
So now let's see what this
looks like in our neuron.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.320
We have our neuron, we
have a current pulse,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.260
we have zero current,
we turn the current

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.970
on to I0 at this time, we
hold the current constant,

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:45.660
and we turn current off at
this time right here, OK?

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:48.480
So what does the voltage do?

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.580
Let's go step by step.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.470
The first thing
is that voltage--

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:55.995
sorry-- the current controls
what in that equation?

00:41:58.902 --> 00:42:03.070
The current controls V infinity.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:05.100
So we can plot V
infinity immediately,

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.440
because V infinity is
just the resistance

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.800
times the injected current.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.220
So what does V
infinity look like?

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:16.908
It's constant here, and then
what happens to V infinity?

00:42:16.908 --> 00:42:19.540
AUDIENCE: Increases.

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.948
MICHALE FEE: It increases,
that's correct, but--

00:42:21.948 --> 00:42:23.490
AUDIENCE: It'll
just be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:24.240
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.320
It will just be the
resistance times the current.

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:30.886
Resistance is a constant, so V
infinity will just go up here,

00:42:30.886 --> 00:42:31.386
right?

00:42:31.386 --> 00:42:31.886
Good.

00:42:31.886 --> 00:42:39.300
It'll go up, and then it
stays constant at R times I.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.050
And then at this
point, the current

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:47.420
goes back to 0, so V infinity
is resistance time 0,

00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.300
so V infinity drops back to 0.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.720
Does that makes sense?

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:57.160
That's V infinity, that's
not the voltage of the cell.

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.880
That's the steady state
voltage of the cell.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.770
So now what does voltage
of the cell actually do?

00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:11.338
So let's start our
voltage here at 0.

00:43:11.338 --> 00:43:11.880
What happens?

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:16.740
Good.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:18.470
What is it doing?

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.970
AUDIENCE: Approaching
from infinity.

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:20.750
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.960
It approaches.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:27.650
So V at every point
is relaxing toward V

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:31.290
infinity exponentially, right?

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.370
And that looks like--

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:39.680
at some time constant, and that
looks like this, all right?

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.185
Now what happens here?

00:43:42.185 --> 00:43:43.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:43.910
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:47.180
Because V infinity
suddenly change to 0,

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:50.570
and so V relaxes toward
V infinity exponentially

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:52.130
with some time constant.

00:43:57.366 --> 00:43:57.866
OK?

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.397
Any questions?

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:08.370
OK.

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:18.690
Now this-- that is our
RC model neuron, OK?

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:20.320
Resistance times
capacitance-- they

00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:24.380
got a resistor and a
capacitor, but the solutions

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:27.740
are just exponential decays
toward some steady state

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:30.490
solution.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:35.110
Now it turns out
that an RC system,

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:40.650
a first order linear system
acts like a filter, OK?

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.510
So remember, our neuron
that just has a capacitor

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:48.660
is an integrator, it
integrates over time.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:51.960
When you add a
resistor, this thing--

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.210
it's kind of integrating
here, but then it

00:44:54.210 --> 00:44:57.630
gets tired and stops
integrating, OK?

00:44:57.630 --> 00:45:01.860
It relaxes to some steady state.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.750
So this actually
looks like a filter.

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.820
It takes time to
respond to something.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:15.550
So that system responds well to
things that are changing slowly

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:19.150
in time, and it responds
very weakly to things that

00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:21.410
are changing rapidly in time.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.570
So here's an example--

00:45:22.570 --> 00:45:26.350
I'll put together
this demonstration.

00:45:26.350 --> 00:45:28.280
In red is the injected current.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:32.050
So if you have long pulses
of injected current,

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:35.290
the time constant of this
garners about 10 milliseconds--

00:45:35.290 --> 00:45:36.930
I think this is probably a--

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.750
what is that, a 50 or
100-millisecond pulse?

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:40.250
80--

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.125
AUDIENCE: Nanofarads.

00:45:41.125 --> 00:45:42.225
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:45:42.225 --> 00:45:44.390
You can see that in
blue is the voltage,

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.670
it relaxes toward V infinity.

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:50.000
And then the current goes
off, it relaxes back.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.510
And you can see that the
voltage is responding very well

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.220
to the current injection.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.420
But now let's make
really short pulses

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.760
that are much shorter than tau.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.630
You can see that
the voltage starts

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:07.027
relaxing toward V infinity,
but it doesn't get very far,

00:46:07.027 --> 00:46:08.860
and all of a sudden the
current's turned off

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.540
and it relaxes back.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.450
And so you can plot the
peak voltage response

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.220
as a function of the
width of these pulses,

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:20.650
and you can see that for long
pulses, it responds very well,

00:46:20.650 --> 00:46:22.520
but for short pulses--

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.310
really responds at all.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:28.180
And that's called a
low pass filter, OK?

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:31.840
It responds well to
slowly-changing things,

00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.210
but barely responds to
rapidly-changing things.

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:40.651
So it's passing low frequencies,
low pass filter, OK?

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.070
All right.

00:46:44.070 --> 00:46:44.760
Any questions?

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.540
That was a lot of
stuff all at once.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:47.040
Yes?

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:49.900
AUDIENCE: I'm just curious,
like on what order is

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:53.030
the capacitance for nanofarads?

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:54.100
MICHALE FEE: OK.

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:57.760
It's 10 nanofarads per--

00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.990
1 microfarads per
square centimeter.

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:03.953
10 nanofarads per
square millimeter, OK?

00:47:03.953 --> 00:47:05.870
We're going to get to
that in a second, that's

00:47:05.870 --> 00:47:07.110
a great question.

00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.950
We're going to get to what
the actual numbers look like

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.190
for real neurons, OK?

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:14.640
I think you had a question.

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.095
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:17.095 --> 00:47:18.470
MICHALE FEE: Sorry,
say it again?

00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:19.870
AUDIENCE: Past [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.795
Is that [INAUDIBLE]
reacts to [INAUDIBLE]??

00:47:22.795 --> 00:47:24.670
MICHALE FEE: What happens
is it reacts to it,

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:27.640
but because it's
changing kind of linearly

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.220
at these short times,
it doesn't get very far.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.060
If the current stays
on for a long time,

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:35.290
you can see it has exactly
the same profile here,

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:37.802
but it just has time
to reach V infinity.

00:47:37.802 --> 00:47:39.760
Here, it doesn't have
time to reach V infinity,

00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:46.590
it just gets a little bit away
from 0 and then it decays back.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:47.350
Yes?

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:50.162
AUDIENCE: Are there other sorts
of filters for non-responses

00:47:50.162 --> 00:47:52.930
like [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:52.930 --> 00:47:55.690
MICHALE FEE: You can build
different kinds of filters

00:47:55.690 --> 00:47:58.990
from circuits of neurons,
but neurons themselves

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:03.160
tend to be high pass filters.

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.360
You can-- sorry,
low pass filters.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.840
You can make-- so you can put in
different kinds of ion channels

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.080
that change the
properties of neurons,

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.180
but sort of to first
order, you should think

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:18.040
of neurons as low pass filters.

00:48:21.976 --> 00:48:22.960
Yeah?

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:31.282
AUDIENCE: Can you
show the [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:31.282 --> 00:48:32.740
MICHALE FEE: I
wrote it like this--

00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.980
you can write it as V equals V
infinity plus this other stuff,

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.620
but I wrote it like this because
what you should really be

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:42.610
seeing here is that the
voltage difference from--

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:48.230
time between the voltage and V
infinity decays exponentially.

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:51.370
So the distance you are
from V infinity decays

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:53.974
exponentially, OK?

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.380
It makes it more
obvious that you're

00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:02.915
decaying toward V infinity, OK?

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:07.950
Yes?

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:10.492
AUDIENCE: If you were to arrange
like the physical properties

00:49:10.492 --> 00:49:15.870
of the neuron itself,
you [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.400
MICHALE FEE: Not-- not really.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.420
Not simply.

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:22.050
You can put in
certain ion channels

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:29.950
that could make a neuron less
responsive at low frequencies,

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:30.450
OK?

00:49:30.450 --> 00:49:34.620
So you can make them kind of
responsive to some middle range

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.265
of frequencies
that won't respond

00:49:37.265 --> 00:49:38.640
to very high
frequencies and they

00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:43.040
won't respond much to
very low frequencies,

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.080
but for the most
part, again, just

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.330
you should-- at this point,
let's just think of them

00:49:47.330 --> 00:49:50.210
as low pass filters.

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:52.940
We're going to start
adding fancy stuff

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:58.110
to our neuron that's going
to make it more complicated.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.070
So don't get too
hung up on this.

00:50:01.070 --> 00:50:03.994
All right, let me
just make this point.

00:50:03.994 --> 00:50:07.630
This one right
here, V equals tau--

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:11.660
V plus tau dV/dt equals V
infinity appears everywhere,

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:17.920
it's ubiquitous in physics,
chemistry, biology, we'll

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.380
be using it in multiple
different contexts

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.790
in different parts of
the class, and in--

00:50:24.790 --> 00:50:26.920
computation, OK?

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:32.770
And even slightly more
complicated versions of this,

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:37.500
like the Michaelis-Menten
equations in chemistry,

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.880
you can kind of understand
them in simple terms.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:43.290
If you like have
a handle on this,

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.270
other slightly more
complicated things

00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:49.360
become much more intuitive, OK?

00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:53.260
All right, so try
to really make sure

00:50:53.260 --> 00:50:57.250
that you understand
this equation

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:02.250
and how we derived it, OK?

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:05.040
OK, let's talk about
the origin of this--

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.510
the timescale of a neuron.

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:08.370
So the tau of a neuron--

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:11.460
of most neurons is about
100 milliseconds to--

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.650
sorry, 10 milliseconds
to 100 milliseconds,

00:51:13.650 --> 00:51:15.250
kind of in that range.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:18.600
And it comes from the values
of resistance and capacitance

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:19.990
of a neuron.

00:51:19.990 --> 00:51:24.660
So a resistor-- the
resistance of a neuron--

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:29.770
range of 100 million ohms, OK?

00:51:29.770 --> 00:51:33.510
And the capacitance is about
10 to the minus 10 ohms

00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:37.640
or about 100 picofarads.

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.780
And you multiply those
two things together

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:44.910
and you get a time constant
of about 10 milliseconds, OK?

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:49.510
So what that means is if you
inject current into a neuron,

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:52.420
it takes about 10 to
100 milliseconds for it

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:58.010
to fully respond to
that step of current.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.260
The voltage will
jump up and relax

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:05.510
to the new V infinity in about
10 to 100 milliseconds, OK?

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.190
So let's take a
little bit closer

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:11.000
look at the resistance-- what
this resistance in capacitance

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.420
looks like in a neuron.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:18.700
So we've described the
relation between leak current

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:24.850
and voltage as current equals
voltage over resistance,

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:29.810
but rather than using resistance
to think about currents flowing

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.290
through a membrane, it's
much more useful, usually,

00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.730
to think about something
called conductance,

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.550
and conductance is just
1 over resistance, OK?

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:43.790
So conductance, G-- and we use
the simple G for conductance--

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.620
it's equal to 1 over resistance.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.960
So now we can write
Ohm's law as I

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:55.820
equals G times V. Resistance
has units of ohms, G--

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:58.730
conductance has units of
inverse ohms or siemens

00:52:58.730 --> 00:53:02.930
is the SI unit for conductance.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:06.340
So if we have
conductances, if we

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:10.400
have two-- let's say two ion
channels in the membrane,

00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.830
they operate in parallel.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.125
Current flows through
them separately, right?

00:53:15.125 --> 00:53:17.500
They're not in series, like
it flows through one and then

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:19.070
flows through the other, right?

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.150
They are in parallel--
the current can flow

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:26.210
through both like
this up in parallel.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:30.160
And we can write down the
current using Kirchhoff's law,

00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.200
the total current
is just the sum

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:36.130
of the current through those two
separate conductances, right?

00:53:36.130 --> 00:53:38.140
Now the total current is--

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.840
we can just expand this
in terms of the inductance

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.750
of each one of those.

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:47.560
So the total current is G1
times the voltage difference

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:50.680
plus G2 times the
voltage difference

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:53.610
for this conductance.

00:53:53.610 --> 00:53:55.490
So the total current is just--

00:53:55.490 --> 00:53:59.720
you factor out the V, the total
current is just G1 plus G2,

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:05.910
so we can write down the total
conductance as just G1 plus G2.

00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:07.290
Does that makes sense?

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:10.230
So conductances in
parallel add together.

00:54:13.563 --> 00:54:15.230
So if we have a piece
of membrane that's

00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:18.860
got some ion channels
in it-- or holes,

00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:21.080
and we add another piece of
membrane that kind of has

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:23.440
the same density
of ion channels,

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.080
you have twice the
holes, twice the current,

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:27.500
and twice the conductance.

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.400
So we can write the current
as conductance times membrane

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.010
potential, but we can
rewrite that conductance

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:43.680
as the area times that
conductance per unit area,

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.200
and that's called specific
membrane conductance--

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.540
in this case, it's a leak,
so we call it specific leak

00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:53.980
conductance, and it has units
of conductance per area.

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:03.070
We multiply that by the area and
we get that total conductance.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.330
Any questions about this?

00:55:09.077 --> 00:55:09.577
No?

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:17.190
So you can see that
we can now plot

00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:21.940
the current through the membrane
as a function of voltage.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:25.080
This is called a
IV current plotted

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:26.170
as a function of voltage.

00:55:26.170 --> 00:55:28.877
You can see that the
current is linear

00:55:28.877 --> 00:55:30.210
as a function of voltage, right?

00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:33.230
That's just Ohm's law.

00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:36.180
And you can see that for a
low conductance, G is small,

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.380
so the slope is small.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.760
For a high conductance,
you get a lot

00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.460
of current for a little bit
of voltage, and so the--

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.070
deeper, OK?

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:48.580
So if you plot current versus
voltage, you get a curve,

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:54.414
and the slope of that curve is
just equal to the conductance,

00:55:54.414 --> 00:55:56.800
all right?

00:55:56.800 --> 00:55:57.340
OK.

00:55:57.340 --> 00:56:00.200
Now let's look at capacitance.

00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:04.600
The total current through these
two capacitors in parallel

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.140
is just the current through
one capacitor plus the current

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.160
through the other.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:10.800
We can write the current through
each capacitor separately.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:16.080
I total equals C1
dV/dt plus C2 dV/dt.

00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:19.050
Factor out the dV/dt and you get
that the total current is just

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:21.320
C1 plus C2 dV/dt.

00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:25.410
So the total capacitance is
the sum of the capacitances.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:27.570
So if you have a
patch of membrane,

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:31.090
you measure the capacitance, if
you put another one next to it,

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.820
you'll get the sum of
those two capacitances.

00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:36.675
So the capacitance
also scales with area.

00:56:39.270 --> 00:56:42.590
So we can write down the
total membrane capacitance

00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:48.500
as capacitance per unit area
times the area of the cell,

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.380
right?

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.650
And the area of a cell is
like the-- if it's a sphere,

00:56:53.650 --> 00:56:59.020
it's 4 pi r squared
where is the radius, OK?

00:56:59.020 --> 00:56:59.520
All right.

00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.760
And here's the-- this
C sub m is called

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.580
this specific
membrane capacitance,

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:11.580
and it's 10 nanofarads per
square millimeter, all right?

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:14.860
OK, now, I want to show
you something really cool.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.450
We have a cell that has
a membrane with some--

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:20.400
this cell has some time
constant-- remember,

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.390
10 milliseconds.

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:26.280
Now you might think,
oh, the capacitance

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.160
of the cell depends on
how big it is, right?

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.140
And so the time
constant will change

00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:34.650
depending on how big the
cell is, you might think.

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:36.240
But let's actually
calculate the time

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:41.230
constant from this capacitance
and this conductance, OK?

00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:42.310
So here we go.

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:48.730
Time constant C. R is just 1
over the conductance, right?

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.500
So the time constant
is capacitance

00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:52.990
divided by conductance--
total capacitance

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:55.900
divided by total conductance.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:58.860
But you can rewrite this
capacitance as capacitance

00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:01.140
per unit area
times area, you can

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.950
rewrite that conductance
as conductance per unit

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:10.630
area times the area of the
cell, and the areas cancel.

00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:14.590
And so the time constant
is just that capacitance

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:17.770
per unit area of the membrane
divided by the conductance

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:19.880
per unit area of the membrane.

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:23.470
And what that means is that
the time constant of a cell--

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.380
nothing to do with the cell.

00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.870
The time constant is the
membrane time constant,

00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:31.165
and it's a property
only of the membrane.

00:58:34.110 --> 00:58:35.270
That's pretty cool, right?

00:58:43.126 --> 00:58:44.580
Any questions about that?

00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:56.420
Now in a more
complicated neuron where

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:59.480
you have a soma and
dendrites and axons,

00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:05.310
different parts of the cell
can have different conductance

00:59:05.310 --> 00:59:07.560
per unit area-- like
more ion channels

00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:11.010
out here on the dendrite
and maybe fewer on the soma.

00:59:11.010 --> 00:59:14.700
And so one part of a cell can
have a different membrane time

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:18.870
constant than some other
part of the cell, OK?

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:20.880
But again, it's a
property of the membrane.

00:59:27.478 --> 00:59:28.520
Any questions about that?

00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:29.294
Yes?

00:59:29.294 --> 00:59:32.305
AUDIENCE: So in that case,
like different time constants,

00:59:32.305 --> 00:59:35.150
do you have to like consider
flow between different areas?

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.580
MICHALE FEE: You sure do.

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.490
Absolutely.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:41.660
That's one of the
interesting things about--

00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.442
when cells have multiple--

00:59:43.442 --> 00:59:44.900
they have different
properties, you

00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:46.940
have current flowing
between them,

00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:50.390
but you have to understand
this kind of basic stuff

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:53.300
before you even get anywhere
close to understanding a more

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:55.240
complicated neuron, right?

00:59:58.670 --> 01:00:00.630
OK.

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:04.555
So we're going to add a
new component to our model.

01:00:07.370 --> 01:00:12.080
It's a battery, and it's
going to solve one really

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.050
fatal problem with this model.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.990
What's the problem
with this model?

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.790
Can anyone see--

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:20.570
I'm kind of showing
it right here.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:30.280
What happens to this neuron
if I turn the current off?

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:31.330
It goes back to zero.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.790
And in order to get the voltage
to go different from zero,

01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:43.460
I have to inject current
through my current source.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:46.850
Without me, the experimenter
with an electrode in it

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:50.120
injecting current, this neuron
literally just sits at zero

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.210
and stays there, all right?

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:56.170
It's actually a good model
of a dead neuron, OK?

01:00:59.170 --> 01:01:04.345
So in order to change that, we
need to add a battery here, OK?

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:11.270
And that battery is going
to power this thing up,

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:13.710
so now it can change
its own voltage.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.230
And then things start
getting really interesting.

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:21.870
So how can these
batteries allow a neuron

01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:23.950
to change its own voltage?

01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:28.500
Well, the way a neuron controls
its own voltage is it has ion

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:30.720
channels-- conductances--

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.720
that have little knobs
on them that the cell

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:39.140
can control called voltage.

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:42.320
So these conductances
are voltage-dependent,

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:45.200
and now the cell
connects these batteries

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:51.170
to its inside wire at different
times in different ways.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:53.600
So let's say we want to
make an action potential.

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.380
So we have a battery that's
got a positive voltage,

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.990
we have a battery that's
got a negative voltage,

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:03.760
and we make an action potential
by connecting the back

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.080
to the inside of the cell by
turning on this conductance,

01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:10.930
and then we're going
to connect the battery

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:13.120
with a negative
voltage to our cell,

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.520
and we're going to do
that one after the other.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.140
So watch this.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.880
We're going to connect
the positive battery

01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:23.885
and the voltage
is going to go up;

01:02:23.885 --> 01:02:25.760
we're going to turn off
the positive battery,

01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:29.050
connect the negative battery,
the voltage goes down;

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:32.070
and then we're going to
turn off both batteries,

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:36.610
and the voltage
just relaxes, OK?

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:37.800
Cool, right?

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.180
So now the neuron can
control its own voltage.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.914
But before we do that, we need
to put batteries in our neuron,

01:02:46.914 --> 01:02:48.950
OK?

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:49.450
All right.

01:02:49.450 --> 01:02:52.656
So anybody know what the-- yes?

01:02:52.656 --> 01:03:00.508
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
What does that [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:00.508 --> 01:03:02.425
MICHALE FEE: Good, we're
going to get to that.

01:03:02.425 --> 01:03:05.000
That was-- exact next question.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.546
What is it that makes
a battery in a neuron?

01:03:08.546 --> 01:03:09.480
Yeah?

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.444
AUDIENCE: Well I mean, like,
you have like something, right?

01:03:12.444 --> 01:03:13.230
Even in like--

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:13.520
MICHALE FEE: Good.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:14.680
AUDIENCE: --concentration
gradient--

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.430
MICHALE FEE: Good.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:17.470
AUDIENCE: --so that
give us a [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:18.220
MICHALE FEE: Here.

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:20.710
You give the rest
of the lecture.

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:22.600
That's exactly right.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:23.140
OK?

01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:25.760
Well concentration gradients.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.270
There's one more thing we need.

01:03:28.270 --> 01:03:31.330
Concentration gradients
by themselves don't do it.

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:36.200
We need ion channels that are
permeable only to certain ions,

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:36.700
OK?

01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:38.283
And that's what we're
going to do now.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.870
So you need
concentration gradients

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:45.360
and ion-selective
permeability, OK?

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:48.370
So we're going to
go through that.

01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:51.870
So let's take a beaker,
fill it with water,

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.570
have a membrane,
dividing it into two.

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.670
We're going to have an
electrode on one side,

01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:58.830
we measure the voltage
difference-- sorry,

01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:00.270
we have an electron
on both sides,

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.310
we hook it up to our
differential amplifier,

01:04:02.310 --> 01:04:05.100
and measure the voltage
difference on the two sides,

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.390
OK?

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:09.745
Then we're going to put--

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:14.580
we're going to take a--

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:18.820
we're going to buy some
potassium chloride from sigma,

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:20.400
we're going to take
a spoonful of it

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:23.460
and dump it into this
side of the beaker.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:27.630
Stir it up, and now you're going
to have lots of potassium ions

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.980
and chloride ions on this
side of the beaker, right?

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:35.550
Now we're going to
take a needle and poke

01:04:35.550 --> 01:04:37.660
a hole in that membrane.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:41.460
That becomes a leak,
a leak channel.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.940
It's a non-specific--
a non-selective pore

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:49.107
that passes any iron, OK?

01:04:49.107 --> 01:04:50.190
So what's going to happen?

01:04:54.375 --> 01:04:56.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:57.490
MICHALE FEE: Good.

01:04:57.490 --> 01:04:59.697
The ions are going to diffuse.

01:04:59.697 --> 01:05:00.530
From where to where?

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:01.670
Somebody else.

01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:03.470
AUDIENCE: To the
lower concentration.

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:05.387
MICHALE FEE: To the lower
concentration, good.

01:05:05.387 --> 01:05:08.230
So some of those ions are going
to diffuse from here to here.

01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:12.132
And we can plot the potassium--
let's focus on potassium now.

01:05:12.132 --> 01:05:14.090
We're going to plot-- we
can plot the potassium

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.710
concentration on
this side over time

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.620
and on this side over time.

01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:21.530
By the way, this
side of the beaker

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:23.900
is going to represent the
inside of the neuron, which

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.910
has lots of
potassium, and this is

01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:28.250
going to represent the
outside of our neuron, which

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:31.340
has very little potassium, OK?

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:35.280
So if we plot that potassium
concentration on this side,

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:37.160
it's going to
increase over time.

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:38.480
It's going to take a long--

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.610
and the concentration
here will decrease

01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:44.240
and eventually they'll meet
in the middle somewhere.

01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:47.245
They'll become equal.

01:05:47.245 --> 01:05:49.370
And that's going to take
a really long time, right?

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:51.950
Because it takes a
long time for this half

01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:53.810
of this spoonful of
potassium chloride

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:56.196
to diffuse to the other side.

01:05:56.196 --> 01:05:59.070
Yeah?

01:05:59.070 --> 01:06:01.800
OK.

01:06:01.800 --> 01:06:06.590
Now let's get a
different kind of needle,

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:08.060
a very special needle.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:11.210
It's really small
and poke a hole

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:13.850
in the membrane that
is only big enough

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.760
to pass potassium ions
but not chloride ions.

01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:20.930
So what's going to happen now?

01:06:26.490 --> 01:06:26.990
Yeah?

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:30.920
Somebody-- yes?

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.280
AUDIENCE: Half of it
flows to the other side--

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:34.030
MICHALE FEE: Good.

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:37.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.080
MICHALE FEE: Good.

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:45.140
So some potassium ions are going
to diffuse through this pore

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:48.460
and go to the other side.

01:06:48.460 --> 01:06:50.770
And what's going to happen
is if we plot the potassium

01:06:50.770 --> 01:06:53.950
concentration here, it
will decrease-- sorry--

01:06:53.950 --> 01:06:56.380
over here it will
increase a little bit,

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.420
and the potassium
concentration on this side

01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:01.870
will decrease a little bit,
but then it will stop changing,

01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:05.690
and it will never
come to equilibrium.

01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:08.650
It will also take a very short
time for that equilibrium

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:10.510
to happen, because
just a few potassium

01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:14.880
ions need to go to the
other side before it stops.

01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:18.360
So why does the concentration
stop changing here?

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:21.390
Well, it's because
the potassium current

01:07:21.390 --> 01:07:24.320
from this side to this
side goes to zero,

01:07:24.320 --> 01:07:25.695
and it goes to
zero very quickly.

01:07:31.070 --> 01:07:31.880
So why is that?

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:41.390
Well, one hint to the
answer to that question

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.300
comes if we look at the voltage
difference between the two

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:44.800
sides.

01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.020
So what you see is that the
voltage difference started

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:54.250
at 0, and when we poked
that hole, all of a sudden

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:56.920
there was a rapidly-developing
voltage difference

01:07:56.920 --> 01:08:00.470
across the two sides, OK?

01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:08.350
Why does that
voltage go negative?

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:10.800
Anybody?

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:13.940
What happened when these
positive charges started

01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:18.115
diffusing from this
side to this side?

01:08:18.115 --> 01:08:19.615
AUDIENCE: Didn't
you say it can bond

01:08:19.615 --> 01:08:24.479
to the positive and
negative charge [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:26.939
MICHALE FEE: Basically this
is like a capacitor, right?

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:30.930
And some charges diffused
from here to here,

01:08:30.930 --> 01:08:33.779
some positive charges
diffused from here to here,

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:37.649
that charges up this side, and
so the voltage is positive.

01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:40.200
We put positive charge--
more positive charges here,

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:43.915
the voltage here goes up, OK?

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:54.529
So if the voltage here is
higher than the voltage here--

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:58.130
we're plotting V1 minus
V2, the voltage here

01:08:58.130 --> 01:09:02.420
is lower than the
voltage here, and so this

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.789
is going negative, OK?

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:13.090
And that voltage difference,
that negative voltage here,

01:09:13.090 --> 01:09:16.880
positive voltage here,
what does that do?

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:19.850
It repels, it makes--
the positive side

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:23.100
starts repelling which ions?

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.609
It's repelling positive ions.

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:29.840
So it keeps more potassium
ions from diffusing

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.663
through the hole.

01:09:32.663 --> 01:09:33.580
Does that makes sense?

01:09:43.830 --> 01:09:45.240
Blank stares.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.810
Are we OK?

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:48.710
OK, good.

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:53.569
And it continues to drop until
it reaches a constant voltage,

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:56.045
and that's called the
equilibrium potential, OK?

01:09:56.045 --> 01:09:59.120
The voltage changes until
it comes to equilibrium,

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:01.760
and that voltage difference
is called the equilibrium

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:04.160
potential.

01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:10.660
And that voltage difference
is a battery, OK?

01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.500
And I'm going to--

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:13.930
we're going to
explain a little bit--

01:10:13.930 --> 01:10:16.690
I think it's in the next
lecture, the one that's

01:10:16.690 --> 01:10:20.860
on tape that explains how
you actually can justify

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:22.810
representing that as a battery.

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:25.210
But right now, I'm
going to show you

01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:28.810
how to calculate what that
voltage difference actually

01:10:28.810 --> 01:10:30.910
is-- what's the size
of the battery, how

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:34.400
big is the battery, OK?

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.070
So you can see that when ions--

01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:39.950
positive ions defuse to this
side, this voltage goes up,

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:44.210
you have a voltage gradient that
corresponds to a field pointing

01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.460
in this direction.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.160
And that electric field pushes
against the ions-- remember,

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.560
we talked about drift
in an electric field,

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.130
so when those ions are
trying to diffuse across,

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:59.000
that electric field is
literally dragging them back

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.160
to this side, right?

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:08.480
So we have a current flowing
this way from diffusion,

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.990
and we have a current
flowing that way from being

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:13.410
dragged in the electric field.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:19.600
And so we can calculate that
voltage difference because

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.900
at equilibrium, the current
flowing this way from diffusion

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:28.850
has to equal the current
flowing that way from drift

01:11:28.850 --> 01:11:30.260
in an electric field, OK?

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:34.040
So one way to
calculate this is we're

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.490
going to calculate the
current due to drift,

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:39.600
current due to
diffusion, add those up,

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:42.470
and that's equal to the
total, and at equilibrium,

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:46.330
that has to equal to 0, right?

01:11:46.330 --> 01:11:50.440
So what I'm showing
you now is just

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.030
sort of the
framework for how you

01:11:52.030 --> 01:11:58.870
would calculate this using this
drift and diffusion equation.

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:02.200
So we have Ohm's
law that tells us

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:05.230
how the voltage
difference produces

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:08.920
a current due to drift, and we
have Fick's law that tells us

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.520
how much current is
due to diffusion,

01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:18.280
and you can set the sum of
those two things to equal zero,

01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:19.588
all right?

01:12:19.588 --> 01:12:21.130
And so this is the
way it would look.

01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:25.090
I don't expect you to follow
anything on this slide

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:29.140
just except to see that it
can be done in this way, OK?

01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:34.240
So you don't even have
to write this down, OK?

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:36.700
So the drift current
is proportion-- it's

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.910
some constant times voltage.

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:44.350
Fisk's law is some constant
times that concentration

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.135
gradient, remember that.

01:12:46.135 --> 01:12:50.748
And we just set those two things
equal and solve for delta V,

01:12:50.748 --> 01:12:51.790
and that's what you find.

01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:54.670
What you find is the delta V
is just some constant times

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.330
the log of the difference
in concentrations

01:12:58.330 --> 01:13:02.994
on the inside and outside, OK?

01:13:02.994 --> 01:13:06.220
Now it turns out, there's a
way of calculating this that's

01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.980
much simpler and
more elegant, and I'm

01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:13.130
going to show you
that calculation, OK?

01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.639
Yes?

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:15.597
AUDIENCE: And so like
the concentrations inside

01:13:15.597 --> 01:13:18.382
and outside, like at the
[INAUDIBLE] beginning of the--

01:13:18.382 --> 01:13:19.840
MICHALE FEE: Yes,
at the beginning.

01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:23.080
And the answer is that the
concentrations don't change

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.720
very much through this
process, so you can even

01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.870
ignore that change, OK?

01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:31.160
All right, everybody got this?

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:31.660
All right.

01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:33.520
So here's how we're
going to calculate

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.110
an alternative
way of calculating

01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:39.660
this voltage difference,
just really beautiful.

01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:41.420
We're going to use the
Boltzmann equation.

01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:45.290
The Boltzmann equation
tells the probability

01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:48.350
of a particle
being in two states

01:13:48.350 --> 01:13:51.280
as a function of the energy
difference between those two

01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:51.780
states.

01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:54.560
And one of those states is going
to correspond to a particle

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:58.700
being on the left side of the
beaker or inside of our cell,

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.772
and that particle being
outside of our cell

01:14:01.772 --> 01:14:03.230
or on the other
side of the beaker.

01:14:03.230 --> 01:14:05.780
And those two, left
side and right side,

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:08.600
have different energies, OK?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.990
So our system has two
states, a high-energy state

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.460
and a low-energy state.

01:14:13.460 --> 01:14:15.518
Boltzmann equation just
says the probability

01:14:15.518 --> 01:14:17.810
of being in state 1 divided
by the probability of being

01:14:17.810 --> 01:14:22.050
in state 2 is just e to the
minus energy difference divided

01:14:22.050 --> 01:14:22.550
by kT.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.820
k is the Boltzmann
constant, T is temperature--

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.710
this is the same kT
that we talked about

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:30.550
in the last lecture.

01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:36.500
Now, you can see if the
temperature is very low,

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.700
all those particles are--

01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:39.860
if the temperature is 0,
they're not being jostled,

01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.350
they're just sitting
there quietly.

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:44.720
They can't move, they
can't get into state 1,

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:48.020
they just sit in state 2, OK?

01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.970
So the probability of
being in state 1 divided

01:14:49.970 --> 01:14:54.250
by the probability of
being in state 2 is 0, OK?

01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:57.650
If kT is 0, this is
a very big number,

01:14:57.650 --> 01:14:59.530
e to the minus big number is 0.

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:03.810
Now let's say that
we heat things up

01:15:03.810 --> 01:15:07.290
a bit so that now kT gets big.

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:12.690
So the Katie actually gets
approximately the same size

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:16.650
as the energy difference
between our two states.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:18.200
So now some of
those particles can

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.450
get jostled over into state 1.

01:15:25.210 --> 01:15:27.130
And we can write down--

01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:28.690
we can just calculate--

01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:31.180
you can see now that the
probability of being in state 1

01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:32.020
is--

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.970
divided by the probability
of being in state 2

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:35.890
is bigger than 0 now.

01:15:35.890 --> 01:15:37.720
You can actually
just calculate it.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:41.770
If the energy difference
is just twice kT, then

01:15:41.770 --> 01:15:45.880
energy difference,
2kT divided by kT,

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.308
that ratio of probabilities
is just e to the minus 2, OK?

01:15:53.550 --> 01:15:57.240
If the energy difference is
bigger, then you can see,

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:59.100
that probability
ratio is smaller.

01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:00.630
The probability
of being a state 1

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:04.015
goes to 0 if you
increase that energy.

01:16:04.015 --> 01:16:05.640
If you make that
energy difference very

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:08.580
small at temperature
kT, you'd see

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:13.150
that if the energy difference
is about the same as kT,

01:16:13.150 --> 01:16:14.830
then the probability
of being at state 1

01:16:14.830 --> 01:16:16.660
is equal to the
probability in state 2.

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:19.450
Those particles just
jostle back and forth

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:21.880
between the two states.

01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:24.410
OK, so we're ready to do this.

01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.810
Ratio of probabilities
is e to the minus energy

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:27.870
difference over KT.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:30.950
What's the energy of a
particle here versus here?

01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:33.200
Well, that's a charged
particle, the energy difference

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:36.050
is just given by the
voltage difference.

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.900
So energy is charged
times voltage where

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:41.036
Q is the charge of an ion.

01:16:41.036 --> 01:16:43.710
The ratio of probabilities
is e to the--

01:16:43.710 --> 01:16:46.035
Q times voltage
difference over kT.

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:52.400
Take the log of
both sides, solve

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.310
for the voltage difference,
V in minus V out

01:16:55.310 --> 01:17:00.440
equals minus kT over Q times the
log of the probability ratio,

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:05.600
but the probability is
just this concentration.

01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:09.350
And so we can write
this as delta V--

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.910
the voltage difference
is equal to kT

01:17:12.910 --> 01:17:18.340
over Q, which is 25 millivolts,
times the log of the ratio

01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:21.460
of potassium concentration
outside to potassium

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:24.000
concentration inside.

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.160
And that's exactly
the same equation

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.660
that we get if you do that much
more complicated derivation

01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:35.070
based on Fick's law and
Ohm's law, balancing Fick's

01:17:35.070 --> 01:17:38.790
law and Ohm's law, OK?

01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:40.920
And this is equilibrium
potential here,

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:44.120
not electric field.

01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:46.610
OK, so let's take a look
at potassium concentrations

01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:48.700
in a real cell.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.470
This is actually from
squid giant axon.

01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:52.450
400 millimolar inside.

01:17:52.450 --> 01:17:56.200
So 20 millimolar outside, so
there's a lot of potassium

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:59.590
inside of a cell, not
very much outside.

01:17:59.590 --> 01:18:01.360
Plug those into our equation.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:04.090
kT over Q is 25,000
millimolar-- temperature

01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:06.980
at room temperature.

01:18:06.980 --> 01:18:10.310
The log of that concentration
ratio is minus 3,

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:12.430
so ek is minus 75 millivolts.

01:18:12.430 --> 01:18:14.410
That means if we start
with a lot of potassium

01:18:14.410 --> 01:18:20.110
inside of our cell, open up a
potassium-selective channel,

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:21.280
what happens?

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:26.010
Potassium diffuses out
through that channel

01:18:26.010 --> 01:18:30.460
and the voltage goes
to minus 75 millivolts.

01:18:30.460 --> 01:18:31.810
How do you know it's negative?

01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:34.810
Like, I always can't remember
whether this is concentration

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.820
inside or outside, outside
over inside, I don't know.

01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:39.965
But the point is, you don't
actually have to know,

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.590
because you can just
look at it and see

01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:44.080
the answer what sign it is.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.930
If you have positive ions--

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:50.800
a high concentration of positive
ions inside, they diffuse out,

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:54.970
the voltage inside of the
cell when positive ions leave

01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:57.630
is going to do what?

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:02.040
It's going to go down, so
that's why it's minus, OK?

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:06.500
So-- the battery
and in those video

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:09.320
modules that I
recorded for you, it's

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:12.260
going to explain how you
actually incorporate that

01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.040
into a battery in
our circuit model.

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.880
And so we've done
all of these things,

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.270
we've looked at how membrane
capacitance and resistance

01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:23.120
allows neurons to
integrate over time,

01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:25.740
we've learned how to write down
the differential equations,

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:28.520
we're now able to just
look at a current input

01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.530
and figure out the
voltage change,

01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:33.320
and we now understand where
the batteries in a neuron

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.110
come from.

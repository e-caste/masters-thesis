00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.059
You probably noticed Professor Cohen is a
little bit more formal and wears a tie.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.779
And so, when he's here, I also wear a tie.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:15.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.340
But today we're a little bit less formal and
so no ties.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.529
But I'll probably have one on, on Thursday,
again.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.899
Just so that you knew what the code was.

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:31.340
Tom Moser is coming.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.789
You know, that was the generation where everybody
wore ties.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.710
So, I'll wear a tie, too.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.670
Anyway, despite the fact that we're a little
bit more informal that doesn't imply any intellectual

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.350
informality.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:56.219
We are actually, I think, very fortunate that
Professor John Logsdon, who is the Director

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.260
of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington
University which is part of their Elliott

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.930
School of International Affairs -- And we
have a recent graduate of that program.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.570
He is going to talk to us today.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.370
And this is really going to be the last in
the looks at kind of the policy which led

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.000
to the original requirements on the Space
Shuttle.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.640
And, as we've pointed out on numerous occasions,
when you're looking at systems engineering

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.220
of any scale project -- Well, anything really.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.670
It is absolutely critical to get the requirements
straight.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.380
And we cannot really understand a lot of the
technical issues with the Space Shuttle and

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.160
the challenges that we had to face without
understanding how it got to be that way.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.490
Professor Logsdon has written numerous articles
about the shuttle.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.240
And do you have an electronic version of your
science article?

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.670
You don't.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.830
We'll have to dig that up.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.070
We'll give you a version of that.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:18.510
But before that, actually, I guess the work
where he really achieved a national recognition

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.310
was his book on the Apollo program, "The Decision
To Go To The Moon," which was a history of

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:29.110
the Apollo program.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:36.069
Professor Logsdon is a recognized expert is
space policy.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.000
You will see numerous articles by him in Space
News.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.020
And he is often the first person who gets
called by the New York Times or National Public

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:53.920
Radio or one of the other media for comments
on various developments in space.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.240
And actually, depending on how the talk today
goes on the shuttle in terms of time, if there

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.670
is some time left over he's brought some information
about the new exploration architecture which

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.010
was just announced formally yesterday.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.079
And, given that we're setting out on another
large space project where a lot of the same

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:22.390
issues that we had to deal with about the
shuttle will also apply, I think it would

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.599
be interesting for people in the class to
start following what's going on in this new

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.099
space system.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.930
So, that's enough from me.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.060
John, I'll turn it over to you.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.670
And take it away.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.900
Good morning.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:49.550
What I'm going to do this morning is somewhat
different from what you just announced in

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.660
the sense that I'm not going to talk about
the political history of the shuttle requirements

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.840
as much as the political history of the shuttle
and how the requirements interacted with that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.780
political history.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.290
So, it may be the same thing.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.709
But I'm not a technical person.

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:15.640
Although, you have a bachelor's degree in
physics which is a well-hidden fact.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.870
Yes.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.410
Next Tuesday is the 100th anniversary of the
publication of the equation E equals MC squared.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.970
And my degree in physics is almost before
that, not quite.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.280
One of the things that we've been doing at
George Washington University, seemingly forever,

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:48.130
and close to it, it started in 1990, is a
project to collect the seminal documents that

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.530
define the evolution of the US Space Program.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.010
There are now six volumes of this size printed,
we're working on seven and there is one more

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.720
to follow called "Exploring the Unknown".

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.270
Jeff thinks that it's in your library.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.350
I'm going to try to get an electronic version
of what I'll just talk about in a moment to

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.960
put on your class website.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.680
Volume four, which Dr.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.620
Hoffman has at his home, not in his office,
deals with access to space.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.110
And one section of volume four deals with
the shuttle.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.960
And that's what I'm going to try to get an
electronic copy of for you.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:38.790
What I've done is built this talk around the
original documents that trace the policy history

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.320
of the shuttle.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.770
And I'll use them kind of as backdrop.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:53.760
As NASA approached the end of the Apollo program,
its leaders, or at least some of them were

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.350
thinking about what followed Apollo.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:04.550
And, at that time, the head of I'll say Manned
Spaceflight and apologize for the gender-specific

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.090
language.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:11.560
But that indeed was the Office of Manned Spaceflight
in the late `60s.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:19.490
Its head was a very creative character named
George Miller who is still active.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.509
He's one of the founders and moving spirits
in a thing called Kistler Aerospace that wants

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.800
to provide alternative commercial access to
space.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.909
Miller gave this talk, as you see, August
of 1968.

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:41.820
As far as anyone can tell, it's the first
use of the term "efficient earth to orbit

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:47.870
space transportation system and economical
space shuttle".

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:53.610
Miller's concept of the shuttle, which had
a lot of influence in one strain of its development,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.580
was rather grandiose in character.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:07.590
Especially the notion that the shuttle would
operate in a mode similar to large commercial

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:18.630
air transports and work in and out of major
airports.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:24.070
Landing would be completely automated with
prime dependence on spacecraft guidance with

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:29.389
ground control backup.

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:31.680
And this is a long talk.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:37.449
It's in the book I just mentioned.

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:42.830
Then its basic design could be applied to
point-to-point transport.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:47.949
If the Space Shuttle were used as a global
transport, safety and comfort standards could

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:50.690
be comparable to those of a large transport
jet.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:54.630
It was probably not like business class in
a 747.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.680
Maybe like the Concorde.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.380
But that's certainly what they were talking
about with the National Aerospace plane.

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:09.740
I mean if you can develop a plane that can
take off from a runway and fly into orbit.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.580
And you remember, when we talked about the
rocket equation, we tried to make it clear

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.310
why that is such a difficult thing to do.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.280
But, if you could do it, then you don't have
to go all the way to orbit.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:24.960
You can just go halfway to orbit and land
in Tokyo after you take off from London or

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:25.960
New York.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.460
Right.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:33.740
And this kind of holy grail reduction in cost
by two orders of magnitude, that was the mental

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:40.769
set of the guy who I would call at least the
policy father of the Space Shuttle, is that

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:47.459
you could have an aircraft-like operations,
two orders of magnitude of a level of safety

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:53.040
and reliability and operability that it could
even be used for commercial transport.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:09:05.420
As you know, NASA was successful in carrying
out its mission of getting humans to the moon

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.890
in July of 1969.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:16.510
When Nixon came into office in January of
1969, he had a transition taskforce on space.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:22.330
And that taskforce told him that there was
a need for some decisions on what to do after

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.000
Apollo.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.490
With the focus on getting Apollo done, the
then head of NASA Jim Webb didn't like long-range

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:30.790
planning.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:37.270
He wanted the politicians to tell NASA what
to do, rather than the other way around.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:44.100
NASA was woefully unprepared for what it wanted
to do after Apollo.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.770
And the country hadn't discussed it at all.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:53.870
Nixon appointed a so-called space task force,
Space Task Group and asked it for definitive

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.520
recommendations on the post-Apollo space program.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:05.100
That task group was chaired by the vice president
who traditionally has had the space portfolio

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.830
in most administrations.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.769
At that time was a well-known space expert
named Spiro Agnew.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:15.050
You're all too young for that to even be a
joke.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.769
He was later caught taking bribes in the White
House and resigned in shame.

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:23.980
He was a typical Maryland politician, which
means corrupt.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.940
That's my home state.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:34.740
The Space Task Group was captured by NASA,
by its then administrator Tom Paine who was

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:37.160
a very bravado character.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.990
He told NASA that they should be swashbuckling.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.330
And by Miller, who had developed a long-range
plan for NASA.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.600
And, ultimately, by Wernher von Braun who
was brought up to Washington to add the charisma

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.360
to the plan.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:58.830
The report that was submitted by the Space
Task Group to the White House two months after

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:11.959
Apollo 11 had these recommendations -- -- for
what NASA should do.

00:11:11.959 --> 00:11:20.089
This was what NASA really wanted to do, mars
starting in 1981, a hundred man space base

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:23.170
in the mid '80s.

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:29.930
The program that was recommended ultimately
was Program 2 which had mars in '86.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:33.320
And you see these comparative accomplishments.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:40.709
And in here was an earth-to- orbit space shuttle
for some time between '75 and '77.

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:48.029
That's where the shuttle entered into national
policy, was in Nixon's reaction, or in the

00:11:48.029 --> 00:11:52.540
country's reaction to NASA's post-Apollo proposal.

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:59.990
Again, just to give you a sense of this kind
of thinking at that point, I'm not sure where

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.649
this came from, to be frank.

00:12:01.649 --> 00:12:10.339
But you take the station, the space based
and other stuff in this maximum program and

00:12:10.339 --> 00:12:19.329
you're talking total space shuttle flights
a year peaking in '83 with 66 flights a year,

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:27.930
including 34 to service a six-man base and
a six-man orbiting station at the moon.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:31.339
So, these truly grandiose ideas of what might
be done.

00:12:31.339 --> 00:12:37.480
I don't think it was ever clear why you had
to go to the moon every other week in order

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.399
to maintain a six-man base either.

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:42.019
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:42.019 --> 00:12:47.940
No, I think it was not every other week.

00:12:47.940 --> 00:12:50.300
Thirty flights a year.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.000
I think it was a three month rotation of a
crew.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.370
But they've got 30, 40 flights a year.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.110
Maybe logistics flights, I don't know.

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.350
Logistics.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.709
And you're doing two things.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:03.690
You've got a six person station in orbit around
the moon.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:03.690
Why?
I don't know.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.029
And a six person base.

00:13:08.029 --> 00:13:13.860
The architecture, it was announced yesterday,
culminates in the buildup of a four or more

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:22.220
person lunar base with a passing mention that,
oh yeah, we might go to mars.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.250
By the way, if anybody has comments or questions,
interrupt me.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.480
Otherwise, I'll just drone on.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:28.910
Yeah, Larry.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:36.750
To what extent was the Space Station's existence
importance for the shuttle back in the `70s?

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.480
It was the reason for its existence.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:45.260
At this point, the reason to have a space
shuttle was to take crew and supplies to the

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:52.180
station, period, at least in the core NASA
planner's ideas.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:58.720
You had people like Miller who left the agency
in September of '69 with these very grandiose

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.290
ideas.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:03.440
He was succeeded by Dale Myers, who I understand
has already talked to you.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:11.360
And Myers was very instrumental in the negotiations
that led ultimately to the decision to go

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.420
forward with the station.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.310
I remember the first time I heard the word
space shuttle.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:22.339
As Jeff said, I've been at this a long time.

00:14:22.339 --> 00:14:27.430
I finished the book "The Decision To Go To
The Moon," published by MIT Press, but out

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:31.880
of print, in late 1968.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:35.070
We tried to market it as a paperback.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:39.269
We were going to put a rocket and a girl on
the cover, and the inside story of why Kennedy

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:40.170
sent us to the moon.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:41.660
It didn't work.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:49.040
It had footnotes and all because it was a
PhD dissertation.

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:57.720
Talking to an audience like this, they understand
what a PhD dissertation looks like.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:04.550
I went down to attend my first launch, which
was Apollo 11, and for some reason hadn't

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:10.790
rented a car so I was figuring on hitching
a ride from Orlando to Coco Beach.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:15.760
And the person that I ended up driving to
was a man named Leroy Day.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.350
Did you know Roy Day?

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:22.889
Roy was, at that time, running the Phase A
studies of the Space Shuttle.

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:24.980
And he told me what he was doing.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.990
It was the first time I had heard of the concept.

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:35.389
See, I don't know where this came from but
it's the kind of thinking of the need for

00:15:35.389 --> 00:15:35.570
this.

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:38.839
So, to go to your point, Larry.

00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:48.889
When NASA first presented its post-Apollo
plans to the Congress in the spring of 1970,

00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:52.050
the program was called Station Shuttle.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:56.220
And they were coupled at the hip.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:16:02.440
And so it was the integral justification from
the NASA side.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:08.160
Although, people like Dale Myers were already
negotiating with their counterparts in the

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:13.410
Department of Defense for potential military
use of the system.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:18.500
Although, almost clearly this is before any
military involvement or really commercial

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:22.889
involvement came in because, when you look,
there are only two unmanned satellites per

00:16:22.889 --> 00:16:26.660
year.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.470
This is the manifest to implement this.

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:33.560
And that was purely as NASA program.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:40.720
There was not much consideration of other
users of the shuttle at this point because

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:47.510
this was enough to justify the investment
in a new vehicle.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:53.750
Again, the logic was that you could put these
big things in space like space stations but

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:58.019
the logistics costs would drive you crazy
if you were doing it with expendables.

00:16:58.019 --> 00:17:06.019
And so the only way to operate a permanent
outpost in orbit or beyond was to have reusability

00:17:06.019 --> 00:17:08.949
in the supply system, in the transportation
system.

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:11.909
That was, in essence, the number one requirement.

00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:18.419
Unfortunately, well, I don't know whether
it was unfortunate but in reality the Nixon

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:22.329
administration was not having any of this.

00:17:22.329 --> 00:17:27.849
Nixon made a statement in response to the
Space Task Force report, as you'll see, March

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:29.049
of 1970.

00:17:29.049 --> 00:17:32.279
So, it took him six months to respond to the
report.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:35.649
Meanwhile, NASA's budget was getting chopped
to pieces.

00:17:35.649 --> 00:17:44.679
But it was essentially a fundamental 180 degree
change in policy from Apollo.

00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:50.379
Now, Apollo was separate leaps requiring a
massive concentration of energy.

00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:55.830
Space must take their proper place within
a rigorous system of national priorities,

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.279
must be planned in conjunction with all the
other undertakings.

00:17:59.279 --> 00:18:05.429
In other words, space has to be compared in
its priority to all the other demands on the

00:18:05.429 --> 00:18:07.470
federal budget.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:14.210
And at least for the Nixon administration,
but in reality for every administration since,

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:21.519
the answer has been essentially the same.

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:26.840
When Kennedy made his speech saying we should
go to the moon in 1961, the NASA budget jumped

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:35.019
89% the first year, 101% the second year,
38% the third year.

00:18:35.019 --> 00:18:38.889
And it's like a rollercoaster that gets to
the top of the first hill.

00:18:38.889 --> 00:18:42.669
And the program has been living on that momentum
every since.

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:46.549
And you came down that hill very quickly.

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:57.759
You see by '73 or '74, this value was percent
of the federal budget, so it's kind of a constant

00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:58.119
measure.

00:18:58.119 --> 00:19:04.619
As the budget goes up, NASA gets essentially
the same share of the federal budget.

00:19:04.619 --> 00:19:07.389
About seven-tenths or eight-tenths of one
percent.

00:19:07.389 --> 00:19:11.869
And has gotten that share for 35 years.

00:19:11.869 --> 00:19:21.779
And this, I would say, is the way the democratic
political system makes policy choice, is through

00:19:21.779 --> 00:19:23.539
budget allocations.

00:19:23.539 --> 00:19:29.619
And if you have the same budget allocation
essentially for 35 years, I would say that's

00:19:29.619 --> 00:19:35.899
where space ranks in the scheme of national
priorities according to the political leadership

00:19:35.899 --> 00:19:38.729
in the White House and Congress.

00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:48.549
Just to flip ahead to 2004, one of the fundamental
premises in the Bush Vision for Space Exploration

00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:54.090
is that NASA will stay at this level of expenditures.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:58.570
And that everything you want to do, going
back to the moon, eventually to mars, has

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:02.759
to be within that budget envelope, which means
you have to design to that.

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:07.669
And remember the fundamental systems engineering
triad we talked about on several occasions,

00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:10.840
cost, schedule, performance.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.909
That clearly demonstrates cost is a fixed
parameter.

00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:16.210
We don't have the freedom.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:24.119
Either for the shuttle or in this future program,
cost is going to go up by very much.

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:31.340
Just in case anybody asks what these two blips
are, this one is the replacement of Challenger

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.769
after the 1986 shuttle accident.

00:20:33.769 --> 00:20:38.039
It's a one-time cost of building another orbiter.

00:20:38.039 --> 00:20:48.710
And this was Bush 41, you may remember, or
no, who announced a space exploration initiative

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.179
on the 20th anniversary of Apollo.

00:20:51.179 --> 00:20:57.999
And he provided an increase in budget resources
to carry out that initiative which, when Bill

00:20:57.999 --> 00:21:01.210
Clinton was elected, quickly got undone.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:10.090
And you see the result in the past few years.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:18.519
In a sense, that decision that space had to
be planned in the context of all other priorities

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:22.840
has had multiple impacts over 35 years.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.609
The first thing is NASA has never accepted
it and has always tried to do more than it

00:21:27.609 --> 00:21:30.440
has resources.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.239
And one of the things Jeff didn't say was
that I was a member of the Columbia Accident

00:21:35.239 --> 00:21:37.879
Investigation Board after the last accident.

00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:42.899
One of the things we said in our report was
that NASA had, for too many years, been trying

00:21:42.899 --> 00:21:44.889
to do too much with too little.

00:21:44.889 --> 00:21:51.119
And it created the kinds of stresses in the
organization that led to some of the organizational

00:21:51.119 --> 00:22:02.220
sloppiness that was at least a contributing
factor in the Columbia accident.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:10.929
It told NASA that it could not pursue in the
`70s a post-Apollo program that was anywhere

00:22:10.929 --> 00:22:12.919
near its ambitions.

00:22:12.919 --> 00:22:21.559
And so NASA had to reinvent its program from
what it had proposed in 1969.

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:29.389
And, by the end of 1970, this is how budgets
get done.

00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:35.609
This is a letter from the then head of NASA,
Jim Fletcher, transmitting NASA's recommendations

00:22:35.609 --> 00:22:37.779
for the next year's budget.

00:22:37.779 --> 00:22:44.609
This happened last Monday, September the 12th
this year, NASA submitted its formal budget

00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:46.549
proposal to the White House.

00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:48.759
Every year this starts the process.

00:22:48.759 --> 00:23:09.289
Well, you can read all this rhetoric later.

00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:14.919
NASA had decided that the key element in the
program for the `70s was not the Space Station

00:23:14.919 --> 00:23:17.489
by now but the Space Shuttle.

00:23:17.489 --> 00:23:24.399
It supports the last four of the presidents'
six objectives, these four.

00:23:24.399 --> 00:23:37.789
And reflecting that decision, NASA announced,
"We have made a major decision to defer development

00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:44.409
of a space station to a later time and to
orient the space station studies towards modular

00:23:44.409 --> 00:23:50.509
systems that can be launched, as well as serviced
by the space shuttle." Again, a fundamental

00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.119
change in plans.

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:58.799
The station that NASA was planning in 1969
would have been launched by the Saturn 5.

00:23:58.799 --> 00:24:06.179
Would have been 33 feet across, have lots
of habitable space, be big, a 12 person minimum

00:24:06.179 --> 00:24:10.919
building up to 50 person, maybe eventually
100 person outpost.

00:24:10.919 --> 00:24:16.619
This represented a major shift that said,
number one, the shuttle becomes our number

00:24:16.619 --> 00:24:22.789
one priority, not the station, and the shuttle
has to be designed to launch space station

00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:24.059
modules.

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:26.619
That was the overriding NASA goal.

00:24:26.619 --> 00:24:39.830
And so I would argue or suggest that this
decision made in late 1970 only separated

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:51.119
in time shuttle and station that the intimate
link between the two programs remained.

00:24:51.119 --> 00:24:54.859
It was just going to do them in sequence,
rather than at the same time.

00:24:54.859 --> 00:24:58.509
And here we are 35 years later.

00:24:58.509 --> 00:25:07.019
And the major issue in getting started on
exploration remains, what do you do with the

00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:08.940
shuttle, what do you do with the station?

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:15.119
They are now seen as mortgages that have to
be paid or obstacles to the next systems or

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:22.169
however you want to characterize.

00:25:22.169 --> 00:25:31.969
What this also meant is that the traffic model
that was justifying the shuttle of all these

00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:39.499
launches to space stations and lunar bases
that you saw was no longer operative.

00:25:39.499 --> 00:25:47.349
And so beginning at the start of 1970 and
all the way through this two-year complex

00:25:47.349 --> 00:25:52.929
decision process, the Office of Management
and Budget kept saying well, how do you justify

00:25:52.929 --> 00:25:55.879
this investment?

00:25:55.879 --> 00:26:00.279
You're talking about a multi-billion dollar
investment in the future.

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:03.359
What is the justification for it?

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:10.320
This was the first time, in the early '70s,
that the White House, through its Office of

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:18.219
Management and Budget, used cost-effectiveness
analysis, cost-benefit analysis as a tool

00:26:18.219 --> 00:26:19.499
in budget allocations.

00:26:19.499 --> 00:26:24.299
It had not been done, certainly not been done
in the space program of the `60s.

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:34.940
But OMB insisted that NASA show an economic
justification for this investment.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:42.249
And in order to make it come out the way OMB
wanted it to come out, which was that there

00:26:42.249 --> 00:26:48.379
was no justification, how much economics do
any of you get in this environment?

00:26:48.379 --> 00:26:55.489
I have never had an economics course, except
at Jesuit undergraduate college called Christian

00:26:55.489 --> 00:26:59.219
economics, which may be a contradiction.

00:26:59.219 --> 00:26:59.749
Never mind.

00:26:59.749 --> 00:27:00.619
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:00.619 --> 00:27:08.139
But I'm going to say something, I don't have
a clue of what it means, which is that OMB

00:27:08.139 --> 00:27:16.769
insisted that NASA use a 10% discount rate,
which is the future value of current money.

00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:23.659
And that's much higher than the discount rate
applied to many other investments, because

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:27.469
this was a long-term and risky investment.

00:27:27.469 --> 00:27:35.039
And so that meant the economic justification
for the shuttle had to be very strong.

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:43.940
And, throughout this process, there was this
constant pressure on one hand to justify the

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.609
shuttle economically.

00:27:45.609 --> 00:27:52.029
The only way that could be done, absent a
space station or an ambitious NASA program,

00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:54.349
was finding other users.

00:27:54.349 --> 00:27:56.779
And this goes back to your comment earlier.

00:27:56.779 --> 00:28:06.169
NASA became not just a kind of suitor of the
military as a user of the shuttle, but the

00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:10.889
economic justification for going ahead with
the shuttle became totally dependent on the

00:28:10.889 --> 00:28:15.549
military willingness to use the vehicle.

00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:19.619
And military is a euphemism.

00:28:19.619 --> 00:28:25.729
Many of the payloads that were being discussed
there were intelligence payloads operated

00:28:25.729 --> 00:28:31.479
by the organization called the National Reconnaissance
Office which, at that time, the existence

00:28:31.479 --> 00:28:36.039
of the National Reconnaissance Office itself
was classified.

00:28:36.039 --> 00:28:38.769
So, you could not say NRO satellites.

00:28:38.769 --> 00:28:39.419
You can say it now.

00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:44.899
NRO's existence was declassified in 1992.

00:28:44.899 --> 00:28:55.469
But, at that point, was all called Air Force
or DOD satellite, many of which, including

00:28:55.469 --> 00:29:05.229
the most demanding were intelligence satellites.

00:29:05.229 --> 00:29:15.450
The primary determinant of the size of the
shuttle's payload bay, the width was the ability

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:17.309
to launch space station modules.

00:29:17.309 --> 00:29:21.889
Professor Young may be able to comment.

00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:26.789
If I understand it right, the kind of human
factor studies at the time said that people

00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:32.960
would be unwilling to live in tubes less than
14 feet across for long durations.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:40.509
And so the shuttle had to be able to accommodate
a 14 foot wide module.

00:29:40.509 --> 00:29:43.039
The length could be adjusted.

00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:54.859
But the military payloads, I think Hubble
pointed down rather than pointed up.

00:29:54.859 --> 00:30:03.649
I think there's been enough discussion of
it that I'm not revealing classified material.

00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:09.479
The reconnaissance equivalent of Hubble was
the next generation reconnaissance satellite.

00:30:09.479 --> 00:30:13.639
And that was basically 55 feet long.

00:30:13.639 --> 00:30:21.509
And so the decision was that you needed a
payload bay 60 feet long in order to capture

00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:25.119
many military and reconnaissance payloads.

00:30:25.119 --> 00:30:31.839
And that was a determinant of the size of
the payload bay, which again drove the size

00:30:31.839 --> 00:30:36.830
of the shuttle.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:41.649
The other military requirement was the desire,
well, there were two.

00:30:41.649 --> 00:30:48.799
One was a desire to be able to go into polar
orbit which meant a west coast launch site.

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:54.450
You cannot launch into polar orbit from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station or Kennedy Space

00:30:54.450 --> 00:30:58.710
Center without flying over Boston.

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:03.969
Actually, I guess you'd launch south flying
over Miami and Cuba which, for range safety,

00:31:03.969 --> 00:31:05.169
is not a great idea.

00:31:05.169 --> 00:31:10.109
If you launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base
out in California, you've got several thousands

00:31:10.109 --> 00:31:13.059
of miles of open ocean in front of you.

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:20.739
The Air Force was in a nice position here
because it could make up any requirements

00:31:20.739 --> 00:31:21.169
it wanted.

00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:25.919
We've actually talked about the cross-range.

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:26.950
OK, you've talked about it.

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.820
That's where the cross-range came from.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:35.440
And so you've talked about cross-range leading
to delta wings, leading to heavier orbiter

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:42.899
because of more thermal protection, but all
of that came from the requirement of getting

00:31:42.899 --> 00:31:48.519
the Department of Defense to say they would
use the shuttle as a way of justifying to

00:31:48.519 --> 00:31:52.139
the economists the large upfront investment.

00:31:52.139 --> 00:32:07.679
Have you looked at anything like this?

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:15.089
This is kind of from the outcome of the Phase
A studies in the last `60s and early `70s.

00:32:15.089 --> 00:32:20.099
As you see, Phase B proposals, a bunch of
studies.

00:32:20.099 --> 00:32:28.320
And then, in June of 1971, a rapid shift so
that in six months the configuration evolved

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:33.169
to what was finally built.

00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:37.389
And I presume if you've talked about cross-range
and that sort of thing you've talked about

00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:45.899
the difference between the preferred shuttle
of Johnson Space Center and its chief designer

00:32:45.899 --> 00:32:54.179
Max Faget, which was a straight wing minimal
cross-range shuttle, probably technically

00:32:54.179 --> 00:33:04.029
simpler to build and less expensive to build
into a delta wing configuration that matched

00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:09.700
the Air Force cross-range requirement.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:15.039
What happened in June of 1971 was critical
to this whole process.

00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:23.909
At this point, in its studies, NASA had concluded
to build a two-stage fully reusable shuttle

00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:31.330
that would match the cross-range requirement
and the big enough to launch space station

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:36.669
modules it would cost in the order of $10
billion to $14 billion in investment cost

00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:40.200
with a peaks funding of $2 billion a year
during the `70s.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:49.700
OMB, in May of 1971, said that's fine, but
you can only have $5 billion with a peak spending

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.539
of $1 billion a year.

00:33:51.539 --> 00:33:57.629
If you want a shuttle at all, it has to fit
within that budget curve.

00:33:57.629 --> 00:34:03.979
And I presume Aaron and others are going to
talk about the kind of hectic trades that

00:34:03.979 --> 00:34:12.379
got from a fully reusable shuttle to first
moving the liquid hydrogen tanks outside the

00:34:12.379 --> 00:34:15.750
orbiter air frame and throwing them away.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:21.469
Then coming up with the idea that you could
put both the external oxygen and hydrogen

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:26.909
fuel tanks on the outside and throw them away
to the notion that you could use strap-on

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:35.668
solids to assist in takeoff and move the orbiter
down to the bottom so its engines could be

00:34:35.668 --> 00:34:41.510
used as part of the take-off thrust to the
final configuration.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:51.440
At that point, June to December 1971, there
were not zillions but hundreds of different

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:58.460
variations of shuttle design being floated
around and other designs to do something that

00:34:58.460 --> 00:35:10.700
was approximating but not totally -- What's
the right word I want to say?

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:15.160
Totally meeting all of the payload requirements
that had been laid out.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:24.480
I'm sure you're going to be talking a lot
about the engineering choices that were involved

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:24.900
in this.

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.180
And I'm not capable of talking about them.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:35.039
But as apprentice young system engineers,
the notion that you could go from here, totally

00:35:35.039 --> 00:35:39.940
different concepts to here in six months and
know what you're doing should make you a little

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.450
nervous.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:48.049
Why was the shuttle ultimately approved?

00:35:48.049 --> 00:35:55.450
OMB, the Office of Management and Budget was
on one spectrum of the participants in this

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:56.470
debate.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:02.470
It really didn't believe, its staff, in the
value of human spaceflight.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:09.760
Its staff was, and is, the guardian of the
federal budget, believed it was under the

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:17.730
policy guidance of the Nixon administration
to cut federal expenditures dramatically across

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:18.799
the board.

00:36:18.799 --> 00:36:27.440
And so OMB, through this whole process, through
a variety of interventions and changing demands

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:36.240
on NASA and political interventions, getting
leaked information from the aerospace industry

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:47.289
and asking NASA nasty questions that it didn't
want to answer -- The career staff of OMB,

00:36:47.289 --> 00:36:51.160
they say, in retrospect, went too far in trying
to kill the shuttle.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:54.740
So they were at one end of the spectrum.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:37:04.079
NASA was at the other end, obviously, because
by now, 1971, the shuttle was a survival project

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:11.700
for NASA as it viewed itself as a large organization
built around human spaceflight and developing

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:14.000
new large scale systems.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.970
Yeah, Larry?

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:15.940
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:25.309
OMB, not Congress, is
what I'm talking about.

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.700
Well, ask your question.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:33.269
Well, the fact that non-elected AUDIENCE:
staffers, I was thinking of congressional

00:37:33.269 --> 00:37:33.299
staffers?.

00:37:33.299 --> 00:37:33.539
LOGSDON: Yeah, but OMB is the same thing.

00:37:33.539 --> 00:37:34.109
AUDIENCE: Have enormous influence over not
only implementing but making policy.

00:37:34.109 --> 00:37:38.609
And they stay long after their term [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:37:38.609 --> 00:37:46.839
LONGSDON: Any of you heard of Paul Shawcross?

00:37:46.839 --> 00:37:48.940
I wouldn't think so.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:51.400
Paul is an MIT graduate.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:56.319
He's the Examiner for Human Spaceflight in
OMB right now.

00:37:56.319 --> 00:38:01.710
He did a TPP masters up here ten years ago
or so.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.910
And he is leading the fight to ground the
shuttle.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:12.170
Now, nobody knows his name unless you're inside
the beltway.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:20.690
One of the things I'll say, Larry, in reaction
to where you were going is at least the career

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.150
staff on the Hill are relatively accessible.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:32.549
So, if you're an aerospace industry operative,
you know who they are and you can talk to

00:38:32.549 --> 00:38:33.510
them.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:38.430
Particularly back in this period 35 years
ago, the OMB staff operated under a cloak

00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:43.140
of anonymity, weren't open to talking to industry
people.

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:45.170
It's changed a lot over the years.

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:53.849
And were able to operate behind a wall of
secrecy and push their agenda into national

00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:55.099
policy.

00:38:55.099 --> 00:39:01.700
It is my belief, after starting my 40th year
in Washington.

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:08.880
God, that's a long time.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.589
Most people outside of Washington think that
Congress matters, but almost all the decisions

00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:20.240
that matter are made in the Executive Branch
and Congress just snips at the margins, 2%

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.359
or 3%.

00:39:21.359 --> 00:39:22.490
Yes, sir.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:28.680
How much did industry lobbying affect the
design of the shuttle?

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:35.089
I mean you look at it and every aerospace
company had a piece of the shuttle, you know,

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:36.609
they were getting money from it.

00:39:36.609 --> 00:39:41.730
I assume they also were probably lobbying
their senators for places like [OVERLAPPING

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:42.480
VOICES].

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:48.460
I mean how much did industry [OVERLAPPING
VOICES]?

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:56.910
Well, if you look at this, all of industry
had study contracts.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:03.190
This is Grumman, which was a separate company
at the time that had built the Lunar Lander.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:09.460
And Boeing, before it bought Rockwell, this
was North American Rockwell that had built

00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:11.970
the Apollo Command Module.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:15.660
This was McDonnell Douglas.

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:19.539
So, the major aerospace companies each had
a concept.

00:40:19.539 --> 00:40:28.420
And they were lobbying or contending for the
adoption of their concept rather than what

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.180
you see now which is work shares of a single
concept.

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:38.490
But this was a decision totally inside the
Executive Branch at this point.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:45.470
Congress was more or less supportive with
the exception of one senator, Fritz Mondale,

00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.309
Walter Mondale who kept asking some difficult
questions.

00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:53.170
And NASA had its preferred concept.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:41:00.900
MSC is Manned Space Craft Center, what's now
Johnson Space Center.

00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:08.910
And it was Grumman and McDonnell Douglas that
came up with the idea of putting rockets on

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:19.420
the side, at that point they weren't necessarily
solid rockets, to enable a cheaper configuration.

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:26.319
What you ended up with was the preferred orbiter
of the Manned Space Craft Center and the NASA

00:41:26.319 --> 00:41:30.460
Orbiter after all these design requirements.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:41.480
With the Grumman McDonnell Douglas concept
of an expendable external tank and recoverable

00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.200
strap-ons.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.710
I don't want to say solids.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:52.109
What came out of this was an amalgamation
of everybody's ideas.

00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:59.450
And I said in passing, I will say again, one
of these industry firms, and all evidence

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:06.940
points to North American, had a relationship
with the OMB that was feeding OMB questions

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.730
that would embarrass their competitors.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:17.440
Or, result in not doing the shuttle at all
and continuing on with the existing systems

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:25.750
where North American was building at least
the Apollo Command Module.

00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:30.529
Players in this included the economic analysis.

00:42:30.529 --> 00:42:40.119
Here is a report that was given, as this debate
heated up, to NASA in October of 1971 done

00:42:40.119 --> 00:42:51.119
by a company called Mathematica, which was
founded by Oscar Morgenstern, an economist

00:42:51.119 --> 00:42:56.740
at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton.

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:03.529
And his young colleague, Klaus Heiss, was
and is an Austrian somewhat crazy economist.

00:43:03.529 --> 00:43:10.369
Again, that may be the same thing, crazy and
economist.

00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:17.220
And they had the contract to do the external
economic analysis for the shuttle.

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:28.990
And they came up, through their analysis,
with the conclusion that a reusable system

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:32.299
is economically feasible at the current level
of activity.

00:43:32.299 --> 00:43:41.960
And that a thrust-assisted, that's the strap-ons,
shuttle is the economically preferred choice.

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:51.910
This is economists designing technical systems,
another thing that would make me nervous.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:57.049
And this goes back to your comment earlier,
the demand for space transportation by NASA,

00:43:57.049 --> 00:44:01.890
the Department of Defense, but particularly
by commercial and other users is the basis

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:06.039
for economic justification.

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:15.220
The economic analysis had, as an input, a
demand model that was totally unconstrained.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:21.890
It's everybody's wish list of things that
might be launched but weren't funded for the

00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:24.490
next 15 years.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:32.819
And that's where the next round of shuttle
launches, 50 or 60, which was part of the

00:44:32.819 --> 00:44:38.319
image at the time the decision was made, came
from this demand model which was done by the

00:44:38.319 --> 00:44:46.619
Aerospace Corporation given to Mathematica
to play with in its economic analysis.

00:44:46.619 --> 00:44:54.430
It's not clear how influential this set of
recommendations was in the final decision

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:56.339
to proceed.

00:44:56.339 --> 00:45:01.759
Klaus Heiss, who is still very active, claims
it was very influential.

00:45:01.759 --> 00:45:07.069
I tend to think, well, you'll see my explanation
why the shuttle was chosen.

00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:18.880
These are the kind of economic comparisons
that were talked about.

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:28.259
The launch vehicle investment costs, nonrecurrent,
were clearly much greater for the new shuttle

00:45:28.259 --> 00:45:37.289
system, but the recurring costs of operations
were much less than using the current system.

00:45:37.289 --> 00:45:37.779
What is that?

00:45:37.779 --> 00:45:41.680
Almost $6 billion.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:48.539
This is 514 space shuttle flights over a twelve
year or eleven year period.

00:45:48.539 --> 00:45:51.009
Eleven, I guess.

00:45:51.009 --> 00:46:00.390
That is, what, about 48 or 49 flights a year,
the model that was being used at this time.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:06.099
It always interests me when people do modeling
like that.

00:46:06.099 --> 00:46:11.480
You notice they chose the number 514, not
513 or 515.

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.440
I mean it sort of gives you the impression
that they know what they're talking about.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:16.809
[AUDIENCE QUESTION]

00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:23.750
If they had just put approximately 500, that's
really as much as anybody knew at the time.

00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:28.670
But that's the number that will make it work,
I suppose.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.670
[LAUGHTER]
Now, that would be rigging the analysis, wouldn't
it?

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:35.319
Look at how round the numbers are at the bottom,
too.

00:46:35.319 --> 00:46:44.630
Well, one of the things to watch here is that
a lot of the costs were payload savings.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:51.329
There was this illusion at the time, proven
to be an illusion, that because of the characteristics

00:46:51.329 --> 00:46:57.339
of the shuttle you could make the payloads
much less expensive.

00:46:57.339 --> 00:47:02.839
You didn't have to design them to space program
standards if you want.

00:47:02.839 --> 00:47:04.329
Here are the payloads.

00:47:04.329 --> 00:47:11.990
Instead of costing $18 billion over this period,
we're going to cost $12 billion.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:17.750
That's a $6 billion savings in payload.

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:26.279
And it's that combination of operation cost
and payload savings that give you the $7 billion

00:47:26.279 --> 00:47:32.849
advantage in the economic argument for going
ahead with the shuttle.

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:37.980
Bush 41 later used the term, which I think
is properly applied to this analysis, calling

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.690
it voodoo economics.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:49.089
And I think most of the people involved in
this decision recognize that.

00:47:49.089 --> 00:47:58.740
In a technical decision, the White House often,
at this period in time, depended on its Office

00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:05.440
of Science and Technology, now called OSTP,
Office of Science and Technology Policy, and

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:10.200
its President Science Advisory Committee called
PSAC.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:15.630
What does PSAC mean?

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:19.769
President Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology.

00:48:19.769 --> 00:48:27.630
And so the science advisor who was actually
an engineer, not a scientist, named Ed David,

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:39.420
commissioned a PSAC, President Science Advisory
Committee study to look at NASA's proposals

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:43.039
as a basis for the position he would take
in White House debates.

00:48:43.039 --> 00:48:58.230
Head chair of that study was Alexander Flax
who was President of the Institute for Defense

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.789
Analyses, a think-tank in Washington.

00:49:01.789 --> 00:49:08.490
And this was a kind of summary report that
Flax sent in about the panel.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.329
Doubt that a viable shuttle program can be
undertaken without a degree of national commitment

00:49:13.329 --> 00:49:18.289
over the long-term analogous to that which
sustained the Apollo program.

00:49:18.289 --> 00:49:22.930
It may be attainable but is certainly not
apparent at this time.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:27.170
This is a long letter, and I'm just going
to show you a couple of things.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:36.099
In retrospect, I think this advice was sound
advice that was provided.

00:49:36.099 --> 00:49:41.839
Maintaining the program is large and risky
with the long-term prospect of fixed budget

00:49:41.839 --> 00:49:49.029
ceilings does not bode well for the future
of the program.

00:49:49.029 --> 00:49:53.869
Some decisions had been taken which introduce
additional hazards to the success of the program

00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:59.339
technically, operationally and economically
in order to reduce projected peak-year funding

00:49:59.339 --> 00:50:04.990
requirements.

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:12.119
At that point, I think the strap-ons, firing
the main engines at liftoff.

00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:21.289
I can show you the analysis in the letter,
but I think that's what he was talking about.

00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:29.859
And basically what the PSAC panel recommended
was postponing the decision for a year or

00:50:29.859 --> 00:50:33.769
more while some of the uncertainties were
studied.

00:50:33.769 --> 00:50:35.849
General view.

00:50:35.849 --> 00:50:42.950
No significant role for manned spaceflight
in military and civilian or science.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:48.039
Didn't believe NASA's suggestion that the
shuttle would allow experimenters to conduct

00:50:48.039 --> 00:50:50.579
their activities in spaceflight.

00:50:50.579 --> 00:50:53.089
Evoke no enthusiasm from the scientists.

00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:54.880
You can counter that obviously.

00:50:54.880 --> 00:51:00.220
The shuttle was not a wonderful laboratory
for most applications.

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:18.740
The scientific community in large doubts the
potential benefits of the space shuttle.

00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:25.049
Manned spaceflight should be considered contributions
in terms of national prestige, international

00:51:25.049 --> 00:51:32.079
cooperation, exploration and unforeseen future
needs.

00:51:32.079 --> 00:51:38.319
Basically, the justification was really kind
of arm-waving intangibles, some of which I

00:51:38.319 --> 00:51:41.490
think are very real like prestige and cooperation.

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:59.880
[Jump back a little bit to the?]

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:11.259
science enthusiasm or lack of it, because
I think there was a clear division in the

00:52:11.259 --> 00:52:18.499
science community then between the "real space
scientist" and [OVERLAPPING VOICES]

00:52:18.499 --> 00:52:18.499
which sort of came into its own with Skylab
when it was realized [OVERLAPPING VOICES].
But Skylab was two years after this, Larry.
But at this point the life science community
was better that interesting things were going

00:52:20.049 --> 00:52:20.220
to be happening.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.890
But without any real data Skylab was the first
long duration exposure.

00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:26.150
And the life science community did not have
the high step in the space science community

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.710
at that point.

00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:28.890
Space science was dominated by physicists.

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:41.089
And, in fact, even within the NASA hierarchy.

00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:44.529
I think at that point it was still part of
space medicine.

00:52:44.529 --> 00:52:45.569
Right, crew medicine.

00:52:45.569 --> 00:52:46.720
So, yes, that split was there.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:51.499
It must be noted that new approaches have
often not been recognized or appreciated by

00:52:51.499 --> 00:52:56.579
the putative users until after they've been
demonstrated.

00:52:56.579 --> 00:52:56.940
Yeah, Mark.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:03.529
Didn't Hubble then conveniently make scientists
excited about the shuttle?

00:53:03.529 --> 00:53:04.779
Some.

00:53:04.779 --> 00:53:08.849
But, again, only after.

00:53:08.849 --> 00:53:12.579
We don't want to talk about why.

00:53:12.579 --> 00:53:19.130
We'll let Hoffman talk about whether the tradeoff
of putting Hubble in the shuttle orbit compared

00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:25.400
to it being serviced was a good tradeoff compared
to where you want a telescope.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:29.779
If you would have been designing this large
space telescope in 1970, would you have made

00:53:29.779 --> 00:53:30.499
it shuttle launched?

00:53:30.499 --> 00:53:33.650
Well, everything had to be shuttle launched
then.

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:41.730
I mean given the history of Hubble, obviously,
had it been put in an inaccessible orbit,

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:44.329
we wouldn't have a space telescope now.

00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:50.059
So what can you say?

00:53:50.059 --> 00:53:54.380
Again, the shuttle cannot be justified on
a purely economic basis for the unmanned portion

00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:59.190
of the program so it's a position directly
opposite the thing I showed you before.

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:05.299
It must be justified on the basis of new capability,
contribution to leadership and prestige, its

00:54:05.299 --> 00:54:10.220
unique value if we're going to have intensity
of infrequent manned spaceflight.

00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:19.210
And you have to postulate expanding rather
than level space budgets over the next ten

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:19.599
years.

00:54:19.599 --> 00:54:24.269
And the Nixon administration said that wasn't
going to happen.

00:54:24.269 --> 00:54:42.930
Again, the somewhat bottom line of the PSAC
position -- -- led to the conclusion that

00:54:42.930 --> 00:54:46.619
if you had to make a choice in 1971, you had
two choices.

00:54:46.619 --> 00:54:53.980
Either proceed with the shuttle program now
or soon or drop manned spaceflight after Skylab.

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:57.779
And nobody likes binomial choices like that.

00:54:57.779 --> 00:55:06.880
But, in the large degree, that was the consideration
or the mental set as this debate came to a

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:09.880
head towards the end of 1971.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:14.289
Actually, that brings into sharp relief.

00:55:14.289 --> 00:55:18.989
Remember the comment that Professor Cohen
made when he was talking about what should

00:55:18.989 --> 00:55:24.880
a systems engineer do when presented with
requirements that you're not really happy

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.880
with and don't know if you can meet?

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.700
But, on the other hand, recognizing as they
came to that basically if they didn't build

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.799
the shuttle that was being specified they
probably were going to end up with nothing

00:55:39.799 --> 00:55:40.279
at all.

00:55:40.279 --> 00:55:48.170
And I think what John just showed was justification
that that, in fact, was the political environment

00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.749
at the time.

00:55:48.749 --> 00:55:52.769
It wasn't the shuttle or something else.

00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:54.509
It was the shuttle or nothing.

00:55:54.509 --> 00:56:01.339
Well, except at the end people like PSAC and
OMB kept suggesting alternatives.

00:56:01.339 --> 00:56:08.579
This was a chart drawn in November of '71
by George Low who was the Deputy NASA Administrator

00:56:08.579 --> 00:56:16.319
and kind of the technical strength in this
thing, showing the investment costs versus,

00:56:16.319 --> 00:56:22.359
this is in billions, this is in millions,
the cost of operations for various things.

00:56:22.359 --> 00:56:27.960
The two-stage fully reusable, $10 billion
investment, low operating cost.

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:34.299
The baseline 15 x 60 foot payload bay could
be done, he's saying, for $8 billion.

00:56:34.299 --> 00:56:37.309
Within three weeks it was $5 billion.

00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:46.789
A phase development, develop a simpler one
first and then a more complex orbiter later

00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:59.039
with the large payload bay and various rocket
assists developing a smaller one, smaller

00:56:59.039 --> 00:57:07.480
payload, smaller bay, or developing a Titan
3 launched glider sort of thing.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:12.950
And the argument was in this curve it made
sense to pick something along this line, the

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:20.210
knee and the curve on that basis.

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:31.640
NASA made its last best case in a memo to
the White House.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:33.739
This is dated November the 22nd.

00:57:33.739 --> 00:57:38.619
I think it shows up at the top.

00:57:38.619 --> 00:57:40.430
And look at these reasonings.

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:43.190
This is really NASA's best case.

00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:52.910
Number one, the US has to stay in the human
spaceflight business.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:55.940
That's not subject to analysis.

00:57:55.940 --> 00:57:57.749
That's a belief.

00:57:57.749 --> 00:58:09.499
And NASA argued that this should be a policy
premise that the United States had to have

00:58:09.499 --> 00:58:10.440
humans in space.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:16.589
And the shuttle is the only meaningful new
manned space program, the operative word being

00:58:16.589 --> 00:58:17.680
"new".

00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:23.759
You could have kept launching Apollo capsules
and Saturn 1bs or something.

00:58:23.759 --> 00:58:25.980
Saturn 5 had been cancelled by then.

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:34.999
The shuttle is a necessary next step for science
applications, military position in international

00:58:34.999 --> 00:58:37.489
competition and cooperation.

00:58:37.489 --> 00:58:41.809
The cost and complexity is one-half of what
it was six months ago.

00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:46.579
Again, as engineers, that statement ought
to be very nervous that in six months you

00:58:46.579 --> 00:58:51.519
can cut cost and complexity in half.

00:58:51.519 --> 00:58:57.529
And starting the shuttle now will have a significant
positive effect in aerospace employment.

00:58:57.529 --> 00:59:03.230
Not starting will be a serious blow to both
the morale and health of the aerospace industry.

00:59:03.230 --> 00:59:07.029
Let me talk about that last one.

00:59:07.029 --> 00:59:12.759
Those, I think, were NASA's five best reasons
for going ahead.

00:59:12.759 --> 00:59:15.829
Employment impact was one of them.

00:59:15.829 --> 00:59:22.619
This is an undated memorandum from somebody
within OMB.

00:59:22.619 --> 00:59:30.089
Peter Flanagan was Nixon's top person right
at the intersection of policy and politics

00:59:30.089 --> 00:59:34.319
who was overseeing the space program.

00:59:34.319 --> 00:59:40.749
And Flanagan had asked for impact of the shuttle
on the aerospace industry.

00:59:40.749 --> 00:59:45.650
And this is what came back.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:54.499
What the program is.

00:59:54.499 --> 01:00:03.140
Here is the additional employment impact on
the engine program space shuttle.

01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.779
Main engine.

01:00:04.779 --> 01:00:06.829
Not very much in early '70.

01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:08.749
This is '71.

01:00:08.749 --> 01:00:18.440
But in '72 fairly significant employment impacts
in either California or Florida.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:29.589
And on the airframe,

01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:39.190
depending on when the decision was made to
go ahead with the shuttle, the impact in '72

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:42.470
not very big, but big enough.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:46.539
Peak of 70,000 jobs might ultimately result.

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:52.460
The number of actual jobs by the end of 1972
would be relatively small.

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:56.519
Why do you think 1972?

01:00:56.519 --> 01:01:02.920
You have to recreate the environment of the
time.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.960
This was 1971.

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.049
The supersonic transport had been cancelled.

01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:13.630
Defense spending on Vietnam was ramping down.

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.460
NASA had no new program.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:23.730
And, in doing the article that Jeff mentioned
on the space shuttle decision, I ended up

01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:28.950
one afternoon in, of all places, Santa Fe,
New Mexico talking to John Ehrlich, one of

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:29.819
Nixon's top guys.

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:39.660
He said they sat down in the White House and
mapped NASA jobs on key election states and

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:47.480
said if we want to win the 1972 election,
again this is political history well before

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:47.859
your time.

01:01:47.859 --> 01:01:53.019
At that point, the leading candidate was Ed
Muskie of Maine who was viewed as a serious

01:01:53.019 --> 01:01:54.900
candidate.

01:01:54.900 --> 01:02:00.999
It wasn't George McGovern who was, for better
or for worse, not a serious opponent.

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:08.019
So that the political people were worried
about winning places like California and Florida

01:02:08.019 --> 01:02:17.299
and saw in the Shuttle Program a way of providing
the indication of future jobs in key electoral

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:18.700
states.

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:23.579
Some of the people I have talked to over the
years say that, at least for the top political

01:02:23.579 --> 01:02:28.809
levels of the White House, that was the major
reason for going ahead with this program.

01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:33.960
Was in order to have aerospace employment
impacts for the '72 election.

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:40.069
You can judge whether that's a good reason
or not.

01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:44.309
The decision kept getting postponed until
very late in the budget process.

01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:48.999
OMB kept asking for more studies.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:56.210
This was a letter to the Deputy Director of
OMB, Caspar Weinberger, later Secretary of

01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:03.329
Defense, which NASA said we've concluded the
full capability still represents a best buy.

01:03:03.329 --> 01:03:10.960
But, in recognition of budget problems, we
are recommending a smaller vehicle, 14 x 45,

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:17.309
because that is the smallest that will still
be useful for manned spaceflight, Reid Space

01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:19.049
Station.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:28.089
It won't accommodate many DOD payloads and
some planetary payloads.

01:03:28.089 --> 01:03:29.538
And here are the numbers.

01:03:29.538 --> 01:03:32.380
I don't know whether you've seen these numbers
yet.

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:39.710
Attached to this letter, this is what NASA
was telling the White House last business

01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:48.769
day of 1971 what the cost of various shuttle
configurations would be.

01:03:48.769 --> 01:03:56.299
You notice very little difference in the development
cost of the configurations, eight-tenths of

01:03:56.299 --> 01:04:05.819
a billion dollars between a very small and
less capable and the full size fully capable.

01:04:05.819 --> 01:04:13.680
And the operating cost relatively low across
the board.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:25.690
Look at that number, $7.7 million a flight
for a payload cost of $118 a pound.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:31.299
I think one of the points of your course,
if I understand it, is to understand maybe

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:36.749
where these numbers came from and where they
ever possible?

01:04:36.749 --> 01:04:37.710
I shouldn't bias the answer.

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.900
Were they ever a possible realization?

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:47.180
I mean here are the heads of the leading technical
organization in the US government presenting

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:49.609
these figures to the White House.

01:04:49.609 --> 01:04:56.519
Did NASA lose its technical integrity in this
process, was there any foundation for these

01:04:56.519 --> 01:05:04.839
numbers or where these total salesmanship,
are all, I think, valid questions.

01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:08.640
You said you took a two-minute stretch break.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.339
Yeah.

01:05:10.339 --> 01:05:16.150
Let's do that, and then I'll come back with
the answer of why they ultimately went ahead

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.720
with the shuttle.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:51.650
I'm going to argue that the decision to go
ahead with the shuttle was made before all

01:05:51.650 --> 01:06:04.220
of this last six months or so of 1971 back
and forth when it occurred.

01:06:04.220 --> 01:06:14.430
And the basis for that is primarily this memorandum
written through the Director of the OMB, George

01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:24.288
Shultz, by Cap Weinberger to the President
in which he is talking about the staff proposals

01:06:24.288 --> 01:06:31.450
for reducing the NASA budget, which included
eliminating the last two Apollo flights and

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:33.670
eliminating Manned Spaceflight.

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:39.509
And Weinberger said in this memo to the President,
I believe this would be a mistake.

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:45.839
The reason for reducing NASA is because we
cut it because it's cutable, not because it's

01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:48.329
not doing a thing.

01:06:48.329 --> 01:06:54.920
That the uncontrollable programs that offer
no real hope for the future, this is remember

01:06:54.920 --> 01:07:01.339
a republican administration, are eating up
the budget.

01:07:01.339 --> 01:07:11.450
We do need to reduce the budget but we need
to do it on a reasonable basis.

01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:16.529
There is real merit in the future of NASA.

01:07:16.529 --> 01:07:24.220
And, if you took NASA apart, it would be very
hard to put it back together again.

01:07:24.220 --> 01:07:32.869
And he says stopping Apollo and not starting
new programs would be confirming a belief,

01:07:32.869 --> 01:07:35.700
I fear, is gaining credence at home and abroad.

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:37.799
Our best years are behind us.

01:07:37.799 --> 01:07:42.979
We are turning inward, reducing our defense
commitments, involuntarily starting to give

01:07:42.979 --> 01:07:47.910
up our superpower status and our desire to
maintain our world's superiority.

01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:49.660
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:55.089
America should be able to afford something
besides increased welfare.

01:07:55.089 --> 01:07:55.979
Notice the underlining.

01:07:55.979 --> 01:08:04.079
And this came back with a handwritten note,
I agree with Cap.

01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:07.059
That's Nixon.

01:08:07.059 --> 01:08:12.829
My view, the decision was made with those
four words.

01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:13.089
Yeah?

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.210
Just out of ignorance, who is Weinberger?

01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:21.299
Weinberger at that time was the number two
person in the office of Management and Budget,

01:08:21.299 --> 01:08:29.549
long-time California associate of Nixon, became
Secretary of Defense under Reagan.

01:08:29.549 --> 01:08:37.068
Who he is, in a sense, irrelevant, except
he was a political appointee and a trusted

01:08:37.068 --> 01:08:41.059
associate of the President.

01:08:41.059 --> 01:08:49.630
And basically he was telling Nixon that the
reason for continuing the space program was

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:51.540
image.

01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:54.920
I mean, again, read those words because they're
interesting words.

01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:02.198
Not having the strongest space program would
confirm our lack of desire to maintain our

01:09:02.198 --> 01:09:08.599
world's superiority.

01:09:08.599 --> 01:09:15.639
I should you this December the 29th memorandum
where NASA went to the White House and said

01:09:15.639 --> 01:09:21.830
we would recommend the full-size orbiter usually
but, with tight budget, will go with 14 x

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:22.359
45.

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:28.549
That was a Friday, the 29th of December, or
maybe earlier in the week.

01:09:28.549 --> 01:09:36.690
Anyway, over that New Year's weekend, '71,
'72, somehow somewhere Nixon and his inner

01:09:36.690 --> 01:09:41.460
circle decided to approve the shuttle and
approve the full-size shuttle.

01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.599
And they decided if we're going to approve
it, we might as well approve the one that

01:09:44.599 --> 01:09:47.690
NASA thinks is best.

01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:55.920
And there was a meeting scheduled between
NASA leadership and the President in the San

01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:02.760
Clemente on January the 5th.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.409
This is written by George Low.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.820
For a historian, Dr.

01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:08.340
Low was wonderful.

01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:14.460
He dictated his notes every week on the events
of the week and then backed it up with the

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.940
documents.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:21.750
That's like a treasure load for somebody that's
trying to write the history of this.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.520
Met for 40 minutes.

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:26.889
Here's what the President had to say.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:30.580
We should not hesitate to mention the military
applications.

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:31.650
Routine operations.

01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:36.159
Quick reaction times.

01:10:36.159 --> 01:10:38.210
Solar power satellites.

01:10:38.210 --> 01:10:41.800
These kinds of things tend to happen more
quickly than we expect.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.320
Nuclear waste disposal.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:50.090
He liked the fact that ordinary people would
be able to fly in the shuttle.

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:53.730
Preserve the skills of the people in the aerospace
industry.

01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:57.820
In summary, we do not know of the things the
shuttle will be able to do.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.820
It will open up entirely new fields.

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:05.449
Did we think it was a good investment?

01:11:05.449 --> 01:11:08.030
We, the top two leaders of NASA.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:10.650
It's not a $7 billion toy.

01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:15.449
But he indicated even if it were not a good
investment, we would have to do it anyway

01:11:15.449 --> 01:11:17.530
because spaceflight is here to stay.

01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:24.010
Men are flying in space now and will continue
to fly in space, and we best be part of it,

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:28.590
which was essentially what Weinberger had
said six months earlier.

01:11:28.590 --> 01:11:36.650
And, to me, that link in doing research in
this area, I've talked with both Weinberger

01:11:36.650 --> 01:11:38.800
and Ehrlichman and others around that.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:48.070
It's that link of human spaceflight to national
image of the United States, plus the employment

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:53.070
impacts in the '72 election that were the
fundamental reasons for going ahead with the

01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:55.719
shuttle.

01:11:55.719 --> 01:12:01.949
You may make a judgment that those aren't
great reasons, but there they were.

01:12:01.949 --> 01:12:10.719
Finally, the decision was made, say, January
3rd, we would develop a shuttle with the big

01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:11.900
shuttle.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.980
And the only major open issue was whether
to use a liquid or solid strap-on.

01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:30.139
And that was studied for three months.

01:12:30.139 --> 01:12:33.230
Trade-off between future benefits and earlier
savings.

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:46.639
Liquid boosters have lower operating cost,
solid boosters have lower development cost.

01:12:46.639 --> 01:12:51.659
Conclusions here are heavily dependent on
the mission model.

01:12:51.659 --> 01:13:00.080
The basic concern was keeping within the development
cost of the shuttle and somebody else worry

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:07.420
later about operating costs.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:20.330
All of that argument led to a decision in
favor of the solid booster.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:27.489
The rest of this is kind of irrelevant to
that.

01:13:27.489 --> 01:13:33.869
Basically with the OMB acceptance of this
letter and the choice of the solids, the configuration

01:13:33.869 --> 01:13:34.739
was frozen.

01:13:34.739 --> 01:13:39.510
There were some things in it that I'm sure
you'll talk about later.

01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:43.360
There was at that point it had abort capability
on the solids.

01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:47.330
I'm not quite sure how that would have worked.

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:53.300
And somewhere along the line, and it's not
clear to me, at one point the shuttle was

01:13:53.300 --> 01:14:00.320
going to have jet engines so it could fly
to a landing rather than glide to a landing.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.790
And those were taken out.

01:14:01.790 --> 01:14:14.880
And I think it was after this, but I'm not
sure.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:26.800
As I said at the start, the technical requirements
of the shuttle, I want to say it a little

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.550
differently.

01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:34.489
The reason for approving the shuttle had very
little to do with the specific technical characteristics

01:14:34.489 --> 01:14:38.000
of the system.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:43.580
If my argument that the main reasons were
national prestige, national image, aerospace

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:50.179
employment rather than the actual performance
characteristics of a particular configuration.

01:14:50.179 --> 01:15:02.750
As long as the shuttle could be developed
within a $5 billion a year peak funding profile

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:08.420
and as long as the shuttle could do things
for the Department of Defense that made it

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.869
useful to both civilian and military users.

01:15:11.869 --> 01:15:17.020
Those were the drivers of the shuttle decision.

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:22.639
And the technology was derivative of that
rather than the other way around.

01:15:22.639 --> 01:15:29.520
That presented challenges, as I'm sure Aaron
Cohen or Jeff have talked about, of developing

01:15:29.520 --> 01:15:35.639
thermal protection, developing a main engine,
developing a vehicle that could operate in

01:15:35.639 --> 01:15:37.320
multiple flight regimes.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:44.080
But those were secondary to the policy decision
that the country should go ahead with this

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:44.619
capability.

01:15:44.619 --> 01:15:49.530
Questions?

01:15:49.530 --> 01:15:50.380
Comments?

01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.010
Reactions?

01:15:51.010 --> 01:15:51.540
Yes, sir.

01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:52.300
One quick question.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:58.139
I saw, in one of those earlier things you
put out, that it was around '71, it talked

01:15:58.139 --> 01:16:00.750
about first flight was '77 and fully operational
by '79.

01:16:00.750 --> 01:16:08.159
It seems to me that you could really reduce
things like heat cost and you could spread

01:16:08.159 --> 01:16:11.690
out your development cost if you just said
we're not in a hurry, let's do it right but

01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:12.559
let's take our time.

01:16:12.559 --> 01:16:12.750
Because there wasn't the race anymore.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:12.989
I mean we had done the Apollo.

01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:13.159
We had beaten the Russians.

01:16:13.159 --> 01:16:23.239
And I was wondering what kind of time constraints
played into this, why they were trying to

01:16:23.239 --> 01:16:30.860
finish it by the late `70s and why not say
let's launch it mid `80s?

01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:39.280
Well, it ties into the current situation rather
nicely in the sense that there was then, and

01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:47.830
I think is now, a perception that an extended
gap in US human spaceflight is not politically

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:49.260
acceptable.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:57.219
And, at that point, at the end of '71, the
only human spaceflight missions on the books

01:16:57.219 --> 01:17:02.000
were three flights to the Skylab Space Station
in 1973.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:09.309
The thing that followed that, the Apollo-Soyuz
Test Project, had not yet been agreed on.

01:17:09.309 --> 01:17:12.800
That wasn't agreed until May of '72.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:19.670
There would have been from '73 to whatever
future date a gap in American's flying to

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:20.070
space.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:24.610
And I think the general sense was that that
was not acceptable.

01:17:24.610 --> 01:17:36.360
Also, you had a workforce issue of maintaining
the workforce with something to do at Johnson,

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:43.290
by then not yet Johnson, but Manned Spacecraft
Center, Marshall Spaceflight Center and Kennedy.

01:17:43.290 --> 01:17:50.520
And so you needed a relatively rapid development
program so that you didn't either disassemble

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:52.530
the teams and have to reassemble them later.

01:17:52.530 --> 01:17:58.969
And the same for the capability inside the
industry.

01:17:58.969 --> 01:18:07.469
This was a program that was paste within a
budget ceiling to make full use of the space

01:18:07.469 --> 01:18:12.210
industrial base in a reasonable timeframe.

01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:19.750
And I think that's why I would say, I mean
the dates were set on the basis, this is the

01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:22.949
earliest we can do it on this budget profile.

01:18:22.949 --> 01:18:23.420
Yes, sir.

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.989
You said the decision to go for solids instead
of liquids for the boosters was the development

01:18:28.989 --> 01:18:31.639
costs as opposed to the operating costs.

01:18:31.639 --> 01:18:44.400
And now, in this new architecture, the plan
is to use the solid rocket booster.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:55.929
It's something like it's proven to be the
most reliable launcher ever developed or something

01:18:55.929 --> 01:18:56.040
along those lines.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:56.110
It's true.

01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.909
You've launched 228 of them with one failure.

01:18:56.909 --> 01:18:58.360
I agree.

01:18:58.360 --> 01:19:08.199
But, at the same time, if the idea then, if
they went for solid they could sort of reduce

01:19:08.199 --> 01:19:11.820
development costs and sacrificing operating
costs.

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:19.210
Is sticking with solids in the same configuration
now kind of repeating the same possible mistake?

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:20.960
Well, I don't know.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:27.360
First you seem to assume that going with solids
in the first place was a mistake.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.840
That a liquid strap-on solution would have
been a better solution.

01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:34.280
I'm not necessarily assuming that.

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:35.760
Many have argued that.

01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:40.860
It's not really clear that the operating cost
of a liquid booster would have been less.

01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:46.130
One of the big concerns was you have a liquid
booster, you've got a real rocket engine on

01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:48.320
it, and what happens when that lands in the
ocean?

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:55.070
I mean there were real concerns about could
you clean up and reuse a rocket engine once

01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:56.809
it's been exposed to salt water?

01:19:56.809 --> 01:20:01.300
And we don't know the answer to that.

01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:06.699
Maybe it's the time to segue, if we want to
do this, to a quick look at the new architecture

01:20:06.699 --> 01:20:14.730
as it was presented yesterday, which is being
driven heavily, the choices are being driven

01:20:14.730 --> 01:20:15.969
by budget ceilings again.

01:20:15.969 --> 01:20:38.219
An interesting question, Mark, is whether
you would be making the same choices now if

01:20:38.219 --> 01:20:52.550
you weren't constrained by budget, once again.

01:20:52.550 --> 01:21:29.900
I didn't mean to assume that the liquid would
be better than solid.

01:21:29.900 --> 01:22:05.050
Just the observation of the basis the decision
was made on.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:14.110
What this is, or at a certain level what it
isn't, is the briefing that is on the NASA

01:22:14.110 --> 01:23:18.699
website which is a 10-page briefing.

01:23:18.699 --> 01:23:28.429
This is
the 23-page briefing.

01:23:28.429 --> 01:23:33.659
There is a clear set of top level requirements
in this new vision.

01:23:33.659 --> 01:23:40.840
And, if you're space types at all, you should
know this.

01:23:40.840 --> 01:23:53.630
An interesting attempt to develop rationale
for exploration which, as you see, is mainly

01:23:53.630 --> 01:23:55.239
intangible.

01:23:55.239 --> 01:24:08.530
Curiosity and leadership, they are very much
the same things that started the shuttle program.

01:24:08.530 --> 01:24:15.090
This is about the only mention of mars in
the whole presentation, even though the President's

01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:22.550
vision says moon as a way of getting to mars.

01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:30.239
But here is why moon.

01:24:30.239 --> 01:24:33.460
And you're developing technologies that you're
going to use downstream.

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:43.099
And, in particular, this Saturn 5 class.

01:24:43.099 --> 01:24:50.510
The Apollo 17 Saturn 5 launcher took 117 metric
tons to low earth orbit.

01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:54.630
This vehicle that's being planned is slightly
larger than Saturn 5.

01:24:54.630 --> 01:25:04.210
One of the few areas of technological innovation
in this system is a new engine which uses

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:09.360
liquid methane rather than liquid hydrogen
as a fuel.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:09.520
Why?

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:15.670
Maybe I'll ask the class, why would you be
interested in liquid methane?

01:25:15.670 --> 01:25:16.969
Yeah.

01:25:16.969 --> 01:25:19.270
You could manufacture it on mars.

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:20.130
Yeah, precisely.

01:25:20.130 --> 01:25:26.440
It's also a lot easier to store over the long-term,
liquid hydrogen.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:32.619
But the main reason is it is a potential resource
that you could get in situ on mars and so

01:25:32.619 --> 01:25:35.809
you wouldn't have to carry it all the way
out there.

01:25:35.809 --> 01:25:39.670
And you could get oxygen on mars because there
is clearly water.

01:25:39.670 --> 01:25:39.849
Yeah.

01:25:39.849 --> 01:25:43.139
This may be slightly off topic, but I wonder
if you could comment on what you think the

01:25:43.139 --> 01:25:51.070
feasibility of [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:58.530
Whether it's feasible or not, we're not going
to do it.

01:25:58.530 --> 01:26:07.690
Elements of Mars Direct are in the NASA planning
for mars which does a fair amount of in situ

01:26:07.690 --> 01:26:12.969
resource utilization.

01:26:12.969 --> 01:26:17.900
Maybe I should back up and say what is this?

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:22.000
Mike Griffin was sworn in as NASA administrator
April the 14th.

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:30.150
He had been convinced for a number of months
that NASA's planning for implanting the Bush

01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:32.900
vision was proceeding at much too slow a pace.

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:40.150
And distributing money much too widely, including
to MIT graduate students.

01:26:40.150 --> 01:26:45.699
Jeff will explain that if none of you were
affected by it.

01:26:45.699 --> 01:26:54.550
And so he ordered, on April the 29th, a so-called
60-day exploration architecture study to develop

01:26:54.550 --> 01:27:00.219
a specific architecture for getting humans
onto the surface of the moon.

01:27:00.219 --> 01:27:06.190
And that architecture was basically finished
by the end of July.

01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:10.349
And it's taken six weeks to get White House
permission to release it.

01:27:10.349 --> 01:27:13.020
And so it was formally released yesterday.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:17.750
It was mainly because of two reasons, because
the senior people in the White House were

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:22.540
on vacation in August, as we all know.

01:27:22.540 --> 01:27:28.650
And so the OMB staff could sit and snip at
this and say, well, you can put all this stuff

01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:32.320
down, but where is the money to carry it out?

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:37.520
You have to show the business case that you
can actually do this with the budget that

01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:38.000
is allocated.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:49.739
And it takes a little prestidigitation, I
think, to do that.

01:27:49.739 --> 01:27:56.540
So, this is what NASA has now said is its
architecture for the next step in fulfilling

01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:00.239
our destiny as explorers.

01:28:00.239 --> 01:28:01.929
Safe accelerated.

01:28:01.929 --> 01:28:06.559
Accelerated in the sense that when Griffin
got there the schedule for the first crude

01:28:06.559 --> 01:28:15.650
flight of the CEV, crew exploration vehicle
was 2014, and he wanted the shuttle hard date

01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:17.150
retired in 2010.

01:28:17.150 --> 01:28:26.579
And he wanted to close that gap and thought
that it might be possible to have the CEV

01:28:26.579 --> 01:28:28.230
as early as 2011.

01:28:28.230 --> 01:28:33.219
It's turning out it is probably not going
to happen.

01:28:33.219 --> 01:28:38.750
Why is this just not Apollo over again sending
people back to the moon?

01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:40.619
Here are the arguments.

01:28:40.619 --> 01:28:52.300
For all crew on the moon, you can go anywhere
on the moon, not just in the equatorial regions.

01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:56.780
You can begin the buildup for permanent human
presence in a lunar base.

01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:58.880
Do institute resources.

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:04.760
And it's more reliable and safer.

01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:11.630
The argument is that, at least on ascent,
you get almost a factor of ten improvement

01:29:11.630 --> 01:29:14.520
in the safety.

01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:23.040
And how is that going to happen?

01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:27.739
Well, there are specific charts on that later.

01:29:27.739 --> 01:29:33.610
Oh, OK.

01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:38.590
Although, the system is being designed from
getting to the moon backwards.

01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:46.400
It can also be used for the International
Space Station, if we continue with the space

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.010
station.

01:29:49.010 --> 01:29:50.130
What are we going to do on the moon?

01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:55.040
Learn to operate away from earth.

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:55.780
Do science.

01:29:55.780 --> 01:30:03.020
Learn how to use local resources.

01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:05.530
Develop one mission at a time.

01:30:05.530 --> 01:30:08.790
A lunar base.

01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:14.929
And develop techniques for the eventual human
missions to mars.

01:30:14.929 --> 01:30:22.190
So there is another mars mention.

01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:25.809
Science group picked a bunch of places that
were interesting.

01:30:25.809 --> 01:30:34.420
I believe this was primarily a drill because
going in NASA knew that its preferred site

01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:39.389
was the Shackleton crater at the south pole
of the moon.

01:30:39.389 --> 01:30:42.369
Why?

01:30:42.369 --> 01:30:48.670
Because of the possibility of water ice which
would be a very valuable resource for in situ

01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:52.949
utilization.

01:30:52.949 --> 01:31:02.099
And each mission will go to the same place
and begin to leave on the surface the elements

01:31:02.099 --> 01:31:04.309
of a long duration base.

01:31:04.309 --> 01:31:11.880
How is this going to be done?

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:20.290
First you're going to have this heavy lifter,
launch the earth departure stage and the Lunar

01:31:20.290 --> 01:31:21.699
Lander.

01:31:21.699 --> 01:31:27.250
Then you're going to have the smaller rocket
launch the crew exploration vehicle.

01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:31.250
They are going to rendezvous in earth orbit.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:35.530
Fire up the departure stage and head off to
the moon.

01:31:35.530 --> 01:31:39.480
Arrive in lunar orbit.

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:45.340
And then the lander will separate and come
down to the moon.

01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:50.690
This is the lunar orbit rendezvous method
that was used for Apollo, plus an earth orbit

01:31:50.690 --> 01:31:56.550
rendezvous step.

01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:58.079
Work on the moon.

01:31:58.079 --> 01:32:04.530
Come back and rendezvous with the CEV.

01:32:04.530 --> 01:32:11.949
Probably ablative heat shield for what is
hoped to be a land landing in Western United

01:32:11.949 --> 01:32:17.599
States in Oregon, Nevada or California so
you don't have to deploy the fleet.

01:32:17.599 --> 01:32:25.250
The hope, but it's what the contractors will
confirm, is that most of the CEV will be able

01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:29.840
to reused up to ten times by replacing just
the heat shield.

01:32:29.840 --> 01:32:33.130
Again, that's the hope.

01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:36.790
That is not put in as a requirement, which
is important.

01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:37.699
It's a desire.

01:32:37.699 --> 01:32:47.190
It's a desire, yeah, because they don't know
they can do it.

01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:50.150
The baseline design is for a crew to the moon.

01:32:50.150 --> 01:32:55.980
The thing can actually carry six people, either
six people to space station early on or six

01:32:55.980 --> 01:33:03.320
people to a mars transit spaceship downstream.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:11.980
It can also be used, if you take the crew
accommodations out, as either a pressurized

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:16.250
cargo module going to space station and bringing
stuff back from the space station.

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:23.059
Provides down mass capability which is missing
after the shuttle goes away.

01:33:23.059 --> 01:33:27.070
The Apollo capsule was 3.9 meters across.

01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:34.170
This is 5.5 meters, 32 degree slope on the
capsule.

01:33:34.170 --> 01:33:46.079
So, it's a much larger capsule with hopefully
better characteristics.

01:33:46.079 --> 01:33:50.309
NASA is calling the bluff of the commercial
industry.

01:33:50.309 --> 01:33:56.309
It will issue shortly a request for a proposal
with a half a billion dollars behind it that

01:33:56.309 --> 01:34:04.400
says you, you, the commercial sector, demonstrate
the ability to have cargo or maybe even crew

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.540
deliver to the space station and we'll buy
those services.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:11.900
We won't use CEV.

01:34:11.900 --> 01:34:18.989
But, in case you cannot demonstrate it, the
CEV will be able to be a space station transport

01:34:18.989 --> 01:34:22.770
and crew rescue vehicle.

01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:31.719
I don't think anybody believes that, in the
relevant timeframe, anybody in NASA believes

01:34:31.719 --> 01:34:36.889
in the relevant timeframe the private sector
is going to develop crew transport to an acceptable

01:34:36.889 --> 01:34:38.650
level of reliability.

01:34:38.650 --> 01:34:39.510
Maybe cargo.

01:34:39.510 --> 01:34:54.179
The National Space Transportation Policy was
issued last January that said that there should

01:34:54.179 --> 01:35:01.960
be full utilization of the evolved expendable
launch vehicles, Delta 4 and Atlas 5.

01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.699
And that caused a problem because NASA said
well, for our purposes, we're going to build

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:07.389
something else.

01:35:07.389 --> 01:35:17.550
And part of the price of that is NASA agreement
to use primarily Delta 4s and Atlas 5s for

01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:18.989
its robotic missions.

01:35:18.989 --> 01:35:23.650
The problem with that is those things are
expensive, a lot more expensive than the Delta

01:35:23.650 --> 01:35:25.340
2s.

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:32.260
And where does that leave people like Elon
Musk in space exploration in privately developed

01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:37.760
launch systems?

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:44.300
Griffin was party to a study commissioned
last year by the Planetary Society that came

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:51.099
out with the conclusion that a shuttle derived
launch system was the best way to approach

01:35:51.099 --> 01:35:53.340
this.

01:35:53.340 --> 01:36:01.010
This study examined that system, shuttle derived,
and a number of possible alternatives and

01:36:01.010 --> 01:36:03.650
came up with this conclusion.

01:36:03.650 --> 01:36:07.469
This is the so-called stick.

01:36:07.469 --> 01:36:14.079
The first stage is the current solid rocket
booster on the shuttle for segment solid rocket.

01:36:14.079 --> 01:36:22.559
There's a new upper stage powered by some
version one space shuttle main engine, liquid,

01:36:22.559 --> 01:36:24.559
hydrogen, oxygen fuel.

01:36:24.559 --> 01:36:29.889
A capsule on top with a service module and
an escape tower.

01:36:29.889 --> 01:36:35.179
Now you can say why is it safer?

01:36:35.179 --> 01:36:40.909
It's because the crew is above any debris.

01:36:40.909 --> 01:36:45.119
And, if something bad happens in the first
couple minutes with a solid, you've got an

01:36:45.119 --> 01:36:48.179
escape system to pull the crew away from it.

01:36:48.179 --> 01:36:56.530
And so NASA's probabilistic risk assessments
say that this is a much safer system.

01:36:56.530 --> 01:36:58.599
You want to comment on that?

01:36:58.599 --> 01:37:07.929
Well, the probabilistic risk assessment, I
think it's fairly obvious, if your escape

01:37:07.929 --> 01:37:16.540
system has a 90% probability of working then
you have cut down, whatever the reliability

01:37:16.540 --> 01:37:23.889
of the main rocket, you've just increased
your survival probability by a factor of ten

01:37:23.889 --> 01:37:26.119
if the rocket blows up.

01:37:26.119 --> 01:37:34.300
Now, if you listen to some of the stories
that Professor Cohen has alluded to, and we'll

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:40.139
probably talk more about that, there were
some serious questions in Apollo about how

01:37:40.139 --> 01:37:47.960
well the ejection rocket would work throughout
the flight regime.

01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:54.750
And he said everybody always breathed a sigh
of relief when the ejection rocket was jettison

01:37:54.750 --> 01:37:56.820
in the course of the launch.

01:37:56.820 --> 01:38:02.329
But, nevertheless, we've never used it in
the US Space Program.

01:38:02.329 --> 01:38:13.040
But there was one example of a Russian Soyuz
which they did have a pad abort and the crew

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:16.659
was pulled off the pad by the ejection rocket.

01:38:16.659 --> 01:38:23.739
At a very high G load, like 15 Gs or so, but
they survived and went on to fly again.

01:38:23.739 --> 01:38:29.520
You want to comment on the comparison of that
to your level of confidence on return to launch

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:33.300
site aborts on the shuttle?

01:38:33.300 --> 01:38:38.869
Which was never done, thank heavens.

01:38:38.869 --> 01:38:44.790
We'll actually talk about some of the abort
schemes for the shuttle in more detail.

01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:48.449
And I think I'll leave it for that.

01:38:48.449 --> 01:38:53.579
But there's no question, the only way to survive
in the shuttle is for the shuttle itself to

01:38:53.579 --> 01:38:55.889
survive.

01:38:55.889 --> 01:39:05.159
We now have the capability either of returning
the shuttle to the launch pad and landing

01:39:05.159 --> 01:39:07.010
or going across the ocean.

01:39:07.010 --> 01:39:12.869
But if you cannot quite get back for a landing,
we do now have the capability.

01:39:12.869 --> 01:39:16.309
I showed you the pictures of the escape.

01:39:16.309 --> 01:39:20.059
You can actually bail out of the shuttle now,
but it has to be under controlled flight.

01:39:20.059 --> 01:39:26.199
And there's definitely no system of just extracting
you out of the shuttle.

01:39:26.199 --> 01:39:31.110
I mean the whole logic is this is claimed
to be an order of magnitude safer for the

01:39:31.110 --> 01:39:32.300
crew on ascent.

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:42.179
Well, I think the other point is that the
solid booster by itself is more reliable.

01:39:42.179 --> 01:39:46.489
Right now, for the shuttle to have a safe
launch, you have to have both solid rocket

01:39:46.489 --> 01:39:49.059
boosters work, plus all of the three main
engines.

01:39:49.059 --> 01:39:50.679
So you've got a lot more failure points.

01:39:50.679 --> 01:39:54.300
This is a simpler system so only one solid
booster.

01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:59.420
And then the second stage is your liquid rocket.

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:02.050
So, there are a lot fewer things to go wrong.

01:40:02.050 --> 01:40:06.869
Plus the whole aerodynamics is much simpler
because it's a simple stack formation.

01:40:06.869 --> 01:40:15.840
I think, just from an aerospace design point
of view, it is a simpler and safer system.

01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:21.820
Apparently, there were some concerns because
this was so tall of bending and that sort

01:40:21.820 --> 01:40:22.219
of thing.

01:40:22.219 --> 01:40:23.730
Well, that's something they'll have to deal
with.

01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:26.250
But we've launched tall skinny rockets before.

01:40:26.250 --> 01:40:29.989
And I suspect they'll be able to figure out
how to do that.

01:40:29.989 --> 01:40:39.940
The heavy lift is built around something derived
from the space shuttle external tank with

01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:48.559
five versions of a throw-away version of the
space shuttle main engine, plus two five segment

01:40:48.559 --> 01:40:49.020
solid rockets.

01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:56.869
So, it's adding one more segment to the existing
booster.

01:40:56.869 --> 01:41:05.619
The upper stage will be powered by one or
two derivatives of the J2 engine used for

01:41:05.619 --> 01:41:07.500
the upper stages of the Saturn 5.

01:41:07.500 --> 01:41:11.010
So, this is a pretty retro system.

01:41:11.010 --> 01:41:13.969
But it was a good engine.

01:41:13.969 --> 01:41:21.659
And the other thing to mention, some people
had suggested using five segment solids for

01:41:21.659 --> 01:41:24.400
the crew launch vehicle.

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:31.489
One of the other things, when you talk about
reliability, as John said, we've had now 228

01:41:31.489 --> 01:41:34.290
launches of the solid rocket boosters.

01:41:34.290 --> 01:41:40.909
And one of the great things about the recovery
is not just the economic impact of being able

01:41:40.909 --> 01:41:47.270
to recover and reuse the solid booster, but
you get to examine how it performed.

01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:52.400
And that makes a huge difference in terms
of flying safely.

01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:57.590
Because, if you look back at the history of
the Challenger accident, we knew for many

01:41:57.590 --> 01:42:02.030
years that we had a problem with blow by around
the O ring seal.

01:42:02.030 --> 01:42:10.639
Unfortunately, for various reasons, management
chose to ignore that and fly anyway.

01:42:10.639 --> 01:42:16.010
But if you can recover your rocket after you
use it and actually see how it performed and

01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:26.309
look and see if there are any critical failures
which are suggesting that there are problems,

01:42:26.309 --> 01:42:28.520
that also improves your reliability.

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.369
So, we have a lot of experience with four-segment
solid rocket boosters.

01:42:33.369 --> 01:42:40.290
And, by choosing not to use this new and improved
five segment booster for the human launches,

01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:45.469
we're basically saying we're going to go with
what we have experience with and what we understand.

01:42:45.469 --> 01:42:47.090
Well, besides that, we don't have it now.

01:42:47.090 --> 01:42:56.130
It will be developed, but when we develop
it and use it for this, some day, after we

01:42:56.130 --> 01:43:00.710
get a lot of experience with it, we may decide
to -- Well, it says can be certified for [OVERLAPPING

01:43:00.710 --> 01:43:00.900
VOICES].

01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.469
Now, this is the heavy lift thing.

01:43:03.469 --> 01:43:07.619
Right, but you're going to want to fly it
many times before we decide to [OVERLAPPING

01:43:07.619 --> 01:43:07.679
VOICES].

01:43:07.679 --> 01:43:12.380
And the intent is not to human rate this from
the start.

01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:16.520
Without the upper stage, you can get 100 tons,
106 tons to low earth orbit just with the

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:29.500
first stage and 55 metric tons to, well, you
can read, I think.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:35.400
That's a new development, obviously.

01:43:35.400 --> 01:43:41.949
This is Marsha Ivins who presented this yesterday,
one of Jeff's former colleagues.

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:47.199
This really isn't what it's going to look
like, the Lunar Lander.

01:43:47.199 --> 01:43:51.750
What's interesting is, in addition to carrying
the crew down, the idea is that you can carry

01:43:51.750 --> 01:43:57.429
a fairly significant cargo load down to the
lunar surface and leave it there.

01:43:57.429 --> 01:44:03.929
And that enables the fairly early buildup
of a lunar base capability.

01:44:03.929 --> 01:44:08.559
And, again, this ascent stage will use a liquid
methane propulsion.

01:44:08.559 --> 01:44:16.000
Any sense of scale on the habitat?

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:20.599
Well, this is enough for four people so it's
not super big.

01:44:20.599 --> 01:44:31.199
I've seen dimensions on it, but this is just
a nominal design anyway.

01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:35.920
This design, with all the tanks down here,
is not very good for carrying cargo down.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.199
They added the cargo capability and didn't
change the picture.

01:44:41.199 --> 01:44:47.909
Here is what NASA says are the commercial
opportunities in this initiative.

01:44:47.909 --> 01:44:54.820
It's interesting.

01:44:54.820 --> 01:45:00.969
There were some other ones that have gone
away from earlier briefings.

01:45:00.969 --> 01:45:03.510
Here are the international opportunities.

01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:10.309
And they are focused in the longer run on
lunar surface systems.

01:45:10.309 --> 01:45:17.610
And the reality is that without international
contributions you cannot do a lunar base because,

01:45:17.610 --> 01:45:20.460
on the budget available, you cannot afford
to build this stuff.

01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:29.219
I am looking at this hard for the first time.

01:45:29.219 --> 01:45:32.829
I saw a version of this in July, and there
have been some significant changes.

01:45:32.829 --> 01:45:39.619
The July version said opportunities for non-US
astronauts going to the moon, and it's not

01:45:39.619 --> 01:45:51.510
here in this final briefing.

01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:53.650
Committed long-term lunar effort is needed.

01:45:53.650 --> 01:46:00.040
You can show mars up here, but this is really
a plan for getting back to the moon.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:07.920
And to reach for mars we must first reach
for the moon.

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:19.750
A Griffin quote, Mike and I have talked about
this, he believes that the spread of the human

01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:26.150
species into the solar system is inevitable,
and the United States should lead so we carry

01:46:26.150 --> 01:46:31.730
the principles and values of Western philosophy
and culture.

01:46:31.730 --> 01:46:36.110
You can make a judgment whether you think
that's a good rationale for doing this or

01:46:36.110 --> 01:46:46.860
not, but he means it.

01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:48.699
Great nations do great and ambitious things.

01:46:48.699 --> 01:46:50.270
We must continue to be great.

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:53.040
Cue the music now.

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:55.469
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:55.469 --> 01:46:56.630
This is interesting.

01:46:56.630 --> 01:47:01.210
This was a presentation that was given yesterday.

01:47:01.210 --> 01:47:07.000
And it is different than the presentation
that was presented to industry yesterday.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:18.219
And the biggest difference is
the industry presentation had a budget.

01:47:18.219 --> 01:47:20.469
[LAUGHTER]

01:47:20.469 --> 01:47:35.070
And the budget shows that within the next
five years all of this fits within the plan

01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:44.520
budget curve and then stops in terms of the
affordability downstream.

01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:53.380
And it also shows no mars research and technology
until fiscal 1917.

01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:57.320
And a fairly big wedge for lunar outpost.

01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:00.940
This is a US-only scenario.

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:05.230
Any relief from this is going to come from
international contributions.

01:48:05.230 --> 01:48:13.920
And one of the things that changed over the
past week or so is now the phrase is go as

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:15.340
you can pay.

01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:22.599
In the trade between performance requirements,
cost and schedule, what you're going to trade

01:48:22.599 --> 01:48:25.320
is schedule.

01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:30.889
And NASA is very nervous of announcing this
thing in the middle of the Katrina recovery

01:48:30.889 --> 01:48:35.130
saying we're going to spend $100 billion going
back to the moon.

01:48:35.130 --> 01:48:40.980
Actually, that was the first question that
Griffin got at the press conference.

01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:41.429
Right.

01:48:41.429 --> 01:48:46.550
I talked with some media yesterday, and this
is the same sort of thing.

01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:57.510
It's interesting that the budget chart is
not in the presentation I was given.

01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:58.989
The budget said that you cannot do it?

01:48:58.989 --> 01:49:01.369
The budget says that they can get started.

01:49:01.369 --> 01:49:07.639
[LAUGHTER]

01:49:07.639 --> 01:49:16.179
What the budget is going to support and the
hardware that we will be building, over the

01:49:16.179 --> 01:49:19.770
next few years it's just the crew exploration
vehicle.

01:49:19.770 --> 01:49:21.760
And the launch vehicle.

01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.980
The upper stage in the launch vehicle.

01:49:23.980 --> 01:49:26.099
Right, this.

01:49:26.099 --> 01:49:28.760
We will retire the shuttle.

01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:34.750
We will use that to support the space station,
if we're doing the space station at that point.

01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:41.659
And not until the shuttle is retired will
then the money that is now used to support

01:49:41.659 --> 01:49:44.630
shuttle flights can start going into building
this.

01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:47.099
That's the way I understand it.

01:49:47.099 --> 01:49:50.710
And that's the schedule which means you cannot
get to the moon until near the end of the

01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:52.030
next decade.

01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:54.900
2018 is the target date.

01:49:54.900 --> 01:50:00.750
And that doesn't support any extra equipment
once you get to the surface of the moon.

01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:05.349
So, we don't have a long-term habitat, we
don't have rovers, we don't have NC2 resources.

01:50:05.349 --> 01:50:12.420
All the stuff that we'd like to do on the
moon, that's over and above this.

01:50:12.420 --> 01:50:13.659
I think that's fair to say, isn't it?

01:50:13.659 --> 01:50:23.219
I think it's fair to say except that, as I
say, in this budget curve it's in the budget.

01:50:23.219 --> 01:50:30.480
But the only way to do the rest of it is to
get that green part, the lunar base buildup

01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:36.659
to be paid for by somebody else.

01:50:36.659 --> 01:50:37.349
So, we will see.

01:50:37.349 --> 01:50:38.730
This is your future, I think.

01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:44.559
If you're going into aerospace engineering,
this is at least the NASA project for the

01:50:44.559 --> 01:50:46.530
next 15 years.

01:50:46.530 --> 01:50:51.429
And maybe 20 years from now there will be
a class here talking about the systems engineering

01:50:51.429 --> 01:50:56.159
of the Lunar Exploration Program.

01:50:56.159 --> 01:50:58.380
So, you're kids can attend that class.

01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:59.309
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:59.309 --> 01:51:01.260
Then it was typewritten memos.

01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:05.630
Now it's PowerPoint.

01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:12.750
For you engineering junkies, there is a thousand
page report coming next month that has all

01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:16.159
the information of the trade studies and everything
underpinning all this.

01:51:16.159 --> 01:51:17.610
This is the output of a study.

01:51:17.610 --> 01:51:19.099
The study report is coming.

01:51:19.099 --> 01:51:26.760
OK, just briefly, from most of you I've gotten
an indication of what you want to do for your

01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:27.320
projects.

01:51:27.320 --> 01:51:29.860
I'll have a look at those.

01:51:29.860 --> 01:51:32.699
If you haven't sent them to me, please make
sure I get them by Thursday.

01:51:32.699 --> 01:51:40.489
One or two of you have said you want to come
and talk with me about it, that's fine.

01:51:40.489 --> 01:51:42.949
Let's see, that's on the reports.

01:51:42.949 --> 01:51:50.420
The last thing, just to remind you, is this
really is the last of the kind of introductory

01:51:50.420 --> 01:51:55.440
policy, how did the shuttle program get started.

01:51:55.440 --> 01:52:02.070
For the next six weeks or so we'll be going
deep into the nitty-gritty of some of the

01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.449
systems.

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:07.690
Tom Moser will be here, and he will be talking
about shuttle structures and the thermal protection

01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:09.219
system on Thursday.

01:52:09.219 --> 01:52:09.660
See you then.

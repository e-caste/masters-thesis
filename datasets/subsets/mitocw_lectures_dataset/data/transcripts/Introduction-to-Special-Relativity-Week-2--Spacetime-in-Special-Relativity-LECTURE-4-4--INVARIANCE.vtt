00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.560
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, special relativity.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.420
Let's start here
with a short summary.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.510
We have seen through
experimental measurements

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.620
that there is no ether, that
electromagnetic waves travels

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.930
through vacuum.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.180
We have discussed the concept of
the relativity of simultaneity,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.320
meaning that two events
might occur simultaneous

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.090
to one reference-- in
one reference frame,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.410
to one observer, while
they're not to another.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.470
In the last two videos,
we looked at clocks.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.140
And we've seen that
moving clocks run slow.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.980
We've also seen that moving
objects appear smaller.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.400
They're lengths contract.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.340
We found that the
time of a moving clock

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.640
is related to the time
in the clock at rest

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.850
with a gamma factor
because it's time dilation.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.520
And, for the length, we
have seen that there is a 1

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.300
over gamma dependency,
length contraction.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.110
The entire discussion was
based on Einstein's postulates.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.570
We simply used
Einstein's postulates.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.870
And then we looked at
experiments of clocks.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.940
Now, you might argue that
the setup of the clock

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.800
is actually what's
tricking us here,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.700
but I can tell you
that is not the case.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.325
As you have seen for
the muon, the muon

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:32.110
doesn't know about
optical clocks.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.550
It just decays based
on its own properties.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.730
I think it's fair to say that
PoincarÃ© and Lorentz came

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.580
to similar conclusions about
the same time as Einstein did.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.660
Delta t at rest and delta L at
rest, the time and the length,

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.380
are also sometimes called
the proper time and length.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.110
In German-- and I actually
prefer this a bit--

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.720
we use the word eigen,
which means own.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.110
So it's basically the time,
the own time of the object,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.680
the object being addressed.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.600
So we can now ask, [INAUDIBLE]
seen time is suspect.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.770
What is not suspect?

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.370
What are the observables
which are invariant?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.418
And, by this, I mean
the observables,

00:02:16.418 --> 00:02:18.210
when we have two
different reference frames

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.400
and we have a conversation,
we do actually

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.474
agree in a conversation
about an observation we have.

00:02:27.474 --> 00:02:29.870
We have seen we
cannot agree on time,

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.480
and we cannot agree on the
length in the direction

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.700
in which we are moving.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.650
So can I ask, for
example, what happens

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.920
to the width or the height?

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.490
If I put a train on a train
track and it's fast moving,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.490
is that contracted or even
expanded or changing at all?

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.800
The answer is no.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.860
Similarly, if I put a
train track on a track

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.770
and I go very fast
into a tunnel,

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.300
does the height of
the tunnel change?

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.670
Also here the answer is no.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.780
And we can verify this
later quantitatively.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.780
In summary, transverse
dimensions are not affected.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.160
They are not suspect.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.860
We can agree in a
conversation of two people

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.620
in different reference
frames about the height

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.630
and the width of a train.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.420
That's good.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.460
But what else is invariant?

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.950
So here I want you to
consider the time and distance

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.830
between two events or
maybe even three events

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.230
observed from different
reference frames.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.740
And we introduce or reintroduce
our characters Alice and Bob

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.950
and add Carol to this.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.180
So we're going to have three
reference frames of three

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.870
observers in this discussion.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.590
So I want you to look
at this one here.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.090
So assume that Bob
has a clock, and it's

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.750
moving with a velocity v. And
Alice is observing Bob's clock.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.470
We have done this before.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.750
Now, we want to also
add Carol to this.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.600
And Carol is moving with
three times the velocity

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.750
and is also observing
Bob's clock.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:08.970
What I want you to do is
look at this property here.

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.560
So we have seen that
the height is invariant.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.080
So let's look at what
happens if I calculate

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.019
2 times the height squared, and
I use x and t, time and space,

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.170
in order to express
the height, all right?

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.480
Again, this is an opportunity to
stop the clock, stop the video,

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.830
and work this out
on a piece of paper.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.800
So it turns out
it's not that hard.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.410
We basically find that 4
times the height squared

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.725
is equal to--

00:04:40.725 --> 00:04:42.910
maybe it is hard--

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.880
c squared times t
squared minus x squared.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.820
And, since the height
is an invariant,

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.450
this property, c squared,
the speed of light squared,

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.320
times the time squared minus
x squared, is invariant.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.430
So we can think about them
as delta t and delta x.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.460
When we look at the difference
in time and the difference

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.050
in space between two events--

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:10.100
Professor Klute
entered the class.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.570
And, at the other
end of the class,

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.580
Professor Klute exploded.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.880
If I do the delta t and the
delta x between the two--

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.280
we square them and
subtract them--

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.680
that is an observation
we can all agree on.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.260
Whether or not you're
stationary in the classroom

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.440
or you're passing by really
quickly with your spacecraft,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.240
that observation is
something we can agree on.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.340
And it's invariant.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.590
This property is called
the invariant interval.

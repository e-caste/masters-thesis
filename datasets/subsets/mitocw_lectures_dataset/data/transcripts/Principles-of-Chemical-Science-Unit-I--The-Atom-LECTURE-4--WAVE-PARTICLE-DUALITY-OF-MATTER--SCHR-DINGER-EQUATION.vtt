00:00:36.414 --> 00:00:37.330
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.980
We're going to take
10 more seconds.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.350
OK.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.510
Does someone want to explain
how they got the right answer?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.600
We have a Faculty of 1,000
research bag for them.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.570
Do you want to hand that
up and the bag, too?

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.070
We're just--

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.150
AUDIENCE: So the theme
of light gives enough

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.880
energy for the
electrons to be ejected.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.770
And the amount of energy
for that is 4.3 eV.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.890
And then it also has
kinetic energy of 7.9 eV.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.210
So you just add the two.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.543
So 4.3 plus 7.9 is 12.2 eV.

00:01:38.543 --> 00:01:39.626
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Thanks.

00:01:39.626 --> 00:01:41.631
Let's bring it back.

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:42.130
OK.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.890
Thank you.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.390
All right.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.610
We'll have lots more
practice with this today,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.230
and we'll get the hang
of doing these problems.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.650
So let's just jump
in and get started.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.830
We're still continuing to think
about the photoelectric effect,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.660
and think about
light as a particle.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.450
So we're going to finish up
with the photoelectric effect,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.357
and we're going to have a little
demo on that in a few minutes.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:05.440
Then we're going to go on.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:11.320
If light is, in fact, quantized,
and you have these photons,

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.930
then photons should
have momentum.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.600
And so we'll talk about that.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.700
Then we've talked about
white as a particle.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.530
And most of you are probably
pretty OK with matter

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.340
being a particle.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.110
But what about
matter being a wave?

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.660
So we're going to talk
about matter being a wave.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.420
And if we have time
at the end, we're

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.461
going to start on the
Schrodinger equation, which

00:02:32.461 --> 00:02:34.390
we're going to continue
with on Friday.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.370
So I'll just say that sometimes,
I am a little overly ambitious,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.710
and I put things on the
handout that I'm not really

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.120
sure I'm going to get to.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.860
Just because I've
never gotten into it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.100
before doesn't mean that I
won't get into it this time.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.680
So if I don't finish
everything on a handout,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.602
bring your handout
to the next class,

00:02:52.602 --> 00:02:54.060
and we'll just
continue from there.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.530
And there'll be a new
handout then as well, so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.220
just a heads up on that.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.720
All right.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.800
So let's continue with
the photoelectric effect

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.360
and get good at doing
these kinds of problems.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.580
So let's look at these
particular examples.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.770
We have three different
examples here.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.920
We have the energy
of an incoming photon

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.960
must be equal or greater to that
threshold energy or that work

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.200
function, in order for an
electron to be ejected.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.810
So in this case, the energy is
greater than the work function.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.350
So tell me whether an
electron will be ejected

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.470
or will not be ejected.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.690
And you can just yell it out.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.662
What do you think?

00:03:35.662 --> 00:03:36.640
AUDIENCE: Will.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.598
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yes.

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:38.950
So an electron is ejected.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.260
It will be ejected.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.780
What about this
scenario over here,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.310
where the energy is less
than that threshold energy?

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.520
Is or is not ejected?

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.820
AUDIENCE: Is not.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.900
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yes.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.210
OK now we have another scenario.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.660
We have three
photons, each of which

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.800
have half of the energy needed,
half of that threshold energy.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.090
But you have three of them.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.864
So will an electron
is or is not ejected?

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:11.572
AUDIENCE: Is not.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.000
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Is not.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.959
OK.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.160
So three photons each
that have half the energy

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.660
does not add up.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:23.490
You cannot add it.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.420
It will not eject an electron.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.170
So let's just think
about it for a minute.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.920
Suppose the threshold
knowledge for passing

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.180
an exam is answering three
specific questions correctly.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.440
Suppose over here, we have the
answer to one of the questions,

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.360
but not to the other two.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.580
Over here, we have an
answer to the middle one,

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.252
but not the first or the second.

00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:46.210
And over here, we have
the answer to the third,

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.740
but not the first or the second.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.910
So everyone knows the answer
to a different question.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.930
Will there be the threshold
energy, a threshold knowledge,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.010
to pass this test?

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.490
No.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.730
Everyone needs to have
the threshold knowledge

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.580
themselves to be able to pass.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.240
Everyone has to overcome that
critical amount of knowledge

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.250
to be able to pass the test.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.440
So that's the same thing here.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.140
You can't add it up.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.230
Now, with the test here at MIT,
if everyone has that threshold

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.420
knowledge, and a really
high level of the threshold

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.470
knowledge, everyone can get
an A. So the more people

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.550
with the threshold knowledge,
the more tests that are passed,

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.350
and the more the course
is passed by people.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.030
So the more photons coming
in with that threshold

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.270
energy, the more
electrons being ejected.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.940
But you can't add up
if you have photons

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.310
that don't have enough,
if they're not greater

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.720
than, the threshold energy.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.250
You won't eject an electron.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.000
So everyone needs to meet
that threshold criteria.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.800
You can't add things up.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800
OK.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.830
So here's just some
useful terminology

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.410
for solving problems
on this problem set.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.050
And there will also be
problems on problems set two

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.990
related to this topic.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.390
So photons-- also
called light, also

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.270
called electric
magnetic radiation--

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.070
may be described by their
energy, by their wavelength,

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.430
or by their frequency.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.880
Whereas electrons, which
are sometimes also called

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.590
photoelectrons, may be described
by their kinetic energy,

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.150
their velocity, and, as you'll
see later, by their wavelength.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.480
So you'll be given
problems where,

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.399
given different
pieces of information,

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:40.690
you have to think about how
you're going to convert it.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.940
You've got to think about
am I talking about a photon?

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:44.940
Am I talking about an electron?

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.800
And you also want to
think about units.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.780
You'll sometimes be
told about energy in eVs

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.660
and sometimes be told
about energies in joules.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.520
So this is a conversion factor.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.085
All conversion factors are
given to you on the exam.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:03.160
You do not need to memorize
any kind of conversion factor.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.250
But you need to be
aware, when someone

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:09.090
said joules, what's that a unit
for, or eV, what's that a unit

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.990
for.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.490
All right.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.730
So now we're going to do
and in-class demonstration

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.430
of the photoelectric effect.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.200
But before we actually
do the experiment,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.160
we're going to predict what
the experiment will show.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.050
Always dangerous to
do that, so we'll

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.461
hope it works after
we do the prediction.

00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:27.960
All right.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.020
So we're going to be
looking at whether we're

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:36.750
going to get an injection of an
electron from a zinc surface.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:42.510
And we're given the threshold
energy, or the work function,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.520
of zinc.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.490
Every metal-- this is
a property of metals.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.620
They're different,
as we saw last time.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:54.390
So this is 6.9 times 10
to the minus 19th joules.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:56.400
And we're going to use
two different light

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.420
sources that are going to
have different wavelengths.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:04.440
And we'll predict whether
they have enough energy

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.660
to meet this threshold
to go over the threshold

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.270
and inject an electron.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.660
So the two different
sources, we have a UV lamp

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:16.480
with a wavelength
of 254 nanometers

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.650
and a red laser pointer
with a wavelength

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.631
of about 700 nanometers.

00:08:22.631 --> 00:08:23.130
OK.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:25.650
So before we do the
experiment, let's

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:29.250
do some calculations
to see what we expect.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.860
So first, we want to
see what the energy,

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:34.470
or calculate what the
energy, of the photon

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:38.909
will be that's a
emitted by the UV lamp.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:43.049
And I will write this down.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.190
So what do we know?

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:46.230
We know a bunch
of things already.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:51.420
We know that energy is equal
to Planck's constant times

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:52.980
the frequency.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.720
We also know that the frequency
is related to wavelength

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.360
by c, the speed of light.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.120
And then we can put
those two things together

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.070
to say the energy, then, is
also the Planck's constant times

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:12.750
the speed of light
divided by the wavelength.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.710
So we can use that last
equation to do a calculation,

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.620
and figure out the
energy that's associated

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:22.710
with that particular
wavelength of light.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.810
So here we have energy.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:32.910
We're going to write in Planck's
constant, 6.626 times 10

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.530
to the minus 34.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:39.000
And the units are
joules times seconds

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:46.200
and the speed of
light, 2.998 times 10

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.130
to the 8 meters per second.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:56.770
And we want to divide this,
then, by the wavelength.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.580
So we have the wavelength
here that we're

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:11.130
using first is a 254 times
10 to the minus 19 meters.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:17.200
Oh sorry-- 9 meters.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.720
Thank you.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.630
I wrote down 19.

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:21.630
I'm like, wait a minute.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.250
That's not right.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.850
OK.

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.170
OK.

00:10:26.170 --> 00:10:28.410
So then we can do
the calculation out.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.720
And here is where I
got excited about 19.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:41.130
We have 7.82 times 10
to the minus 19 joules.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.940
And if we look at
the equation, we'll

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.890
see that the meters
are going to cancel.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.540
The seconds cancel,
and we're left

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.990
with joules, which is good,
because we want an energy.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:52.030
So joules is a
good thing to have.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.940
So there, we can do
a simple calculation.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:00.100
And we can look and say, OK,
if the energy, then, associated

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:03.430
with that wavelength
is 7.82 times 10

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.410
to the minus 19th joules, then
we ask, is this greater or less

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:11.560
than the threshold energy?

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.720
And it's greater than that.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.420
So it does have enough energy.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.100
It should eject an electron.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.800
So we can try that out and see.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:24.580
Now we can look at what happens
with the red laser pointer

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.870
and see whether that should
have the energy that's needed.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.540
And so I will just write
these things down here

00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.990
instead of writing it again.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.220
So that was our UV.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.520
So now our red light, we have
700 times 10 to the minus 9

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.520
meters, or 700 nanometers.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:48.490
And so here is our
answer for the UV.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:57.160
And our answer for the red
light should be 2.84 times 10

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.340
to the minus 19 joules.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:04.820
And I'll move this up a
little so people can see that.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.700
So does that have enough
energy to eject an electron?

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.437
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:12.437 --> 00:12:14.020
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
No, that should not

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.530
work, because that's less than
the threshold energy that's

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:18.790
needed.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.530
All right.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.530
So we'll do one more
calculation just for fun.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.400
And then we'll do
the experiment.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.740
So the last
calculation we'll do is

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.900
we'll think about
the number of photons

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.410
that are emitted by
a laser in 60 seconds

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:38.860
if you have an intensity
of one milliwatt.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:43.720
And a milliwatt is equal
to 10 to the minus 3 joules

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.160
per second.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.370
So we can just do that
calculation over here.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:13:00.730
So we have 1.00 times 10 to
the minus 3 joules per second,

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:07.410
1 photon, and here, this
is for the red laser.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:11.480
So we'll use the number that
we just calculated over here.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.650
So we have 2.84 times 10
to the minus 19th joules

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:24.400
for the red laser
and times 60 seconds.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:32.200
And we should get 2.1
times 10 to the 17 photons.

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.080
So that's how much
photons, if we hold it

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.900
for 60 seconds, that were going
to be shooting at our metal's

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.030
surface.

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.720
So these are the
kind of calculations

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.270
that you'll be doing on
these kind of problems.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:49.139
And now let's see how
well the experiment works.

00:13:49.139 --> 00:13:51.430
So we're going to bring out
our demo TAs, who are going

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.186
to tell you about this demo.

00:13:53.186 --> 00:13:55.060
And we're going to try
to do some fancy stuff

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.660
with this document camera
to project it on the screen.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:59.580
So this is all very exciting.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.310
Oh, I guess I should
put that down,

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.810
the number, in case
you couldn't see

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.260
it-- 2.1 times 10 to the 17.

00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:06.760
All right.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.385
So let's bring--
you've got the mic.

00:14:12.607 --> 00:14:13.440
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.784
So we've got our
metal plate here

00:14:15.784 --> 00:14:16.950
that Eric's got in his hand.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:19.020
And what he's doing
right now is he's

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.722
rubbing it with a little bit
of-- what is that, actually?

00:14:21.722 --> 00:14:23.320
ERIC: It's just steel wool.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.570
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Steel wool.

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:24.810
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:26.476
So that's just going
to get the aluminum

00:14:26.476 --> 00:14:28.780
oxide, because sometimes--
you guys will get to it.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.100
But sometimes you can get
a reaction of aluminum

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.250
with the moisture in
the air, and that's

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.500
going to cause aluminum oxide.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.230
So he's getting get rid of that.

00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:43.704
And now we've put this
on a-- what is this?

00:14:43.704 --> 00:14:44.580
ERIC: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:45.470
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
What do you call it?

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.570
A detector of some kind.

00:14:46.570 --> 00:14:49.620
So basically, when he charges
this, what's going to happen

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:54.660
is that you have this plate,
and you have this joint.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.290
And they're both going to
be electrically negative,

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.230
because you've introduced
some electrons.

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:02.160
And they're going
to repel each other,

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.000
because they're both negative.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.583
Two negative charges
repel each other.

00:15:04.583 --> 00:15:08.190
So you're going to see some
space develop as Eric's done.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:10.760
Now, what he's doing is
he's got a plastic rod here

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.440
that he's charging with the fur.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.637
And he's introducing those
electrons onto the plate.

00:15:16.637 --> 00:15:18.470
So now we've got a
negatively charged plate,

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.460
and you can see that
by the fact that you

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.220
see some repulsion between
that rod and the rest

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.670
of the detector, which
is actually working out

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.860
pretty nicely.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.360
So once--

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.068
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
say this experiment

00:15:30.068 --> 00:15:31.340
is very weather-dependent.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:36.410
If it's really humid or too dry,
it doesn't work nearly as well.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:37.910
But today, today's good weather.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:39.618
Today's good weather
for this experiment,

00:15:39.618 --> 00:15:42.320
not so much good for
sunbathing outside, but good

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.885
weather for this experiment.

00:15:43.885 --> 00:15:47.810
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Although
we have UV lamps, so maybe.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.217
CATHERINE DRENNAN: That's true.

00:15:49.217 --> 00:15:50.050
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:51.487
So now we've got a charge.

00:15:51.487 --> 00:15:53.570
CATHERINE DRENNAN: That's
the green laser pointer.

00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:54.992
Let's get the red.

00:15:54.992 --> 00:15:56.950
GUEST SPEAKER 1: It's
underneath here, I think.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.317
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Oh, yeah.

00:15:58.317 --> 00:15:59.150
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.960
So now--

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.340
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We could do
the calculation for the green.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:03.770
If you want to do the
calculation for the green,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:04.740
we can try it later.

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.200
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Eric's got a
red laser pointer in his hand.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.158
He's going to shine it.

00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:11.450
And we're going to see
that nothing happens,

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:15.170
because as we calculated,
the energy of these photons

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.069
is not enough to get
over the threshold

00:16:17.069 --> 00:16:18.110
of this particular metal.

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.600
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So if
electrons were being ejected,

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.599
you should see it move.

00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:25.640
GUEST SPEAKER 1: And we'll
do that one more time.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.889
Maybe the green one will work.

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:28.242
It doesn't.

00:16:28.242 --> 00:16:29.450
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.310
Well, now we have to see
if the UV-- we built it up.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.970
The UV should--

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:32.440
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So
hopefully this works.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:32.900
CATHERINE DRENNAN: --work.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.637
Let's see.

00:16:33.637 --> 00:16:36.167
GUEST SPEAKER 2: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:36.167 --> 00:16:37.000
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.877
So oh-- maybe--

00:16:38.877 --> 00:16:39.752
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:39.752 --> 00:16:40.668
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Oh.

00:16:40.668 --> 00:16:42.740
GUEST SPEAKER 1: Oh,
well, I guess it worked.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.410
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It did work.

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:45.580
You could sort of see that.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.330
GUEST SPEAKER 1: So
maybe we can charge it

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:48.690
up again while I talk about it.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:48.995
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Yeah, sometimes

00:16:48.995 --> 00:16:49.953
the charge [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:49.953 --> 00:16:51.710
GUEST SPEAKER 1: The
UV lamp, obviously,

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.050
has enough energy in
each of these photons.

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:58.250
So when you shine that
light at the metal,

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.900
you have the electrons
on the surface,

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.850
which are being ejected.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.650
And if those
electrons get ejected,

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.010
then the whole system
becomes neutral.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.050
If the systems become neutral,
then that rod can go back

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:13.060
and is no longer
feels a repulsion,

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.410
because the two parts
are no longer negative.

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.450
So once we charge this
up again, maybe we

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.859
can go to the other side
and-- I think it's good.

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:20.359
It's good.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.096
CATHERINE DRENNAN:
Yeah, that's good.

00:17:21.096 --> 00:17:21.869
Oh--

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:23.801
GUEST SPEAKER 1:
It will be fine.

00:17:23.801 --> 00:17:25.292
GUEST SPEAKER 2: Wavering.

00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:26.750
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.960
GUEST SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.720
Now we're just going
to try it again.

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.182
And yay.

00:17:34.182 --> 00:17:35.140
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yay.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.265
GUEST SPEAKER 1: We got it.

00:17:36.265 --> 00:17:39.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:40.990
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.490
Great.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.520
We can just leave this here.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.070
All right.

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.360
And I think he held it
for 60 seconds, so you

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.400
know how many photons
were coming off,

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.860
too, if you want to
do that calculation.

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.220
So again, the
photoelectric effect

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.850
was really important
at this time

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:03.140
in understanding the properties
that were being observed,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:07.370
to help us understand about this
quantized energy of particles,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.290
that light had this
particle-like property.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.290
It had this quantized energy.

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.110
And you needed a
certain amount of it

00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:17.900
to eject an electron
from a metal surface.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.530
So we all know that
light is a wave.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.240
But now there's
this evidence that,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:27.590
even though it's pretty
much this massless particle,

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:31.070
that it still has
particle-like properties.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:34.887
So light is a really
amazing thing.

00:18:34.887 --> 00:18:36.470
This doesn't really
show up very well.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.803
It's a view of the Stata Center.

00:18:37.803 --> 00:18:41.360
Stata Center always has some
really spectacular sunlight

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.200
coming around it sometimes.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:43.700
All right.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.900
So now, if this is
true, that means

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:51.530
that photons that have
this quantized energy

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:53.980
should have momentum as well.

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.390
And so Einstein was
thinking about that.

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:59.450
And so he reasoned that
this had to be true.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:03.650
There had to be some kind of
momentum associated with them.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:07.490
And so momentum, or p,
here is equal to Planck's

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.840
constant times the frequency
divided by the speed of light,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:12.740
c.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.250
And since the speed of light
is equal to the frequency

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.770
times the wavelength
of the light,

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.280
then the momentum should be
equal to Planck's constant

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.530
divided by the wavelength.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.050
So this is really-- we're
talking about momentum

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:31.470
in terms of wavelength, this
inverse relationship here.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.590
This was just a
kind of a crazy idea

00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:35.570
to be thinking
about momentum, when

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:37.560
you're talking about light.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.120
And this really came out of
the photoelectric effect.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:43.700
And also, there were
some experiments

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.560
done by Arthur Compton that
also showed that you could

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.110
sort of transfer this momentum.

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.170
And so that's again the
particle-like property.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:57.050
So it's a really exciting time.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.190
OK.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.610
So we're going to
now move to matter.

00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:03.050
So we've been
talking about light

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:08.870
and how light has this dual,
particle, wavelike properties.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:10.370
But what about matter?

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:15.260
So we accept that matter has
particle-like properties.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:17.135
But what about as a wave?

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.960
So enter de Broglie
into this area.

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:31.050
And so he was following what
Einstein was thinking about.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.690
And he said, OK, so
that's pretty cool.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:38.620
If you have momentum is equal
to Planck's constant divided

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.210
by wavelength, if
you could think

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.750
of things that have
wavelengths as having momentum.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:47.620
And he said, or I can
rewrite this equation,

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:52.150
that wavelength equals Planck's
constant divided by momentum.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:54.760
And we know something
about momentum.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.600
We know that momentum is often
associated with something's

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.550
mass times its velocity.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:06.700
So therefore, I should be able
to rewrite this equation again

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:09.250
in terms of wavelength
being equal to Planck's

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.240
constant divided by a
mass and a velocity.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:18.300
And here, we are expressing
wavelengths in terms of masses.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:19.930
So this was really something.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.420
And this was basically
his PhD thesis.

00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.700
I think it maybe had
more pages than that,

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.910
but this would have
probably been enough,

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.870
this sort of cover page.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.940
This is my PhD thesis.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:34.800
And Einstein said
that he had lifted

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.230
the corner of a great veil
with really just manipulating

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.890
what was known at the time and
rearranging these equations

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.300
and presenting relationships
that people hadn't really

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.990
put together before.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.360
So he ended up
winning a Nobel Prize,

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.410
basically, for his PhD thesis,
which is a fairly rare thing

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.020
to have happen.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.070
But this was really
an incredible time.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.690
OK.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:03.300
So if this is true,
if you have equations

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:07.510
that relate wavelengths
to mass, and particles

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:12.030
have wavelike properties,
how come we don't see this?

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.690
How come this isn't
part-- how come

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:16.530
no one noticed the
particle going by

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.800
and this wavelength
associated with it?

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:25.630
So why don't we observe
this wavelike behavior

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.750
if, in fact, it is
associated with particles?

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.140
So let's think
about this a minute.

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:37.450
And we can consider why,
when you go to Fenway Park--

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:39.630
and you should,
because it's fun--

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.060
and you watch someone
throw a fastball,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:46.770
why you don't see a wave
associated with that fastball.

00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:51.910
So we can consider a fastball
and that the mass of a baseball

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:57.020
is about 5 ounces,
or 0.142 kilograms.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:01.290
And the velocity of a fastball
is around 94 miles per hour,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:04.150
or 42 meters per second.

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:05.920
And so we can do a
little calculation

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.460
and figure out what the
wavelength associated

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:12.610
with that ball should be.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:16.750
So wavelength should be
Planck's constant over the mass

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:19.450
times the velocity of the ball.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:21.490
And we can plug in these values.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.750
And here's Planck's
constant again.

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:27.670
And now you'll note I did
something with the units.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.790
So instead of joule
seconds, I substituted

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:37.260
joules with kilograms meters
squared seconds to the minus 2.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.460
And that's what's
equal to a joule.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.290
And I'm going to do that so
I can cancel out my units.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.190
And again, all of this will be
provided on an equation sheet.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:48.970
You do not need to remember
all of these conversions.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:55.006
And so over the mass of the
baseball and the velocity

00:23:55.006 --> 00:23:56.380
of the baseball--
and we're going

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.560
to put the velocity
in meters per second

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.950
so our units can cancel out.

00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:03.940
And so I'll just
cancel units out.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.680
So we're canceling
our kilograms.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.040
We're canceling
one of the meters,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.420
and canceling all
of the seconds.

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.444
And we have one
meter left, which

00:24:13.444 --> 00:24:15.485
is good, because we're
talking about wavelengths.

00:24:15.485 --> 00:24:18.160
So that's the unit
we should have.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:23.820
And the wavelength is 1.1 times
10 to the minus 34 meters.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:29.710
That is a really small
number times 10 to the 34.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:34.480
And it is, in fact,
undetectably small.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.440
OK.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.760
So now why don't you
try your hand at this,

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.410
and we'll try a
clicker question.

00:25:22.963 --> 00:25:23.950
Yeah, it's very tiny.

00:25:39.061 --> 00:25:39.560
All right.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.588
Let's take just 10 more seconds.

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:51.165
Oh, or five seconds.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:57.940
OK.

00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.880
Awesome.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:02.860
It went away.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.030
That's OK.

00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:07.230
So they're in-- 97%.

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:08.530
I like 97%.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.110
That's a good number.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.150
So again, you want
to think about this

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.760
and just realize the
relationship, the equation,

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:16.690
involved.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:21.660
And so thinking about--
oops, I switched pointers.

00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.470
I like the green better.

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.130
So think about the relationship
between the velocity

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:29.090
of the ball and the wavelength.

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:32.220
And so Wakefield, who
was an knuckleballer,

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.830
is the winner here, with
the longest wavelength.

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:40.120
But still, the number
for this is 1.4 times 10

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.900
to the minus 34.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.730
And so this is still
undetectably small.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:50.020
So of course, no one had
noticed this property before.

00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:53.330
But it still, it still exists.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.260
So when you're talking
about a baseball,

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.530
the wavelength is really
not very, relevant to you,

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:04.130
because it is this incredibly
small, undetectable number.

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:07.000
But if you're talking
about an electron,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.870
it's entirely different.

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.340
So now, if we think about a
gaseous electron traveling

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.750
at 4 times 10 to the 6
meters per second, and so

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.770
that's associated with
an eV of about 54.

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:24.310
So we have this electron
traveling with this velocity.

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.940
And now, if we do
this calculation,

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.360
so if we use Planck's
constant divided

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.670
by the mass of the
electron-- and that's

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:38.470
known, in another great
experiment-- and its velocity,

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:41.230
now we can calculate
out the wavelength.

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:47.090
And it's 2 times 10 to the minus
10, or about two angstroms.

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:51.970
Now, 2 angstroms is
a relevant number,

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.130
when you're talking
about an electron,

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:56.570
because an electron
is in an atom.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:28:01.310
And atoms tend to be-- you have
diameters 0.5 to 4 angstroms.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:04.630
So now the wavelength
is on the same scale

00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:07.750
as the size of the object
you're talking about.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.090
And so when that's true, all
of a sudden, the wavelength--

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:14.650
the wavelike property becomes
super important to thinking

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.760
about this.

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.720
So for an electron
that is a particle,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:24.040
it's really important to think
about its wavelike properties.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:27.580
And so people were saying, OK,
if electrons are waves, then

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:30.370
maybe we should see other
wavelike properties,

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.950
such as diffraction.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:35.290
Diffraction, we talked
about last time,

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:37.210
is an important
wavelike property

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.640
of constructive interference,
destructive interference.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.220
So people looked to
see whether there

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.150
were diffraction-like
properties,

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:46.180
and in fact, there are.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:49.150
So we had observed,
then, the first

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:52.570
was observing
diffraction of electrons

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.190
from a nickel crystal.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:57.790
And then JP Thomson
showed that electrons

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.880
that pass through
gold foil again

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.870
produced a diffraction pattern.

00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:06.470
So again, this was
a wavelike property.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:09.970
So you might think Thomson, that
sounds a little familiar to me.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:12.610
Didn't she just talk
about that last week?

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.980
And yes, here there are
two important Thomsons

00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:15.670
in this story.

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.970
And this is a
father and son team.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:23.710
And so JJ Thomson won
a Nobel Prize in 1906

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.230
for showing that an
electron is a particle.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:28.630
He discovered an electron.

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:34.300
And then in 1937, his son wins
a Nobel Prize for showing-- son

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.190
just had to be like, Dad, I'm
going to show you're wrong.

00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:41.415
An electron is, in fact, a wave.

00:29:41.415 --> 00:29:42.790
But I think they
were both happy.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.730
I think they both got along,
no father-son rivalry.

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:49.060
I think this is one of the
cooler stories in science,

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.330
how this father,
son both had kind

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:55.990
of opposite discoveries, which
both ended up being true,

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:00.190
and really changed the way
we thought about matter.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.300
All right.

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:08.410
So we have light as a
particle and as a wave.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.080
We have matter,
particularly electrons,

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.150
as particles and waves.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.110
And now we are ready
for a way to think

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.880
about how to put this together.

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.750
So before we move on and talk
about the Schrodinger equation,

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:25.687
I just want to take a break
from history for a minute,

00:30:25.687 --> 00:30:27.520
because some of you are
like, OK, well, this

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.400
is really cool for the
father and son team,

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.380
but what about today?

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.740
What's happening today?

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.280
So let's take a break
from history for a second

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.000
and talk about why you should
care about small particles.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.070
Small particles of
special properties,

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:43.929
if they're on the
subatomic scale,

00:30:43.929 --> 00:30:45.220
their properties are different.

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.200
If you have very, very few
atoms, versus many atoms,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.184
the things with very few
atoms have special properties.

00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:53.600
So why should you
care about that?

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.930
Why should you care
about the energies

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.136
that we can get out of
the Schrodinger equation?

00:30:58.136 --> 00:31:00.760
So why should we care about the
Schrodinger equation or quantum

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.780
mechanics?

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.870
So there are many reasons,
but I will share one with you.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.990
And this is a segment
in their own words.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.640
So you're going to hear
from Darcy, who was actually

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.070
a former TA for 5.111.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.190
So she is associated
with this class.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:21.330
She actually just got her
PhD in the spring from MIT,

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.080
and she now works at Google.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:26.940
But in this short,
she's going to tell you

00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:29.130
about research in
Moungi Bawendi's Lab,

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:32.190
and why you should care
about quantum dots, which

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.590
are small collections of atoms.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.440
So I'm going to
try to switch over

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.750
now and hope that
our demo before

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.780
didn't screw up the sound.

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.970
But we'll see what we can do.

00:31:44.970 --> 00:31:51.424
And I think it should be good.

00:31:51.424 --> 00:31:52.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.548
- My name is Darcy Wanger, and
I work as a graduate student

00:31:54.548 --> 00:31:56.630
in the Bawendi Lab at MIT.

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:59.740
I work with quantum
dots in my research.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:03.130
Quantum dots are really,
really tiny particles

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:04.960
of a semiconductor.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:09.850
So we're talking like 4
nanometers in diameter.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.292
In a particle that small, there
are only 10,000 or so atoms,

00:32:14.292 --> 00:32:16.000
which seems like a
lot of atoms if you're

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.500
comparing to
something like water,

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.510
which only has 3 atoms in it.

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:21.910
But if you compare it to
something you can actually

00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:25.180
hold in your hand, which
has a lot of atoms in it,

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.730
10,000 is actually a
pretty small number.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.600
So a particle this small has
really strange properties.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:34.260
Different things start to matter
when you get really small.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.970
And just like an
atom, a quantum dot,

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.930
or semiconductor nanocrystal,
has discrete energy levels.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:44.020
So if an electron is sitting
at this energy level,

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:46.300
and it absorbs
light, an electron

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.730
can get excited to a
higher energy level.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:51.790
And then, when that electron
relaxes back down to the ground

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.190
state, it emits light.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.650
And the energy of
that light is exactly

00:32:56.650 --> 00:32:58.625
the difference between
these two energy levels.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:03.400
The difference between
the energy levels

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:06.460
is related to the
size of the dot.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.530
So in a really
small quantum dot,

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:10.600
the energy levels are far apart.

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.000
So the light it emits
is higher energy,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.060
because there's a large energy
difference between the energy

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.740
levels.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.230
If we use a larger
quantum dot, the distance

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:23.470
between the energy levels is
smaller, so the light it emits

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.680
is lower energy, or redder.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:30.490
People in our lab are working
to make quantum dots bind

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:31.360
to a tumor.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.120
So when a doctor goes
in to remove a tumor,

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.880
they can see the shining
of the UV light on it,

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.380
and see whether
it's all gone when

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:39.640
they've taken out the tumor.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:42.760
They can also use quantum
dots to label other things

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.860
other than tumors, like pH
or oxygen level or antibodies

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.890
or the other drugs that are
treating the cancer tumor.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:52.730
Each of those can
be different colors.

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.550
So if you shine a light
on that whole area,

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:58.270
you can see, oh, that orange
spot, that's some cancer cells.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:02.920
Oh, and that green tells me
that the pH is above 7.4.

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:07.480
So it's pretty cool that we can
use the idea of energy levels

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.460
in something so applicable like
surgery, where it can actually

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:16.510
be used to track things and
make it easy for doctors

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.801
to see what's going on while
they're doing a surgery.

00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:21.060
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:22.570
CATHERINE DRENNAN: OK.

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:25.900
So that's an example
for course 5 research.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:29.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:31.491 --> 00:34:33.199
And you can see all
these credits online.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.500
I will mention that some
of those nice animations

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:41.060
were done by a former graduate
student in the chemistry

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:41.659
department.

00:34:41.659 --> 00:34:44.389
So these videos,
even the art was

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.940
done by chemists,
which is a lot of fun.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:47.719
OK.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:50.659
So let's introduce the
Schrodinger equation.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.139
And we'll spend some
more time on this

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:57.710
as we go along, on Friday.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:03.680
So we needed now--
we had learned a lot

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.420
about wave particle
duality and about

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:10.017
these subatomic particles.

00:35:10.017 --> 00:35:11.600
And we needed a way
to think about it.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.900
We needed a theory to
describe their behavior.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.500
And classical mechanics had
some flaws in with respect.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.610
So we needed a new
kind of mechanism.

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:24.590
We needed quantum mechanics.

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:27.410
So here, if we're
thinking about particles

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.690
that are really
small like electrons,

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.610
we need to consider the
wavelike properties.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.810
It's really important when
you have a wavelength that

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.630
is so similar to the
size of the object

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.130
that you're thinking about.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.110
So the Schrodinger
equation really

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:46.700
became to quantum mechanics
like Newton's equations

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.110
were to classical mechanics.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:50.942
So what is the
Schrodinger equation?

00:35:50.942 --> 00:35:52.400
So here's a picture
of Schrodinger.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.900
And he looks so happy.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.870
I would be happy, too, if I
had come up with this equation,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:57.680
I think.

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.680
So here's the simplest
form of the equation

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.140
that you will probably ever see.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:08.510
And so we'll just define
some of these terms.

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:12.710
So we have wave function, psi.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:16.770
And over here is
the binding energy,

00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.820
and that's the energy of binding
an electron to a nucleus.

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:26.040
And then an H with a hat, we
have our Hamiltonian operator.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.250
And in this course, you will
not be solving this equation.

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.310
We're just going to be talking
about what sorts of things

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.740
came out of this equation.

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:38.700
So I'm going to give
you a little bit longer

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.640
version of the equation now.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.350
And so again, you're
thinking about the electron.

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:48.120
It has these
wavelike properties.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:54.210
And it's somewhere in the atom,
not crashing into the nucleus.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.460
And it needs to be defined
in three dimensions.

00:36:57.460 --> 00:37:00.210
And it has momentum,
so it's moving.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.500
So we need to think about
this as an equation of motion

00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:07.860
in a three-dimensional space.

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:10.630
And the equation
is going to change.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:12.600
The math will change,
depending on where

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.650
the electron is located,
which you won't know exactly.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.480
So this is a very hard problem.

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.500
But it's not totally
without anything

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:24.970
to do with classical mechanics.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.700
And if we write
the longest version

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.570
you'll see, at least in this
course, for the hydrogen atom,

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.970
I just want to show
this to point out

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:37.440
that there are some terms from
classical mechanics in here.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:40.050
This is Coulomb's energy,
also sometimes called

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.500
potential energy.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.440
So we saw Coulomb's
force before.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.060
Here is Coulomb's energy.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:46.710
So some of the
classical mechanics

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.860
is contained within
this, but it expands

00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.990
from classical
mechanics to consider

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:57.190
the wavelike properties
of the electrons.

00:37:57.190 --> 00:38:00.930
So whenever I talk
about this, I always

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:05.310
feel like I want to
have something better

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:10.530
to say about really what this
is doing and where it came from.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.160
In terms of what it's doing,
how is solving this helping you?

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:16.830
What are you learning
from solving this?

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.170
So one thing you're
learning from solving

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.110
this is you're
finding E. And that's

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.702
really important, the
binding energy of the nucleus

00:38:24.702 --> 00:38:25.410
and the electron.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.540
And we saw before
that, if you just

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.510
used simple classical
mechanics, you

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:32.250
have a positive and
negative charge that

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:33.700
are close to each other.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.000
Why don't they come and
crash into each other?

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.360
We want to know how they are
bonded to each other, what's

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.820
the real energy of
that association.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:44.100
We also saw, with the
photoelectric effect,

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.930
that it's not that
easy to get an electron

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:48.750
to eject from a metal surface.

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:50.230
So it's bound in there.

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.920
And what is that
actual binding energy?

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.570
So that comes out of the
Schrodinger equation.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.650
This E here is the
binding energy.

00:38:58.650 --> 00:39:02.100
And also, solving it will tell
you about the wave function

00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.960
or, as chemists
like to talk about,

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:08.010
orbitals, where the electrons
are, in what orbitals.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:10.980
So this is the
information you get out.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:15.390
And importantly, it works.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.790
It matches experiment.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:19.980
So chemists are
experimentalists.

00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:22.890
We love experiments,
and we see this data,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.030
and we want to understand it.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.200
And the Schrodinger equation
helps us understand it.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.650
It correctly predicts binding
energies and wave functions,

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.980
and it explains why the hydrogen
atom is, in fact, stable,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:40.180
where you don't have crashing or
exploding of the hydrogen atom.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:44.040
So where did this equation
come from that works so well?

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.837
How did Schrodinger
come up with this?

00:39:46.837 --> 00:39:49.170
And this is always sort of
the puzzle when I teach this.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.110
I feel like I should have
something profound to say

00:39:52.110 --> 00:39:54.390
about where this came from.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.370
And so I've done a little
reading and looked,

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.980
and I thought the best
explanation for this

00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:02.640
that I ever saw came
from Richard Feynman.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.590
And when he was asked
how Schrodinger came up

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:07.320
with this equation,
he said, "it is not

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:10.650
possible to derive it
from anything you know.

00:40:10.650 --> 00:40:14.220
It came out of the
mind of Schrodinger."

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:18.060
And I thought that
pretty much summed it up.

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.010
So sometimes-- after
class last week,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:22.110
on Wednesday, someone
came down and said,

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.490
you know, the
Thomson experiment,

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:25.531
discovering the electron,
why didn't someone else

00:40:25.531 --> 00:40:26.820
do that experiment?

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:28.590
It seemed like it's
not a cathode ray.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:31.650
And you have to have a
little phosphorous screen.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:33.900
Why didn't someone else
discover the electron?

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.581
And some of these other--
de Broglie rearranged

00:40:36.581 --> 00:40:38.580
some equations, did it
in a way that no one else

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:40.200
was thinking, but still.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.479
Or plot solving the
equation of a straight line.

00:40:43.479 --> 00:40:45.270
No one else was thinking
about it some way,

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:46.800
using other people's data.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:49.470
They just sort of saw things in
data that other people didn't.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:53.160
But you think why didn't
someone else see that, too?

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.960
When it comes to the
Schrodinger equation,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.930
the question is why didn't
someone else or lots of people

00:40:57.930 --> 00:40:58.860
come up with it?

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:01.230
I think the question really
is, how did Schrodinger

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:01.990
come up with it?

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.780
At least, that's
the question to me.

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.770
And I have never really-- that's
the best explanation I have.

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:09.930
It just came out of his mind.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:10.740
OK.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.510
So we're many years later.

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.890
We've had the Schrodinger
equation for a while.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:17.490
So this is an old story, right?

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:20.040
Well, maybe for
the hydrogen atom,

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.480
but this is still actually a
very active area of research.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.490
Oh, my startup disk is full.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:27.960
Thank you.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.160
Let's go back to that.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.966
All right.

00:41:30.966 --> 00:41:32.340
So I just thought--
I always like

00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.250
to give you examples of current
research on these areas.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:38.010
And so I know a
number of you were

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.700
interested in potential of being
chemical engineering majors,

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:42.265
undergrads.

00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:43.890
And I'll tell you
about a new professor

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:46.440
who started about a
year ago, Heather Kulik.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:50.190
And her research group is
really interested in using

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.310
a quantum mechanical
approach to study materials

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.140
and to study proteins.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:56.920
But when you get to
things like proteins,

00:41:56.920 --> 00:41:58.920
there's thousands and
thousands of atoms around.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.520
Forget multiple electrons, we're
talking about multiple atoms

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.580
with multiple electrons,
huge complexes.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:08.970
How can you give a quantum
mechanical analysis

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.492
of things that are so large?

00:42:10.492 --> 00:42:11.700
And this is really important.

00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:15.240
I mean, I think that one of
the big problems moving forward

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.085
is solving the energy
problem and doing it

00:42:17.085 --> 00:42:19.440
in a way that doesn't
destroy our environment, so

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.900
new batteries, new
electrodes, new materials.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.330
We need to understand the
properties of different metals

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:26.585
to understand what will
make those good electrodes.

00:42:26.585 --> 00:42:27.960
And to really
understand them, we

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.700
need a quantum
mechanical approach.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.470
But these are big areas.

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:33.660
There's a lot of things
to consider here.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:36.330
So Heather is
interested in coming up

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.320
with improving algorithms,
improving the computation,

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.010
to really give a quantum
mechanical analysis to systems

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:46.290
that have a lot
of atoms in them.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.360
So if you're interested in
this area, you're not too late.

00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.870
You don't have to go
back to the early 1900s.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:55.620
There's still a lot
to do in this area.

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:56.490
OK.

00:42:56.490 --> 00:43:00.210
So very briefly
now, let's just look

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.250
at the Schrodinger equation
we saw from the hydrogen atom.

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:05.160
So we'll go back
to understanding

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.690
quantum mechanical analysis
of photosynthesis-- amazing,

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:11.060
don't understand how it works.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.090
That would be great if we did.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.131
That would really solve
a lot of energy problems.

00:43:14.131 --> 00:43:17.890
But we'll just go to hydrogen
atom, one electron back.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:20.046
So if you solve the
Schrodinger equation for this--

00:43:20.046 --> 00:43:22.170
and I think I did this in
college, not in freshman,

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:24.990
chemistry, but somewhere
along the line--

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:26.550
you'll come up with this term.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.680
So again, this is
the binding energy.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.530
We just want to know
about how the electron is

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.050
being held by the nucleus.

00:43:34.050 --> 00:43:36.330
And there are some
terms in here.

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:40.350
We have the electrons
mass-- that's known,

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:42.300
the electrons charge.

00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:46.050
We have a permittivity
constant and Planck's constant.

00:43:46.050 --> 00:43:48.570
And if you look at this,
you go, wait a minute.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:49.770
That's a constant.

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:50.670
That's a constant.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:51.570
That's a constant.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:53.100
That's a constant.

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:56.220
We can simplify that.

00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.470
And we will.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:03.210
And that is the Rydberg's
constant, 2.18 times

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:05.620
10 to the minus 18th joules.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:07.710
So now it doesn't
look quite as scary.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:11.670
We can just substitute this RH.

00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:13.646
That makes us feel a lot better.

00:44:13.646 --> 00:44:16.020
It's one number that will be
given on the equation sheet,

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.210
so we don't even
have to remember it.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:22.500
And now we can rewrite this in
terms of the binding energy.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:25.620
So again, the binding
energy, this is a constant.

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:32.450
So now this turns into
minus RH over n squared.

00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:35.430
And n, what is n?

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:41.920
n is a positive integer
1, 2, 3, up to infinity.

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:44.370
And what's its name?

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:46.662
What is n?

00:44:46.662 --> 00:44:48.270
You can you yell it out.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:49.050
Some of you know.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:50.165
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:50.165 --> 00:44:51.165
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yeah.

00:44:51.165 --> 00:44:54.960
The principle quantum
number, that's right.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.420
So the principle
quantum number comes out

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.280
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:01.030
And that's how we
can think about it.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:03.500
And again, here are these ideas.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.140
The binding energies
are quantized.

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:09.120
This is a constant over here.

00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:11.100
So the principle
quantum number comes out

00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:13.020
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:13.530
All right.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:16.800
So now, next time, we're
going to think more

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.600
about the Rydberg constant.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:22.050
And we're going to do a
demonstration next Friday

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.190
of the hydrogen atom spectrum
to show that the Schrodinger

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.090
equation, in fact, can
explain binding energies.

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:34.870
So that's on Friday, and that's
our first clicker competition.

00:45:34.870 --> 00:45:35.610
So come.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.680
Be ready with your clickers.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.870
You can sit in recitations.

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:42.570
You can share answers
before clicking in.

00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:43.980
It's not cheating.

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.190
It's teamwork.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.690
OK.

00:45:45.690 --> 00:45:47.540
See you Friday.

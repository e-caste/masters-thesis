00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.100
MICHAEL SHORT: So
today, I wanted

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.800
to give you some context for
why we're learning about all

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.170
the neutron stuff and go
over all the reactor types

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.810
that, until this year,
the first time you learned

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.940
about the non-light
water reactors at MIT

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.250
was once you left MIT.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.440
I remember that as
an undergrad as well.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.410
The only exposure we had
to non-light water reactors

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.903
is in our design course, because
we decided to design one.

00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:45.570
So I wanted to show you guys all
the different types of reactors

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.730
that are out there,
how they work,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.130
and start generating
and marinating

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.110
in all the different
variables and nomenclature

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
that we'll use to develop the
neutron transport and neutron

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.910
diffusion equations.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.430
The nice part is
now, until quiz two,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.800
you can pretty much forget
about the concept of charge.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.050
So 8.02 can go
back on the shelf,

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.870
because every interaction
we do here is neutral,

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.250
charge neutral.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.650
There'll be radioactive
decays that are not the case.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.793
But everything
neutron is neutral.

00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:14.460
It doesn't mean it's
going to be simple.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.350
It's just going to be different.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.420
But in the meantime,
today is not

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.040
going to be
particularly intense,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.620
but I do want to show
you where we're going.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.260
And this goes with
the pedagogical switch

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.580
that we made in this
department starting this year.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.270
And you guys are the
first trial of this.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.180
We're switching to context
first and theory second.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.190
I personally find it
much more interesting

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.830
to study the theory of
something for which I

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.415
know the application exists.

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:40.290
Who here would agree?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.950
Just about actually everybody.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.520
OK.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.760
Yeah.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.960
That's what I thought too.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.943
So in the end, we had arguments
amongst the faculty about,

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.360
well, you have to
learn the theory

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.960
to understand the application.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.490
And that works really well when
you say it behind the closed

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.780
office door by yourself.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.120
But the fact is, I'm in it for--

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.160
yeah.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.060
I'm in it for maximum
subject matter retention,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.630
so in whatever order
that works the best.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.030
And sounds like, for you
guys, this works the best.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.697
That's what we're doing with the
whole undergrad curriculum, not

00:02:12.697 --> 00:02:14.540
just this class.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.890
So let's launch into all the
different methods of making

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.740
nuclear power, both
fission and fusion,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.500
and to switch gears since
we're dealing with neutrons.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.380
I don't know what happened
with the-- oh, there we go.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.810
The idea here is that
neutrons hit things

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.610
like uranium and
plutonium, the fissile

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.830
isotopes that you
guys saw on the exam,

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.900
and caused the release
of other neutrons.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.450
And as we come up
with these variables,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.400
I'm going to start
laying them out here.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.538
It might take more than
a board to fill them all.

00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.080
And I'll warn you
ahead of time, this

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.180
is the only time in
this course that we're

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.520
going to have V and nu,
the Greek letter nu,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.230
on the board at the same time.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.310
And I'm going to make it
really obvious which one is nu

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.260
and which one is V.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.370
So this parameter that describes
how many neutrons come out

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.560
from each fission reaction
we refer to as nu,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.830
or the average number you'll see
in the data tables as nu bar.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.830
And so as we come up with
these sorts of things,

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.190
I will start going over them.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.460
And the idea here is that each
uranium-235, or plutonium,

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.310
or whatever nucleus begets
two to three neutrons,

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.950
the exact number for which
is still under a hot debate,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.642
and I don't think
it actually matters,

00:03:28.642 --> 00:03:30.850
will make a couple of fission
products that take away

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.030
most of the heat of
the nuclear reaction.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.512
And I just want to stop there,
even though you know there's

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:37.720
going to be a chain reaction.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.200
And that's what makes
nuclear power happen.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.790
And we can go over the timeline
of what actually happens

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:47.182
in fission and what kind of a
nuclear reaction it really is.

00:03:47.182 --> 00:03:48.640
So in this case,
this is a reaction

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.372
where a neutron is
heading towards,

00:03:51.372 --> 00:03:53.080
this time we're actually
going to give it

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.220
a label, a uranium-235 nucleus.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.770
And it very temporarily,
like I showed you yesterday,

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.280
forms a compound
nucleus, some sort

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.660
of large excited nucleus
that lasts for about 10

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.660
to the minus 14 seconds.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.580
So it doesn't
instantly fizz apart.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.950
There's actually a
neutron absorption event,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.910
some sort of nuclear
instability, at which point

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.709
your two fission
products break off.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.800
Notice, you don't have-- let's
call them fission product one

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.320
and fission product two.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.500
Notice, you don't quite
have any neutrons yet.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.010
Neutron production is not
instantaneous for the following

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.290
reason.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.620
If you remember back to nuclear
stability, when we plotted,

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.090
let's say, I think that
was maybe Z and this was N.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.130
And I think this was
a homework problem.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.380
And you had to come up
with some sort of curve

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.960
of best fit for the most
stable combination of NZ

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:57.590
for a nucleus.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.300
It was not a straight line.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.670
It was something on the
order of like N equals--

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.350
what is it?

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:10.840
--1.0055Z plus some constant,
something with a rather small

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.240
slope.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.910
Well, if you have a heavy
nucleus, like uranium-235,

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.670
and you split it apart
evenly, let's just

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.310
pretend it splits
evenly for now,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.830
you're kind of
splitting that nucleus

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.450
along a rather unstable line.

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.530
And, as you saw in the
semi-empirical mass formula,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.260
a little bit of instability
goes a really long way

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.240
towards making the nucleus
extremely unstable.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.280
So let's say you'd make a
couple of fission products

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.920
that just cleaved that nucleus
with the same proportion

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.900
of protons and neutrons.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.100
How would they decay?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.317
Or how can they decay?

00:05:48.317 --> 00:05:49.650
There's a couple different ways.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.236
What do you guys think?

00:05:51.236 --> 00:05:53.150
AUDIENCE: It can emit neutrons.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.650
MICHAEL SHORT: It
can emit neutrons

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.255
if it's really
unstable, at which point

00:05:58.255 --> 00:05:59.880
it would just go down
a neutron number.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.632
Or how else could it decay?

00:06:02.632 --> 00:06:03.980
AUDIENCE: Alpha decay.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Alpha decay.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.220
Let's see, yeah, a
lot of those will--

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.020
the heavier ones tend
to do alpha decay.

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.670
What would it do at alpha decay?

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.457
For alpha, I guess it will be
going that direction, right?

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.040
You know what?

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.498
I'm not going to
rule that out yet.

00:06:16.498 --> 00:06:17.860
So let's go with that.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.147
How else could they decay?

00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:20.570
AUDIENCE: Through beta decay.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:21.310
MICHAEL SHORT:
Through beta decay,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.855
let's say in that direction.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.940
Pretty much all
these happen, just

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.890
not necessarily in this order.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.340
When you have a really,
really asymmetric nucleus,

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.450
a lot of these
fission products will

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.280
emit neutrons almost
instantaneously

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.610
in the realm of like 10
to the minus 17 seconds,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.390
some incredibly short timeline.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:50.188
You will start to decay
downwards a little bit.

00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:51.730
But you're not quite
at the stability

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.980
line, which is why a lot of the
fission products then go on.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:59.020
And they deposit
their kinetic energy

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.480
by bouncing around the
different atoms in material

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.650
creating heat.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.340
But a lot of them will also
send off betas or gammas.

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.880
And it may take 10 to the
minus 13 seconds for them

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:20.150
to whatever the half-life of
that particular isotope is.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.740
And after around, let's say,
10 to the minus 10 to 10

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:27.230
to the minus 6
seconds, depending

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:31.610
on the isotope in the medium,
those two fission products

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.210
will stop.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:37.866
And let's just say
that they stop there.

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:40.030
So the whole process of
fission, it's actually

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.890
quite a compound process.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.940
First, the neutron is absorbed,
forming a compound nucleus.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:47.290
Then it splits apart.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.940
Then those individual
fission products

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.400
undergo whatever
decays suit them best.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.250
And that's the source of
the neutrons in fission.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.960
Sometimes one of
those fission products

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.000
might be particularly unstable.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.100
And it might send
off two neutrons.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.930
In other cases, though
I don't know of one

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:03.850
off the top my head,
it might be none.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.550
But this is the whole
timeline of events in fission

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.460
and the justification for
why this happens straight

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.046
from the first month of 22.01.

00:08:12.046 --> 00:08:14.410
And I wanted to pull up
some of the nuclear data

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.670
so you can see what these values
tend to look like and also

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.520
where to find them.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.430
I'm going to do that
screen cloning thing again.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:27.930
There we go.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.970
So I've already pre-pulled
up the JANIS library.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.950
I've already clicked
on uranium-235.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.708
Thanks to you guys, I have
all the data now on my shirt

00:08:36.708 --> 00:08:38.000
so you can see a little better.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.955
I also have it on the screen.

00:08:39.955 --> 00:08:41.330
So let's look at
this value right

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.172
here, nu bar total,
neutron production.

00:08:45.172 --> 00:08:48.150
And I'll make it bigger
so it's easier to see.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.190
Did I click on the right one?

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:51.300
Yeah.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.330
So take a look at that.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.660
The total number of neutrons
produced during U-235,

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.100
for most energies it's
hovering around the 2.4 or so.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.740
There's been arguments about
whether it's 2.43 or 2.44.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.810
And that's a linear scale.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:09.960
That's not very helpful.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.050
Let's go to a logarithmic scale.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.210
That's more like what
I'm used to seeing.

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:18.860
Most of the fission happens for
U-235 in the thermal region,

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.350
in the region where the neutrons
are at values, let's say,

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.450
the cutoff is usually about
one electron volt or lower

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.820
in average energy.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:30.620
And nu bar is fantastically
constant at that level.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.140
Then as you go up
and up in energy,

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.030
you start to make more
and more neutrons.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:36.905
Why do you guys think
that would be the case?

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.520
What are you doing to
that compound nucleus

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.052
as you increase the
incoming neutron energy?

00:09:48.052 --> 00:09:49.760
AUDIENCE: It's going
to have more energy.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.690
MICHAEL SHORT: It's going
to have more energy itself.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.420
You might excite
other nuclear states

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.460
that can then lead to
other sorts of decays

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.960
or other neutron emission.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.740
So to me, that's the reason
why, once you hit about 1 MeV,

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:05.120
you can start to see a lot
more neutrons being given off.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.850
The reason we usually
treat this as a constant,

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:10.510
notice I haven't given
it an energy dependence,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.680
is because most of the
fission that happens

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.480
is at thermal energies.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.896
For that, I want to show you
the fission cross section.

00:10:18.896 --> 00:10:22.125
There are a lot
of cross sections.

00:10:22.125 --> 00:10:24.250
And it's probably going to
be on a different graph,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.013
because it's in different units.

00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:27.430
And this gives you
a rough measure

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:29.710
per atom, what's the
probability of fission

00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:33.010
happening as a function of
incoming neutron energy?

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:37.060
At those high energies, you have
relatively low cross sections,

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.520
or low probabilities,
of fission happening.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:41.560
Then there's this crazy
resonance region that

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.780
looks like a sideways mustache.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:46.540
But then as you get down
to the lower energy levels,

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.150
it gets much more, in
fact, exponentially more,

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.800
likely that fission will happen.

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.380
So almost all the fissioning
in a light water reactor,

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:55.330
or any sort of other
thermal reactor,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.010
happens at thermal energies.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.870
And that's why we take
nu bar as a constant.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.110
You don't have to,
especially if you're

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:04.255
analyzing what's
called a fast reactor

00:11:04.255 --> 00:11:07.780
or a reactor whose neutron
population remains fast

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:09.093
on purpose.

00:11:09.093 --> 00:11:10.510
And so with that,
I want to launch

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:14.976
into some of the different types
of reactors that you might see.

00:11:14.976 --> 00:11:17.420
And you guys already
did those calculations

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:21.670
in problem set one, so I don't
have to repeat them for you.

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.290
Let's get right
into the acronyms.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.440
So if you haven't
figured this out already,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.310
nuclear is a pretty
acronym dense field.

00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:34.125
Can anyone say they know all
the acronyms on this slide?

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:37.230
You're going to know about 90%
of them in about 90 minutes.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.370
So it's OK.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.720
Or you'll have
seen them at least.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.772
Any look completely unfamiliar?

00:11:44.772 --> 00:11:45.730
AUDIENCE: Most of them.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.380
MICHAEL SHORT: Most of them?

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:47.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.895
Well, let's knock them off.

00:11:48.895 --> 00:11:50.520
So [INAUDIBLE],, last
Thursday, already

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.670
showed you the basic layout
of a boiling water reactor,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:56.010
one of the types of
light water reactors.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:58.440
And the reason that this
is a thermal reactor

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.180
is because it's full of water.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:03.480
Water, as we saw in our
old q equation argument,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.120
is very good at
stopping neutrons,

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.130
because, if you
guys remember this,

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:12.480
the maximum change in energy
that a neutron can get

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.750
is related to alpha times
its incoming energy.

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:24.250
Or this alpha is just A minus
1 over A plus 1 squared.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:29.050
And I think this would actually
be a 1 minus right there.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.580
A is that mass
number of whatever

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:34.230
the neutrons are hitting.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:37.140
And that one comes directly
from the neutron mass number.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.270
If you remember, this was
the simplest reduction

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.090
of the q equation,
the generalized q

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.377
equation for kinematics
that we looked at.

00:12:50.377 --> 00:12:51.960
When I said let's
do the general form,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.850
then OK, let's take
the simplest form,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:55.560
neutron elastic scattering.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.480
Here's where it comes back.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.650
If a neutron hits water, which
is made mostly of hydrogen,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:07.230
and A is 1, then it can transfer
a maximum of all of its energy,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.477
let's say, to that
hydrogen atom, therefore,

00:13:09.477 --> 00:13:12.060
giving the neutron no energy and
thermalizing it or slowing it

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.940
down very quickly.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:17.580
To show you what one of these
things actually looks like,

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.818
that's the underside of a BWR.

00:13:19.818 --> 00:13:21.360
Did [INAUDIBLE] show
you this before?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.860
OK.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.022
So you've already seen what
this generally looks like.

00:13:25.022 --> 00:13:25.980
What about the turbine?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.640
Has anyone actually seen a
turbine this size close up,

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:31.990
a gigawatt electric turbine?

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:34.350
I'm trying to see which one
of those pixels is a person.

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.250
I don't see anything
person-sized.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:43.910
There's a ladder that looks
to be about 6 feet tall,

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.500
so to give you guys a sense of
scale of the sort of turbines

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.530
that we say, oh, yeah, we
draw a turbine on our diagram.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.380
Well, it's not
actually that simple .

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.210
These things take
up entire hallways,

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.100
or kind of airport
hangar sized buildings.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:59.980
I've never seen one in the US,
but I've seen one in Japan.

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.450
It was a lot cleaner than this.

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.900
But, otherwise, it looked
pretty much the same.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.650
And the way this
actually works, for those

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.650
who haven't taken any
thermo classes yet,

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:12.850
is this turbine is full of
different sets of blades that

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:15.520
are curved at an angle so
that when steam shoots in,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:19.030
it transfers some of its energy
to get the turbine rotating.

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.640
And there's going to
be a generator, kind

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:24.770
of like an alternator, to
generate the electricity there,

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:27.940
which looks to be
roughly 100 feet away.

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:30.900
Just to give you a sense
of scale for this stuff.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.207
As [INAUDIBLE] showed you,
a pressurized water reactor

00:14:33.207 --> 00:14:35.290
is another kind of light
water reactor with what's

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.120
called an indirect cycle.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:39.190
So this water stays pressurized.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:42.700
It also stays liquid, which
is good for neutron moderation

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.170
or slowing down.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.520
Because in addition to the
probability of any interaction,

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.790
some probability sigma, if you
want to get the total reaction

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:56.310
probability, you have to
multiply by its number density

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:58.800
to get a macroscopic
cross section.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.630
This is why I introduce
this stuff way

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.310
at the beginning
of class, so you'd

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.640
have time to marinate in it and
then bring it back and remember

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.420
what it was all about.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:09.270
And so every single
reaction that

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:14.610
goes on in a nuclear reactor
has got its own cross section.

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:19.400
We'll probably need half
the board for this one.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:25.740
You can say you have a total
microscopic cross section.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.070
These are all going to be as
a function of neutron energy.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:31.740
What's the probability of
anything happening at all?

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:36.300
And these are actually tabulated
up on the JANIS website.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.930
So let's unclick that, get
rid of neutron production,

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:44.260
and go all the way to
the top, n comma total.

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.020
So all this stuff is written
in nuclear reaction parlance,

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.500
where if you have, let's
say, n comma total, that

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.320
means a neutron comes in, and
that's the reaction that you're

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:57.530
looking at.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:01.160
So this data file here,
once I open it up,

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.560
will give you the probability
that anything at all

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.790
will happen.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.920
You can see as the neutron
energy gets higher,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:11.070
the probability of
anything happening at all

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.900
gets less, and less, and less.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.750
And it follows the shape of most
of the other cross sections.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.910
And I'm going to leave
this up right there.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.150
You've also got a few
different kinds of reactions.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:24.710
You can have a scatter.

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:29.060
Let's call that scatter,
which we've already said

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.520
can either be
elastic or inelastic.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.830
It may not matter
to us from the point

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.610
of view of neutron physics
whether the collision

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.770
is elastic or inelastic.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.720
All that matters is
the neutron goes in,

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.760
and a slower neutron comes out.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:53.460
Because what we're really
concerned with here

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:57.330
is tracking the full
population of neutrons

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.760
at any point in the reactor.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.470
So we'll give this
a position vector

00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:07.380
r, which has just
got x, y, and z in it

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.710
or whatever other coordinate
system you might happen to use.

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:13.710
I prefer Cartesian,
because it makes sense.

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.800
At every energy going
in any direction,

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.700
so we now have a
solid angled vector

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.187
that's got both theta and
phi in it any given time.

00:17:26.187 --> 00:17:28.520
And the whole goal of what
we're going to be doing today

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.410
and all of next
week is to find out,

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.110
how do you solve
for and simplify

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.610
this population of neutrons?

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.970
Make sure to fill
that in as velocity.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.370
Let's see.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.300
Let me get back to the
cross sections and stuff.

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:57.400
If we want to know
how many neutrons

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.940
are in a certain little volume
element, in some d volume,

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.330
in some certain little
increment of energy, dE,

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:11.250
traveling in some very
small, solid angle,

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.170
d omega, supposedly, if
you have this function,

00:18:14.170 --> 00:18:16.810
then you know the
direction, and location,

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.280
and speed of every
single neutron

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.110
everywhere in the reactor.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.460
And this is eventually what
the goal of things like Ben

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.820
and Kord's group does, the
Computational Reactor Physics

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.287
Group, is solve for this or
a simplified version of it,

00:18:28.287 --> 00:18:30.370
over, and over, and over
again for different sorts

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.780
of geometries.

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:36.100
And in order to do so, you need
to know the rates of reactions

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.960
of every kind of
possible reaction

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.995
that could take a neutron
out of its current position,

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:43.120
like if it happens to be
moving, which most of them

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.390
are, out of its
current energy group.

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:49.420
Which pretty much any reaction
will cause the neutron

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:50.920
to lose energy.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:52.570
What's the only
reaction we've talked

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.210
about where the neutron
loses absolutely no energy?

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:02.567
It's a type of scattering.

00:19:02.567 --> 00:19:04.030
AUDIENCE: Forward scattering?

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.660
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
exactly, forward scattering.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:08.790
So for forward
scattering for that case

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.730
where theta scattering equals 0.

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.243
Again, you missed.

00:19:15.243 --> 00:19:17.410
The neutron didn't actually
change direction at all.

00:19:17.410 --> 00:19:19.940
And, therefore, it didn't
transfer any energy.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.350
But for everything else, for
every other possible reaction,

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.990
there's going to be an energy
change associated with it

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.960
and probably some
corresponding change in angle,

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.970
because a neutron can't
just be moving, and hit

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:34.210
something, and continue
moving more slowly.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:38.050
There's got to be some change
in momentum to balance along

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:40.020
with that change of energy.

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.840
And it might slightly move
in some different direction.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.780
And all this is happening
as a function of time.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.417
As you can see, this gets
pretty hairy pretty quick.

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:50.250
That's why we put the
full equation for this

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.877
on our department t-shirts.

00:19:51.877 --> 00:19:53.460
But no one ever
solves the full thing.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.050
What we're going to
be going over is,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.610
how do you simplify
it into something

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.340
you can solve with a pen
and paper or possibly

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:00.930
a gigantic computer?

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.670
But it's not impossible.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:05.890
So inside this sigma
total, we talked

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.570
about different scattering.

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:15.310
And then you could
have absorption in

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:17.860
all its different forms.

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.330
What sort of reactions
with a neutron

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:21.580
would cause it to be absorbed?

00:20:27.036 --> 00:20:27.980
AUDIENCE: Fission.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.580
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, fission.

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.130
Thank you.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.370
So there's going to be some
sigma fission cross section

00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:35.450
as a function of energy.

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:42.260
And if it doesn't fizz,
but it is absorbed,

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.260
we'll call that capture.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.750
But capture can mean a whole
bunch of different things

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:52.505
too, right?

00:20:52.505 --> 00:20:53.880
There could be
also a whole bunch

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:56.280
of other nuclear reactions.

00:20:56.280 --> 00:21:00.940
There could be a reaction
where one neutron comes in,

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:05.500
two neutrons go out, like
we looked at with beryllium

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.930
in the Chadwick paper
from the first day

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:13.260
or like what actually
does exist for this stuff.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.790
So JANIS doesn't
like multi-touch,

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.870
so you have to bear with me on
the small print on the screen.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.715
But there should
be-- yep, here it is.

00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:25.480
Cross section number 16,
there is a probability

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.980
that one neutron goes in.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:31.060
That z right there is whatever
your incoming particle

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:31.870
happens to be.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:34.180
And in this case, we know
it's a neutron, because we

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.940
picked incident neutron data.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.920
And 2n means two
neutrons come out.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.090
Let's plot that cross section.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.890
You can see that the value is
0 until you hit about 4 or 5.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:52.290
Oh, it's actually 5.297781 MeV.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.960
So that's the q value at
which this particular reaction

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.130
happens to turn on.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:22:00.370
Might be responsible for
a little bit of the blip

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:02.200
in the total cross section.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.185
So technically, if we were
to turn on every single cross

00:22:05.185 --> 00:22:09.580
section in this database, it
should add up to that red line

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.260
right there.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.500
So you can start to get an
idea for how much of all

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.770
the reactions of uranium-235
are due to fission.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.550
That's the one we
want to exploit.

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:24.690
So let's find fission,
right down there.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:26.420
Oh, wow, there's a 3n reaction.

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:28.670
I want to see that.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:32.240
That doesn't happen
until 12 MeV.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:32.940
Yeah.

00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:35.700
So neutrons don't
typically tend to hit

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.880
12 MeV in a fission reactor.

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.400
So this is a perfect
flimsy pretext

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.470
to bring in another variable.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:48.140
It's called the chi spectrum or
what's called the fission birth

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:48.640
spectrum.

00:22:54.702 --> 00:22:55.202
Yeah.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:01.490
We've already talked about
the neutrons being born

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:02.990
and how many there were.

00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:06.410
But we didn't say at
what energy they're born.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:11.590
In fusion reactors,
this is pretty simple.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.040
You've already
looked at this case.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.540
What is it?

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:16.790
14.7 MeV.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:18.500
That's a lot simpler.

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.810
That's the fusion.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.820
For fission, it's not so simple.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.450
For the case of fission, if
you draw energy versus this chi

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:35.890
spectrum, it takes an
interesting looking curve

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:42.590
from about 1 MeV to about 10
MeV with the most likely energy

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.930
being around 2 MeV.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.050
So you aren't really
going to get neutrons

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:52.040
at the energy required for a 3n
reaction in a regular fission

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.790
reactor, just not
going to happen.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.140
But it's good that you
know that that exists.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.310
So let's go and answer
my original question.

00:23:59.310 --> 00:24:01.850
How much of the total cross
section is due to fission?

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:10.850
Most of it, especially
at low energies.

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:12.890
So let me get rid of
those 2n and 3n ones,

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:16.110
because they're kind
of ruining our data.

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:17.500
It's making it harder to see.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:25.730
That's better.

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:30.860
So you can see at energies below
around, let's say, a keV or so,

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.650
almost all of the reactions
happening with neutrons

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.720
in uranium-235 are fission.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.970
This is part of what makes
it such a particularly good

00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:39.980
isotope to use in reactors.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.560
The other one is, you can
find it in the ground,

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.440
unlike most of the other
fissile isotopes, unlike,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.020
I think, any of the
other fissile isotopes.

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:52.450
Thorium you got to breed and
turn it into uranium-233.

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.002
I'll have to think
about that one.

00:24:55.002 --> 00:24:56.460
But then you start
to look at, what

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.190
are the other components
of this cross section,

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.600
like zn prime, inelastic
scattering, which

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:09.600
doesn't turn on until
about 0.002 MeV,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.180
but later on is one of
the major contributors

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.810
and actually is
responsible for--

00:25:13.810 --> 00:25:15.750
wait, I've brought
this for a reason.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.855
--is responsible for that
little bump in the total cross

00:25:18.855 --> 00:25:19.710
section.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.740
So eventually all
these things do matter.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.520
But let's think about which
ones we actually care about

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.080
at all, because what we
eventually want to do

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.850
is develop some sort of
neutron balance equation.

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.310
If we can measure the change
in the number of neutrons

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:45.140
as a function of position,
energy, angle, and time,

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.720
as a function of time,
and that would probably

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.780
be a partial derivative, because
there are like seven variables

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.550
here.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.270
Before I write any
equations, it's

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:56.645
just going to be a measure of
the gains minus the losses.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:02.840
And while every particular
reaction has its own cross

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:06.610
section, there's only going to
be a few that we care about.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.210
There will only be
one or two types

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.360
of reactions that can result
in a gain of the neutron

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:15.720
population into a certain
volume with a certain energy

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.460
with a certain angle.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:22.140
And for losses, there's only
one we really care about, total,

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.480
because any interaction
with a neutron

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.240
is going to cause
that neutron to leave

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.797
this little group of perfect
position, energy, and angle.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.670
So that's where we're going.

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.520
We'll probably start down
that route on Tuesday,

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.790
because I promised you
guys context today.

00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.660
You've all been to the
MIT Research Reactor.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.110
A couple of you-- are
you running it yet?

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:50.752
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:50.752 --> 00:26:51.710
MICHAEL SHORT: Awesome.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.590
OK.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:54.110
Yeah.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.810
Yeah, so Sarah and
Jared are doing that.

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:58.490
Anyone else training or trained?

00:26:58.490 --> 00:26:59.860
No.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.640
I'd say folks are usually
pretty scared when they find out

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.670
MIT has a reactor.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:04.750
And they're even
more scared when

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.000
they find out you guys run it.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:08.253
MICHAEL SHORT: What
they don't realize

00:27:08.253 --> 00:27:10.965
is there's been basically
no problems since 1954.

00:27:10.965 --> 00:27:12.340
The only one I
know of is someone

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.350
fell asleep at the
controls once and forgot

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.480
to push the Don't
Call Fox News button,

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.020
and it called Fox
News or something.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.000
So there was a big story
about, asleep at the helm,

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.110
ignoring all of the alarms,
and passive safety systems,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.010
and backup operators,
and everything else

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.550
that actually made sure
that nothing happened.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:32.137
But nowadays, correct
me if I'm wrong,

00:27:32.137 --> 00:27:33.970
you actually have to
get up every half hour,

00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:35.920
reach around a panel,
and hit a button, right?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.490
AUDIENCE: No.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.900
It's on console,
but it beeps at you.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's pretty tiring.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:45.290
MICHAEL SHORT: So you want to
hit it before it beeps at you.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:47.650
AUDIENCE: It's reminding
you to take hourly logs.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:48.400
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.108
AUDIENCE: It does go
off every half hour.

00:27:50.108 --> 00:27:52.893
AUDIENCE: It is half hour, but
you we don't do [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:52.893 --> 00:27:54.060
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, OK, yeah.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.040
I'd heard the button's
every half hour.

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.090
Gotcha.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:27:58.990
Cool.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:02.110
Yeah, so for all of you watching
on camera or whatever, just

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.150
know that these guys
got it under control.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.400
So onto some gas cooled
reactors and to explain

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.780
some of these acronyms.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.133
There are some that use natural
uranium, though pretty much all

00:28:13.133 --> 00:28:14.550
the ones in this
country, you need

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:16.590
to enrich the
uranium to get enough

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.350
U-235 to turn the reaction on.

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.890
But you don't have to
do that in every case.

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:26.550
And you'll also see these
acronyms, LEU, MEU, or HEU,

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:30.420
standing for Low, Medium,
or High Enrichment.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.240
The accepted standard for
what's low enriched uranium

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:35.780
is 20% or below.

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:37.470
An interesting fact,
though, you can't

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:42.930
have something at
19.99% enriched uranium

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:45.245
and expect it to be
low enriched uranium,

00:28:45.245 --> 00:28:47.370
because every measurement
technique has some error.

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.787
And what really
determines if it's

00:28:48.787 --> 00:28:51.870
LEU is when an inspector
comes and takes a sample,

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.620
it better be below 20%
including their error.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:29:00.570
So you'll usually see 19.75%
given as the LEU limit,

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:02.850
because there's always
some processing error,

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.160
inhomogeneities,
measurement error.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:07.950
Hedge your bets, pretty much.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.770
Like in England or the UK,
the advanced gas reactors

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.110
have been churning
along for decades.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.090
They actually use
CO2 as the coolant,

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.000
which is relatively inert.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.240
And they use graphite
as the moderator.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.740
So in this case, the coolant
and the moderator are separate,

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.230
unlike the light water
reactors we have.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:28.920
So this way, the graphite, right
here, just sits in solid form

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.890
and slows down the neutrons,
not quite as good as water,

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:33.210
but pretty good.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:38.100
There is an issue, though, that
CO2, just like anything, has

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:44.410
a natural decomposition
reaction, where CO2 naturally

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:49.390
is in equilibrium
with CO and O2.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:55.090
And O2 plus graphite
yields CO2 gas.

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:57.647
Graphite was solid.

00:29:57.647 --> 00:29:59.980
In talking with a couple folks
from the National Nuclear

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.470
Laboratory, they said
that 40 years later, when

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.110
they took the caps
off these reactors,

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:10.410
a lot of that graphite was just
gone with a good explanation.

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:15.360
It vaporized very, very, very
slowly over 40 years or so due

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.650
to this natural recombination
with whatever little bit of O2

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.820
is in equilibrium with CO2
and possibly some other leaks.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.320
I'm sure I wouldn't have been
told that if there was a leak.

00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:27.510
So I'd say the
feasibility is high,

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:30.300
because they've been running
for almost half a century.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.722
The power density is very low.

00:30:32.722 --> 00:30:34.305
Why do you guys think
that's the case?

00:30:37.548 --> 00:30:38.534
Yeah.

00:30:38.534 --> 00:30:43.464
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:43.464 --> 00:30:44.450
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hm.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:47.057
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:47.057 --> 00:30:48.140
MICHAEL SHORT: Absolutely.

00:30:48.140 --> 00:30:50.920
So well, let's say, you need
the same cooling capacity,

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:51.870
but you're right.

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:55.230
CO2, even if pressurized, is not
as good a heat transfer medium

00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.730
as water.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.200
Water is dense.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.700
It's also got one of the highest
heat capacities of anything

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.050
we've ever seen.

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:04.020
The other reason is right here.

00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:05.655
If you want enough
reaction density,

00:31:05.655 --> 00:31:09.240
then it not only matters
what the per atom density is,

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.150
but what the number density is.

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.490
And if you're using
gaseous CO2 coolant,

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.310
even if it's pressurized,
there are fewer reactions

00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.440
happening per unit
volume, because there

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:23.880
are few CO2 molecules per unit
volume than water would have.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.060
So that's why we pressurize
our light water reactors,

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.560
to keep water in
its liquid state

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.440
where it's a great heat
absorber, takes a lot of energy

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.180
to boil it, and
it's really dense

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.524
so it's a very effective
dense moderator.

00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:38.925
These have been around forever.

00:31:38.925 --> 00:31:39.540
Let me think.

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:42.000
When did Windscale happen?

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.870
Windscale was also the
source of an interesting fire

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.560
that you guys might
want to know about.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.010
It's one of those
only nuclear disasters

00:31:50.010 --> 00:31:53.190
that hit 7 on the
arbitrary unit scale.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.010
I don't quite know how they
determine what's a seven.

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:58.380
But there was a fire
at the Windscale plant

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:01.750
due to the build up of
what's called Wigner energy.

00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:04.380
It turns out that when
neutrons go slamming around

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.580
in the graphite, they leave
behind radiation damage.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.340
And when my family always
asks me to explain,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.540
what do you do for a living?

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:15.780
And I can only think, well, they
don't know radiation damage.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.340
They've watched Harry Potter.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:20.760
I'd like to say, radiation,
like dark magic, leaves traces.

00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.380
Well, it leaves
traces in the graphite

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:27.150
in the form of atomic defects,
which took energy to create.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:29.820
So by causing damage
to the graphite,

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:32.850
you store energy in it, which
is known as Wigner energy.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:35.730
And you can store so
much that it just catches

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.770
fire and explodes sometimes.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.080
That's what happened
here at Windscale.

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.397
11 tons of uranium
ended up burning,

00:32:42.397 --> 00:32:44.730
because all of a sudden, the
temperature in the graphite

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:47.280
just started going up
for no reason, no reason

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.842
that they understood
at the time.

00:32:48.842 --> 00:32:51.300
It turns out that they had
built up enough radiation damage

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.480
energy that it started
releasing more heat.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.240
And releasing more heat
caused more of that energy

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.240
to be released, and it
was self-perpetuating

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.930
until it just caught fire and
burned 11 tons of uranium out

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:04.810
in the countryside.

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.900
This was 1957.

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:12.900
So again, a 7 on the scale with
no units of nuclear disasters.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:15.090
Argue it's probably not
as bad as Chernobyl,

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:19.900
so they might want a little bit
of resolution in that scale.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.840
There's another type of gas cool
reactor called the Pebble Bed

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.720
Modular Reactor, a much more
up and coming one, where

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:28.570
each fuel element-- you
don't have fuel rods.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:30.370
You've actually
got little pebbles

00:33:30.370 --> 00:33:32.570
full of tiny kernels of fuel.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.630
So you've got a built-in
graphite moderator

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.110
tennis ball sized thing with
lots of little grains of sand

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.920
of UO2 cooled by
a bed of flowing

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.050
helium or something like that.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:46.420
And then that helium,
or the other gas,

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.660
transfers heat to water,
which goes in to make steam

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:53.514
and goes into the turbine
like I showed you before.

00:33:53.514 --> 00:33:55.940
So this is what the fuel
actually looks like.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.190
Inside each one of
these tennis ball

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:00.650
spheres of mostly
graphite, there's

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:02.870
these little kernels
of uranium dioxide

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.540
about a half a
millimeter across covered

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.420
in layers of silicon
carbide, a really strong

00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.920
and dense material that keeps
the fission products in,

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.790
because the biggest
danger from nuclear fuel

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.510
is the highly radioactive
fission products that

00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:20.429
due to their instability
are giving off

00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:24.060
all sorts of awful, for
anywhere from milliseconds

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.747
to mega years, after
reactor operation.

00:34:27.747 --> 00:34:29.580
And so if you keep those
out of the coolant,

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:32.489
then the coolant stays
relatively nonradioactive.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:36.962
And it's safe to do things
like maintain the plant.

00:34:36.962 --> 00:34:38.920
Then there's the very
high temperature reactor,

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.500
the ultimate in
acronym creativity.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.850
It operates at a very
high temperature,

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:46.150
which has been
steadily decreasing

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:50.440
over time, as reality has
caught up to expectations.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.630
When I first got into this
field, they were saying,

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.272
we're going to run
this at 1100 Celsius.

00:34:55.272 --> 00:34:56.980
Then I started studying
material science.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:00.250
And I was like, yeah, nothing
wants to be 1100 Celsius.

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:02.650
By that time, they
downgraded it to 1000.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:06.040
Now they've asymptoted
it at around 800 or 850

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:10.570
due to some actual problems
in operating things in helium.

00:35:10.570 --> 00:35:13.070
It's not the helium itself, but
the impurities in the helium

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:14.915
that could really mess you up.

00:35:14.915 --> 00:35:16.290
And the sorts of
alloys that they

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.890
need to get this working,
these nickel superalloys,

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.440
like Alloy 230,
they can slightly

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.510
carburize or
decarburize depending

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:26.760
on the amount of carbon
in the helium coolant.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.230
Either way you go, you lose
the strength that you need.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.100
So I'll say feasibility
is low to medium,

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:37.122
because, well, we haven't
really seen one of these yet.

00:35:37.122 --> 00:35:38.455
Then onto water cooled reactors.

00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:40.240
Has anyone here
heard of the reactors

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.340
they have in Canada,
the CANDU reactors?

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.740
That's my favorite acronym.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:46.760
I hope that was intentional.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.260
It what?

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:48.220
AUDIENCE: It's convenient.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.053
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:35:49.053 --> 00:35:51.100
[LAUGHS] It's not like the--

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:54.100
well, they're not sorry
about anything, but whatever.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.800
At any rate, one of the
nice features about this

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.640
is you can actually use natural
uranium, because the moderator

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.063
is heavy water.

00:36:02.063 --> 00:36:04.480
You have to look into what the
sort of cross sections are.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:09.490
Even though deuterium
won't slow down neutrons

00:36:09.490 --> 00:36:12.220
as much as hydrogen will--
where did my alpha thing-- oh,

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.850
it was right here all along.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:17.070
Even though A is 2 instead
of 1 for deuterium,

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.990
it's absorption cross section,
or specifically-- yeah,

00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:21.320
because it doesn't fission.

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:26.257
Its absorption cross section is
way lower than that of water.

00:36:26.257 --> 00:36:28.090
It actually functions
as a better moderator,

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:31.570
because fewer of those
collisions are absorption.

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.150
And because you have a better
neutron population and less

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.880
absorption, you don't need
to enrich your uranium.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.770
You also don't need to
pressurize your moderator.

00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:43.000
So you can flow some other
coolant through these pressure

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.810
tubes and just have a big tank
of close to something room

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:50.460
temperature unpressurized
D2O as your moderator.

00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.300
The problem with that
is D2O is expensive.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:59.415
Anyone priced out
deuterium oxide before?

00:36:59.415 --> 00:37:01.040
Probably have at the
reactor, because I

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:03.619
know you have drums of it.

00:37:03.619 --> 00:37:07.323
AUDIENCE: It's like a couple
thousand per kilogram.

00:37:07.323 --> 00:37:08.990
MICHAEL SHORT: A
couple thousand a kilo,

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.910
it's an expensive
bottle of water.

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:14.260
It'll also mess you up if you
drink it, because a lot of it,

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.150
even if it's crystal
clear, filtered

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.690
D2O, a lot of what the
cellular machinery depends

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.350
on the diffusion coefficients
of various things in water,

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:25.540
those solutes in water.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.820
And if you change the
mass of the water,

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.320
then the diffusion coefficients
of the water itself,

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.400
as well as the things
in it, will change.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.200
And if you depend on, let's
say, exact sodium and potassium

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.330
concentrations for your
nerves to function,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:39.310
a little change in
that can go a long way

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:42.170
towards giving you a bad day.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:44.030
And actually, we have
a little piece of one

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:47.100
of these pressure tubes upstairs
if anyone wants to take a look.

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:49.100
There's all these
sealed fuel bundles

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.770
inside what they call
a calandria tube,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:54.590
just a pressurized
tube that's horizontal.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.390
The problem with
some of these is

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.730
if these spacers get
knocked out of place, which

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.650
they do all the
time, those tubes

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.050
can start to creep
downward and get

00:38:03.050 --> 00:38:06.830
a little harder to cool or touch
the sides and change thermal.

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.240
And now I'm getting
into material science.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.320
It's a mess.

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:16.000
Then there's the old RBMK, the
reactor that caused Chernobyl.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.230
You can also use natural uranium
or low enriched uranium here.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:22.660
The problem though that
led to Chernobyl-- one

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:25.450
of the many problems that
led to Chernobyl was,

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:27.380
you've got all this
moderator right here.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:30.340
So if you lose your coolant,
let's say you had a light water

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:33.580
reactor and your coolant goes
away, your moderator also

00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.140
goes away, which means your
neutrons don't slow down

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:39.190
anymore.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.680
That one reaction is messing up.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.580
There we go.

00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:45.140
Which means your neutrons
don't slow down anymore,

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.140
which means the probability
of fission happening

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:50.320
could be like
10,000 times lower.

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.858
So losing coolant in
a light water reactor,

00:38:52.858 --> 00:38:54.650
temperature might go
up, but it's not going

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:56.690
to give you a nuclear bad day.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:00.340
In the RBMK reactor,
it will and it did.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.860
And in addition,
the control rods,

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.950
which were supposed to shut down
the reaction, made of things

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.590
like boron 4 carbide,
or hafnium, or something

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:12.390
with a really high
capture cross section

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:15.150
were tipped with graphite
to help them ease in.

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.760
So you've got
moderator tipped rods,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:20.490
which induce additional
moderation, which

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.790
helps slow down the
neutrons even more to where

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.087
they fission even better.

00:39:25.087 --> 00:39:27.420
And that's what led to what's
called a positive feedback

00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.560
coefficient.

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.670
So the more you tried to
insert the control rods

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.212
and the more you
tried to fix things,

00:39:32.212 --> 00:39:34.680
the worse things got
in the nuclear sense.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.320
And in something like
a quarter of a second,

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.470
the reactor power went
up by like 35,000 times.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.350
And we'll do a millisecond by
millisecond rundown of what

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:46.467
happened in Chernobyl after
we do all this neutron

00:39:46.467 --> 00:39:48.300
physics stuff when
you'll be better equipped

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.050
to understand it.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.620
But suffice to say, there were
some positive coefficients here

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.890
that are to be avoided at all
costs in all nuclear reactor

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:58.410
design.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.480
In the actual reactor
hall you can go and stand

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.560
on one of these things.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:04.020
It's a very different design
from what you're used to.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.687
I don't think anyone
would let you stand

00:40:05.687 --> 00:40:06.912
on top of a pressure vessel.

00:40:06.912 --> 00:40:09.120
First, your shoes would
melt, because they're usually

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:11.418
at like 300 Celsius or so.

00:40:11.418 --> 00:40:13.710
And second of all, you'd
probably get a little too much

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.790
radiation.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.190
But this is actually
what an RBMK reactor

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:21.200
hall looks like for one of
the units that didn't blow up.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.970
There were multiple
units at that site.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:26.370
Then there's the
supercritical water reactor.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.830
Let's say you want to run
at higher temperatures

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:31.200
than regular water
will allow you to.

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.290
You can pressurize
it so much that water

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:37.800
goes beyond the supercritical
point in the phase sense

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:41.700
and starts to behave not
like liquid, not like a gas,

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.400
but somewhere in between,
something that's really, really

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.610
dense, so getting towards
the density of water, not

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.130
quite, which means it's
still a great moderator,

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:52.410
but still can cool the
materials quite well

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:56.130
to extract heat to make
power and so on and so on.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:56.810
Yeah.

00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.260
AUDIENCE: So supercritical
refers to the coolant

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.720
not the neutrons?

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Good question.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.030
For a supercritical
water reactor,

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.780
it most definitely
refers to the coolant.

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.295
It's the phase of
the coolant where

00:41:09.295 --> 00:41:13.270
it's beyond the liquid
gas separation line,

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.220
and it's just
something in between.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.920
Any of these reactors
can go supercritical,

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.680
where you're producing more
neutrons than you're consuming.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.110
And that is a nuclear bad day.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:24.760
But the supercritical
water reactor

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:28.480
does not refer to neutron
population, just a coolant.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.797
Good question.

00:41:29.797 --> 00:41:30.880
It's never come up before.

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.630
But it's like, should
have thought of that.

00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:37.360
And so then my favorite,
liquid metal reactors,

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:40.750
like LBE, or
Lead-Bismuth Eutectic.

00:41:40.750 --> 00:41:44.080
It's a low melting point
alloy of lead and bismuth.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:48.803
Lead melts at around 330
Celsius, bismuth 200 something.

00:41:48.803 --> 00:41:51.220
Put them together, and it's
like a low temperature solder.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:54.190
It melts at 123.5 Celsius.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.078
You can melt it in a frying pan.

00:41:56.078 --> 00:41:58.120
This is nice, because you
don't want your coolant

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.460
to freeze when you're
trying to cool your reactor,

00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.570
because imagine something
happens, you lose power.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:06.610
The coolant freezes
somewhere outside the core.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:08.740
You can't get the
core cool again.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.360
That's called a loss
of flow accident

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.250
that can lead to
a really bad day.

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.620
And the lower your melting
point is the better.

00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:17.770
Sodium potassium is already
molten to begin with.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.030
Sodium melts at like 90 Celsius.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.000
And when you add two
different metals together,

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.610
you almost always
lower the melting point

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:25.852
of the combination.

00:42:25.852 --> 00:42:27.310
In this case,
forming what's called

00:42:27.310 --> 00:42:32.540
the eutectic, or a lowest
possible melting point alloy.

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.690
The sodium fast reactor
has a number of advantages,

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:37.760
like you don't really
need any pressure.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:40.280
As long as you have a cover
gas keeping the sodium

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.940
from reacting with anything,
like the moisture in the air,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.980
or any errant water
in the room, you

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.370
can just circulate
it through the core.

00:42:48.370 --> 00:42:51.500
And liquid metals are
awesome heat conductors.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.900
They might not have
the best heat capacity,

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.930
as in how much energy per gram
they can store like water.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:58.520
But they're really
good conductors

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.770
with very high
thermal conductivity.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:04.680
They also are really good at
not slowing down neutrons.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.700
So these tend to be what's
called fast reactors that

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.960
rely on the ability of
other isotopes of uranium,

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:15.540
like uranium-238, to undergo
what's called fast fission.

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.100
And I want to show you
what that looks like.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:23.325
Let's pull up U-238 and look
at its fission cross section.

00:43:23.325 --> 00:43:24.700
And you might find
that it should

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:28.340
look a fair bit different.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:37.220
So we'll go down to number
18 to fission cross section,

00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.960
very, very different.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.940
So U-238 is pretty terrible
at fission at low energies.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.870
It's pretty good at
capturing neutrons.

00:43:46.870 --> 00:43:48.750
This is where we
get plutonium-239,

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.660
like you guys saw on the exam.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.160
But then you go to really high
energies and all of a sudden,

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.630
it gets pretty good at
undergoing fission on its own.

00:43:58.630 --> 00:44:00.720
And so the basis behind
a lot of fast reactors

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.990
is a combination of making
their own fuel and the fact

00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:08.010
that uranium-238 fast
fissions even better than it

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.023
thermal fissions.

00:44:09.023 --> 00:44:10.440
So something good
for you to know,

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.900
even though it's
not a fissile fuel,

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.316
that's light water
reactor people talking.

00:44:15.316 --> 00:44:19.900
You can get it to fission if
the neutron populations higher.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.970
Now, there's some
problems with this.

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:28.870
It takes some time for neutrons
to slow down from 1 to 10 MeV

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.780
to about 0.025 eV.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:35.022
If your neutrons don't need to
slow down and travel anywhere,

00:44:35.022 --> 00:44:37.480
and pretty much all they have
to do is be born and absorbed

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.990
by a nearby uranium
atom, the feedback time

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:43.210
is faster in these
sorts of reactors.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:45.970
They're inherently more
difficult to control.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:49.690
And you can't use normal
physics like thermal expansion

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:51.740
of things that might happen
on the order of micro

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.810
to nanoseconds if it takes less
time than that for one neutron

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:58.510
to be born and find
another uranium atom.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:01.670
You can still use it somewhat,
but not quite as much.

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:05.790
So it's something to note
backed up by nuclear data.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.790
And that's what one of
them actually looks like.

00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:09.860
These things have
been built. That's

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:14.280
a blob of liquid sodium on
the Monju reactor in Japan.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.190
And where I was all
last week in Russia,

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:18.590
they actually have
fleets of fast reactors.

00:45:18.590 --> 00:45:24.410
Their BN-300 and BN-600 reactors
are 300 and 600 megawatt sodium

00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:25.910
cooled reactors.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.560
One of them in the
Chelyabinsk region

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:29.822
they use pretty much
for desalination

00:45:29.822 --> 00:45:31.280
down in the center
of Russia, where

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.180
there's no oceans nearby
and probably dirty water.

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:38.655
They actually use that
to make clean water.

00:45:38.655 --> 00:45:40.280
They also use this
for power production

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.470
and for radiation
damage studies.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:45.800
So when it comes to
radiation material science,

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.990
these fast reactors are
really where it's at.

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:52.920
Yeah, you just
noticed the bottom.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.290
I went to Belgium, to their
national nuclear labs,

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:57.330
where they have a
slowing sodium test loop.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.580
It's not a reactor, but it's
like a thermal hydraulics

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.430
and materials test loop.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.000
And I asked a simple question.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:04.790
Where's the bathroom?

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:06.420
And they started laughing at me.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:09.370
And they said, we're not putting
any plumbing in a sodium loop

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:10.540
building.

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.373
You'll have to go to
the next building over.

00:46:12.373 --> 00:46:14.957
And that's when I noticed, there
weren't any sprinkler systems

00:46:14.957 --> 00:46:15.900
or toilets.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.650
But every 15 or 20 feet, there
was a giant barrel of sand.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:22.530
That's the fire extinguisher
for a liquid metal fire

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.720
is you just cover it with
sand, absorb the heat,

00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.125
keep the air out, the moisture
out, wick away the moisture

00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:29.430
or whatever else sand does.

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:30.920
I don't know.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:33.090
But you can't use normal
fire extinguishers

00:46:33.090 --> 00:46:34.810
to put out a sodium fire.

00:46:34.810 --> 00:46:37.765
AUDIENCE: When you said sand,
I thought of kitty litter.

00:46:37.765 --> 00:46:38.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.093
I don't know if that would work.

00:46:40.093 --> 00:46:42.197
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:42.197 --> 00:46:43.280
I guess it's worth a shot.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.460
With glasses, and safety,
and stuff, of course.

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:49.610
And the ones that I spent
the most time working on,

00:46:49.610 --> 00:46:51.440
like I showed you in
the paper yesterday,

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.970
is the lead or
lead-bismuth fast reactor.

00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:56.300
This one does not
have the disadvantages

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.802
of exploding like sodium.

00:46:57.802 --> 00:47:00.260
It does have the disadvantage,
like I showed you yesterday,

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.720
of corroding everything,
pretty much everything.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:07.083
And so the one thing keeping
this thing back was corrosion.

00:47:07.083 --> 00:47:08.500
And I say the
ultimate temperature

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.340
is medium, but higher soon.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.840
Hopefully, someone
picks up our work

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:14.215
and is like, yeah, that was
a good idea, because we think

00:47:14.215 --> 00:47:16.340
it can raise the
outlet temperature

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.180
of a lead-bismuth reactor
by like 100 Celsius

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:21.860
as long as some other unforeseen
problem doesn't pop up,

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.360
and we don't quite know yet.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:27.240
These things also
already exist in the form

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.720
of the Alfa Class attack
submarines from the Soviet

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.770
Union.

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:34.592
These are the only subs
that can outrun a torpedo.

00:47:34.592 --> 00:47:37.550
So you know that old algebra
problem, if person A leaves

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.380
Pittsburgh at 40 miles
an hour and person

00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:41.750
B leaves Boston at
30 miles an hour,

00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:45.620
where do the trains collide or
I forget how it actually ends?

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.650
Well, in the end, if a
torpedo leaves an American sub

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:52.640
at whatever speed and the Alfa
Class submarine notices it,

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:55.700
how close do they have to be
before the torpedo runs out

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:56.970
of gas?

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.020
So what I was told by the
designer of these subs,

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:03.463
a fellow by the name of Georgy
Toshinsky, when he came here

00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:05.630
to talk about his experience
with these lead-bismuth

00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:09.020
reactors is, there is a
button on the sub that's

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:12.790
the Forget About Safety,
It's a Torpedo button.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.940
Because if you're underwater
in a lead-bismuth reactor

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.860
and a torpedo is
heading at you, you

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.730
have a choice between maybe
dying in a nuclear catastrophe

00:48:21.730 --> 00:48:24.650
and definitely dying
in a torpedo explosion.

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:29.060
Well, that button is the
I Like Those Odds button.

00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:31.400
And you just give full
power to the engines

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.590
and whatever else
happens, happens.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:37.340
The point is, you may be
able to outrun the torpedo.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.800
And quite popular nowadays,
especially in this department,

00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.070
is molten salt cooled reactors
that actually use liquid salt,

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.960
not dissolved, but molten
salt itself as the coolant.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:50.940
It doesn't have as many of
the corrosion problems as lead

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.610
or the exploding
problems as sodium.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:56.160
It does have a high melting
point problem though.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.340
They tend to melt at
around 450 degrees Celsius.

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.110
But there's one
pretty cool feature.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:03.600
You can dissolve
uranium in them.

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.250
So remember how in
light water reactors

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.620
the coolant is
also the moderator?

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.570
In molten salt
reactors, the coolant

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:12.790
is also the fuel, because
you can have principally

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:15.400
uranium and lithium
fluoride salt

00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:17.008
co-dissolved in each other.

00:49:17.008 --> 00:49:18.550
And the way you make
a reactor is you

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:22.630
just flow a bunch of that
salt into nearby pipes.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:26.280
And then you get less, what's
called, neutron leakage,

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:28.520
where in each of these pipes
once in a while uranium

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.728
will give off a few neutrons.

00:49:29.728 --> 00:49:32.228
Most of them will just come out
the other ends of the pipes,

00:49:32.228 --> 00:49:33.880
and you won't have a reaction.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.010
When you put a whole bunch
of molten salt together,

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:38.230
most of those neutrons
find other molten

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:41.715
salt. And the reaction proceeds.

00:49:41.715 --> 00:49:43.340
And it's got some
neat safety features.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.780
Like if something goes wrong,
just break open a pipe.

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.770
All the salt spills out,
becoming subcritical,

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:52.240
because leakage goes up.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.460
It freezes pretty quickly, and
then you must deal with it.

00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:58.180
But it's not a big deal
to deal with it if it's

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:01.660
already solid and not critical.

00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:03.100
So it's actually five of.

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.660
It's zero of five of.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.340
I'll stop here.

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:08.410
On Tuesday, we'll
keep developing

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:10.003
the many, many
different variables

00:50:10.003 --> 00:50:11.920
we'll need to write down
the neutron transport

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.523
equation, at which
point you'll be

00:50:13.523 --> 00:50:15.940
qualified to read the t-shirts
that this department prints

00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:16.720
out.

00:50:16.720 --> 00:50:18.637
And then we'll simplify
it so you can actually

00:50:18.637 --> 00:50:20.400
solve the equation.

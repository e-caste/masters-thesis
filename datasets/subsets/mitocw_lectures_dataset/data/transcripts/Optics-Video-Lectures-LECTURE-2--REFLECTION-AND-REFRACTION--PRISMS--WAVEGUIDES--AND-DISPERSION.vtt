GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
So does anybody

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.040
have questions from
the last lecture?

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.807
After some time to wake up,
anybody still have questions?

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.120
So I will start, and if
you remember of a question

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.500
that you had, please interrupt.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.250
I think if you push
the button the button,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.160
I will hear a sound over here.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.680
So we will know that
there's a question.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.140
So I'd like to
pick up the thread

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.970
from where I left last time.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.819
We covered fairly quickly
because we ran out of time.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.180
But we covered that
the law of reflection

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.580
and the law of refraction.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.330
So I'd like to go back
to the low of reflection,

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.600
and remind you that it is a
very simple, very simple result.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.040
The minimum path requirement
for the light rays

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.490
force those reflections
to be symmetric.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.080
So this has a
strange consequence

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.300
that we're unfamiliar with
from when we look in the mirror

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.590
daily.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.680
And that is the fact that
our left and right locations

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.710
in our body.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.538
They flip when we
look at the mirror.

00:01:41.538 --> 00:01:43.330
So we'd like to make
that a little bit more

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.190
quantitative by looking
at this diagram.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.080
So to understand this,
suppose that I am--

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.760
I have an object
that is oriented.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.870
You can think of it as
perhaps two pencils that

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.300
are sort of following
the ray paths

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.190
and then they get
reflected from the mirror.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.860
So, for example, if you
look at the central ray,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.990
it will be reflected
symmetrically.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.070
So, again, what you see here is
the front view of the mirror.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.770
And then I will draw a few
ray a paths in perspective.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:25.360
So this is the ray paths
that start from the object.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.110
I don't know if you
can see me over there,

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.190
but I'm trying to show what will
happen with an actual pencil.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.410
So if this was a pencil that
is coming towards the mirror,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.110
and this is the
surface of the mirror.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.420
The pencil will go like this.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.760
And then law of reflection
says that it will also

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.120
come out like this again.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.730
This follows very easily if
you simply trace the rays.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.190
In the next step in
my animation here, it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.960
paints the sort of positions
of the pencils and their tops

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.860
as they get reflected
from the mirror.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.570
So what happened here
is the following.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.550
As you can see, the
pencil did not actually

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:08.670
change orientation.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.520
This is a strange
thing about mirrors.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.810
But what did change
is the following.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.720
Imagine that you
are walking together

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.770
with this pair of pencils.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.550
As you are walking
this way, you will

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.060
see that the one that is
horizontally oriented.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.730
The top of it is
pointing to your right.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.400
But if you walk all
the way to the mirror.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.860
Go to the center of the
ray, and start going

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.630
backwards the other way around.

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.650
Then all of a sudden,
the top of the pencil

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.160
appeared on your left.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.380
This is a simple consequence
of the law of reflection.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.380
The way we interpret it
in everyday life when

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.528
we see through a mirror
is the following.

00:03:50.528 --> 00:03:52.070
Of course, in everyday
life, we don't

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.250
talk about left handed
and right handed triads.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.670
But the way we interpret
it is because normally when

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.557
we look at a good
quality mirror,

00:04:00.557 --> 00:04:02.390
we do not know that
there is a mirror there.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.480
We actually see a continuation
of that are being reflected

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.830
behind, back behind the mirror.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.100
So what you're seeing then
if we look behind the mirror

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.300
is actually this triad, with the
pencils oriented as shown here.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.510
And if we interpret it as
being seen from behind,

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.470
then, of course, left has
become right, and vice versa.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.942
So another way to
think about it is

00:04:28.942 --> 00:04:30.400
that when we look
through a mirror,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.080
it is as if we're looking
from the image from the back.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.580
So a better way
to think about it

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.700
is if you're
looking at something

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.070
that is written on my t-shirt.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.600
If you look at it
from the mirror,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.850
it would appear as
if I were hollow,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.580
and you would see the back
of the writing on my t-shirt.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.060
And you all know that if
you look at the ambulance

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.090
sign in ambulance
trucks, ambulance

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.250
whatever you call them, cars.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.040
Because it is meant to be
visible through the mirror

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.880
of a driver, they actually
write the sign backwards.

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.540
So when you look at it, it is as
if you saw a transparency of it

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.700
from the back.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.440
So this is a simple consequence
of the law of reflection.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.430
This is a very
simple silly question

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.630
that sometimes is asked.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.200
And it actually takes quite
a long explanation to answer.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.410
And that question
goes like this.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.450
If you look at the
mirror, yes, we

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.280
know that left and right
flip, but up and down do not

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.790
flip, right?

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.790
You don't see yourself
upside down in a flat mirror.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.388
You see yourself flipped
from left to right.

00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:37.180
What is the reason?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.590
The reason is shown here.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:46.190
The reason is because
of the flipping

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:51.140
of the relationship between the
left and right in the object

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.480
side, as you interpret
the projection

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.090
of the rays that are coming
from the opposite side

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.980
of the mirror.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.730
So this requires a
little bit of thinking,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.940
so I'll let you think about it.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.967
Unless you have a question
now, please ask it.

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:06.800
If not, you can think
about it and come back

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.810
with more questions
on Wednesday.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.020
Is there any immediate
question about this?

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.040
That's kind of a subtle
and elegant point.

00:06:17.285 --> 00:06:18.910
I should have brought
a mirror with me.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.535
Piper, do you have
a mirror over there?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.260
AUDIENCE: No, I don't
have a mirror here.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:28.520
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
No mirrors, OK.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.320
But everybody has access
to mirrors, right?

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.841
It's the one optical element
that we can find very easily.

00:06:34.841 --> 00:06:38.020
So I'll let you practice with
your mirror in your bathroom,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.475
and then come back
and ask me questions.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.620
OK.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.610
AUDIENCE: I'm lying down.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.640
You're horizontal.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.430
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
That's right.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.640
Our producer like this.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.680
The other thing I
wanted to talk about

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.980
is expand a little bit
on the law of reflection.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.200
Oh, I'm sorry, the
law of refraction

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.210
that we derived last time.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.870
So the law of refraction
is the last equation

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.320
shown on this line.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.170
It says that this quantity,
the index of refraction

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:32.020
multiplied by the sign of
the angle of incidence, where

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.750
the angle of incidence
is defined with respect

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:40.000
to the normal to the surface.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.210
It is preserved.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.200
So as you go through multiple
surfaces, the law of refraction

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.630
says that this quantity
must be preserved.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.900
So there is a common
problem that I

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.300
have posted just a
couple of hours ago

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:57.730
that asks you to make an analogy
between the law of refraction,

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.550
and the problem of
a lifeguard who has

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:02.860
to save a person in the water.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.350
So recall the reason the
law of refraction happens

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:10.480
is because the light must
minimize its path between two

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.660
points, P and P prime.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.520
So a very similar
problem is if you

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.630
have a trajectory that you're
trying to design in a way

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.910
that you minimize the
time that you will

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.130
spend going on this trajectory.

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.730
So here, you have a swimmer
who is sitting on the beach.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.320
I'm sorry, not a swimmer.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.600
You have a lifeguard
sitting on the beach.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.549
And the lifeguard sees a
person drowning in water

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.799
farther behind.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:44.084
The lifeguard can run on the
beach at some velocity, v sub

00:08:44.084 --> 00:08:44.960
r.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:48.710
They can also swim in water
at some velocity v sub s.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.100
Most people swim
slower than they run,

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:56.960
so we can assume here that
the running speed is faster

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.110
than the swimming speed.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.860
And the question is
how should the swimmer

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.820
plan his path so that he can
reach the drowning person as

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:05.690
fast as possible?

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.420
Again, you can think that,
for example, the straight path

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.270
is not the best
because he's spending

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.130
too much time in water.

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:18.780
I mean, water, he's slower.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.660
So he may want to spend
a little bit extra time

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.850
in the fast middle,
and a little bit

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:25.320
less time in the slow medium.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.790
But, again, he cannot overdo it.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.160
If he goes a really crazy
path, then, again, he

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.840
will end up with a longer time.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.180
So light is trying to
do a similar thing.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.910
It is time to optimize
the obstacle path

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.370
length, or
equivalently, the time

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:41.850
that it takes for the light ray
to reach from a starting point

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.990
to an ending point.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.020
And, again, remember this is
almost an exact analogy here.

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:49.500
The speed of light
is faster in air,

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.550
and slower in a
dielectric medium.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.910
So if you had the
air and glass here,

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:56.160
that would be a very
similar situation.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.780
I'm going to skip the next line.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.135
And I'm going to go to
this one, to number 34.

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:13.950
So what I'm trying to say here
is to point out two cases.

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:15.990
They're not really different.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.260
They're just two cases
of the same situation.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.160
In one, you are going from
a medium of lower index

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.560
to a medium of hire index.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.960
And in this case,
obviously, because

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.930
of the law of refraction,
the angle of refraction

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:33.630
will increase as you
go from left to right,

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.940
from low index to high index.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.550
The opposite will happen
if you go from high index

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:40.650
to low index.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.380
OK, so this has
two consequences,

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.240
which you can think of as
you reach the extremes.

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.510
If you come in at the
maximum possible angle

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.940
here, 90 degrees,
then you can imagine

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.310
that you will not enter
at 90, but you will enter

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.110
at a slightly smaller angle.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.860
So basically, if you
are coupling in light

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:03.780
from air to glass, or in
general from a medium of lower

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.430
index to a medium
of higher index,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.070
you have a limited
column of approach

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.180
that you can couple light into.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:13.320
And that is given by
this equation over here.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.920
When the exterior angle
theta reaches 90 degrees,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.650
then this is the maximum
angle, theta prime,

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.510
that you can access inside
the high index medium.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.080
The opposite is perhaps
slightly more interesting,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:31.950
is what happens when you
reach or exceed theta

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.863
prime equals to 90
degrees over here.

00:11:34.863 --> 00:11:36.780
So if you look again at
the law of refraction,

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:40.260
you can realize that it
is possible to arrange

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.160
for a combination
of n and theta,

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:47.370
such that the product is bigger
than the index of refraction

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:48.840
at the medium side.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.140
In order, now, to satisfy
the law of refraction,

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.870
you would have to require
that the sine of an angle

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:56.130
is bigger than 1.

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.920
So since we are limited to
deal with real angles here,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.350
not complex, this cannot happen.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.080
What really happens there is
that the light will actually

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.130
be reflected.

00:12:05.130 --> 00:12:08.880
If you satisfy this
condition, this product

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:11.460
becomes bigger than
the index of refraction

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.120
outside in the medium.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.740
Then when you satisfy
this condition,

00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:23.760
then light will be reflected
inside the high index medium.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.980
And that is known as total
internal reflection, or TIR.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.100
So let's look at TIR in
slightly more detail over here.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:33.880
So I have a glass
medium in there,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.870
and imagine that I
have a wavefront that

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:41.060
is arriving from glass
towards the air interface.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:44.920
So there is a combination
of index and angle,

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.800
where the product of the
index inside the glass

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.860
times the sine of the
angle equals exactly one.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.160
What happens then is
the law of refraction

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.870
does not break down yet.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:58.840
But what will happen is the
light will be refracted,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.870
and it will propagate exactly
parallel to the interface.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.460
This is known as a surface wave.

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.180
If you increase the angle
now, then the product

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.530
will become bigger than one.

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:12.260
The law of refraction
cannot be satisfied anymore.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.450
So what will happen then.

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.040
Oh, and I should have said that
the angle where this happens

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.080
is called the critical angle.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:21.500
Because it is the
angle just below which

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.080
I still have refraction.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.780
If exceed this angle,
then I get this phenomena

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:33.140
of total internal reflection,
where all of the light

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:36.950
is reflected inside the glass,
inside the high index medium.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.740
So it is almost as
if the interface here

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.680
abruptly changes,
and instead of being

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.040
mostly transmissible over here,
it becomes mostly reflective.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.390
So it starts acting
like a mirror.

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.760
There's one difference
that makes it slightly

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.710
different than a mirror.

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:56.770
And the difference
is that if you

00:13:56.770 --> 00:14:01.380
were to calculate the electric
field on the opposite side

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.510
of the interface, that
is, inside the medium

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:05.940
where light does not propagate.

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:08.650
You will discover that
there is some leakage.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:13.710
The electric field has non-zero
values in the low index

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.450
medium over here.

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.170
Even though the electric
field that you find

00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:20.940
is not propagating, it is
what is called evanescent.

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.350
It is in exponential decay,
but there is no wavefront.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:28.370
There is no wavefront
of light propagating

00:14:28.370 --> 00:14:31.133
in the vertical
direction like this.

00:14:31.133 --> 00:14:32.550
This is called an
evanescent wave,

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:35.130
and we will revisit
it later when

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.870
we deal with electromagnetics.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.120
Because right now,
the way I defined

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.780
it is not perhaps very
rigorous, or very quantitative.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:47.590
But I wanted to give
you a sort of a heads

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.970
up that something slightly
more than geometrical optics

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.220
prediction happens here.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.140
But as far as
geometrical optics goes,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:58.820
that we will be dealing
for the next few lectures,

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.242
there is a reflection.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:08.320
This says what I just
mentioned, that we

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.740
will talk more about
these evanescent waves

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.140
a little bit later.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.030
One more thing that I want to
say about evanescent waves.

00:15:17.895 --> 00:15:20.700
One way you can sort of
realize the existence

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.280
of evanescent waves
is with a sort

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.210
a related phenomenon called
frustrated total internal

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.140
reflection, also known as FTIR,
because that's quite a mouthful

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:32.370
to pronounce.

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:35.070
So FTIR happens if you
have this situation,

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.280
where you're beyond
that critical angle,

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.690
and therefore, your
total internal reflecting

00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:41.160
into the medium.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:43.770
But you bring near
the interface,

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.630
you're bringing
another piece of glass,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.790
another piece of
high index medium

00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:53.010
in a way that an appreciable
amount of the evanescent wave

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:57.780
is allowed to enter inside
the high index medium.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.190
If that happens, as we've
said, the TIR is frustrated.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.730
What it really means is that
the TIR stops happening now.

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.507
What would happen
is a small amount

00:16:07.507 --> 00:16:09.340
of light will still be
reflected, of course.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.920
You cannot avoid that.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.660
But the significant
portion of the light

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:17.640
will couple out into
the next material,

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.662
and it will actually
be transmitted.

00:16:20.662 --> 00:16:22.370
So this is a very
interesting phenomenon,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.162
because if you think
about it, the light is

00:16:24.162 --> 00:16:27.160
forbidden to enter this region.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.620
Snell's law says that light
cannot cross into air,

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.550
yet because of the proximity,
the light can actually couple

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:34.170
out.

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:37.460
And again, we will see a much
more rigorous explanation

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:40.340
and quantitative description
of this phenomenon

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.440
later, when we're doing
it through magnetics.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:46.010
Some of you who may have
taken electronics or quantum

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.190
mechanics, there's
a similar effect

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:56.300
called tunneling in potential
barriers in quantum mechanics.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.030
The equations are very similar
that describe this phenomenon.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.530
In both cases, you
have a wave that

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.650
is crossing a forbidden
region in order

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:06.710
to pass into an
allowable region again.

00:17:09.842 --> 00:17:11.300
This may be actually
be a good find

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:19.819
for Piper to solve a demo of
the total internal reflection.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:24.277
And Piper will actually solve
it in the context of a prism.

00:17:24.277 --> 00:17:25.819
Piper, maybe you
can start setting up

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:28.010
while I give a brief
description of prisms.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.840
You all are familiar, I suppose.

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:38.220
They're pieces of glass that
are cut into various triangular

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.940
and other polygonal shapes.

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.770
And typically, prisms are--

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.610
they're arranged either so
that the light passes through,

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:48.380
as shown in the top diagram.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.440
Or if you bring the
light from the bottom,

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:54.460
and you manage to exceed
the critical angle

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.140
in the interface, then you
can also total internally

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.920
reflect the light, and create
a situation like this that

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:03.470
is known as a retro-reflector.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.400
Now, a rule of thumb that is
useful to know for glass, which

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.240
has index of refraction 1.5.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.130
The critical angle
is about 42 degrees.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:16.430
So if you are incident
at 45, as shown

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:21.717
in this case of what is called
isosceles triangle, then--

00:18:21.717 --> 00:18:22.550
actually, I'm sorry.

00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:24.600
This is equilateral, isn't it?

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.190
If you're incident at 45
in an equilateral triangle,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.800
then you will satisfy
the TIR condition,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.580
and you get this
retro-reflector.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:35.120
And there's more
complicated prisms

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.600
that allow you-- for example,
this is the pentaprism.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.900
After two bounces, the light
will exit at 90 degrees angle.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.750
So Piper, maybe you
can do the demo now?

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:48.820
PROFESSOR: Sure, sure.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:50.110
So just before
showing the demo, I'm

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.820
going to pass around
this prism that

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:55.310
has in these two
surfaces, two images.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:57.520
So then what you see is
that in this window here,

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.760
you tilt it like this.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.290
You're going to see when
you get a hold of it.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:04.380
You actually see
two different images

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.230
due to total
internal reflection.

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:08.110
So at a given
angle, you basically

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:10.212
get the light reflecting
from one of the surfaces.

00:19:10.212 --> 00:19:11.920
And another angle,
you get the other one.

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.628
So it's actually very
interesting to see.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.340
OK, so we're seeing here
the top view of the demo.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.150
We put together a wide light
source and a laser source.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:27.157
And before showing you
what actually happens,

00:19:27.157 --> 00:19:28.990
let me just introduce
some of the components

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:33.160
that we are going to be seeing
in several demos from now on.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:36.700
First of all, we have the white
light source, it's a lamp.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:40.060
And then this component
here, it's a regular lens

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.360
that you're familiar with.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.990
So the job of these
lens is to collimate--

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.080
that's the term that we use--
to convert this light close

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.180
to a plane wave, similar
to the light that

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:50.350
is coming from the sun.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.200
So the sun, again, would be
like a point source of light

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.460
far away.

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.020
So then these
lenses are basically

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.570
transforming in this
light into parallel rays

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.850
from the geometrical
optics point of view.

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.940
So we use these lens.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.380
This is an iris, similar
to the iris that controls

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.170
the aperture in your eye.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.170
And this is just used to
split the light into two--

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:13.840
I'm sorry, to reduce the
diameter of the beam.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.680
Then this component,
here this one.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.110
It's what we call
the beam splitter,

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:23.080
or more specifically, the
non-polarized beam splitter.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:25.000
And it's a component
that allows us to split

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.710
the light into two paths.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:31.050
So here, this is one
path, and another path.

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:38.270
So once we split the light in
two paths, and in this case,

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.450
it has equal ratios.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:42.530
So it's 50% to one
side, 50% to the other.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.850
Then let's follow
one of these parts.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.640
This part illuminates
one of these prisms here.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:52.940
And again, there's going to
be some refraction following

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:54.650
the law of refraction
that we saw.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:56.360
But in addition
to that, as we'll

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.780
see in the next
couple of slides also.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.883
There is a phenomenon
called dispersion

00:21:00.883 --> 00:21:02.300
that you're familiar
with when you

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.940
see rainbows in a rainy day.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.550
And basically, that
has to do with the fact

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:11.640
that different wavelengths see
a different index of refraction.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.730
So if you go back
to the Snell's law,

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.700
they will basically
bend in a different way.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.430
So therefore, you
see a rainbow effect.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:22.250
So I don't know if you can see
the side view in the camera

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:25.090
please?

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:29.130
Yeah, so that's a picture of it.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:31.410
OK, but here in the
classroom too, please.

00:21:37.678 --> 00:21:38.970
I don't know if you can see it.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.010
We're going to try to
show it also in this.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.660
But I have here two components.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.300
This is a prism
that is doing these,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:49.840
what we call the normal
dispersion, which basically has

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:53.760
that the biggest angle that
bends is the blue light,

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.870
or the shorter wavelength.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:57.600
And then we have
another component here

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.693
that we haven't
talked about yet,

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.360
but we'll see it in
the next few slides.

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.440
So this is just an introductory
introduction to this element.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.070
It's called
transmission grating.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:10.560
And this component is
used in several systems.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.370
They're a different principle.

00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:16.200
It's not refraction anymore.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.500
It's using the diffraction
property of the light.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.510
And using that diffraction
property can also

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:24.900
create this rainbow that you
could see here in the back,

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.570
and hopefully, you
can see the picture.

00:22:30.343 --> 00:22:32.260
What we are going to see
here is that actually

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.030
the opposite trend happens.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.870
The red angles bend more
than the blue angles,

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.190
and that's called
anomalous dispersion.

00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.310
So we have normal dispersion
in the prism case,

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.470
like in the one shown
here in transparency,

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:49.060
and anomalous dispersion
showed in the grating.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.920
So I'm going to tilt
this a little bit.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.910
OK, it's fine.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:57.110
I'm going to try to see.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.770
So I don't know
if you can see it.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:00.920
Can you see the rainbow
here from the back?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.550
If you're in the classroom?

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.560
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
Yeah, we can see it.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:04.910
PROFESSOR: All right, excellent.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:07.582
So this is just the
rainbow from the grating.

00:23:07.582 --> 00:23:10.040
After class, you can just come
here and play with the demo.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.950
And you're going to
see the two cases.

00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:15.080
You can actually
trace the rays and see

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.860
which color is bending
more, and distinguish

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:21.540
between anomalous and
normal dispersion.

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.390
So the last thing that
I want to show here

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.660
is the total internal
reflection principle.

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.920
In this case, this piece of
acrylic here that we have.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.300
You can see that it's forming--

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:35.060
it's basically having a
laser light coupling into one

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.450
of the sides, so similar to
that exit sign over there.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.730
And what we have is
that the acrylic--

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:43.070
the piece of acrylic
acts like a wave guide.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:46.190
So it conducts a light inside.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:48.470
And the reason the
light doesn't escape

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:50.810
is because it's
basically suffering

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.840
total internal reflection at the
interface between the acrylic,

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.470
which has a higher index
than air, so stays inside.

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.320
Now, in order to
couple the light out,

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.110
I put some tape here, as you
can see forming the letters MIT.

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:08.480
And that basically
frustrates the light,

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.360
allows it to break
the incidence angle.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.140
So a ray now instead of getting
into a very flat surface

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.860
at an angle that is larger
than the critical angle,

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.370
it basically reaches
a surface that

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.940
has a diffuser type of angle,
so maybe it can escape out.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:25.700
So then, you can see
all this light diffusing

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:30.560
out forming like either this
image, or the image of the exit

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.940
sign.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.470
So that one, you can see
it also in Singapore?

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:36.317
The frustrated?

00:24:36.317 --> 00:24:37.400
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.960
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.310
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: It
looks frustrated to us.

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:45.250
PROFESSOR: From the
side view, I guess.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.938
So I don't know if you want
to add anything, George.

00:24:47.938 --> 00:24:49.980
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: So
what you see on the slide

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:52.590
that I'm projecting it
now is an application

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.260
of the same principle
that Piper just showed.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.470
It has an application
in a bunch of commonly

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:02.690
used conventional devices,
namely, fingerprint sensors.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:05.860
Where instead of the tape
that Piper put over there,

00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:08.490
usually what you do is
they place their finger

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.280
touching the side of the prism.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:16.410
And then because our buddy,
this may be surprising to you.

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:18.610
It was surprising to me
when I first heard it.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.920
Our body is composed mostly
of water, about 75% is water.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:25.440
So therefore, the
refractive index of our skin

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.800
is close to 1.3, which
is, of course, higher

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.950
than the refractive
index of air.

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:35.280
So what happens here is
over here, for example,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.280
you have a glass and air.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:42.930
So therefore, light will be
totally internally reflected.

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:46.710
But at the ridges of the
finger, of the fingerprint,

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:49.200
you have glass and water.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.010
That is 1.5 to 1.33 or so.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:56.440
So therefore, the ridges appear
dark because they frustrate

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.210
the total internal reflection.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.300
The light couples
into your finger.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:04.110
And therefore, a surprisingly
sharp image of the finger

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.460
appears in the camera.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:07.550
Actually, what you see
here, it does a disservice.

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:11.280
The projector and the
pixelation of my computer

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:13.980
does a disservice to the
quality of the fingerprint image

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.910
that you get.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:18.150
So nowadays, most
fingerprint sensors

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.732
are based on this principle.

00:26:19.732 --> 00:26:20.940
In fact, we have improved it.

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:23.250
Instead of using
the prism in places

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:27.050
like laptops that have
fingerprint security,

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.490
it is the same principle,
but you slide the finger.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.130
But still, the ridge
of the fingerprints

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.860
as you slide the
finger over the sensor

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.525
is captured by the principle
of total internal reflection.

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:45.350
Any questions about that?

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:46.900
About TIR and FTIR?

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:07.050
OK, one other use of TIR
is in another very useful--

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.080
another extremely
useful property of light

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.160
is that you can actually capture
it, almost like in a wire.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.933
And you can guide the light
over a very long distance.

00:27:17.933 --> 00:27:19.350
Now, why this is
very important is

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.780
because we know from
experience, and we'll also

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:24.570
learn later as the
Huygens principle,

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:28.110
that light does not
like to be confined.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:32.130
Generally, light, once you
generate light in a source,

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.720
the light would like to expand.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.590
It would like to open up and
propagate in an expansive way.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:40.140
For example, the sun,
the stars, and so on.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.170
They propagate isotropically,
all around them.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:45.640
And you know the same from
the light bulbs and so on.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.010
The light expands.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:49.400
There's an exception, of
course, called lasers.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.150
Lasers can be quite collimated.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:53.000
But even lasers,
they tend to expand.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.600
If you leave a laser
beam by itself,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.550
and you propagate it
for a long distance,

00:27:56.550 --> 00:27:57.860
eventually, it will expand.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.420
It will become quite big.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.980
So the way to undo this
property of light--

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.170
if you want to transmit
light over a long distance

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:09.300
without expansion-- is
to use a wave guide.

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.440
So wave guides typically,
they use this phenomenon

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.030
of total internal reflection.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:22.610
In the simplest case, you
have a slab of high index--

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.510
dielectric middle sandwiched
between two other pieces

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:28.970
of lower index medium.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:33.110
And what happens there provided
that the light is incident

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:37.040
at the sharp enough angle that
is beyond the critical angle

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:38.480
between the two media.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.330
Then the light will sort
of bounce back and forth

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.340
between the two interfaces.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:45.590
And this way, you can
actually transmit it

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.330
over a very long distance.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.790
So, of course, if
it is not true.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.950
If the light arrives at
a shallower angle, then,

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.245
of course, it will
actually couple out,

00:28:54.245 --> 00:28:57.380
and it will not
be guided anymore.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.990
The way you establish whether
the light will be guided or not

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.970
is by using these properties
called the and numerical

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.820
aperture of the wave guide.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:11.000
So this is a term,
numerical aperture,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.150
that we'll hear again and
again in this class, at least

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.280
in three different contexts.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.380
But they all mean
the same thing.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.960
Actually, they mean
an angle of acceptance

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.610
of an optical system.

00:29:24.610 --> 00:29:27.600
So in this context
here of a wave guide,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.710
compare the two rays.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.160
One is sort of the
solid ray, and the other

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.760
is the dotted ray.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.940
The solid ray comes
in from air, then

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.140
is refracted at the
vertical interface.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:42.530
And because this
angle is fairly small,

00:29:42.530 --> 00:29:44.990
by the time it gets into
the middle, the angle

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:47.300
it makes through the
perpendicular surface

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.270
of the interface between
the slab and the cladding.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:53.660
It actually satisfies the
TIR condition over here.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.330
You can see a little bit
if you familiarize yourself

00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:58.650
with the way Snell's law works.

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:02.060
You can see that as you
increase this angle over here,

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.970
this angle over here
actually decreases.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:09.320
So the dotted ray
actually can arrive

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.480
at below the critical angle.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.070
So therefore, the
daughter ray is not

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:15.590
guided where the
solid ray is guided.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:19.880
So the numerical aperture is
the maximum angle, theta naught,

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.850
that you can tolerate
before you stop

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:24.938
satisfying that TIR condition.

00:30:24.938 --> 00:30:26.480
And therefore, the
numerical aperture

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:30.050
is the maximum angle that you
can couple into the wave guide.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:32.930
If you tried to bring light
at a higher angle than that,

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:34.250
it will actually not be guided.

00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:37.400
It will escape into the
cladding, and it will get lost.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.920
It will disappear.

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.670
So with a little bit of algebra,
which I haven't done here.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:45.890
I will let you do
it by yourselves.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.200
In years past, I used to
give this as a homework,

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.433
but I didn't do it this time.

00:30:49.433 --> 00:30:51.600
But anyway, with a little
bit of algebra and playing

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.390
with Snell's law,
you can find out

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:55.220
that the numerical
aperture in this case

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.170
is given by this
quantity over here.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:59.030
The square root
of the difference

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.030
of squares between the
two indices of refraction.

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.750
And as I mentioned earlier,
physically what it means.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.940
This quantity is the
angle of acceptance

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:11.310
of the wave guide for the light
that you want to couple in.

00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:13.190
Typically, wave
guides in practice,

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.350
they have a very
small difference

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:21.010
between the index of the core,
where the light is guided,

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:22.560
and the index of the cladding.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:26.030
This difference is typically in
the order of 10 to the minus 3,

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.620
or 10 to the minus 4.

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.630
So therefore, the
numerical aperture is what?

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:32.660
It is small or large for
a typical wave guide?

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:38.490
If the index difference
is very small,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.490
is the numerical appearance
or a small or large?

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:50.543
Small, right?

00:31:50.543 --> 00:31:52.210
We're going to set
up a competition here

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.590
between Singapore and Cambridge.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:57.940
So you guys, when you have an
answer, please push the button.

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:00.520
On either side, please
push the button.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.100
So the numerical aperture
is actually very small,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:05.980
as our colleagues
here correctly said.

00:32:10.342 --> 00:32:12.050
And what is on the
slide is the opposite.

00:32:12.050 --> 00:32:13.467
If you have a high
index contrast,

00:32:13.467 --> 00:32:17.650
then you get a high
numerical aperture.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.720
There is one more type of
wave guide, which is actually

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.370
the same principle,
but a slightly

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:24.200
different implementation.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.102
It's called a gradient
index wave guide.

00:32:27.102 --> 00:32:28.310
And the way to understand it.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:33.920
Imagine that I stack a bunch
of different slabs of glass

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.940
with index that varies
from a small value.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:40.460
This I denoted as the
sort of light gray.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.640
Then to darker gray, denoting
higher index of refraction,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:45.320
and then back to light gray.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.360
I mean, back to low
index of refraction.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.500
So if you imagine the ray
coming in from the top here.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.880
It will refract into the
guide, and then as it goes in,

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.690
it will keep getting refracted.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.960
Now, we can adjust
the numbers here,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:03.170
so that one of these
interfaces, the light

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:05.410
will exceed the critical angle.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:07.820
And therefore, it will be
totally internally reflected

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.280
at this interface.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.020
And if that is
true, the same thing

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.380
will happen also at
the top interface.

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:18.690
As I mentioned before, this
quantity, n sine theta,

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:19.880
is preserved.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.940
So therefore, if this
quantity, n sine theta,

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.320
was such that the TIR condition
was satisfied over here,

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.273
then the same will
happen over here.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:31.190
Because everything else
is symmetric, correct?

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:36.020
The reflections are symmetric,
and the quantity, n sine theta,

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.880
is preserved.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:44.110
So therefore, if you put a light
in this kind of arrangement,

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.650
it would actually follow
a periodic trajectory.

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:51.480
The light will sort of
be periodically reflected

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.560
from these interfaces, and will
follow a periodic trajectory

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.560
down the stack of slabs.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:01.680
Therefore, this is also
a kind of wave guide.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.040
It is commonly referred to
as green, where green is not

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:09.110
for the facial expression,
but stands for gradient index.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:17.989
And there's a special case of
a gradient index where they

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.429
don't normally do it this way.

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:22.230
The way they do it is with
a continuous variation.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:23.929
And they manufacture
it with diffusion.

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:24.846
It's very interesting.

00:34:24.846 --> 00:34:29.120
They take a piece of glass,
and they diffuse ions.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.340
Because the ions change
the index of refraction

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.440
of the glass, then
they can sort of

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:39.830
get a continuous profile of
gradually variable index.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:42.800
And in the special case where
this profile is quadratic,

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.520
it turns out that the
trajectory of the light paths

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.570
is kind of like a helix.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.730
It become sinusoidal.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.810
And the light sort of
bounces in sinusoidal fashion

00:34:53.810 --> 00:35:00.540
between the two interfaces,
this one and this one.

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:04.378
We will do this in more
detail four lectures later.

00:35:04.378 --> 00:35:05.920
If you look at your
syllabus, there's

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.880
something called
Hamiltonian optics.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.060
We will actually
see in action how

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:15.900
this sinusoidal periodic
trajectory comes about.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.610
Yes.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.294
AUDIENCE: So what
is the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:35:20.917 --> 00:35:22.000
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: Yeah.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.315
That's a very good question.

00:35:23.315 --> 00:35:24.940
PROFESSOR: Can you
repeat the question?

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.890
Because they didn't
press the button here.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.390
Can you repeat the
question, please?

00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.970
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS: I'm sorry.

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.020
Could you repeat
with the button?

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:30.740
Yeah.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:34.130
What is the advantage of
using this type of wave guide

00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.367
compared to step
index wave guide?

00:35:37.367 --> 00:35:38.950
GEORGE BARBASTATHIS:
So the advantage,

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.830
which I cannot describe yet
because we have not done wave

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:42.760
optics.

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:47.630
But in wave guides, there's a
phenomenon called dispersion.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:51.880
It is very similar to the
dispersion from a prism

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:53.770
that Piper showed before.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:57.260
But in telecommunications,
when you transmit signal down

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.270
a wave guide, it has the
effect of basically lowering

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:03.940
the speed, the effective
speed at which you

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.170
can transmit information.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:08.440
So it turns out that
the step index wave

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:12.410
guide has a higher dispersion
than the gradient index wave

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:13.060
guide.

00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:17.645
So you get a much higher speed
in fibers of gradient index.

00:36:17.645 --> 00:36:19.270
So that's one reason
why people use it.

00:36:23.242 --> 00:36:24.200
This will take a while.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.210
And, of course, more
practical wave guides that

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.460
are shaped like a wire.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.293
Literally, they are
known as optical fibers.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.090
Again, you have two
types of fibers.

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.740
You have the step index fiber,
where you have a higher index

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:55.500
core, and the light is kind
of bouncing back and forth

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.870
between the core
and the cladding.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.780
And there's also
gradient index fibers,

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:04.200
where the light is following
a helical trajectory.

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:07.470
The phenomenon of
wave guiding, again, I

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:09.120
have to defer to
electromagnetics.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.210
It is much easier to describe
with electromagnetics

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.850
than it is with wave optics.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:19.440
But for now, we can get a sort
of a preliminary description

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.870
with the means that we
have available to us.

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:28.370
As a sort of a
curiosity, it turns out

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:31.780
that these gradient
index wave guides.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.960
They appear in the nature
in certain animals.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:38.030
I mean, insects, actually.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.750
Their eyes, they're composed
of several wave guides,

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:45.300
each one of which is actually
a gradient index wave guide.

00:37:45.300 --> 00:37:48.500
And the way the animal eye
works is it captures-- remember,

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:51.590
the wave guide has a
limited numerical aperture.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:55.740
So each one of these guides,
each one of these small eyes,

00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:59.670
they're called ommatidia,
these little wave guides.

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:02.780
So each one of those
captures a very narrow angle

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:07.250
of light sort of within
the field of view

00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:08.600
of the eye of the insect.

00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.280
And then sends a signal down to
the optic nerve of the insect.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.440
So basically, the insect
with this kind of eye, it

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.720
forms a very bloody
picture of the background,

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:22.640
because it integrates a
relatively large range

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.390
of angles.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:25.970
But still, the range of
angles is small enough

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:30.332
that it allows it to
quote unquote see.

00:38:30.332 --> 00:38:31.790
Now, insects, of
course, they don't

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:38.270
see the way we see, at least
from our everyday experience.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:40.580
And the reason, of course,
is that the insects

00:38:40.580 --> 00:38:43.670
have a very limited brain.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.550
A typical insect might
have about 10,000 neurons

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.300
in his brain.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.030
Show of hands, does
anybody know how many

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:51.238
neurons we have in our brain?

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.770
10 to the 11.

00:38:59.770 --> 00:39:03.650
So we have about eight orders
of magnitude more neurons.

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.630
In case you are
wondering, whether you

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.420
are smart or
educated, it does not

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.880
have to do with a number
of neurons that you have,

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.565
but it has to do with the
connections between neurons.

00:39:13.565 --> 00:39:15.320
Neurons are
connected with wires.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:18.080
It turns out an
educated person has

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.480
approximately 10
times more connections

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.490
than an uneducated person.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.060
The same number of neurons,
but more connections.

00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:30.230
And so it's a sad fact of
life that every day, adults--

00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:36.060
that is, after age six or
so, even at childhood--

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:37.280
would begin to lose neurons.

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:38.870
In fact, each one
of us every day

00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:41.102
will lose about 100,000 neurons.

00:39:41.102 --> 00:39:43.310
Nothing to worry about,
because we have 10 to the 11.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.020
So even with all this
loss, we can still

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:48.590
survive until a fairly old age.

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.090
But anyway, it is true.

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:53.390
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:55.630
Anyway, the insect,
on the other hand,

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.860
has about 10,000
neurons altogether.

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.025
So it has to make do with
these 10,000 neurons.

00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:00.650
It has to move.

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:01.490
It has to feed.

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:04.400
It has to mate and
all of these things.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.610
So the way they handle it is
they get very simple vision,

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:10.910
and they navigate according
to differences in lighting.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:15.410
So the typical example is an
insect flying toward a tree.

00:40:15.410 --> 00:40:18.320
Nature has evolved the insect
to avoid this situation,

00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.470
because if it flies into the
tree it will crash and die.

00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:26.040
But if it flies towards a
tree, the insect sees a dark

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.250
background-- the
trunk of the tree--

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.740
surrounded by light,
which is sort of leaking

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.240
on the sides of the tree.

00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:35.780
As it flies by, it
sees an edge of light

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.720
that is very rapidly
expanding, because it

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.370
is approaching the tree.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:42.400
So the insect is wired.

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:43.260
It as actually automatic.

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.630
The insect doesn't think, oh
my god, I'm going to crash.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:46.500
Let me turn.

00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.600
It's automatic.

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.850
As soon as the
neurons of the insect

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.680
register a difference
in lighting

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:54.770
between successive
ommatidia over here,

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:56.800
they turn on the motor--

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.592
the flies or whatever, the
legs and so on of the insect,

00:40:59.592 --> 00:41:00.800
the navigation of the insect.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.690
And the insect turns
and avoids the obstacle.

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:07.680
So this is what I
say about insect.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:10.600
More precisely, I'm referring
to the fruit fly, which

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.180
has been very broad,
very extensively studied

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.660
in this context.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.770
But anyway, this is a very,
very interesting story

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:22.040
of how the insects
use what we now

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.600
consider as a
rather sophisticated

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.850
optical instrument,
a green wave guide

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:29.090
in order to generate a
very simple type of vision

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.500
based navigation.

00:41:35.033 --> 00:41:36.450
The next thing I
was going to say,

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:38.570
Piper already mentioned it.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:43.820
The index of refraction
of most dielectric media

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.360
turns out to be a strong
fraction of the wavelength.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:49.520
So I stole from
a book, actually,

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.410
from the Soto website.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:54.530
Soto is a glass manufacturer.

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:56.150
They make glasses
that are used very

00:41:56.150 --> 00:42:00.210
commonly in optical instrument
lenses and such, and prisms

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:02.392
and so on.

00:42:02.392 --> 00:42:03.850
So they have this
picture on online

00:42:03.850 --> 00:42:06.670
of the index of
refraction as a function

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:09.400
of wavelength for a relatively
large range of wavelengths

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:14.470
going along the wave
from ultraviolet

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.090
into the deep
infrared over here.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.000
So you can see that the
index varies quite a bit.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.750
Also, with the plot
here, the absorption

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:24.490
coefficient of the material.

00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:28.660
And you can see that they are
kind of correlated in the sense

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:32.430
that when the index does
something interesting,

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:36.518
the absorption also seems
to do something interesting.

00:42:36.518 --> 00:42:37.560
It is not coincidentally.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.370
It turns out to have
a very interesting

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.990
theoretical foundation.

00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:42.030
I will go into it.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.140
Perhaps I will go into
it later in the class.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.900
But anyway, the point I've
been trying to make here

00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.483
is that you can see
that the index can

00:42:51.483 --> 00:42:53.180
have quite a bit of variation.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:57.550
So because of that, if
you send broadband light

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:01.970
that contains multiple
colors into an element,

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:03.070
such as a prism.

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.850
Then you can observe these
phenomena that Piper showed.

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:10.000
Different wavelengths,
different colors,

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.810
they experience different index,
and therefore, the Snell's law

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:15.650
applies differently to them.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:19.060
That is why you have this--

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.130
it's called analysis
of white light.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.110
It becomes a rainbow.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.050
For most materials, it is true.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:34.570
Longer wavelengths actually have
a lower index of refraction.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.060
Now let's see, does
this make sense?

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.160
If you look at this
picture over here.

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:41.150
Does it make sense what I said?

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:45.870
Which wavelength apparently has
the lower index, blue or red?

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:02.760
It better be right, or I--

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.010
either I made the wrong slide.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.460
But anyway, I have taught
this class for several years.

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:08.190
So you would think that if
I had made the wrong slide,

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.810
I would have fixed
it by now, right?

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.100
So the slide is correct.

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:12.600
The way to figure
it out is you have

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.110
to imagine a normal to
the surface over here.

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:24.350
So which wavelength appears to
have the stronger refraction?

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.820
Blue or red?

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.950
Blue, right?

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:32.470
So the blue wavelength
suffers a strong refraction.

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:35.860
That is, the blue
wavelength has what index?

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:39.360
Higher or lower?

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.420
Higher.

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:44.600
And indeed, the
blue wavelength is

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.230
softer than the red wavelength.

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:49.010
So this is consistent with
the curve that you see here.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.500
The blue wavelength is
probably somewhere around here.

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.930
The red wavelength is
somewhere around here.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:57.600
It is not a dramatic variation
in the visible range.

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.620
And that is typical
for most glasses.

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.455
In the visible range, they have
a relatively slow variation

00:45:03.455 --> 00:45:04.580
of the index of refraction.

00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.080
But nevertheless, it is there.

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.270
And you saw evidence
of it in the experiment

00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:12.027
that Piper just
did with the prism.

00:45:12.027 --> 00:45:13.610
And the last thing
that I want to say.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.980
I don't want to
belabor this point.

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:22.430
People use various quantities
to characterize dispersion.

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:26.810
And typically, they
characterize them with respect

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:29.390
to the various emission lights--

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:34.280
emission lines,
from atomic spectra.

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.400
So they use this as
reference [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.880
The reason, I suppose.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.070
The reason is that
back when people

00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.610
developed these measures,
lasers were not available.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:47.180
So the best way to define
wavelength standards

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:50.930
was with emission lines.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.960
So they use typically
the hydrogen C line and F

00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.690
line, and the sodium D line.

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:58.550
And then they define
these quantities,

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:03.080
the dispersive power and
the dispersive index,

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.320
which are defined according
to the index at these three

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.230
different wavelengths.

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.250
So this is very useful for
people who do optical design.

00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:19.520
And it gives you sort of an idea
of how dispersive is a glass.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:25.070
These quantities are actually
inverse relative to each other.

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.720
And this an example.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.320
For ground glass,
typically, you want

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.580
the V number, the
dispersive power, to be low,

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.830
if you want a
dispersion free element.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.730
OK, any questions?

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:09.640
OK, so I'm not going to go
over the second lecture.

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:12.780
We will postpone
it for Wednesday.

00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.720
Basically, we have slid back by
about an hour, but that's OK.

00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.720
We'll catch up later.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.840
But what I'll do is I would
like to get you started thinking

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:25.820
about next Wednesday's lecture.

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:27.650
So next Wednesday,
we'll basically

00:47:27.650 --> 00:47:32.300
see a bunch of applications
of Fermat's principle.

00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.840
Namely, the principle
that says that light

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:39.320
chooses its trajectory trying
to minimize the optical path

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:40.640
length.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.260
So we saw already
two applications,

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.480
one in the law of
reflection, and the other

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.170
in the law of refraction.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.350
So the next applications
will be in focusing.

00:47:49.350 --> 00:47:51.800
So the question we'll
ask the next Wednesday

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:57.920
is how can we design a surface,
or reflect a surface such

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:02.060
that if light is arriving
from infinity in parallel rays

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:05.320
like this, this
surface upon reflection

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:06.880
focuses all the rays.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.288
So they pass from the
same common focal point F.

00:48:10.288 --> 00:48:11.830
So you can look it
up into the notes,

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.860
and then I will go over
it again on Wednesday,

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.750
how we can use the Fermat's
principle in order to design.

00:48:18.750 --> 00:48:19.750
You can actually design.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.070
We can come up with an
analytic expression that

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.760
has to be a parabola for
the sacrifice that gives

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.890
the perfect focus onto a point.

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:31.610
So the homework has been posted.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:33.870
The first three
problems you can do

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:37.380
without a need for any of this.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.130
Actually, I think the
first four problems.

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:41.860
You don't need any of this.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:45.610
The problems are not due until
actually the next Wednesday.

00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.910
Not this Wednesday,
but Wednesday the 18th,

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:50.290
nine days from today.

00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:54.660
So you're in good shape with
regards to the homework.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.340
Suppose we have a
rigid body, and it's

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.220
rotating about a
fixed axis, and we

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.450
know that the angular
acceleration, alpha, is given.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.490
Now, it may be a
function of time.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.220
And we'd like to find
from the angular velocity

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.710
and how much angle has
rotated in some time interval.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.770
So the first thing
we have to do is

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.410
choose a point in
the rigid body,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.780
and introduce a
coordinate system.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.240
Here we have our angle theta.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.060
And with this point, we have
our r hat and our theta hat

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.470
direction.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.460
And recall that by
the right-hand rule,

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.200
the k hat is going out of
the plane of the figure.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.300
And so we have our
coordinate system.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.940
And we wrote alpha as the
second derivative of theta

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.950
with respect to time k hat.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.110
Now our goal is to
find omega, which

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.170
we'll right as the first
derivative of d theta dt k hat,

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.590
and also to find theta
as a function of time.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.920
Now recall that our notation
was that alpha z was the omega

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.630
z dt equals d squared
theta dt squared.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.852
And in this notation, omega
z was equal to d theta dt.

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.310
Now what we're
going to do is we're

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.710
going to integrate
alpha, just like we

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.120
did in simple circular
motion kinematics

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.039
for point-like objects.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.370
And so what we have here is
that for some time interval,

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.479
omega z at time t minus
omega z0 is the integral of t

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.340
prime equals 0 to
t of alpha z, which

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.970
is our component of the
angular acceleration.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.420
We have an integration
variable, dt prime.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.710
And recall that that
implies that omega z t can

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.080
have some initial
value at time t

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.400
equals 0 plus this
integral relationship,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.350
which is what we want to figure
out by direct integration.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.480
Now, this only works when alpha
z is some function of time.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.490
In order to get the angle,
theta of t, we integrate again,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.180
where we have theta t0
is the integral from t

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.820
prime equal 0 to t prime equals
t of this function omega z.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.260
Again, we have some integration
variable, t prime, dt prime.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.850
And so we see that
theta t can have

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.829
some initial value plus
this integral relationship,

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:54.610
t prime equals t of
omega z t prime dt prime.

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.360
And this is how
we can figure out

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.180
how the point p has a
component of angular velocity,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.130
and what angle the
point p sweeps out

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.324
in some time interval t.

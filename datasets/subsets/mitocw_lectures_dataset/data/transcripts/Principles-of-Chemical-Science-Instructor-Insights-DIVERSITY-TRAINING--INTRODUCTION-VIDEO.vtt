CATHY DRENNAN: So
I'm Cathy Drennan.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.990
I'm a Professor of
Chemistry and Biology

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.690
here at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.630
I'm also an investigator and
professor with the Howard

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.512
Hughes Medical Institute.

00:00:17.512 --> 00:00:19.470
And I just wanted to give
a little introduction

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.380
to the training video you're
about to watch, this workshop

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
that we've developed, that is
on the topic of stereotype,

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.420
stereotype threat, Why Is
Criticism Unconscious Bias.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.330
And so in this workshop
you're about to see,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.150
this is the workshop that
we run for teacher training

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.410
at MIT, both in the
biology department

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.990
and in the chemistry department.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.910
So most of the
people in this room

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
are about to go on an adventure
of teaching for the first time

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.190
here at MIT.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.740
So I'm going to talk
about the motivation

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.720
for doing this workshop
actually in the workshop.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.720
But let me just tell you
the goals for a minute.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.460
So we want the
people who are going

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.360
to be teaching our students
here to know about stereotypes,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.300
know about stereotype threat,
feel comfortable with terms

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.120
such as wise criticism,
know some of the data

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.290
behind the idea that
stereotype threat can actually

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.780
lead to underperformance
by students,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.910
and think about
how do you create

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.970
an environment in your classroom
where every student can reach

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.327
their full potential.

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:20.910
So that's what this
training is about.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.160
And we hope the students
coming out the other end

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.410
are going to be really
excited about their classroom

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.590
experience and how they're
going to create this environment

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.400
for every student.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.310
So although this
training is really

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.500
designed for
teaching assistants,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.340
we found that this material
is broadly applicable.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.770
It can be used to
train faculty members.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.140
It can be used to train mentors
in a research laboratory.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.130
It can be used to become
a better student oneself

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.430
or a better mentee oneself.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.610
It's really for everyone.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.100
And it relates to everyone.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.700
So I'm hoping at the end
of watching this video,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.100
that maybe you will
feel comfortable enough

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.890
with this material that you
might start these discussions

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.540
at your home institution.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.490
So I'm going to make
available to you

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.350
both this workshop on
videotape, all of the slides

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.480
that you're about
to see, a booklet

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.610
with more information
for you to read

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.820
and exercises in it,
references in it.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.200
It can be used--

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.230
people can read about this
before they do a workshop.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.300
We're hoping to have
this discussion just sort

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.072
of spread all over the place.

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:30.780
And I know what some
of you are thinking.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.650
It's like, no way, I cannot
lead this discussion myself.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.540
But you know, that's
what I used to think.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.090
And everyone can talk
about these things.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.490
Sometimes it makes us feel a
little uncomfortable to talk

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.440
about things like stereotypes.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.060
But we can talk about them.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.890
We need to talk about them.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.720
And after watching
this video, we

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.120
hope that you'll be ready to
start a discussion of your own.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.750
So it's important to do this.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.510
It's an important time to
be having these discussions,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.730
because there are a lot
of problems in the world.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.350
And in addition to
being a professor,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.880
I'm a mom of a 10-year-old.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.340
And I can tell you, I'm really
worried about the planet

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.850
that she's going
to be inheriting.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.040
There's global warming.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.660
There's warming of oceans.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.680
There's antibiotic resistance.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.860
We need smart people to be
thinking about these problems.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.590
We need scientists to be
thinking about these problems.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.210
So we need everyone who
wants to be a scientist

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.540
to be able to reach their full
potential so that we can tackle

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.372
these important
problems moving forward.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.080
And that's what this
training is designed

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.470
to do-- start the
discussion so that everyone

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.270
can be in an
environment where they

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.900
can reach their full potential.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.980
So enjoy watching.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.470
MICHAEL SHORT: So, before we
begin today's bit on dose,

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.180
dosimetry, and
background radiation,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.770
I promised you guys
a story about how

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.409
to use 22.01 to get out of
Apartheid, South Africa.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.910
So, I got told this story when
my cousin was about to get

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.480
married because he needed a
diamond and he was going to go

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.430
buy one and his dad said, don't.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.870
So back in the 70s, when
my uncle and his family

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.460
were living in
South Africa, anyone

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.190
who wasn't Dutch white,
so that would be blacks,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.010
Jews, including
us, anyone else was

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.252
considered second-class citizens
by the Apartheid Government.

00:00:57.252 --> 00:00:59.710
And you were allowed to leave,
because they didn't want you

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.570
there, but you had to
surrender all of your funds

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.220
to the government
in order to leave,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.880
which gives me everything
you have and then

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.630
you can leave the
country penniless is not

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.280
a winning proposition.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.270
So, my uncle and his brother
devised a pretty brilliant idea

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.660
to get their funds out of
South Africa unnoticed.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.450
They were both dentists
or radiologists

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.750
or some sort of medical doctor
that requires x-ray reading.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.015
So, one of them gave the
other one all of his money,

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:28.390
then reported bank statements
to the Apartheid Government

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.670
and said, I'm pretty
much penniless.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.173
My practice went broke.

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:33.340
I want to leave the country.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.050
And they said, OK,
get out of here.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.180
So he went to the
US, established

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
a dental or radiological or
some other sort of practice,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.140
I forget which one, and
started requesting his brother,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.510
back in South Africa, to
send him x-rays to read

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.760
to help boost his business.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.910
Because that was their actual
business, it was pretty legit.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.640
So then my uncle would
send him packets of x-rays

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.220
to interpret and send back.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.950
Except that there would
be 10 x-rays on the front

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.110
and 10 on the bottom,
and the middle 80

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.130
would be hollowed out.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.930
AUDIENCE: Oh!

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Now that
would have ordinarily have

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.690
tripped off alarms because
any change in density

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.090
would trigger a change
in x-ray contrast.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.670
Because these packages were
being inspected by x-ray,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.968
and if it looked like
these x-rays were hollow

00:02:17.968 --> 00:02:19.510
and you were smuggling
something out,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.080
they'd be caught
and confiscated.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.740
So what sort of materials
are valuable that you

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.620
find in South Africa,
that are pretty

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.128
similar in x-ray contrast to
other light media like film?

00:02:34.128 --> 00:02:34.920
AUDIENCE: Diamonds.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.910
MICHAEL SHORT: Diamonds.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.940
So the remaining brother
went and converted

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.550
all of his life savings into
diamonds, which is something

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.040
that you can do in South
Africa because this

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.000
is where diamonds come from.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.660
He then slowly, over a
period of months or years,

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.840
sent packets of hollow
x-rays full of diamonds

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.200
to his brother in the
states, knowing full well

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.580
that the mass attenuation
coefficients of soft tissue

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.430
and carbon are pretty similar
and so are their densities.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.700
So their total
attenuation coefficients

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.950
are pretty similar, to.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.770
Let's pull those up
so we can check it.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.536
Carbon graphite.

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:17.420
I'm going to add a new tab
and bring up soft tissue

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.210
and we can compare them.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.850
Let's see, what's
the most similar--

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.025
so long as you can see
it-- thing to film?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.140
What should we call film here?

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.468
X-ray film?

00:03:32.468 --> 00:03:34.760
AUDIENCE: I don't even know
what X-ray film [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.870
MICHAEL SHORT:
Photographic emulsion.

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:36.495
How about that?

00:03:36.495 --> 00:03:37.766
AUDIENCE: Kodak.

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:39.586
MICHAEL SHORT: Is
there something Kodak?

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.620
OK.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.940
Kodak, standard nuclear.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.370
I don't think that sounds right.

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.610
Let's go with
polyethylene and plastic.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.220
Carbon, plastic.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.765
Carbon, plastic.

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:55.160
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Carbon, plastic.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.840
Basically identical.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.480
So this is a way they were
able to smuggle wealth out

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.980
of the country without
x-ray contrast tripping off

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.480
the guards.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.980
And once all of
the slave savings

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.948
had been converted
into diamonds,

00:04:08.948 --> 00:04:11.240
he then went to the government
and said, I'm penniless.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.387
My practice went broke.

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:13.470
I want to get out of here.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.940
And they said, good riddance.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:15.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:16.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.140
So they were able to
restart their life

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.598
in the states with
all of the money

00:04:19.598 --> 00:04:21.015
that they had had
in South Africa.

00:04:21.015 --> 00:04:23.098
And when my cousin wanted
to get married and said,

00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:25.440
I'm thinking of buying a
diamond, my uncle just said oh,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.940
don't.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.398
He's like, what,
don't get married?

00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:28.910
He said, no, don't
buy a diamond.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.743
Here, let me take you
to the diamond drawer.

00:04:30.743 --> 00:04:31.887
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:32.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.670
Because there was some leftover.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.250
So he said, pick out
an extra diamond.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.370
And that's the story of my
cousin's engagement ring,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.620
as well as why part of my
family's here in the States.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] That's
like a very cool diamond story.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, very,
very nuclear diamond story.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.510
Diamonds aren't forever, as
the finish have shown us,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.550
but they can get you out
of repressive regimes.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.032
OK, back to the dose stuff.

00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:01.740
So today, and for the
rest of the course,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.950
we get into biological and
chemical effects of radiation.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.475
As soon as this pops up.

00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:08.100
And so in the first
slide is everything

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.220
you need to know
about dose and units.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.230
Don't worry, it's
not up there yet.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.330
I know that different
units of dose

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.900
are a common point of confusion.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.950
So I wanted to put
everything on one slide

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.520
so you can refer back to
it like a cheat sheet.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.970
So, you've probably heard
of the roentgen before.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.760
You've definitely seen
the roentgen as a unit

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.810
because you've all looked in
those pen or pocket dosimeter

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.820
that you actually had
at the nuclear reactor,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:35.970
when you guys took a tour of
it and controlled the control

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.810
rods.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.810
The roentgen is not really a
unit that we use much anymore

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.470
for very careful
calculations because you

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.080
have to do some tissue
equivalency stuff

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.830
in order to go from
ionizations in air, which

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.285
is what it actually
measures, it's

00:05:51.285 --> 00:05:55.500
the amount of charge
dissipated or built up in air,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.320
to some damage to soft tissue.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.360
And the way you actually
calculate roentgens

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.510
from first principles, linking
the physics and the biology

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.540
part, is remember
this equation here?

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.360
Stopping power, which
is some energy transfer,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.270
divided by the energy
required to make an ion.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.510
Each one of those will give
one electron unit of charge

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.040
towards [INAUDIBLE] coulombs.

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.400
And so this is the direct
link between the physics

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.740
and the chemistry/biology
in this course.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.363
It's not something that's
done that carefully in any

00:06:25.363 --> 00:06:27.780
of the readings, which is why
I'm going to harp on it here

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.070
in lecture.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.560
These two parts of the course
are often taught differently.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.420
And they're actually
totally related

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.130
and everything's all the
same, which is kind of nice.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.260
You don't have to just relearn
a whole new lingo and field.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.060
Then there is the
SI units of dose.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.557
The ones that, when you do
calculations in the homework

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:45.140
and the rest of your
life, I recommend

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.410
that you use whenever
possible because they're

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.100
in units that we're familiar
with, in standard units.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.370
The one where you start
with all along is the gray.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:59.240
A gray is the simple measure
of absorbed energy in joules

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.850
per kilogram of whatever.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.130
And so calculating it is
fairly straightforward, too.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.420
For example, if you want to know
what sort of dose you would get

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:11.690
in gray from
absorbing gamma rays,

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:14.827
you can use this old
equation from the first third

00:07:14.827 --> 00:07:15.410
of the course.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:25.210
And if you integrate
this from, let's say,

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.000
over the range of
whatever object or person

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.830
you happen to be
irradiating, you'll

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.440
get some fractional
difference in intensity.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.440
That, multiplied by the original
intensity of gammas, which

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:38.710
could be given in maybe
gamma rays per centimeter

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:42.010
squared per second,
maybe times time

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.590
to get total number of gammas
per centimeter squared.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.420
All that multiplied by
the energy of each gamma,

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.670
divided by the mass of whatever
is doing the absorbing,

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:01.140
equals your dose in gray.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.840
So you can use all the old
stuff from the previous parts

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:07.355
of the course directly to
calculate dose in gray.

00:08:07.355 --> 00:08:09.480
And this is the starting
point for any calculation.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.910
If you don't know what
tissue was exposed,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.390
what type of radiation provides
what biological effectiveness,

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:16.230
it doesn't matter.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:19.130
You just start here.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.720
Then the other unit
you may have seen

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.820
is a unit, not of
energy absorption,

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.430
but of increased risk
for something going

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.470
wrong in the biological sense.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.030
It's called the sievert.

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:33.039
For simple things like whole
body dose from gamma rays,

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.900
sieverts equals
gray, because sievert

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.500
is multiplied by this quality
factor, or this effectiveness

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:40.549
factor.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:42.870
That Q factor is actually
a couple of factors.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.770
There's a Q for
the type of tissue

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:49.610
and there's a Q for
the type of radiation.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.730
And the total quality
factor for whatever

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.388
you're trying to calculate
is just the multiplication

00:08:59.388 --> 00:08:59.930
of these two.

00:09:07.835 --> 00:09:09.460
And so it's fairly
easy, if you're ever

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.240
dealing with whole body gamma
dose, gray equals sieverts.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.180
If you're dealing with pretty
much anything different, gray

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.290
does not equal sieverts.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.480
There'll be just some
factor to add in,

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:21.280
which can be looked
up from a lookup table

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.860
but, as I've told you before,
I don't like that explanation,

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.120
look it up on a table.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.850
We're going to explore why the
lookup tables are constructed

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.400
the way they are.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.770
And then there's the
CGS units, the ones

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.950
that are based in
centimeter-gram-second, instead

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.150
of kilogram-meter-second.

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:41.420
The rad is a simple measure.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.085
It's, let's say, 100
rad is just 1 gray.

00:09:44.085 --> 00:09:45.460
Where the rad
actually comes from

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.560
is, it's defined as 100 ergs
absorbed energy per gram,

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.410
where an erg is 10
to the minus 7 joules

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.843
and a gram is 10 to
the minus 3 kilograms.

00:09:56.843 --> 00:09:58.510
And so, you can do
the mental math there

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.000
to make sure these all work out.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.120
And then a REM, a
roentgen equivalent man,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.850
is just a hundredth
of a sievert.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:08.950
So there's historical
basis for this.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.380
Back in the day, more
folks used CGS units.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.660
There's been a push
to SI units, which

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.225
I happen to like because
everything works out

00:10:16.225 --> 00:10:18.100
and you don't have to
remember things like 10

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:21.530
to the minus 7 joules
or whatever like that.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:24.130
So I'd say, when in doubt,
for equal comparisons

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.740
always use the SI
units and always

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:28.330
start with the
gray because that's

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.420
something where you can take a
physical calculation of energy

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:35.860
per kilogram and go into
some increased cancer risk

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.630
by using the dose
quality factors.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:41.620
So let's take a look
at how these appear.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.930
First of all, gammas,
x-rays, electrons,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.630
positrons of any LET.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.870
LET, as I mentioned before,
is linear energy transfer.

00:10:58.267 --> 00:10:59.850
And to put this
mathematically, you've

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:06.020
actually seen this before, which
would be some change in energy

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:09.850
over some change in distance.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.660
It's the stopping power.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.660
It's not like the stopping
power, it's the stopping power.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.660
So with the formulas you got in
the second half of this class,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.600
you can calculate
linear energy transfer.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.670
Now, why are these things given
in, let's say, discrete tables,

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:30.380
or now what's currently
recommended is these functions?

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:31.510
Does anyone have any idea?

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.100
How many of your
Core Seven friends

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:44.380
know the formula for stopping
power, or could parse it even,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.840
or understand it?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.090
You don't have to,
not everybody has to.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.470
So, for the rest of us, there
are simpler empirical relations

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:55.350
or relations that get the
numbers right that aren't

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:58.110
necessarily based on physics.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.760
So a simple lookup
table, for those

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.895
who don't have time to take
22.01 or something beyond,

00:12:02.895 --> 00:12:04.020
is the easiest thing to do.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.310
And in most cases it works.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:08.310
It's not exact, but it's
probably close enough.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.790
Given uncertainties in
the amount of radiation

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:15.420
that one could absorb or the
weight of a certain organ

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.600
or the energy of
some x-ray tube,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.548
I think these empirical things
are pretty much good enough.

00:12:22.548 --> 00:12:24.090
And what this tells
you is that there

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:27.450
is some effectiveness of
different types of radiation

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:29.580
and different
energies of radiation

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:34.140
at imparting energy to the
parts of cells and organs

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.050
that cause damage.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.540
To say that in a little
smaller sentence,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.210
different energies of radiation
can have different effects

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:46.020
biologically, and these tissue
factors account for that.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:46.800
It's also a table.

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.508
I want you to keep in
mind because you're

00:12:48.508 --> 00:12:50.780
going to have to do a
calculation about it.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:54.230
The principle elements in
soft tissue in unit density,

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.300
otherwise known
as number density,

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.830
which you've seen before.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.040
If you want to calculate the
dose using a stopping power

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.970
formula to a human, you have to
know what this human is made of

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.710
and this is a pretty
good assumption.

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:09.417
And this is something you'll
be doing on homework number 8,

00:13:09.417 --> 00:13:11.000
is finding the dose
that you're giving

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.116
to each other in a
particular situation.

00:13:14.116 --> 00:13:15.980
If anyone's seen the
particular situation,

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.500
check OCW for last
year's course and you'll

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:20.930
see what that situation will be.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.670
Has everyone gotten your whole
body counts at the EHS Office?

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.890
If anyone hasn't, do
them in the next week

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.130
because you'll need that
data for the homework.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:33.020
You'll also need this table.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.770
Because if you think about
it, if you want to say, well,

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:41.000
what's the damage by
electrons to soft tissue?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.430
And you want to calculate
this from scratch.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.750
You have these four
number densities,

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.470
so we'll keep those in account.

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:50.990
And let's put up the
formula for ionization

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.010
stopping power again.

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:57.980
Comes out with 4
pi, k not squared,

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.450
little z squared, big
Z, number density,

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:07.840
e to the fourth, over
MeV squared, log.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.600
Let's see, what
goes on top again?

00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:18.100
Oh, yeah, 2MeV squared, over
the mean ionization energy.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.940
The nonrelativistic form.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.830
Which of these
terms vary depending

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:26.850
on the atom that an electron
or whatever would strike?

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:30.380
Let's circle them,
there's a couple.

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.520
AUDIENCE: Big Z.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.370
MICHAEL SHORT: Big Z, what
the electron's hitting.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:35.480
N, the number density.

00:14:44.066 --> 00:14:45.510
AUDIENCE: Ionization potential.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:48.703
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, the
mean ionization potential.

00:14:48.703 --> 00:14:50.370
So these three terms
are the only things

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.440
that change when
you're doing a stopping

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.910
power to dose calculation.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:01.760
So if you want to get the
total dose in gray to a human,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:08.325
you have to sum over these
four different isotopes.

00:15:08.325 --> 00:15:08.950
Actually, wait.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:12.580
Let me put all the other junk
in front to make it quicker.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:16.625
So the 4 pi k0 squared
little z squared

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:22.180
e to the fourth
over MeV squared is

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:31.710
just a constant, times the
sum over all your isotopes

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:37.560
of zi, the number
density of isotope i,

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.250
which inside there has the
element fraction of that,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:48.600
times the log of 2 MeV squared
over the mean ionization

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.446
potential of isotope i.

00:15:52.446 --> 00:15:55.378
And in this case, notice
there's no isotopes given.

00:15:55.378 --> 00:15:56.670
They're just given as elements.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.630
Why do we do that?

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.900
Why don't we care for humans?

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:06.830
How many isotopes of hydrogen
tend to exist in you?

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.657
One, pretty much one, to
about five significant digits.

00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:11.990
You all have a little deuterium.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.960
Something like 1 in every 20,000
atoms of hydrogen is deuterium.

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.760
But it's not a lot.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.140
I think it's even
less than that.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.840
Carbon is just carbon-12,
except for the tiny amount

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.630
of carbon-14 you use
for radio carbon dating.

00:16:23.630 --> 00:16:27.530
Oxygen, it's oxygen--
think what, 16?

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.510
Nitrogen is nitrogen-14.

00:16:29.510 --> 00:16:31.580
So as long as you know
what isotopes to use,

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:35.630
you'll know what
z's, what i bars.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.380
And the number
density is given here.

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.310
So this right here is
how you calculate dose

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:42.800
in gray to a human
over some distance.

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.830
Then all you'd have to do is
integrate that over your--

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.160
let's say thickness
of the human,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.750
whatever that happens to be.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.955
And you get the total amount
of dose imparted to them.

00:16:56.955 --> 00:16:59.080
So a lot of questions came
up in last year's class.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.980
How do we actually do
these calculations?

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.868
Well, this is how right here.

00:17:02.868 --> 00:17:04.910
First, separate out
everything that's a constant.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:06.950
Because you only have
to calculate it once,

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:09.140
as I hope problem set 7
and 6 taught you guys,

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.300
is separate out
whatever you can first,

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.770
and don't repeat yourself.

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:14.540
Then sum over all
the things that

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.520
are unique to each isotope.

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.730
And inside this number
density is the fraction

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.349
of that isotope in every human.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:22.700
So it's all built in.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.983
So these calculations
aren't that bad.

00:17:24.983 --> 00:17:26.650
Since you know how
to do stopping power,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:28.600
you can take out
2/3 of the terms.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.630
I don't know why
I still have this.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:33.760
It's not terrible.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.800
Can anyone not see
through how to do this?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.182
Or yeah, have a question?

00:17:37.182 --> 00:17:39.140
AUDIENCE: Where do we
find the ionization term?

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.560
MICHAEL SHORT: The mean
ionization potential

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:45.940
can be usually approximated
as about 10 electron volts

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.610
times z.

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.790
Except for the very light
isotopes like hydrogen,

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:55.870
it's somewhere
between 10 and 19 eV.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.000
I would say one, you
can just look them up.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.370
Or two, you can use
this empirical relation

00:18:00.370 --> 00:18:03.230
to get a good approximation.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.910
And empiricism definitely enters
into the biological world,

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.590
because uncertainties abound.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.890
And it's not always worth
being ultra crazy exact,

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:15.280
although it can't hurt.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.220
Any other questions on
how to actually carry out

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:20.250
a dose calculation
using stopping power?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.020
Hopefully it's pretty
straightforward.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.900
Guess we'll find
out on the homework.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:31.740
The other quality
factors to mention--

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:34.300
there are some different ideas
about these quality factors.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.780
Notice the scales
are fairly coarse.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.780
So again, there's a lot
of uncertainty or slop

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.200
in these values.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.340
But notice that for, let's
say, X-rays, gammas, betas

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:49.900
of all energies and charges,
the quality factor is 1.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.130
Why do you think that is?

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:59.640
Let's go for the case
of X-rays or gammas.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.340
What tends to be the
attenuation coefficient

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:07.460
of any photon in soft tissue
of considerable energy?

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.990
Pretty low.

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:11.120
And the amount of energy
that can be transferred

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:14.510
by those photons is
variable, anywhere

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.490
from pretty low to pretty high.

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.650
And so the resulting
electron cascade

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.780
isn't going to be that damaging.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:22.940
And it might not even
be that localized.

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:25.910
So let's say if you really
want to know how much damage

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.070
is it going to go do to
the DNA of a cell, where

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:31.730
it could mutate and cause
cancer, not that much.

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.650
Most of the gammas
pass through you,

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.600
and the ones that
do get absorbed

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.900
can have rather long
energy deposition tracks.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:43.650
Neutrons, however, interact
nuclear stopping power.

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.360
Or let's say they just interact
with the nuclei of you,

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:49.100
or whatever they're irradiating.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.690
And so when you
knock out a nucleus,

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.520
it can then slam
into other atoms,

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.210
causing a huge and dense
cascade of ionization.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:20:00.470
If that cascade happens to be
near the nucleus of a cell,

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:03.140
you better believe it's going
to cause a lot of damage.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.260
And that's why these
more energetic neutrons

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.870
have a much higher quality
factor, because they're

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.870
much better at causing
damage until you

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.260
reach some sort of threshold.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.420
Why do you think it goes
down at higher energies?

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.370
Yeah.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:22.890
AUDIENCE: Well, because
there's less of a probability

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:25.240
that it would actually
interact with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:29.150
MICHAEL SHORT: Absolutely.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:33.290
Right around 2 MeV or 1
MeV, these cross sections

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:35.040
tend to go down.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.730
If we look at the cross-section
for neutrons in anything--

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:42.780
let's look at
hydrogen. [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:45.800
still got to do the screen
cloning thing again.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.400
Bear with me.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:52.780
Let's look at any old cross
section for, let's say,

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.613
neutron scattering in,
I don't know, oxygen.

00:20:54.613 --> 00:20:58.080
We've looked at
hydrogen enough already.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:58.580
Cool.

00:20:58.580 --> 00:20:59.510
You can see that.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.350
Oxygen-16.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.280
We have incident neutrons,
elastic scattering,

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.210
the bouncing off.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:18.790
Let's look at the form
of this cross-section.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:24.010
Right around 1 MeV,
things start to dip.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.910
And so yeah, the probability
of any sort of interaction

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.150
is going to go down.

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.930
In addition, the
atom that struck

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:34.670
has a much higher energy,
and therefore a higher range.

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.430
So chances are,
even if the neutron

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.310
strikes an atom
near the nucleus,

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:42.010
it will have a higher range
and can travel farther before

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:46.570
that secondary cascade ends up
depositing most of its damage

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.150
at a lower energy.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:52.060
So if you remember for the
stopping power for ionization

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:56.280
or nuclear stopping power,
they both look the same.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.030
So I'm not going
to label which one.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:22:00.100
It's fairly low
at high energies,

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.280
peaks at a rather low
energy, and then comes down.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.120
So it's at the end of the
range of whatever particle,

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.480
whether it be the neutron
or the atoms that it struck,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.040
that it does the most damage.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.830
So you can kind of think
like all forms of radiation--

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:15.940
except for photons--

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.860
as armor-piercing bullets.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:20.470
They don't do damage
right where they enter.

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:23.627
They do damage right where
they stop and explode.

00:22:23.627 --> 00:22:25.210
In the case of
armor-piercing bullets,

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.800
it's a literal explosion.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.450
In the case of neutrons,
electrons, protons, heavy ions,

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:33.910
it's at the end of their range
they have the most stopping

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:34.410
power.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.910
And that's where the dense
cascade's going to be.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:39.250
So chances are,
again, if a neutron

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:43.270
happens to interact with
the nucleus of a cell--

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:47.020
that's the simplest
cell I can draw--

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:49.390
if a neutron comes in
and strikes another atom,

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:56.318
it may move far away before
its armor-piercing explosion.

00:22:56.318 --> 00:22:57.360
Let's see the other ones.

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:01.530
For protons, depending
on which book you go to,

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.250
you get a different
effectiveness.

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:07.440
It's higher than that of gammas
and X-rays and electrons,

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.050
because you get a big
cascade at the end.

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:13.380
And alpha particles,
really, really, damaging.

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.300
And energy is like
even a few MeV,

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:16.710
they have a very short range.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.350
They tend to deposit
a ton of energy.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.170
And that's why they have
a huge effectiveness.

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.210
This is also why
alphas are the--

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.710
that's the one
cookie you don't want

00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:29.040
to eat, if you guys remember
this, the four cookies problem.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.080
Never eat the alpha.

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:32.940
It's not going to get
in through your skin,

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:34.470
but if it gets
into your body and

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:38.190
incorporated into the
material directly surrounding

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.350
your nucleus, that's how
things go really bad.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:44.070
That's why smoking's so bad.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:46.350
Did anyone end up
getting into a smoke shop

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:48.670
to do that measurement?

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.670
I did check the one by
my house, and they just

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:53.260
put up a sign that
said no one under 21.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:55.500
So you guys are
right about that.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.210
Weird law.

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:58.890
Whatever.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:01.170
Now let's look at the
tissue weighting factors.

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:04.320
We've talked about the
factors for different types

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.370
of radiation.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.250
It also matters what
tissue it enters.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.620
So for things like
skin or bone surface,

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:13.047
you think of these tissues
as not that critical.

00:24:13.047 --> 00:24:14.880
If you get a scratch
and you lose some skin,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.690
it's not that bad for the body.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:19.170
Same thing if a little
bone chip flakes off.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.660
You might get shin splints,
but it's not so bad.

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:23.570
Not for the same reason.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:27.290
These tissues aren't
dividing very fast.

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:29.660
The surface of your
bone, the hard part,

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.610
is basically standing still.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:34.790
It's just calcified minerals
with some osteocytes trapped

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.690
in there.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.310
Not much happens.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:42.350
What's happening in these
tissues constantly--

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:46.333
gonads, bone marrow,
colon, lung, stomach?

00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:47.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] cells.

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.292
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:24:48.292 --> 00:24:51.710
This is where stem cells and
fat-- rapidly dividing cells--

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:53.640
tend to be found.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.240
So there's been some theories
and some papers saying

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.210
whatever cancer you're going to
get, you probably already got

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.460
it in the first
few years of life,

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.580
when you're just a big
rolling sack of stem cells.

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.400
This is part of why
occupational hazards for infants

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:11.680
and pregnant women are much,
much lower, because they

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.660
are giant sacks of
stationary stem cells.

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.660
And you don't want to
irradiate something that's

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.830
dividing really, really fast.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.480
And so the older
you are, the more OK

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.230
it is to get more and
more radiation dose,

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.230
because a lot of these effects
take a long time to manifest.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.330
Because they all start
with a single cell.

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:30.460
And it takes a long time
for that single cell

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:33.970
to exponentially grow and
divide over a longtime scale

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.870
into a mass that be
considered a tumor.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.300
So it's a little
worrying to think, OK,

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:42.352
probably most of the cancer
I'll get I got when I was five.

00:25:42.352 --> 00:25:44.310
But then again, it means,
don't worry about it.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.008
What can you do?

00:25:47.008 --> 00:25:47.550
There's what?

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:48.383
AUDIENCE: It's free.

00:25:48.383 --> 00:25:50.460
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, it's free.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.810
It's done.

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:53.650
Not all of it.

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:55.800
You can still limit your
dose, because well, one,

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.070
any acute radiation exposure
will have short term health

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.910
effects.

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.260
And two, your cells
are still dividing.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.320
As we had a seminar speaker
say, a biological organism

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.750
at static equilibrium
is not very interesting.

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:11.300
It's dead.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.070
It's not dividing anymore.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:14.930
So your cells are
still dividing.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.180
It still means you should
minimize radiation exposure.

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.730
But a lot of what
happened already happened.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.340
And if you can see
here, the pattern

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.890
is the more rapidly
the cells are dividing,

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:29.420
the more it has this
tissue quality factor.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.820
Because the more
quickly these effects

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:34.640
would manifest themselves,
and the more quickly the cells

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.360
may divide with that mutation
before these cellular repair

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.025
mechanisms fix that
mutation before a division.

00:26:42.025 --> 00:26:43.400
We'll get into a
lot of that when

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.890
we talk about biological
effects, probably next week.

00:26:47.890 --> 00:26:50.340
So now, how do you do
a calculation of dose

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:51.750
in Sieverts?

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.890
First you can take the dose in
gray, like we have over here,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.680
multiply by these radiation
weighting factors,

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.810
and you get a total
amount of dose

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.880
to that tissue,
where that tissue may

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.270
be a certain organ, a part
of your muscle, whole body

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.340
if it was a broad blast of
radiation from a bomb far away

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:13.730
or something like that.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:18.480
And you get these
single doses to tissue,

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.570
where each of these
radiation equivalent factors

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:24.810
can be equated to this
average quality factor, where

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.140
you integrate the quality
factor as a function of length

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.780
times the dose at that length.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:33.030
This is where the stopping
power formula comes in,

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:37.110
is you'll have a stopping
power as the energy decreases,

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.300
as the particle moves
through the material.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.400
And its stopping
power will change.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.910
So then you have to integrate
that stopping power times

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:49.530
some constants and stuff over
that distance times the quality

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:54.410
at that distance to get the
simple weighting factor.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.890
You then take these
weighting factors,

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:00.850
plug them into your
dose to tissue,

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.430
and sum up all the exposures
to different tissues.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.420
So each tissue will have
its own dose in Sieverts.

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.790
It'll have its own
tissue weighting factor.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.220
You sum up all the
tissues exposed,

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.220
and you get the total effective
dose to the whole body.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.950
This means that some
organs incur dose

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.910
faster than others for the
same radiation exposure.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:25.647
So the whole body dose
should sum up to 1.

00:28:25.647 --> 00:28:27.730
And I believe-- I remember
doing this calculation,

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:29.790
but it may be worth your
while to just try it.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:31.350
These numbers
should sum up to 1,

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:33.900
because all of these
individual organs

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.897
plus the remainder
of your body should

00:28:36.897 --> 00:28:37.980
constitute the whole body.

00:28:41.543 --> 00:28:42.960
And so this is,
in a nutshell, how

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.670
you do these dose calculations.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.030
So let's take an example
from the actual reading.

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:53.642
Let's say a worker gets 14
milligray of uniform whole body

00:28:53.642 --> 00:28:55.350
dose-- this would just
be from background

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.860
radiation, cosmic
rays, food, whatever--

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.680
plus a targeted
dose of 8 milligray

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:07.250
to the lung from alphas,
plus 180 millgray from betas

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:08.458
in the thyroid.

00:29:08.458 --> 00:29:10.750
Anyone know why they chose
alphas in the lung and betas

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.540
in the thyroid?

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:16.312
What's the most likely
sources of those?

00:29:16.312 --> 00:29:17.590
AUDIENCE: Iodine and nicotine.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Iodine
and let's say smoking.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.660
Yeah.

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:22.630
Yeah, exactly.

00:29:22.630 --> 00:29:25.533
As we saw, a lot of the
radon daughter products

00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:26.950
tend to be alpha
emitters, and you

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:28.690
tend to inhale those
through the lungs.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:33.340
And iodine is a beta decay with
about an eight day half life,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:35.800
and that gets preferentially
absorbed in the thyroid.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.260
So this is a pretty
realistic scenario.

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:43.410
And we'd say, how much effective
dose did this person get?

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:45.240
To do this calculation,
you first-- well,

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:47.010
let's go through those steps.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:51.860
You look at the dose to each
tissue times the effectiveness

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.410
for that type of radiation.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.550
So the dose got 8
milligray of alphas.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:59.780
So you multiply by 20
for that quality factor.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:02.420
And the lung gets
160 millisieverts.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.240
You do the multiplication for
the thyroid, the multiplication

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.560
for the whole body.

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:10.760
And then you do a summation
of these single tissue doses

00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:15.237
here, here, and here, times
the tissue weighting factors,

00:30:15.237 --> 00:30:16.820
which you then look
up from that table

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:20.180
or calculate from the cell
division rate here, here,

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.260
and here.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:24.390
And you get a total dose
of 42 millisieverts.

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:26.360
So I want to point
something out to you guys.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.570
His thyroid got
180 millisieverts.

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:32.210
He got 42 millisieverts.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.900
Interesting.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.090
Sounds a little
counterintuitive.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:38.760
But in this case, these
doses for each tissue

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.290
are calculated for that tissue.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:45.930
So if you have a probability
of organ failure or mutation,

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:48.120
you can now then know
how much increased

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:50.160
risk he may have
of thyroid cancer

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:56.223
specifically, or sum it up to
an equivalent whole body risk.

00:30:56.223 --> 00:30:57.640
And it just so
happens you're only

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.887
allowed about 50
millisieverts of exposure.

00:31:00.887 --> 00:31:02.470
So he'd only be
allowed another eight.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.600
But we'll get into
limits and what

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.460
this ICRU whatever
whatever means.

00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:07.960
I'll actually show
you the document.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.760
It's also posted online.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.620
This International
Committee on Radiation

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.250
U. I forget what the U is.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.350
But this is the
whole document that

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:19.810
has the basis for these
recommendations, the numbers,

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:21.010
and the reasons.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.250
And that's all online for
you guys to check through.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:28.158
So anyone have any questions
on a example dose calculation?

00:31:31.086 --> 00:31:32.070
Cool.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.153
Let's look at some of the
ways that you'd actually

00:31:34.153 --> 00:31:35.620
measure dose.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:37.620
One of them we looked at
the first day of class,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.570
the old Chadwick experiment.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.140
Send radiation through
a fixed amount of area

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.350
so you know the flux.

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:47.520
If you know the total
amount of gammas

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.350
is produced by this X-ray
tube, you know the area,

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.600
then you know the solid angle.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.920
You know the flux.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.890
Then you have just a free air
chamber with a high voltage

00:31:55.890 --> 00:31:58.750
to suck up those ions
before they recombine.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.400
And that's how you can calculate
things like dose in roentgens.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.470
You also have pocket
versions of these things,

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.230
sealed tubes with
two electrically

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:11.320
insulated electrodes.

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:17.230
And that cannot discharge unless
ions in the gas allow them to.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:20.230
And this is the basis behind
these civil defense air wall

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:22.940
chambers, one of which I
happen to have right here.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.730
So I want to pass
this around and let

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.158
you guys take a look at it.

00:32:26.158 --> 00:32:27.700
Like the ones you
saw in the reactor,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.520
you can look through
and see a little needle

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.680
that will tell you the--

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:34.780
not dose, but the
amount of ionization

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.000
this thing has
received in roentgens,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.140
which can then be equated
with some calculations

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.060
to dose in soft tissue.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.670
And also there's the base for
the civil defense dosimeter.

00:32:45.670 --> 00:32:47.920
I want to tell you
guys how it works.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.890
It's a battery.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.633
That's it.

00:32:50.633 --> 00:32:52.050
If you open that
thing up, there's

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:56.460
a couple of big T cells in
there and a voltage divider.

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.640
And you just turn the knob--

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.390
which sounds complicated,
all you're doing

00:33:00.390 --> 00:33:02.280
is turning a potentiometer--

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:07.590
to decide at what voltage this
wire end inside of the tube

00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:08.460
will be.

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.680
And that voltage deflects
the wire a little bit

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:13.710
by just coulombic
attraction or repulsion,

00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:16.020
bends it, and
gives you the dose.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.520
And it stays there.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.970
Nothing can get in or out
of that sealed chamber,

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:23.830
except penetrating radiation.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.880
When gammas or
neutrons get through,

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.190
they can cause
ionizations in the gas.

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.010
Those gas ions can move
to these electrodes,

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:36.630
partially neutralizing them,
making the needle tilt a little

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:38.760
farther and a little farther.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.760
So the interesting thing is when
that needle read 0 roentgens,

00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:43.480
it's fully charged.

00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:47.610
And as the detector discharges
from radiation interactions,

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:49.920
the needle moves higher
on the roentgens scale.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.420
Because you can
paint whatever scale

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.647
you want on it, as long
as the physics works out.

00:33:53.647 --> 00:33:55.980
So it's kind of neat to think
that the charge is highest

00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:57.820
when the dose is lowest.

00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.920
Because all the
charge is doing is

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.390
deflecting that little needle.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:04.930
Quite simple design,
and quite robust.

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:07.790
These things were
designed by civil defense

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:10.800
in case the Cold War
became a hot war,

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.380
and they'd have to last
for a very long time.

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:16.010
So having had this one
for about 10 years,

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.730
I can tell you I've not
yet filled the meter, which

00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:21.300
is probably a good thing.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:24.710
And I took that on flights
across the world and hiking

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.280
in Nepal, where the background
dose was considerably higher.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.580
And the needle moved like half
a roentgen for the entire three

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.969
weeks up at elevation
and plane rides.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:37.300
And I got more dose on the plane
ride than I did on the hike.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.522
Interesting fun fact.

00:34:40.522 --> 00:34:42.480
That's pretty much exactly
what you should see.

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.907
And so Alex tells
me these things

00:34:43.907 --> 00:34:46.449
are starting to get kind of rare
on eBay, and that's a shame.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.940
Because this is the best
possible teaching dosimeter

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.929
there is.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:52.420
If you understand 8.02 and
a little bit of radiation,

00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.475
you know how these work and
can predict what the dose is

00:34:55.475 --> 00:34:56.350
actually going to be.

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:02.660
Now, how do you do things
like detect neutrons?

00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:06.230
If you want to detect neutrons,
you want a good moderator.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.590
Because well moderated neutrons
deposit all their energy

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:12.830
in the detector instead of
bouncing off, transferring

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.360
a little energy, and leaving.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.200
If you want to know how many and
what energy neutrons you have,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:21.440
you can fill a similar chamber
that's got a high voltage.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.240
It's got a wire on the inside.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.050
But instead of air or
some other gas in there,

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.410
you can fill it with things
like ethylene or propylene

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:35.150
or some sort of very hydrogenous
hydrocarbon gas, something

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.180
full of hydrogen to act
as a good moderator.

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.340
That hydrogen ion
then becomes a proton,

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.180
which then damages
a lot of other ions,

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.730
causing an ionization
cascade, and leading

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:50.285
to some current pulse, just
like any other detector.

00:35:50.285 --> 00:35:52.160
There's going to be some
movement of current,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:55.770
which is picked up as damage.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:36:00.355
You might then ask also, why
is that alpha source there?

00:36:00.355 --> 00:36:01.230
Anyone have any idea?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.710
That's your calibration source.

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:15.780
So as the gas in this chamber
is attacked by neutrons,

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.900
you will be blasting
some of the hydrogen

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:21.450
atoms out of the
ethylene or propylene

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.040
or whatever gas you have.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:26.520
The gas will change in
effectiveness over time.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.550
The energy of the alpha
particles will not.

00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:33.450
So that is your absolutely
fixed energy calibration source.

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:35.160
So you know exactly--

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:39.600
if, let's say, 3.72 MeV
alphas make a current pulse

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.900
of a certain height,
then you can equate that

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:47.610
to a 3.72 MeV neutron that
would strike a hydrogen atom.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:49.330
And because the gas
degrades over time,

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.180
you have to recalibrate
with that built-in alpha.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.980
And any sort of shutter--

00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.530
like a little piece of
foil-- will block the alpha

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.540
so that you can use it
as a neutron detector.

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.760
Quite clever design,
in my opinion.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:06.245
It accounts for the degradation
of the gas and the detector.

00:37:06.245 --> 00:37:07.870
Anyone seen one of
these things before?

00:37:11.830 --> 00:37:14.770
Then there's the Geiger counter,
which is an ionization counter

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:17.260
run in avalanche mode.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.260
You can use these free
air ionization chambers

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.370
or other counters as an energy
proportional counter, where

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:28.000
a higher energy particle will
impart a bigger ionization

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.050
cascade.

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:31.780
And you can then use that
to get energy resolution.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.210
Or you crank up the
voltage like crazy,

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.410
so that any count of any energy
causes an intense ionization

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.205
cascade and a huge
current pulse.

00:37:41.205 --> 00:37:43.330
And this is the basis behind
cheap Geiger counters,

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:45.370
like the ones we build
in our department.

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.580
Those old Soviet
SPM 20 tubes that

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:52.240
have actually been survived
being stepped on and crushed.

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:54.970
As long as the electrodes don't
short out, they still work.

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:56.845
So there's a few folks
in the department that

00:37:56.845 --> 00:37:58.548
have clearly bent Geiger tubes.

00:37:58.548 --> 00:38:00.340
One of them looks like
they've been chewed,

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.280
but they still work.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.010
Because any sort of anything
interacting with a gas

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:07.830
will cause an ionization
cascade, which is immediately

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.590
sucked into the electrodes
by a high voltage

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:14.485
and collected as a current pulse

00:38:14.485 --> 00:38:15.860
And that's just
a cutaway of what

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.330
it looks like on the inside.

00:38:17.330 --> 00:38:19.520
And this is the circuit
for a Geiger counter.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.480
There is a voltage, a resistor,
a capacitor, and a tube.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.960
That's all you need.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.670
Everything else in
the MIT Geiger counter

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.280
is there to make
lights and sound.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.930
It's just for fun.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:34.570
But the actual Geiger counter
itself can be made incredibly .

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.960
Compact the bigger the
tube, the more radiation it

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.460
will catch, just
because of its size

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.090
but otherwise, as long as you
get the voltage high enough

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.210
to cause this ionization
cascade, it works.

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:47.335
It's really, really robust.

00:38:49.832 --> 00:38:51.790
So I want to skip ahead
for some of that stuff,

00:38:51.790 --> 00:38:54.640
and then talk about how do
you measure dose in humans.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.150
Who here has seen one of these
TLDs, or Thermoluminescent

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.990
Dosimeters before?

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.850
Our reactor trainees have.

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:03.035
And you've worked on
nuclear stuff too, right?

00:39:03.035 --> 00:39:03.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:05.560
MICHAEL SHORT: You've got one
in the vault. Wait, Kristen,

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.145
what about you,
since you've worked--

00:39:07.145 --> 00:39:09.456
AUDIENCE: We had one with
a little crystal in it.

00:39:09.456 --> 00:39:11.248
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
exactly what this is.

00:39:11.248 --> 00:39:12.467
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:12.467 --> 00:39:13.300
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.175
And you can shake it.

00:39:14.175 --> 00:39:15.287
It rattles, right?

00:39:15.287 --> 00:39:15.870
AUDIENCE: Yep.

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:17.752
[INAUDIBLE]

00:39:17.752 --> 00:39:18.710
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.200
So this is how these work.

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.920
This stands for a
Thermoluminescent Dosimeter.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.900
And converting from
Latin to English,

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.890
that means if you heat it, it
produces light proportional

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:31.570
to the dose that it gets.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.090
So these little
crystals, aluminum oxide

00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:37.060
or some sort of assault
or whatever have you,

00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:43.240
something that creates
permanent ionized defects,

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.210
they will relax when you
heat them, giving off light.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:48.610
And then you use a light
counter to tell how much dose

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:50.380
this crystal has received.

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.890
And by putting different filters
in the way for different pieces

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.508
and looking at the light
coming from different parts,

00:39:56.508 --> 00:39:58.050
you can tell different
types of dose.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:00.700
So one works for
betas, because betas

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:03.130
can get through the little
hole in the detector,

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.430
whereas this may help you figure
out gamma rays or neutrons

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:09.440
of different energies.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.830
And who here has seen
one of these ring badges?

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.790
Yeah, so again, the
reactor trainees.

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:14.780
Great.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.610
If you shake them, you
hear a little rattling.

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:18.900
Try it next time.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:20.460
They're usually pretty loose.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:23.040
It's a cheap plastic
crappy casting

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.848
with a thermal luminescent
crystal in the inside.

00:40:25.848 --> 00:40:26.640
So again, shake it.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.960
It should rattle.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:30.110
If it doesn't, the
crystal might be missing,

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.740
and you should
probably get a new one.

00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:36.620
So when you read a TLD,
you use this fancy machine,

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:39.350
all it does is heat
it very carefully,

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:42.320
and allow the electrons that
are trapped at a higher energy

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:45.840
to jump back down,
emitting visible light.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.340
That's it.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.410
We've seen this process before.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.810
What happens after the
photoelectric effect?

00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:52.670
Electrons fall down
an energy and release

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.480
light in the form of
X-rays or visible light.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.947
Same thing.

00:40:58.947 --> 00:41:00.530
And then let's talk
about, how can you

00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:03.950
use dosimeters for dosimetry
in medical applications?

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:06.440
And let's take the
example of proton beam

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:09.800
therapy, the new and
more upcoming replacement

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.330
to X-ray therapy.

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:14.240
It relies on the fact that
the stopping power of protons

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.050
is extremely low, until they
reach the end of their range,

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.090
like we talked about here.

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:23.360
So again, we use protons
as armor-piercing bullets

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.400
to get through the
person, drilling

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.800
a little hole in the
process, and exploding

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.390
once they reach the tumor.

00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:30.680
It's a nice quirk of physics.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.830
It's really an elegant
use of the stuff in 22.01

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:36.840
to do damage where
you want it to.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.872
There's all sorts of other
methods of cancer treatment.

00:41:39.872 --> 00:41:41.580
Let's say you're
simple, and you can just

00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.680
go with excision, which
means cutting it out.

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:45.900
Chemotherapy, which is
a pretty nasty process,

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.200
and is usually used as a
backup for radiation therapy

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.620
to catch whatever else
might be floating.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.920
X-ray therapy, which is still
used a lot, but hopefully

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.480
will get phased out a bit.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.710
Brachytherapy, where you
implant a little seed of a beta

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:05.100
emitter into an area
near where the tumor is.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.685
Let's say you have an easy
route of entry, like that way.

00:42:08.685 --> 00:42:10.560
Then you can implant
one of these seeds right

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.430
where the tumor is.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.110
But if you can't have
an easy route of entry,

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:18.043
that's where proton
therapy comes in.

00:42:18.043 --> 00:42:19.710
And as we've talked
about X-ray therapy,

00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:23.700
if you want to damage the tumor
more than the rest of the brain

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.320
or the rest of the
person, you have

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.300
to come in from
different angles so

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.400
that the sum of all
the dose to this target

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.570
is less than anywhere else.

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:34.560
And X-ray therapy tends
to do a lot of damage.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.530
Well, you hear of X-ray therapy
causing hair loss in people.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.760
Well, yeah.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.160
You're going through the head.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:45.150
It's not good for your
hair follicles, either.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:46.560
And then there's proton therapy.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.270
We've talked about
it before, but not

00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:49.740
in the strict medical sense.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:51.720
And actually I'm going
to reveal to you guys

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:54.390
an invention that we've got out
of our department that might

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.903
help this go a little better.

00:42:55.903 --> 00:42:58.320
The way it works is you start
with a cyclotron, which I've

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:00.195
already explained,
something that accelerates

00:43:00.195 --> 00:43:03.175
charged particles
to about 250 MeV.

00:43:03.175 --> 00:43:05.550
And we have one of these across
the river at Mass General

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:06.980
Hospital.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.740
Send them through
bending magnets,

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.600
and bend them up so that
they hit the patient.

00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:16.400
Then you move the patient
on this gurney or table

00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:19.040
so that-- and the entryf
can rotate anywhere,

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.930
to come in from any
entry point, minimize

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.880
the dose to the
rest of the patient,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.300
while frying the tumor.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:26.760
AUDIENCE: Is that
a scale diagram?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:29.304
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep, quite big.

00:43:29.304 --> 00:43:32.290
Yeah.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:34.870
It's pretty to scale, yeah.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:38.630
So time on this instrument
runs in the thousands per hour.

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.960
If you go through the back
door and know the folks that

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.640
run the thing and
no one is not being

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:43.907
used for cancer treatments.

00:43:43.907 --> 00:43:45.490
Proton therapy can
run in the hundreds

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:46.490
of thousands of dollars.

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:48.073
This is one of the
millions of reasons

00:43:48.073 --> 00:43:49.375
we have medical insurance.

00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:51.490
It's because when you
need it, you want it.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:55.280
And these cyclotrons
aren't cheap.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:56.780
The way they work
is pretty simple.

00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:00.770
You inject ionized particles
through these D magnets,

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:04.070
and they go faster and faster
and faster every time they

00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.960
cross this electric field.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.630
They bend at larger
and larger tracks

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.930
through these magnets as
their energy increases.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:13.280
Than they exit out the
other side, getting

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.780
delivered to the patient.

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.470
And why protons versus X-rays?

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.870
Well, I made it
quick Desmos graph.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.280
To say, let's say
you started off

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.430
with a equivalent dose
of protons and X-rays,

00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.680
and you're trying to get to
a 40 millimeter deep tumor.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:29.680
This is why.

00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:31.430
This is the amount of
dose that the X-rays

00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:33.710
would give compared
to the protons

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:36.277
in this highlighted
tumor region.

00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:38.360
Then you look at the dose
where X-rays and protons

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:39.652
give to the rest of the person.

00:44:39.652 --> 00:44:43.390
It should be
graphically obvious.

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:45.540
And you can do some tricks
with proton therapy.

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:49.320
If you have a lung tumor, you
can vary the energy and time

00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:52.320
at each point, such that
you give a uniform dose

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.370
to the tumor.

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:54.960
So you can move that
[? Bragg ?] peak

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:59.040
by degrading the proton energy,
by putting filters in line

00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:00.090
with the beam.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.620
You don't tend to like to
change the energy of the beam.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.710
So you can put things in
the way of the protons

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:06.270
to slow them down.

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.940
And because when the
stopping power is very low,

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.760
the proton speed's very
high, and forward scattering

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.490
is preferable, putting
things in the way of the beam

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:16.290
pretty much just
slows them down,

00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:19.112
but doesn't change
their direction.

00:45:19.112 --> 00:45:21.320
That assumption breaks down
when the energy gets low.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:23.240
But when the energy gets low,
you better be in the tumor

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:23.910
anyway.

00:45:23.910 --> 00:45:26.780
And you want them to change
direction and explode out

00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:30.350
and blast everything in sight.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:33.230
The problem with
proton therapy is

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.630
that humans are not
biological organisms

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:37.820
at static equilibrium.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.190
In other words, they're alive.

00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:40.690
They tend to move.

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.720
Breathing is something I
like to do every few seconds.

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:46.170
Swallowing, maybe once
every couple of minutes.

00:45:46.170 --> 00:45:47.830
And most of your
organs move around

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:50.343
and dance without
you controlling them.

00:45:50.343 --> 00:45:52.010
It's really hard if
you're trying to hit

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:54.350
a tumor on a moving target.

00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:57.300
That is the main problem
with proton therapy.

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.710
The solution right now, I like
to call it spray and pray.

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.870
You fire into the person,
hope that things don't move.

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:05.350
We know that they do though.

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.580
Those proton beams
are very narrow.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.010
And let's say, for
abdominal patients,

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.080
let's say you happen to
be digesting something.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.750
Your intestines will just
go krschlock like that

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.617
and get lunch where it's going.

00:46:16.617 --> 00:46:18.200
This is one of those
reasons that they

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.050
say don't eat anything
before these procedures.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:23.510
If you're not actively
digesting things,

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:26.460
then your abdomen won't
be moving as much.

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.960
Thoracic patients, better known
as the lungs or your thorax,

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:31.760
if you're from France.

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.760
My wife likes to make--

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.010
I like to make fun of my wife.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.552
That's right.

00:46:34.552 --> 00:46:36.920
Because she still refers to
this region as the thorax.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.230
And I was like, I am
not a giant beetle.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.930
But it is the medical
term for this.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:43.550
You tend to breathe.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:45.240
And if you actually
measure how much

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.000
you move when you
breathe in and out--

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.833
let's say you're trying
to fry a lung tumor.

00:46:48.833 --> 00:46:50.300
That's a tricky proposition.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.550
So how do you keep
the protons on track?

00:46:53.550 --> 00:46:56.910
Ideally, some dosimeter
would be able to determine

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:01.110
absolute dose, and
it would be able to--

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.320
where on this list
of things is--

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.540
oh, there's even more
things I'd want here.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.430
So ideally, if you'd
want a proton dosimeter,

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:10.950
you want it to be able to
measure things, provide

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:16.050
some data, not be orientation
dependent, and things like not

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:18.600
be toxic, be cheap
to build, but also

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.380
be able to turn on and off if
the tumor moves out of range.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.330
And this problem
hasn't been solved yet.

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:28.060
Existing dosimetry
methods include

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:31.480
making calculations and hoping,
which is what we do now.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.760
We do complex Monte
Carlo calculations

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.980
based on scans of
the patient, try

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.000
and map out how much
energy is going to be lost

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.280
and where to go in.

00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.930
There's conventional
port films, which

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:44.080
means you put a film on the
entry of the patient, which

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.390
gives you an idea of
where the beam is, but not

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:47.965
necessarily where the organ is.

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.840
Let me get into some
pictures of these things

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.310
so you know what they look like.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:54.660
Anyone ever put one of
these in your mouth before?

00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:57.370
The sort of electronic
dosimeters, the X-ray

00:47:57.370 --> 00:47:58.870
imagers that you
get at the dentist,

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:00.850
you bite down on one
of these, and you

00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:02.260
get X-rays of your teeth.

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:04.210
That's great if you have
a place to put them,

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:06.790
but doesn't quite work
for proton therapy.

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:08.290
There are tissue
equivalent gels,

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:12.700
where you can cast a person in
gel, fire in the proton beam,

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.495
and see how deep
it goes, and then

00:48:14.495 --> 00:48:16.120
hope that your tissue
equivalent gel is

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.950
equivalent to the tissue.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:20.680
Usually it's pretty good.

00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.790
There's silicon diodes.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:26.080
You can implant a tiny little
diode or other semiconductor

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.930
device near or in the
patient, and measure

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:31.660
the change in band
gap, or the voltage

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:35.350
required to turn on conduction
in the semiconductor.

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:37.470
The problem is you can
only use them once.

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:40.113
Once you irradiate a piece
of silicon, it's irradiated.

00:48:40.113 --> 00:48:41.530
And then you would
have to take it

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:44.800
out and stick another
one in with a big needle

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.830
to keep going.

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.930
There's optically
stimulated luminescence,

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.430
which means protons hit stuff.

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:52.870
Stuff creates light.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:54.760
Light can be measured
in real time.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:59.190
So you could implant a
little crystal like this TLD

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:01.090
or Thermoluminescent
Dosimeter, attached

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.250
to a fiber optic cable.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:06.220
And in that way, you can
measure the amount of light

00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:07.390
and preamplify it.

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.190
PM means-- what is it--

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.110
Photo Multiplier tube.

00:49:11.110 --> 00:49:14.320
And use electronics and
software to calculate that light

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.090
and turn it into dose.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.690
Problem is, this scintillation,
it's not very strong.

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:22.090
There's a lot that can
go wrong between where

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:26.860
the radiation is done and
where it can be collected.

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.700
Also implanted MOSFETs are
these metal oxide semiconductor

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:32.650
field effect transistors.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:33.850
Same problem.

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:37.035
You can look at the
change in difference--

00:49:37.035 --> 00:49:38.410
I'm sorry, the
change in band gap

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:40.997
as you irradiate these things,
or in the MOSFET voltage.

00:49:40.997 --> 00:49:42.580
But again, you can
only use them once.

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.025
It's not like you
can reset them.

00:49:45.025 --> 00:49:46.400
So the problems
with all of these

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.957
is we don't know what
dose the tumor gets.

00:49:48.957 --> 00:49:50.540
If we know how much
we need to fry it,

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:53.810
but we don't know if we fried
it, the cancer could recur.

00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:56.360
Or it may not respond
to the radiation.

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:59.090
These are liability terms
to say it didn't work,

00:49:59.090 --> 00:50:01.580
but you can't sue us,
because we don't know why.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:02.960
And you don't know why.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.170
Or you may apply too much
dose to the surrounding tissue

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.360
and induce secondary tumors.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:10.550
This is one of those things
that's not talked about

00:50:10.550 --> 00:50:12.440
very much, except
in medical circles,

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.627
and my entire family happens
to be in medical circles.

00:50:15.627 --> 00:50:17.210
So they confirmed,
yeah, this is true.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:20.460
We don't know how many
times, if you treat a tumor,

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.040
or do you induce
another one that

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.740
will pop up five years
later in the same site.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:28.100
All you may think is, OK,
it recurred, despite being

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.285
dead for five years.

00:50:29.285 --> 00:50:30.410
It might not have recurred.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:33.030
It might have made a new one.

00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:35.590
You don't know the
dose rate versus time.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:39.630
The existing in situ methods
haven't worked very well.

00:50:39.630 --> 00:50:41.040
So we had another
idea, that I'll

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:43.110
go in the last
negative 1 minutes,

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:46.680
what we call the integrating
F-Center Feedback Dosimeter.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:49.290
We just got the
patent filed on this.

00:50:49.290 --> 00:50:51.990
Not accepted, but filed
with the US Patent Office.

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.490
It's pretty simple.

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.270
You send in calibrated
light into a little crystal

00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:01.470
of something that creates these
color centers, or F-centers.

00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:03.930
When it's irradiated, look
at the light coming out.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:05.130
See what's absorbed.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:08.310
You know how much
dose you've received.

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:10.650
And so look at
these three parts.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:13.420
A is just an alkali
halide salt, better known

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:15.490
as table salt, sodium chloride.

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:19.090
B is some biocompatible casing
so your body doesn't reject it.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:23.140
Calibrated white light source,
fiber optic connection cables,

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.910
and a spectrometer to
read the absorption.

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:28.180
These can be little
compact USB spectrometers.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.310
And it relies on what's
called F-centers.

00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:34.060
When you irradiate ionic
materials, they change color.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.910
These defects produced by,
let's say, blasting out

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:39.730
a chlorine ion or a
sodium or potassium ion

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.310
are optically active.

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.260
Because you get differing
regions of electron density.

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.600
And you absorb certain
wavelengths of light

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.950
changing their color.

00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:49.960
If you then send calibrated
light through it,

00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.150
you can tell what happened,
how much dose there was.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:55.140
And F-center creation
versus radiation

00:51:55.140 --> 00:51:57.000
is extremely well known.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.610
We've actually done some
preliminary tests on the Dante

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:02.610
accelerator here to show that
the amount of dose that you

00:52:02.610 --> 00:52:05.670
give in a fractional cancer
treatment on the order

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:09.690
of a kilogray or so does
cause the salt to respond very

00:52:09.690 --> 00:52:11.460
strongly and produce a color.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:13.770
And the best part is,
they relax on their own.

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:16.290
After anywhere from 5
seconds to a few hours,

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:17.970
the color just disappears.

00:52:17.970 --> 00:52:19.380
Because the atomic
defects relax.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:24.370
So you don't have to implant,
remove, reimplant, remove.

00:52:24.370 --> 00:52:26.590
And you can enable
dose rate information

00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.330
by putting multiple
salts in a row that

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:31.600
have different response
levels to these protons.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.840
So by looking at the amount of
absorption in each wavelength,

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:37.210
you can tell not just the
dose, but the dose rate.

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:40.557
Calibrate your beam current.

00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:42.390
And I'm going to skip
all the way to the end

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:43.780
to say how this would work.

00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.160
So let's say you had one of
these IF2D dosimeters implanted

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.530
in your tumor, and
your heart was beating,

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.530
or your lungs were breathing,
or you were digesting something.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.300
You could then feedback
this information

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:56.910
to the proton accelerator
to shut the beam off

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:59.010
when the tumor
moves out of range

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:02.560
and send in tiny little pulses
to say, hey, are you there?

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:06.930
Little micro second pulses to
say, microsecond of protons

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:08.230
isn't going to do much.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:12.310
But if it senses the
IF2D back in range,

00:53:12.310 --> 00:53:14.440
it then blasts continuously.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:17.430
And as soon as the
IF2D says no more dose,

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:20.340
it starts just putting those
wake up pulses back on.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.560
So this would be the
first feedback way

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:25.860
to apply proton therapy
without screwing it up.

00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:28.890
You could also install
IF2D dosimeters

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:32.490
near the tumor,
outside the tumor,

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.490
and play the world's first
game of radioactive proton

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:36.630
Operation.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.580
Don't hit the sides.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:40.620
If you wonder if your
beam's on target,

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:43.260
you then steer it until it
doesn't hit any of the IF2Ds,

00:53:43.260 --> 00:53:45.930
and you know you're right
through the gates on the tumor.

00:53:45.930 --> 00:53:48.390
Very important for
certain sensitive tumors,

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:50.760
like chordomas,
spinal cord tumors,

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:55.650
which tend to happen in
infants and young children.

00:53:55.650 --> 00:53:57.810
There's various ways
of treating those,

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.930
other than removal of the neck,
what you don't want to do.

00:54:00.930 --> 00:54:02.912
They're extremely
difficult to operate on.

00:54:02.912 --> 00:54:04.620
You don't want to give
radiation therapy.

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:07.050
So highly targeted
proton therapy

00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:08.910
like this, making
sure that you fry

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.560
the tumor without
the surrounding

00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:13.740
spinal cord and medulla,
would be probably

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:15.770
the way to go for this.

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:18.060
So I'm going to stop there,
because it's exactly 10.

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.000
It's also the perfect
stopping point.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.138
And we'll pick up with
background radiation tomorrow.

00:54:24.138 --> 00:54:25.930
I also want to let you
guys know that we'll

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:30.550
be doing our nuclear activation
analysis irradiations Friday

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:33.910
at the beginning of recitation,
and we'll finish up recitation

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.360
by doing the exam review.

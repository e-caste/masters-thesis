00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.200
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So let's get started today.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.820
Again, the topic is fare policy,
structure, and technology.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.420
So we'll cover policy
objectives, the issues

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.140
that agencies face,
fare structure,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.150
demand response to fare
changes and fare technology.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.810
So what are the
objectives of fare policy?

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.850
There are multiple objectives,
and they don't necessarily

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.930
support each other.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.680
In fact, they often
go against each other.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.340
So the number one objective
is to fund operations.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.250
That's the reason there's
a user fee for service.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.660
And I say here at
least partially

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.840
because for the most part,
the revenues obtained

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.290
by fare collection do not cover
the full operational costs,

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.280
let alone capital costs.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.990
So here we have some examples
of fare recovery ratios

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.965
based on the 2014
National Transit Database.

00:01:18.965 --> 00:01:20.660
Now, you might
remember that we talked

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.310
about the National
Transit Database

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.870
earlier in this course.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.370
And here is a breakdown.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.940
I looked at all
heavy rail and I saw

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.770
a range of between 0.14 0.78.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.525
So between 14% and 78%
of operational expenses

00:01:35.525 --> 00:01:39.260
are covered by fare revenue.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.500
The highest one here
is in California.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.327
For light rail a little lower
and for bus all over the place.

00:01:47.327 --> 00:01:48.410
Here we have the averages.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.880
These tend to be higher
for rail and lower for bus.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.130
So why is that?

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.044
Why would that be the case?

00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:58.460
AUDIENCE: On an
operational level,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.270
one rail driver is carrying
a lot more passengers

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.919
than one bus driver.

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:05.210
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.684
Although you can
fill up a bus, right?

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:15.100
AUDIENCE: You can fill up a
bus [INAUDIBLE] train carrying

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.770
500 passengers.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.160
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.270
Yeah.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.820
Yeah.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.560
Yeah.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.020
So to sort of go
back to my rebuttal,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.010
there are some buzzers here with
fare recovery ratios over one.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.370
So it's possible to have a bus
service that returns profit

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.100
even.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.020
So why is it that
system-wide, bus services

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.960
tend to have lower
fare recovery ratios?

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.390
Because you have a good point,
the productivity of rail

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.710
can be higher.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.680
Of course, if rail
is underutilized,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.660
then you still have that issue.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.040
Any other ideas?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.324
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:58.140
AUDIENCE: Buses [INAUDIBLE]
who can have the most service

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.587
and cover the most
low ridership routes?

00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:02.920
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.110
So there's an agency
and you system-wide

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.360
have to cover your territory.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.590
That will include buses that
are not very heavily utilized.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.521
Also, you're
providing service late

00:03:13.521 --> 00:03:14.770
at night and all those things.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.540
So there are many cases of buses
not being very well utilized,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.180
and that brings down
the fare recovery ratio.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.650
I did not include here
demand responsive.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.250
Demand responsive is
usually around 1% to 2%.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.680
So I'm talking about
what here in Boston

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.080
is called the ride for
disabled passengers.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.360
And it can cost
around $20 per ride,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.920
and people pay a lot less.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.897
So I think $20 is low.

00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:49.730
I think it's higher.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.450
Sorry.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.060
I don't remember the number,
but it's closer to $30 or $40,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.990
I think.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.630
So the fare recovery ratio
for demand responsive transit

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.870
is much lower.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.370
OK.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.840
So other goals.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.640
Keep transit affordable
and promote social equity.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.940
So here we have the
first conflicts, right?

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.030
The first objective would mean
that you want to raise fares,

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.000
and if you raise fares then
you get more fare revenue.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.500
But there's another
objective, which

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.410
is to keep transit affordable
and for social equity,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.019
and that would indicate that
you want to keep fares low.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.850
Right?

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.780
So also, supporting growth
for demand of transit

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.630
also keeps fares low.

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.180
Make the fare structure
easy to communicate.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.060
We'll talk about different
fare structures and market

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.050
segmentation later
in this lecture.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.880
But the point is that when
you do market segmentation,

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.560
you can get more revenue
out of your fare system.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.420
When you want to
keep things simple,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.300
then you're probably going to
suggest going for a flat fare

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.900
structure, where people that
have much higher willingness

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.120
to pay are still
paying low fares.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.240
So that objective
of keeping the fare

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.090
structure easy to
communicate and simple

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.670
will reduce fare earnings.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.170
And finally, to reduce
fare system costs.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.640
So there are costs
to fare collection

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.650
and to the fare
system as a whole.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.950
Fare collection is one of them.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.440
So obviously, the capital cost
of installing the fare boxes

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.770
and maintaining the
whole AFC system.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.800
There is a cost for people
who are maintaining those fare

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.000
boxes and vaulting cash
out of the fare boxes

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.630
and counting the cash and
keeping it in a safe place.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.950
And there's customer service.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.940
So customer service involves
more than the fare system.

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.830
But some aspects
of customer service

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.750
involve my CharlieCard doesn't
work, can I get a new one?

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.510
Or I already paid
for that ride and you

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.260
need to give me a refund.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.930
So these kinds of
inquiries or complaints

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.900
are coming from the fare system.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:57.400
OK?

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.060
Questions about
these objectives?

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.560
No.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.360
OK.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.770
So how does fare policy
intersect with other areas?

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.400
It intersects with many areas,
and that makes fare policy

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.530
and fare structure a very
powerful sort of lever or knob

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.170
for a transit agency.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.390
So obviously, finance.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.400
We're talking about funding
operational expenses

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.520
from the revenues derived
from the fare system.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.820
And then there's operations.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.630
So if you have a fare policy
that makes people board faster

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.100
because, for example,
it's proof of payments

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.920
so there's no
validation required

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.790
or you have fare technology
that a smart card is

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.820
much faster than
paying cash, then

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.340
that means that you'll have
faster boarding, shorter dwell

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.430
times, shorter cycle
times, higher reliability.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.800
So you might affect operations
through fare technology.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.470
Some fare structures
require fare inspection.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.070
So proof of payment is
one that people board

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.570
without interacting
with any fare system,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.490
so then an inspector
has to come in

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.140
and either for all
passengers or more likely

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.320
for a subset of passengers, a
sample of passengers, request

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:12.350
proof of having paid the fare.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.680
And of course, that
involves some cost.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.096
There's maintenance
of equipment.

00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.470
If equipment breaks
down, the bus

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.220
needs to be taken out
of service, et cetera.

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.130
Public support.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.990
So politicians may
promise not raising fares.

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:28.812
That's a popular
campaign promise.

00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:30.770
And then of course, that
puts a lot of pressure

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.650
on the agency to
do more with less.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.140
And we'll talk more
about that when

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.820
we discuss transit finance.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.230
There's difficulty gathering
support to raise fares.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:45.190
Usually, we'll
improve service first

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.580
and then that justifies
raising fares.

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:48.080
Right?

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.060
I don't want my service
to get more expensive

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.956
if it's not very good service.

00:07:52.956 --> 00:07:54.937
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:54.937 --> 00:07:56.270
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.270
And essentially, if you
have lower service quality,

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:01.761
then fewer people end up
taking it or liking it,

00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:03.260
and those people
are not going to be

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:09.260
the ones rallying for a
transit sort of fare hike.

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.627
Then there's also labor's
push for higher wages.

00:08:11.627 --> 00:08:13.460
So that's another sort
of political pressure

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.090
on the agency that
increases operational costs

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.360
and therefore, may require
an increase in fares.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.140
But both a labor
dispute and a dispute

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.900
with the passengers
on the fare hike

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.210
are the result of unpleasant
negotiations or interactions

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.770
in public.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.907
Administration, so fare
technology and fare policy

00:08:36.907 --> 00:08:37.740
and equity analysis.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.750
If you're considering any
change to technology or policy

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:45.020
or structure, you have to
analyze the economic aspects

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:51.170
of it and you have to
prove that you're not

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:54.850
discriminating against any one
group, even unintentionally.

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:58.430
So disproportionately affecting
a disadvantaged community,

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:05.480
either by race or income, that's
called Title VI in the US.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.850
Then there's another
big policy issue

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.160
is revenue sharing
across jurisdictions.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.840
Not so much an issue on the east
coast of the US, but certainly

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.590
if you go to the West Coast, you
have in the San Francisco Bay

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.050
Area dozens of operators.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.180
Some of them share
the same fare system.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:29.570
So how much does
each operator pay

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.780
for routes that serve
multiple jurisdictions?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.410
That's one question.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:39.760
The other question might be,
if we are separate operators

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.710
and we each have a route
so we take care of that,

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:46.430
we still are collecting
fares with a joint system.

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.780
Do we trust each other?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.530
And often, actually, the
barriers to integration

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:55.770
are more about trust and
less about technology.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:57.904
Marketing is another
sort of issue

00:09:57.904 --> 00:09:59.070
the agency has to deal with.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:02.640
How much do they market
and what is the message?

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.460
And customer service,
which we already mentioned.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:07.260
It's interesting
to note that fares

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.390
are one of the first
things that a person

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:11.901
has to sort of understand
about a transit system

00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:12.900
to be able to take them.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.160
So if you're a tourist
and you go to a new city

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.670
that you've never been to
before you arrive at the airport

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:20.430
and you want to take the bus
or the train from the airport,

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:21.804
the first thing
you have to do is

00:10:21.804 --> 00:10:24.240
buy a ticket, right, and
figure out the fare structure

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.570
and where are the
maps and et cetera.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.840
So this is sort of one
of the first issues,

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:33.450
the first impression that a
passenger has about the fare

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:36.390
system, about the
transit agency, something

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.720
related to the fare system.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.220
OK.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.800
What issues do agencies
face regarding these topics?

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.420
One is fare recovery ratios.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:48.390
So we looked at ranges.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.790
Typically, fare recovery
ratio system-wide across modes

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:52.200
is about 1/3.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.940
It varies a lot, as we saw.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.160
It's rare to make
a profit system.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.120
So one of the
issues is how much--

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.030
well, the first question is, how
much of a fare recovery ratio

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:09.720
do we need or do we set a goal
to cover operational expenses?

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.930
And is it sort of a
strong requirement,

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.420
as it is in some agencies?

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.540
Some agencies have laws that
say the fare recovery ratio must

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:19.950
be at least this much.

00:11:19.950 --> 00:11:24.270
So if expenses go up,
automatic fare hike.

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:28.640
Others, it's more of a guideline
or maybe there is no policy.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.150
So that that's one
of the key issues.

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.630
The second one is how
often to raise fares.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.270
I think most agencies
are reactive.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.370
So a reactive
approach is one where

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.220
you avoid the headache
of a fare hike

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.110
and all the sort of public
engagement that goes with it

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.590
and you only do that
when you have to so

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:54.600
you are in a financial
situation where you absolutely

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.880
need to raise fare revenues
to continue operating.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.370
So that happens less
than once every year

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:05.280
and it's a big effort.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.400
Some agencies take the
approach of an annual fare

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.196
hike with inflation.

00:12:10.196 --> 00:12:11.820
So it's kind of
predictable, it happens

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.380
every year at the same date.

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.590
It tends to make each
one easier than one

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.160
done ad hoc because
it's more expectable

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:23.420
and there's less public outrage.

00:12:26.222 --> 00:12:28.180
So gathering and maintaining
political support,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.910
we talked a little
bit about that.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.270
Of course, that is an issue that
will play out and sort of it

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:40.570
will affect how other issues
are faced and dealt with.

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.030
One other issue is do
we raise base fares

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:47.680
or do we change the relative
cost of passes and discounted

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.980
fare products?

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.300
So if a base fare
is $2, you might

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:57.610
have 50% subsidy
for seniors and you

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.570
might have some other discounts
for students or other groups.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.600
You might also have passes
like a weekly pass, which

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.210
if you take some number
of trips you break even

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.160
and after that, you ride free.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.880
So you might actually leave
the base fare the same

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.350
and change the percentages
of subsidy or discounts

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.020
or the break even
point of a pass.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.550
And that can affect
fare revenues,

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:24.010
it can affect ridership, and
it can affect people's choice

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.700
of fare product.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:32.980
So you might bump people towards
letting go of fare passes

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:37.480
and opting to do pay as you
go more often or the other way

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.240
around.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.910
And that has implications
on how people

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:45.520
think about the transit system,
how much it costs for them.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:49.330
For a pass holder, of course,
once they've paid for it,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.630
it's kind of a
non-salient expense.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:55.350
So you don't think
about it every time

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:59.770
you're tapping as much as having
value deducted from the card

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.280
every time.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:04.732
So those people might
ride opportunistically

00:14:04.732 --> 00:14:06.190
because they've
already paid for it

00:14:06.190 --> 00:14:09.460
and they might do shorter
trips, discretionary trips

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.680
more so than someone
who is paying

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.524
every fare independently.

00:14:14.524 --> 00:14:15.940
And another big
issue is investing

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.050
in new fare technology.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.090
That's a headache,
a big headache.

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:23.610
You can imagine changing the
way the old technology, all

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:28.090
the analytics and administration
depends on uncertain system.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.840
And bringing in a new system
that nobody understands yet

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.410
might work or not.

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.220
So all the maintenance
needs to be figured out.

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.310
And you have to communicate with
the public about what impact

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.760
that has on them, and
that could involve changes

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.760
in the fare structure,
not just the technology.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.820
So sometimes technology enables
new fare structures or new fare

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:49.890
policies.

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.400
And that can be
one of the reasons

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.130
for bringing new technology.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.844
Questions on the issues?

00:14:55.844 --> 00:14:56.475
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:56.475 --> 00:14:57.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:57.100 --> 00:15:02.370
I wonder if the
rising fare issue

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.620
is less common in
privately operated system

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.954
than in public operated systems.

00:15:07.954 --> 00:15:10.161
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Can you give me an example?

00:15:10.161 --> 00:15:11.910
I'm not sure I
follow the question.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.680
AUDIENCE: In systems where
bus and rail are exceptions

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.717
to the private sector.

00:15:15.717 --> 00:15:17.050
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.390
Sometimes the public
sector is the one--

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.960
so if you look at
the case of London,

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.930
for example, even though
buses are operated

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:31.060
by private companies in
some way it's a contract

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.150
so the fare policy
is still set by TFL,

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:36.430
which is the government.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.470
That's I think usually
the case if you

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:45.520
have a push for a unified
single brand of the system.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:46.930
Maybe in other countries--

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.110
I'm thinking more of
Latin America, Africa--

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.790
there are sort of
independent people

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:53.750
running their own systems.

00:15:53.750 --> 00:15:56.200
And those are usually
cash-based so there's

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.740
no integration whatsoever.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:00.585
Maybe you have a
different example.

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:01.380
AUDIENCE: But No.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.750
Still [INAUDIBLE] just
[INAUDIBLE] the government.

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:09.440
So I wonder if the type
of contracts [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.590
engage with the private
[INAUDIBLE] concessions.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.900
I mean, there is a difference.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.640
There is a myriad of
types of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:22.820
I wonder if that allows you more
flexibility to sort of delay

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.580
because you're under a contract
with a specific [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.420
negotiation [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:32.480
So I wonder if that give you
leverage to delay increasing

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:35.135
fares, as opposed to--

00:16:35.135 --> 00:16:36.760
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I'm not sure.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.260
Frankly, I'm not sure.

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:43.210
Sort of the issues related
to concessions in that case

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:45.700
depend a lot on the
contract structure.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:52.300
So some concessions derive
revenue from the fare.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.400
I think that's not the
best way of doing it.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.370
But if that's how the
contract is structured,

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:59.930
essentially, you say,
I want you to operate.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.870
You keep the fares.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:06.430
Then of course, any fare
question will affect revenues

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:09.250
and it will affect
ridership too.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:13.510
So the private operator will be
interested in any kind of fare

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:16.900
policy change if that
increases their revenues

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.210
and will be disinterested in
any fare policy change that

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.760
decreases their revenues, or
increases the risk of revenue

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:25.260
anyway.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.750
So that is probably
a poisonous topic

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.640
during the length of
a contract and you

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.780
might have to then do
it between contracts.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.090
Here I'm speculating,
but I imagine

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:42.800
this is a case where you
pay to run by distance

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.070
or you might have some
performance standards as well,

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:46.660
but it's not fare so much.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.580
So the government
keeps the fares

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:51.490
and then pays the operators
the contracted amount.

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:56.770
Then that disconnects the
operator's performance

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:00.820
from fare revenue and it allows
the government or the planning

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:06.140
agency to change the fare
structure, change fare

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.960
technology in the
middle of a contract.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.370
And so in the former case, I
imagine it's quite complicated.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:19.420
Because usually, the contracts
are not awarded on cycle, i.e.,

00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:22.000
at a certain moment in time
you might have a contract that

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.100
expires next month; another
one that expires in a year;

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:27.010
another one that
expires in five years.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.710
So to implement a
system-wide change,

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:32.010
it would be very
difficult if the contracts

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.945
depend on the fare revenues.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:38.536
Yeah.

00:18:38.536 --> 00:18:39.590
AUDIENCE: So a
couple of questions.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.000
One, it seems like one of
the biggest choices you make

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.550
is whether to have
[INAUDIBLE] whether to have

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.710
a flat or a zoned fare.

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.940
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.023
And we're going to talk
about market segmentation.

00:18:48.023 --> 00:18:48.780
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:55.810
And then about raising fares,
I see that the MTA in New York

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:58.300
battles to raise
fares, so I think

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.950
flow is really hard for them,
whereas when I lived London,

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:03.230
literally every single year on
January 1st, the fare changed.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.390
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.370
So that goes back
this sort of annually

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:08.130
with inflation and strategy
where you do it every year

00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:10.877
and it just happens
on January 1st.

00:19:10.877 --> 00:19:12.960
AUDIENCE: People get a big
grumpy, but [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.500
about it.

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.833
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:16.242
Right.

00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:17.760
And there are many
other examples

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.490
of that kind of approach.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.250
I think it's more
effective, frankly.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:26.520
Expenses go up every
year, so why not?

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:30.180
Communicate what the
strategy is, make it fair--

00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:37.710
no pun intended-- and do it.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:41.820
AUDIENCE: I read once that
King County Transit in Seattle

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.930
discounts fares
for people living

00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:50.996
below the poverty line or
some threshold based on that.

00:19:50.996 --> 00:19:54.100
[INAUDIBLE] Is
that pretty common?

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.350
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.067
So we'll talk-- in
market segmentation,

00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:58.650
one of the things
you might segment by

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.020
is socioeconomic status.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.270
Yeah.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.000
And there's different
ways of doing that.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.120
So we can talk more about
that when we get there.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.842
AUDIENCE: I have
another question.

00:20:07.842 --> 00:20:11.830
I also have heard it
argued that with the switch

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:13.890
to all electronic
tolling that it

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.879
increases [INAUDIBLE] obscures
how much you actually pay.

00:20:17.879 --> 00:20:19.170
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.070
This is a saliency issue.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.149
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] switch
from cash-base fare system to--

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:25.690
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Absolutely.

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:26.190
Yeah.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.860
Especially if you go to
passes or a capping scheme,

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.450
which we'll discuss.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.230
So yeah.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.240
The more obscure, you
make the fare system,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.560
the less of an impact it
will have on demand response.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.630
And that is true in other areas.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:46.080
If you look at it from a
macroeconomic perspective,

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080
that's true in business.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.935
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't that
mean the more obscure you

00:20:48.935 --> 00:20:49.870
make it, the less--

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.286
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Well,
if people don't understand

00:20:52.286 --> 00:20:59.350
pricing, it may be you might
get a sort of lower reaction

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.410
to changes in pricing.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.070
You make less of
a fuss about it.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:09.210
OK.

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.690
Fare structure, so
market segmentation.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.580
That's a good segue
with these questions.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:17.580
So one possible way of
having a fare structure

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:19.230
is to have a flat
fare structure.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:20.690
That's the simplest one.

00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:23.970
It costs some amount to
ride, no matter what.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.390
No matter where from,
what time of day,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:29.190
what mode, that's the price.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:30.950
So again, that's the simplest.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:33.230
I think most
agencies, if you look

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:35.480
at the profile of all
agencies, including small ones,

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.980
have that fare structure.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:40.070
Bigger agencies tend to have
some market segmentation

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:46.460
because they are bigger and they
serve a wider range of people,

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.530
they serve a wider
geographic area,

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:50.670
and they have some
congestion problems.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:52.880
So how can we
differentiate fare,

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.620
how can we segment the market?

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.160
One is spatially.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.650
So you could have a flat
geographic structure

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:04.250
where no matter where you
ride from, it costs the same.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.510
You could have zones.

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:11.870
So here in Boston, we have no
zones outside of commuter rail.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:13.200
We have no zones.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.660
When you go to London, there's
zones one through nine,

00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:21.630
but most of the greater London
is in the first three, about.

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:28.430
So it costs more to cross zones
than to ride within a zone.

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:34.110
And you can buy passes that are
zone 1, zone 1-2, et cetera.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.770
So that's one way of doing it.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:40.880
If you take that to the extreme
and imagine many, many zones,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.790
you could end up with something
called distance-based pricing,

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.400
where each of the pair
has a different fare,

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:51.580
depending on how
long that ride was.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.090
So you can do that if you
have a tap-in, tap-out system,

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.060
you can do that with proof
of payment in some cases.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.480
It's more common in Europe.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:04.270
And regarding zones,
a lot of agencies

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:06.520
used to have more
zones and are going

00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.370
for reducing zones and
simplifying the system.

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:11.890
It's an interesting,
curious trend

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:14.920
because they've been doing
this at the same time

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.350
that they've been investing
in new fare technology that

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.920
enables more complex
fare structures.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.920
But it's a choice of
communicating to the public

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.920
and keeping it simple,
easier to understand.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.350
AUDIENCE: And do a couple
of years' long advertising

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.850
campaign to get
people to figure out

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.183
how to cap for the
overground system, which

00:23:33.183 --> 00:23:35.020
is part of the TFL.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.310
Because you could essentially
go around the entire city just

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.090
in zone 2.

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.757
But if you don't tap
in in the right way

00:23:41.757 --> 00:23:43.340
when you transfer
trains or something,

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.220
it will think you went
into the city and out.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.710
It's a lot cheaper to go
regularly than it is to go--

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.070
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:49.310
Because you stay in one zone.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.560
AUDIENCE: It was so confusing.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.518
They had people on the
platforms explaining it.

00:23:56.355 --> 00:23:59.800
AUDIENCE: Is DC Metro an
example of distance-based?

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.930
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
In some ways, yes.

00:24:01.930 --> 00:24:07.030
They have many sort of
things that influence price.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.300
So I don't know if you've had
the experience of going to CRB

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.370
and trying to figure out
how much money to put

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:16.600
on your smart trip card because
it varies by time of day

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.477
or how long you are
going to travel.

00:24:18.477 --> 00:24:20.560
And you don't necessarily
know that ahead of time,

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.180
so you end up loading--

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:23.320
it works in their favor.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.470
I just load up $20
or $40 depending on--

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.590
I don't really figure out how
much my rides will cost and put

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.510
in just that amount.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.330
Eventually, maybe I lose my
card and they keep the revenue.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.420
OK.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.630
Another-- oh, Eli.

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:40.820
AUDIENCE: So you said
that you really need

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.653
a tap-in, tap-out system
for distance-based,

00:24:42.653 --> 00:24:44.944
but for zonal [INAUDIBLE],,
how do you run that?

00:24:44.944 --> 00:24:46.360
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It could

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.640
be proof of payment as well,
not just check-in, though.

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.850
So in Europe, you
have some symptoms,

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:56.680
especially it happens
more intercity.

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:02.140
So you buy a ticket between
this station and that station

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.650
and you have a paper ticket.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.110
And you when you board you
validate it so essentially,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:11.260
it gets canceled
with a timestamp.

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:15.160
And if a fare inspector
comes, you better have one.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:17.840
Otherwise, you'll
be heavily fined.

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.170
So that's one way of doing it.

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:24.870
Any other questions?

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:25.510
OK.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.370
Temporal segmentation, so
that's pretty straightforward.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:30.160
You've got a flat
system where there

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.100
is no change in fares
across time of day

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.890
and another one where
you have a peak surcharge

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.300
or an off-peak discount.

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:39.700
Same thing, two ways
of marketing it.

00:25:39.700 --> 00:25:43.390
Most agencies prefer to
offer a discount on off-peak

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:46.090
than to charge more
during the peak,

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.350
but it's all psychological.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.640
So why would an agency
be interested in doing

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:55.090
this and what are the impacts?

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:55.590
Henry.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.530
AUDIENCE: It would influence
people to maybe think more

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:02.660
about taking the trips during
off-peak so that there are

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.300
alternatives that they--

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.508
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:26:05.508 --> 00:26:10.270
So nudging people who can
do off-peak to do off-peak

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:13.300
rather than during the peak.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.120
What else?

00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.040
Any other ideas?

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.250
AUDIENCE: Just encourage
more off-peak ridership

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:21.476
in general, like people
should probably do this.

00:26:21.476 --> 00:26:21.718
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Right.

00:26:21.718 --> 00:26:23.310
So more discretionary trips.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:26.331
So encourage more
off-peak ridership.

00:26:26.331 --> 00:26:26.830
OK.

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:29.200
And why does it make
sense to charge more

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.690
during the peak than
off-peak, regardless

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.492
of how you market it?

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:35.436
AUDIENCE: Some people
are [INAUDIBLE] flexible

00:26:35.436 --> 00:26:38.484
in their schedules and
[INAUDIBLE] capture that.

00:26:38.484 --> 00:26:39.900
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Exactly.

00:26:39.900 --> 00:26:41.850
So willingness to
pay is higher, either

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:43.230
because they are
actually willing

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.600
or because they are
captured on time like they

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.350
have to arrive at some
time to work so they

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:50.520
don't have many options.

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:53.760
And that means that
they're much less flexible

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.960
and that their response will be
much lower to a price change.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.340
OK.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.880
By service, that's
pretty simple too.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.630
You could charge the
same for bus and rail

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.850
or you could say rail is
a better service so it's

00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:09.120
going to be more expensive.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.910
The MBTA has this option.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.970
Regular bus versus express
bus, another way in which

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.370
the MBTA segments the market.

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:20.990
So the idea is if it's a
nicer service, you pay more.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.520
By socioeconomic status.

00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:24.710
So students might get
a discount, seniors,

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.900
disabled might get a discount.

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:29.390
We have some rules
here where seniors

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:32.520
have to be offered
half the base fare,

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:35.590
so that's one example of that.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.620
Some of it can be mandated
by the government.

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:38.995
And then there's
social programs.

00:27:38.995 --> 00:27:41.000
So there's different
ways of doing that.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.070
It could be as part
of your participation

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:45.800
in some social
program, it could also

00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:51.560
be a needs-based subsidy
where you essentially

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:56.730
prove that you have financial
need and based on your need,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.370
you give some amount of subsidy.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.000
So a subsidy could be on or
off, you either have the subsidy

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.520
or you don't or it could
be depending on your need,

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.670
you have more subsidy
or less subsidy.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.280
And usually, it's
the simpler one.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.580
I don't actually know
of any example that

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:16.732
is done based on
your specific case,

00:28:16.732 --> 00:28:18.440
but you could think
of doing it that way.

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:23.890
Because if somebody is
very, very poor then

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:26.910
they might need more
subsidy than somebody who

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:30.124
is just below the poverty line.

00:28:30.124 --> 00:28:34.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is that
because those groups tend

00:28:34.108 --> 00:28:36.754
to have less ability to
pay or what's the logic?

00:28:36.754 --> 00:28:38.920
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
That is usually the logic.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.560
So yeah.

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.130
Again, it's sort of
social equity goal.

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:50.380
So seniors and students
often can't drive, et cetera.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.460
So it's the goal of the transit
agency or the transit provider

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:58.185
to increase mobility for
all groups of people,

00:28:58.185 --> 00:29:01.210
the way in which that
goal is satisfied.

00:29:01.210 --> 00:29:01.945
Henry.

00:29:01.945 --> 00:29:03.805
AUDIENCE: How about
programs where

00:29:03.805 --> 00:29:09.060
you can take out your income
pre-tax and [INAUDIBLE]??

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.270
Is that like a social program?

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.850
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: No.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.220
I do have that in
another lecture, yeah.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.260
Because that is
done for people--

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:22.610
often, they are employee
who have a decent salary.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.000
So that's an incentive.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.460
And that incentive
exists for a car as well.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:32.630
So that's a different strategy.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.910
Another way of segmenting
is by willingness to prepay.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.110
So in other words, are
you willing to buy a pass?

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.420
So if you can commit
to a whole month,

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.280
then you get some discount.

00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:47.840
And this depends heavily on
what the break even point is.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:50.830
Usually, passes-- it used
to be the case that passes

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.830
had heavy discounts.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:59.210
So even without having a commute
two times a week for five days,

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:01.010
you would still get a discount.

00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.690
Now it tends to require
sometimes between two

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:09.050
and three trips daily to
get that break even point.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.870
Some people still decide to
go with that because it's more

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:14.570
convenient, it's less salient.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:20.300
So it's another way of
discriminating or segmenting

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:22.240
the market.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.730
Any questions on
market segmentation?

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
so speaking

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.439
of [INAUDIBLE],, the subsidies
given by government?

00:30:31.439 --> 00:30:32.980
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It depends.

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.020
So it could be
that the agency has

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:37.570
a mandate they have to do this.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:40.630
That is often the model.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:42.520
From an agency's
perspective it would

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:47.680
be much preferable to have the
subsidy come from someone else.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.540
Because then that
would allow the agency

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:52.390
to focus on operating,
It would set fares

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:56.140
to what it needs to cover
operational expenses.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.110
And then if it's a
social program, well,

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:02.200
why doesn't that social
program provide the subsidy?

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:09.370
If it's disabled, maybe there's
some other government entity

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.560
that can provide that subsidy.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.200
For students, why
not the schools

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:16.240
or the Department of Education.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.420
So that's an interesting
sort of policy debate

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.700
and we could talk about
it for a long time

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.890
because some people are
very much against it

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.300
and some people think
that's a good idea.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:28.110
Yeah.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.330
AUDIENCE: Also another thing
about the various groups that

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.050
are entitled to
subsidies is that you

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:36.160
have to have some mechanism
within your technology

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.179
that verifies that a
person is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:38.179 --> 00:31:39.970
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
To prevent fraud.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.660
Yeah.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.230
So smart cards are
helpful with that

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:51.140
because you can embed the
transit chip into a student

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.360
card, for example.

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.970
And that's what we
have here at MIT.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:55.470
OK.

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.400
Fare elasticities.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.850
So they can range from -1 to 0.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.320
We know that demand of
transit is inelastic.

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:10.860
So it means that almost always,
virtually in every case,

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:13.020
if you raise fares, you
increase your revenue

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.560
and your ridership
decreases not by too much,

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.370
not by so much that your
fare revenues go down.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:22.680
So here are some examples
of typical elasticities.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.460
They usually are
closer to -0.3 or -0.4.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:32.130
For rail, it's a little
less, so -0.2, -0.15.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.010
For off-peak, it tends
to be twice as much

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:37.830
because more trips
are discretionary.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:40.440
For work trips, it tends
to be much more inelastic,

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:43.890
as we discussed, so even
half of their base one.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.600
And there's
something interesting

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.560
that is maybe not as
important anymore,

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.562
but I wanted to add it here.

00:32:49.562 --> 00:32:51.270
There is a higher
demand for free transit

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:53.190
than there is for very,
very cheap transit.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:54.720
Even if you have
to pay, say a cent,

00:32:54.720 --> 00:33:00.570
to really get to the extreme,
the simplicity of not having

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:03.810
to deal with paying fares, not
having to interact with a fare

00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:07.650
system, and from the marketing
point of view, it's free--

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:11.850
you can just take it
whenever, you don't

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:14.790
have to be ready to take it--

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:17.790
then that sort of
drives demand up.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:19.680
So that's an
interesting finding.

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.510
A lot of agencies have
moved away from that

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:24.150
because these are
usually smaller agencies.

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:28.319
But of course, operational costs
increase and at some point,

00:33:28.319 --> 00:33:29.610
you need to cover them somehow.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:39.990
So these inelastic values
mean that raising fares

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:42.082
is an effective way of
increasing revenues.

00:33:42.082 --> 00:33:43.540
Not so much to
increase the demand,

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.710
although sometimes some
aspects of fare policy

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.300
are changed to
increase the amount.

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.270
You know you're going to get
a small response to that.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:54.300
From a microeconomics
perspective,

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.880
if you think about market
segmentation and running

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.920
transit like a
business, then you

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.760
would want to charge
more for longer trips;

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:05.640
trips in more convenient,
reliable, comfortable,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.420
and frequent modes; peak
period trips; trips where

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.750
other modes are inconvenient
or costly, therefore this

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:15.030
is the best option and why
not charge more for it;

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:17.250
and trips subsidized
by third parties

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:20.639
because then you could
capture some of the increased

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.590
fare from an outside source.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:23.159
All right.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:27.060
So of course, not
everybody would

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.730
agree that this is what
agencies should do.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:31.230
But if you are
thinking of running

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.170
an agency as a business, this
is exactly what you want.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:37.530
If you have more willingness
to pay for whatever reason,

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.139
your fare is higher.

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.760
And that means that
fare revenues go up

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.969
and your fare recovery
ratio goes up.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.949
And that means you can
operate more service

00:34:46.949 --> 00:34:48.780
or you can operate more
reliably or you can

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.591
get nicer vehicles, et cetera.

00:34:50.591 --> 00:34:51.090
All right.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.900
So transfer pricing and policy.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.320
Another issue,
some agencies don't

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:02.670
have any sort of
integration between rides

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:05.790
so every time you board a
vehicle, you pay a full fare

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:07.710
and there's no free transfer.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:10.470
Some agencies have a
reduced price transfer

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:11.880
or a free transfer.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.950
And free transfers can be
done in different ways.

00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:17.250
One of the most
common ways is to have

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.590
a time-based free transfer.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:23.850
So you tap and you
get, say, an hour

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:29.920
or two hours of free transit
starting from that point.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.270
So if you transfer,
you'll presumably

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:36.450
be in this two-hour window
and the next time you tap,

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:38.490
it'll be a free transfer.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.390
Here in the MBTA, the price
is higher for rail and bus.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.390
So if you transfer from bus to
rail, you pay the difference.

00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.440
If you transfer from rail
to bus, both are free.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:52.110
Interestingly, with
this time-based rule,

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:55.360
you can often do something
very quickly and return

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.510
and these are actually
two different trips

00:35:57.510 --> 00:36:02.000
and you would still
get a free return trip

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.640
and it's not a transfer.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.460
So with more complex
fare rules, you

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:09.270
could say you should get free
transfers within this window,

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:11.340
but not if you are
on the same bus route

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.220
or if you are tapping into
the same station or things

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.150
like this.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:17.880
You could think
of the rules used

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:21.880
for transfer insurance when we
discussed all the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.940
These are not fare transfers.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.260
Those were sort of a
logical trip transfers

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.900
and you could apply those rules.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:29.640
You could put them
into a fare engine

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:35.160
and not give free transfers
when it's not a transfer.

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:35.670
OK.

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.950
Pay-as-you-go,
passes, and capping.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:38.450
OK.

00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:40.340
One question before we--

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:41.100
Daniel.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.250
Yeah.

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:44.770
AUDIENCE: Is there--
how do agencies

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:48.796
determine if it's unlimited free
transfers within the same trip

00:36:48.796 --> 00:36:52.030
or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:57.088
Because [INAUDIBLE] bus,
rail, bus [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:57.088 --> 00:36:58.550
have to [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:59.000
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
You usually

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.370
don't have to because they
set the window wide enough

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:05.600
so that you can get your
whole three-four trip done

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:07.121
in that two-hour window.

00:37:07.121 --> 00:37:09.942
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] trips and
I've been charged [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:09.942 --> 00:37:11.150
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Oh.

00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:14.270
In theory, I think you could
go to customer service and say,

00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:15.410
this was a transfer.

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.420
Your policy is free transfers.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:21.880
You need to refund me.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:22.380
Yeah.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.230
I don't know the
details of it, but I

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:30.105
imagine that's the case,
that you could argue

00:37:30.105 --> 00:37:31.290
that you deserve a refund.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:33.266
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] paid
fare policy [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:33.266 --> 00:37:34.200
reach your [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:35.408
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

00:37:35.408 --> 00:37:37.260
I haven't, clearly.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.630
It would probably be very
interesting, actually.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.196
Any other questions
on transfers?

00:37:42.196 --> 00:37:44.070
Transfers are more of
an issue when there are

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:46.137
multiple operators in a region.

00:37:46.137 --> 00:37:47.970
And we'll talk a little
bit more about that.

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:53.890
If it's one operator, that's
sort of less controversial.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.510
OK.

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.850
So pay-as-you-go
passes and capping.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:38:02.580
So pay-as-you-go is the simplest
way of paying for trips.

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.190
You can do that with cash or
with tickets or smart cards

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:06.670
that have a balance.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:09.210
So you load up some
value onto the card

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.080
and every time you interact
with a fare box or fare gate,

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.480
some amount of that balance
is deducted from the card.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.407
That's pretty clear, hopefully.

00:38:20.407 --> 00:38:21.240
Then there's passes.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.850
So the idea of a pass is
that you sort of prepay

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:28.650
for three days, for a
week, sometimes for a day,

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.060
sometimes for a month.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.610
And it's a fixed price so you
ride with zero marginal costs

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.330
after paying that fixed price.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:40.230
If you ride frequently
enough, then you break even

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:42.790
and anything beyond
that is a free ride.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:48.360
So it's interesting to note that
because passes are convenient,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.630
some fare revenue is
derived from past sales

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:54.210
for people that
don't break even.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:55.840
That could happen
for several reasons.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.780
One of them might be
it's more convenient

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.690
and I'm not going to figure
out every month if I'm

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:03.420
going to be having the
pass or not the pass.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.510
It could also be that some
people receive a subsidy

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.660
from somewhere and
what they spend

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.126
on the pass is lower
than the pass value.

00:39:12.126 --> 00:39:14.250
And so for them, the real
break even point is lower

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:17.580
and you may not necessarily
be considering that when

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:19.681
you do this break even
point calculation.

00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:27.072
So in some cases, going
back to transfers, agencies

00:39:27.072 --> 00:39:28.530
that don't have
free transfers, you

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:30.870
can get them indirectly
through a pass.

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:33.660
Because they might
say, well, you

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:36.480
break even at 10 rides
per week so that's

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:41.400
your five weekdays times
two of going and returning.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.880
And if you have no
free transfers policy

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:47.610
but your trip
requires one transfer,

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.430
then you're going to very
quickly reach that limit

00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:52.420
and you're going to
ride free after that.

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:56.590
So in practice, that would
be a free transfer policy,

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.770
although not directly.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.430
So passes increase
convenience, we know that.

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.290
The reduce saliency
so you're not

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.720
thinking about how much money
you're paying every time

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.820
because it's more convenient.

00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:11.240
They can be subsidized by
employers, by universities,

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:11.990
by governments.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.610
So here we talk about
the pre-tax benefit

00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.310
that Henry brought up.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:18.440
And then there are
social programs,

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.890
like access to jobs
programs, that give

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.860
passes subsidized or
sometimes even free

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.660
for people that are
economically disadvantaged.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:31.340
Questions on passes?

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.091
I think we're all
familiar with passes.

00:40:33.091 --> 00:40:33.590
OK.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.950
So capping is less common,
it's a newer thing.

00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:38.300
It's more common in Europe.

00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:41.400
London has it, Germany has it
in many places, the Netherlands.

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:47.000
So the idea is that when
you have a complex fare

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.980
structure where the prices
are difficult to figure out,

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.030
then the agency says, don't
worry about calculating which

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:58.910
fare products you need
to buy; we'll do the math

00:40:58.910 --> 00:41:01.140
and give you the best price.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.050
So that's called
best price guarantee.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:05.480
And the idea is that
instead of committing

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.390
to getting a pass
or not a pass, you

00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:12.350
pay as you go but when you
reach a certain daily limit,

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:14.550
no more is charged
during that day.

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:15.950
So you can keep riding.

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:17.670
And that doesn't stop there.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:20.450
So the card keeps
counting the trips

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:23.060
in one week, the
trips in one month.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.180
And so you might
have multiple caps

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:29.080
and you might reach
different caps on one session

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.280
sort of with one card.

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.220
So essentially,
you end up getting

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:38.570
the equivalent of a pass if it
was worth it and not otherwise.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.300
Obviously, that means
agencies lose some revenue

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.640
from people who didn't
make the right decision,

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.030
but it's one way of having a
complex fare structure that

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:52.220
heavily segments the
market and therefore does

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:53.870
obtain more fare revenues.

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:59.930
And it allows for simple
communication with people

00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:02.720
by saying, don't worry about
it; we know it's complicated,

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.640
but we'll figure it out for you.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.250
That's one argument.

00:42:08.250 --> 00:42:11.010
In London, one of the reasons
capping was introduced

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:15.030
was with the movement to
contactless bank cards.

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.350
So essentially, you can pay
with your Visa or MasterCard.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.570
You can have it on your phone,
Apple Pay or Android Pay,

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:24.550
you tap, it works.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:28.830
So obviously, a
normal Visa might not

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:32.070
have the logic inside
the card's computer

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:35.410
to hold a pass or
anything like that

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:37.260
so the card becomes a token.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:41.610
One way of dealing with
that is to say, it's capped.

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:43.740
We'll keep track of
your usage for the month

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.660
and when you reach
the monthly cap,

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:47.820
we'll stop charging you for it.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:52.650
So it simplifies the move to or
towards contactless bank card

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:53.770
usage.

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:55.210
And we'll talk more about that.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:55.490
Yeah.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.239
AUDIENCE: So since
London introduced this,

00:42:57.239 --> 00:43:00.040
have they seen a drop in the
number of pass purchases?

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.290
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yes.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.270
Well, they've seen
an increase in--

00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:06.270
the penetration for
contactless bank card use

00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:07.830
has been increasing steadily.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:12.030
And if you go to London,
my last experience there

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:16.500
was on the train ride
between the airport

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:20.670
and the center of London, I
heard several people talking

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:22.050
about how convenient it was.

00:43:22.050 --> 00:43:24.960
So people are
excited about this.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:27.150
And it's great for
a city like London

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:28.640
that has a lot of
people that are

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:31.950
occasional users, a lot of
business travelers being

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.290
able to not have
to think about it

00:43:34.290 --> 00:43:36.350
and just pay with a credit card.

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.760
It really helps.

00:43:38.760 --> 00:43:40.230
And it has several
other benefits.

00:43:40.230 --> 00:43:43.129
I'll discuss them more in detail
when we get to smart cards.

00:43:43.129 --> 00:43:44.670
AUDIENCE: If you
say that it's capped

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:48.080
and you said that there's
a trend away from passes,

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:49.650
people are not buying passes.

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.650
But isn't that essentially
saying that actually,

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:54.120
no; people are buying
more passes than ever.

00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:56.900
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Well,
it's capping so it's not--

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.524
AUDIENCE: It's
capping, but it comes--

00:43:58.524 --> 00:44:00.690
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
It's equivalent to a pass.

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:02.340
The math works out
so that it a pass,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.970
but you're not selling
a monthly pass.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:05.760
Yeah.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.650
It's not a pass.

00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.767
You're paying each ride.

00:44:08.767 --> 00:44:09.840
AUDIENCE: --acts
like a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.640
It induces [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.264
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:11.264 --> 00:44:14.340
But I think if you go to
London every couple of months

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.330
and you can just
show up in London

00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:18.704
and you don't have to fill up
an Oyster card or anything.

00:44:18.704 --> 00:44:21.525
You can tap your card and use
it like you normally would.

00:44:21.525 --> 00:44:24.060
If you ride too much in a
day, they cap it as well,

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:26.430
which is something they
don't do on a monthly pass.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.721
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:29.970
OK.

00:44:29.970 --> 00:44:32.280
We'll discuss more on the
contactless bank cards.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.040
This is a very interesting
trend that we're seeing.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:37.650
So fare policy demand analysis,
we talked a little bit

00:44:37.650 --> 00:44:40.080
about this on
ridership forecasting.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.930
Just a little recap, the
traditional four-step modeling

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.580
process is not
usually appropriate.

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:48.270
And that's because A, it has
insufficient spatiotemporal

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:52.140
resolution and B, the planning
horizon for a fare hike

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.500
is kind of short- to
medium-term so you're not

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:00.120
thinking about land use changes
that will generate new trips.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.300
So therefore, total amount
is, we can assume, fixed.

00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.970
And what you want to play
with is the modal split

00:45:05.970 --> 00:45:10.680
and the assignment
to specific trips.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.930
The other thing is that these
four-step models usually

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:15.810
don't have all the details of
all the fare products in them.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.850
And for an agency,
it's important to know

00:45:17.850 --> 00:45:20.010
what people will do
about getting a pass

00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.600
or paying as they go.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.040
So usually, fare elasticity
analysis is simple;

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.520
in reality, a passenger is
considering multiple things

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.400
at the same time.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.256
So which mode are
they going to take,

00:45:33.256 --> 00:45:35.130
are they going to drive
their car or are they

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:39.430
going to take transit, are
they going to take bus or rail?

00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:41.610
Fare products, are they
going to go for the pass

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:43.109
or are they going
to pay as they go?

00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:45.610
And maybe there are
multiple passes, which one?

00:45:45.610 --> 00:45:48.630
And then costs, not
just in absolute terms.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:50.940
So usually,
elasticity only looks

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.760
at the percentage increase
in fares for this mode.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.350
But what if car costs have
gone up by more than that.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:01.570
So really, it's relative
to your alternatives

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.660
and each person might
have a different choice.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:07.820
For some people, transit might
be the only mode of choice

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.080
[INAUDIBLE] the only
mode in the choice set

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.700
because they don't own a car.

00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.610
For others, there may
be multiple options.

00:46:15.610 --> 00:46:18.741
So the other aspect of it
is that exogenous factors

00:46:18.741 --> 00:46:21.240
influence demand response and
they're not usually controlled

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:21.739
for.

00:46:21.739 --> 00:46:24.420
So fuel prices, employment,
residential development,

00:46:24.420 --> 00:46:27.210
tax policy,
sociodemographics, new modes--

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:30.230
the introduction of
TNCs like Uber and Lyft

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:36.720
and other companies have
potentially affected ridership,

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.730
we think they have.

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.250
And most of these
elasticity models

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:43.610
don't really sort
of control for that

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.460
to get the real fare
elasticity, and that

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:51.740
would be what you would want
to do, an accurate model.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.240
OK.

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:53.740
Communication of fare policy.

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:56.470
So obviously, to the public
it needs to be communicated.

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.970
You can do that on
your website, you

00:46:57.970 --> 00:47:00.890
can have near fare vending
machines there's usually you

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:03.060
know an explanation
of the prices,

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.179
you have a customer
service booths.

00:47:05.179 --> 00:47:06.970
If there's going to be
a fare change, again

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:09.386
you post things on the website;
there's flyers and posters

00:47:09.386 --> 00:47:11.740
everywhere; public
hearings, of course,

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:17.080
to sort of hear complaints
and defend the hike.

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:20.290
And I wanted to add one sort
of third emerging but very

00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:25.110
important aspect that
we haven't figured out,

00:47:25.110 --> 00:47:28.300
and it's via APIs or standard
feeds for trip planners.

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:32.020
So if you have an app or if you
use Google Maps to get transit

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.990
directions and you want it to
calculate what your fare will

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.290
be, unless the agency has
a simple fare structure,

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.082
that can't be done.

00:47:39.082 --> 00:47:41.248
Even for agencies that have
a simple fare structure,

00:47:41.248 --> 00:47:43.240
most of them don't
provide the two files

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.600
in GTFS that allow that
calculation to happen.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.410
And for agencies like London
that have a capping scheme,

00:47:49.410 --> 00:47:51.820
the GTFS specification
does not provide the means

00:47:51.820 --> 00:47:56.564
by which to input the fare
rules that would accurately

00:47:56.564 --> 00:47:57.730
calculate the person's fare.

00:47:57.730 --> 00:47:59.229
Because you would
need to keep track

00:47:59.229 --> 00:48:04.410
of how much they've taken
service over a week,

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:05.560
over a day, et cetera.

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:08.680
So that we haven't figured out.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.500
Third party apps
like the transit app

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.170
would love to be able
to calculate fares

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:15.541
accurately and display them.

00:48:15.541 --> 00:48:17.290
Because they can do
that for Uber and they

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:22.665
can do that for other modes,
so why not for transit as well?

00:48:22.665 --> 00:48:24.790
And although they would
prefer to do that in-house,

00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:28.330
one alternative to
that is to define

00:48:28.330 --> 00:48:30.550
some sort of standard
API where it's

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.720
up to the agency to
calculate what that would be.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:37.150
But you make an API
call and you say,

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:39.340
this is the hypothetical
trip that I'm planning.

00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:43.810
Give me how much [INAUDIBLE]
and the agency would respond.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:47.170
But for performance
reasons I think

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:48.700
the transit app
would prefer to be

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.146
able to do that
with their servers

00:48:50.146 --> 00:48:51.520
so that there's
a quick response.

00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.250
Partnerships, another
sort of emerging trend.

00:48:57.250 --> 00:48:59.270
So employer partnerships
is one example.

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.080
I'll give you the
example of MIT, actually.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.910
MIT has something
called AccessMyCommute.

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:06.010
Our lab was actually
involved in that.

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:10.360
So every MIT student
or employee badge

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.060
has a Charlie chip
embedded inside.

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:15.610
You can look at the back
and it says, Charlie inside.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:20.560
And to employees, it's marketed
as an unlimited use pass.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:23.560
So I can use my MIT
ID and ride the MBTA.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.220
MIT gets billed on a
pay-as-you-go basis.

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:34.780
So the reason that
was the agreement

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.380
is that a lot of people
don't use transit enough

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:40.280
to justify the value of a pass.

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.960
So there was no
way that MIT would

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.080
agree to pay a pass
for every employee.

00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:49.690
And it's in the interest
of MIT to foment,

00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:53.500
to encourage ridership,
so to decrease saliency,

00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:56.560
in this case to the
extreme by making it free.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:01.950
So one way of doing that is to
say, market it as a free pass.

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:07.770
There is a mix of people that
had passes and people that

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.546
ride less often.

00:50:09.546 --> 00:50:10.920
AUDIENCE: Could
MIT reach a point

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.570
where it might actually
want everyone to the pass

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:16.780
without the [INAUDIBLE]
employees knowing it

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.280
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:17.490
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: I don't

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:19.780
think so because many,
many employees-- yeah,

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.880
it's not close.

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:26.610
And some people ride
a lot more so MIT

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:30.150
in some ways for some
employees is paying more

00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:32.070
because they're paying by ride.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:34.560
But many people that
have a subsidized pass

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:38.530
because their break even
point is so much lower

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:39.930
don't really break even.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:42.570
And so it works out to--

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:45.360
AUDIENCE: The next project
that project might do

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.940
is to find a way
to predict based

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:51.282
on the employee [INAUDIBLE]
this information

00:50:51.282 --> 00:50:53.490
and they make a prediction
for what he's going to do.

00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:55.460
And you might save MIT
a fair amount of money.

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:56.751
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:50:56.751 --> 00:50:58.800
Well, one of the
reasons MIT decided

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.870
to do this is because
parking is very expensive,

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:03.720
real state is very
expensive-- very expensive.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.840
And that's, of course,
not true everywhere.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.070
It's not true in most places.

00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:11.130
Most places have free
parking, plenty of land.

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:14.370
But in a place that has high
density, building new parking

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:17.190
is very expensive and you
could use that real state

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.220
for something else.

00:51:18.220 --> 00:51:20.850
In fact, MIT has taken a
parking down near Sloan

00:51:20.850 --> 00:51:22.730
and is making a
new building there.

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:26.970
So it costs less to
provide transit to people

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.860
and to encourage
people to take transit

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.350
than to build new parking
and maintain parking.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.530
Here's another example.

00:51:35.530 --> 00:51:39.000
So the Chicago
Transit Authority has

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.280
partnerships with other
transportation providers.

00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:44.190
And they do that by providing--

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:47.550
there are some passes and
some fare products that

00:51:47.550 --> 00:51:50.619
allow riding in PACE, which
is the original bus provider;

00:51:50.619 --> 00:51:52.410
Metra, which is the
commuter rail provider;

00:51:52.410 --> 00:51:55.470
and Divvy, which
is the bike share.

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:59.460
So you can buy things that--

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:02.490
there are some partnerships that
allow some integration here.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.320
And there is a trend towards
mobility as a service.

00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:08.030
So the idea of
mobility as a service

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:10.170
is that you make a monthly
payment for a bundle

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:12.850
of transportation options.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:13.990
Here's an example.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:18.000
You could have unlimited transit
pass five bike rides and five

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:18.840
TNC rides.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.840
So you provide this bundle.

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:28.020
The person is purchasing
my transportation from home

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.860
to work and back on a
combination of both.

00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:34.430
So if it's today it's
inconvenient to take transit,

00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:39.960
that day I will use the
bike share or the TNC.

00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:43.410
The word is out on whether
this will work or not.

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:45.720
Many agencies are
interested; most of them

00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.250
don't want to talk about it.

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:51.392
And we'll see what
happens as time goes by.

00:52:51.392 --> 00:52:52.850
AUDIENCE: Is the
reason that MIT is

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:55.410
hesitant to extend the transit
benefit to grad students

00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:58.680
because grad students tend
not to be parkers so we

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.520
don't have that bargaining?

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:06.530
GABRIEL
SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: That is

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:10.520
sort of a reason for why they
shouldn't or wouldn't, but I'm

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:13.010
not sure that it is
the actual reason.

00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:16.460
I think this was always
conceived as an employee

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:17.800
benefits program.

00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.680
AUDIENCE: Aren't
we like employees?

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.180
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Not quite.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.970
So yeah.

00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:26.210
So I don't really know
the actual reason.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:28.520
Sometimes decisions
are made for--

00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:32.000
you justify them in all sorts of
ways and then someone decides.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:36.091
So many other factors play in.

00:53:36.091 --> 00:53:36.590
OK.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:38.260
Fare control.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:40.210
Tap in, you know what that is.

00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:42.650
You interact with a
fare box or fare gate

00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:45.450
only when you're entering
the system or vehicle.

00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:48.980
Tap in and tap out, you do
that when you enter and exit.

00:53:48.980 --> 00:53:54.650
Usually, tap in and tap out
is for systems that have zones

00:53:54.650 --> 00:53:57.110
and you tap out so
that we know if you've

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:59.210
traveled multiple zones
or not and therefore, we

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:01.790
know how much to charge you
because of the segmentation

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.550
by geography.

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:08.570
It also happens when there
are multiple agencies sharing

00:54:08.570 --> 00:54:09.660
the revenue.

00:54:09.660 --> 00:54:18.800
So intercity bus in some cities,
if a person takes a bus route

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.400
within a city, then that
revenue would go to that city.

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.400
If the person travels
across cities,

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.650
then the revenue would
be shared across cities.

00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:31.070
So that's one way you
might want to do this.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:33.849
I know that it does exist
in some places for bus

00:54:33.849 --> 00:54:35.390
where you have to
tap in and tap out,

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:38.940
although it's much less
common for bus than for rail.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.218
Henry.

00:54:40.218 --> 00:54:45.670
AUDIENCE: If the tap system
introduces a day pass,

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:49.269
for example, where
[INAUDIBLE] go to multiple--

00:54:49.269 --> 00:54:50.560
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.250
Yeah.

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:51.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:53.011
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

00:54:53.011 --> 00:54:55.031
AUDIENCE: Then would
they just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:55.031 --> 00:54:57.280
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: I
don't know how they do it.

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.530
Funding formulas
are a huge debate.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:04.060
And as an engineer, I would
propose to look at their OD

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:09.250
and figure out the most fair
way of allocating that revenue.

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:13.747
But how would they actually
do it is probably simpler.

00:55:13.747 --> 00:55:15.330
Another thing about
tap in and tap out

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:18.380
is that you may require
internal vending machines.

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.970
It may increase
your capital costs.

00:55:20.970 --> 00:55:21.690
Why is that?

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:24.660
Because you have multiple costs.

00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:27.260
The price of your ride
depends on how far you ride

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:28.590
and if you cross zones or not.

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:30.131
So you might have
just enough balance

00:55:30.131 --> 00:55:33.900
to enter, not enough to exit
if you cross multiple zones.

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:37.170
So you might have
to top up the card

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:38.754
before being allowed to exit.

00:55:38.754 --> 00:55:40.170
That means you
need a fare vending

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:45.165
machine that a person
can use to top up

00:55:45.165 --> 00:55:47.250
if they don't have a pass.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:50.070
It means that you might
need a station attendant

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.030
to deal with somebody.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:53.640
If the fare vending
machine is not working

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.460
or my bank card is not
working and is being rejected,

00:55:56.460 --> 00:55:59.910
I need to get out
of the station.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.690
I'm trapped.

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:02.430
So what do I do?

00:56:02.430 --> 00:56:05.400
So it can increase
costs in that way.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.570
You had a comment?

00:56:06.570 --> 00:56:07.570
OK.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:08.831
No.

00:56:08.831 --> 00:56:09.330
Right.

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:12.030
So that's one potential issue.

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.850
Something that some agencies do
is allowing a negative balance.

00:56:15.850 --> 00:56:18.420
So when we are
softening the blows

00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.590
to allow when you tap
out to go below zero.

00:56:22.590 --> 00:56:28.800
Next time you fill up the card,
you top up, if you put in $20

00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:31.540
and you had a $1 deficit,
your balance is now $19.

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:37.920
You can't do that if cards
are [INAUDIBLE] because people

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:40.590
will then toss the
card and get a new one.

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:43.410
So you make people buy the.

00:56:43.410 --> 00:56:48.160
The cards are maybe $10 and
a $5 balance or something.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.810
So there's a disincentive
to tossing the card

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.180
and getting a new one.

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.280
And by the way, smart
cards cost money.

00:56:56.280 --> 00:56:58.350
They're not that cheap.

00:56:58.350 --> 00:57:01.920
Some agencies have paid $10
per card for their card.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.410
Proof of payments, we
sort of discussed that.

00:57:07.410 --> 00:57:10.840
You buy a ticket.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.840
It might be OD, it
might be flat fare.

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.480
It doesn't matter, you buy
the ticket that you need.

00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.990
And then when you board,
there's usually some validator

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:21.180
that prints a time stamp.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.400
It can be electronic as well.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.220
And what it requires
is fare inspection.

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:29.070
So at random, a fare inspector
will board the vehicle

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:32.580
and have a handheld device
requiring people to confirm.

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:36.660
If it's an electronic system,
then they'll tap on here

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:39.120
and I want to make sure that
you've actually validated.

00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:41.127
If it's paper, then they
would look at the paper

00:57:41.127 --> 00:57:43.210
and make sure that you've
canceled it or validated

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:44.970
that paper ticket.

00:57:44.970 --> 00:57:46.350
And otherwise, big fine.

00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:51.720
So the discouragement to fare
evasion is through fining

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.790
and through policing.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:57.270
But the research shows
that there are still

00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:59.127
higher fare evasion
rates on systems

00:57:59.127 --> 00:58:00.210
that are proof of payment.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:06.798
People opportunistically board
and they don't pay anything.

00:58:06.798 --> 00:58:07.770
OK.

00:58:07.770 --> 00:58:08.800
Fare technology.

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:12.310
So we've talked about
structure and policy,

00:58:12.310 --> 00:58:13.630
let's talk about technology.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:17.280
So this is how an AFC
system is usually set up.

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.780
You have a fare engine.

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:22.530
It's a server that has
all the fare rules in it

00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:27.300
so it can calculate fares
based on a sequence of taps.

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.950
And it's connected
to different things.

00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:30.325
So a fare vending
machine, that's

00:58:30.325 --> 00:58:35.130
where you purchase your
card or your ticket.

00:58:35.130 --> 00:58:37.890
So these are usually
fiberoptic connections

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:44.090
or hardline connections
and so they're fast.

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:46.350
It's a real-time validation.

00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:48.810
As soon as you buy
a card and add value

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:50.820
to it from a fare
vending machine,

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.130
that balance is usually updated.

00:58:53.130 --> 00:58:56.430
If the fare engine
has a balance in it,

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:58.140
it will be updated
in the fare engine.

00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.430
That's not always the case.

00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:01.620
There's many kinds of systems.

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.170
So customer service
booths are also connected,

00:59:04.170 --> 00:59:06.210
fare gates are usually
connected as well.

00:59:06.210 --> 00:59:11.060
So when you tap
into a fare gate,

00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:13.690
there's a quick communication
with the fare engine saying,

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:15.169
is this card valid, yes or no?

00:59:15.169 --> 00:59:15.960
Is there a balance?

00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:17.100
If so, deduct balance.

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.470
This is how much balance
needs to be deducted.

00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:20.850
And the fare gate opens.

00:59:20.850 --> 00:59:24.960
Or maybe the fare engine
says, no, the card's not good.

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.550
Sound the alarm, don't open.

00:59:27.550 --> 00:59:29.040
There are other
ways of doing it.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:32.190
So the card itself might hold
the balance and the fare gate

00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:35.290
might have the logic to
decide whether to open or not.

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:39.420
But there's a whole range
of ways in which this

00:59:39.420 --> 00:59:40.900
can be configured.

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:42.810
Fare boxes and
validators are usually

00:59:42.810 --> 00:59:47.640
on vehicles, although there
can be handheld validators.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.840
Again, a validator is more
often used for proof of payment.

00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:55.530
A fare box is used when
it's pay-as-you-go or pass,

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:58.890
so that's what we
have here in Boston.

00:59:58.890 --> 01:00:00.300
There's two ways of doing this.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.120
It used to be the case
that they were not

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.860
communicating in real
time with a fare engine.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.700
So the card and the fare
box have a little chat

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.700
and decide how much
value to deduct.

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:15.930
Later, the bus reaches the
garage or it's being cleaned

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:18.420
and at the garage there's
a garage server that

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.700
wirelessly probes the
fare box and extracts

01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:21.864
all the data from it.

01:00:21.864 --> 01:00:23.280
And only then will
the fare engine

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.120
receive the information
about what transactions have

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:28.650
been done in that fare box.

01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:33.080
So you might have, again,
a real time validation.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.680
It can be a little
slow over the air.

01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:40.740
So what happens, and this is
being done London, for example,

01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:42.930
with contactless
bank cards, what

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:47.220
happens is that maybe the
first time the card is seen,

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:51.090
there is this dialogue
and validation.

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:55.050
After the card is
marked as trusted,

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:57.420
then it can just
validate immediately

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:02.610
and the actual deduction
can wait a little bit

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:05.250
and be sent in batches
to the fare engine.

01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:10.080
There's a cash
vault. That's where

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:16.800
if your system accepts cash
when the bus or fare box reaches

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.010
the garage, that cash
vault is taken out

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:23.610
and the cash needs to be counted
and moved out of the fare box

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:25.950
and to a safe place.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.710
Smart cards themselves
are computers.

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:32.880
They are small computers
with a battery and a clock

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.185
and some amount of
processing power.

01:01:36.185 --> 01:01:37.560
So they have some
memory, so they

01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.640
can hold some history
about your last trips.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.480
They can hold how much balance
there is in some cases.

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.430
They are able to encrypt
and decrypt communication

01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:54.600
so that it's harder
to break the security

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.510
and say add balance your card.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:00.360
And I want to add although
this is not necessarily

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.150
part of the fare system,
data [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:05.610
Increasingly, we are
doing a lot of analytics.

01:02:05.610 --> 01:02:07.650
So usually, there's
some connection

01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:11.070
between the live production
system and a data warehouse

01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:14.080
where on a daily
or a weekly basis,

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.170
there's an extract of data
into a data warehouse.

01:02:17.170 --> 01:02:23.790
And that allows analysts to run
heavy queries on a server that

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:26.900
is dedicated to analysis and not
on the live system [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:29.658
whether or not to open a
fare, if that makes sense.

01:02:33.465 --> 01:02:33.965
OK.

01:02:33.965 --> 01:02:35.020
Fare media.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:37.720
Any questions about fare
technology and the framework

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.945
of how this is set up?

01:02:38.945 --> 01:02:40.570
There are lots of
variants and I didn't

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:45.150
get into the details of
how any one system works.

01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.930
OK.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:47.220
So fare media.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:51.450
Cash, we all know
what that is; tokens.

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:55.020
So I don't need to
go into how cash

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.300
is minted or anything, right?

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:02.460
So tokens are little coins
that you buy with money

01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.200
and it's like a
ticket in some ways.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.290
It has some value
and sometimes it's

01:03:07.290 --> 01:03:10.530
possible to be able to have
to pay two tokens for a ride,

01:03:10.530 --> 01:03:13.039
although usually it's just one.

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.580
They're being phased
out because they

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.950
can print paper tickets
with magnetic stripes

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:18.350
and there's more data to it.

01:03:21.056 --> 01:03:21.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:23.251
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:03:23.251 --> 01:03:24.530
So they still exist.

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:26.911
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:03:26.911 --> 01:03:29.050
They still exist.

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:30.140
Yeah.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:33.298
This is a Boston token, by
the way, this one right here.

01:03:33.298 --> 01:03:35.440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.640
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: No.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:40.070
I'm pretty sure this
is an old Boston token.

01:03:40.070 --> 01:03:40.570
Yeah.

01:03:40.570 --> 01:03:41.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.171
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:03:43.171 --> 01:03:43.940
Yeah.

01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:45.870
Maybe I'm wrong, but I
think that's the case.

01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:46.370
OK.

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.910
Tickets.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.030
So tickets are they're
printed on paper

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:51.380
and they have a magnetic stripe.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.710
They don't have a
computer in them.

01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:55.700
The magnetic stripe
holds information

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.550
that can be encrypted.

01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:02.390
So it can be, but it's
not always encrypted.

01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:08.000
It's a little easier for there
to be fraud with tickets.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.167
So if there are
questions on tickets,

01:04:12.167 --> 01:04:13.250
I'll talk more about them.

01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:15.530
Smart cards I've talked about.

01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:17.030
Mobile ticketing
is another option.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.340
So that's a recent development.

01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:26.690
You have an app, you pay
for a ticket for your ride

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:27.470
on the app.

01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:30.560
And it's usually kind of
a proof of payment system

01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.630
where a fare inspector comes
along and scans a QR code

01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:39.770
on the app, proving that
you've purchased a valid fare

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.140
for that OD pair, for example.

01:04:42.140 --> 01:04:44.600
This is being used here in
commuter rail in Boston.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:51.980
And then the sort of newest
form is contactless bank cards.

01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:58.330
So that's a wireless Visa,
MasterCard, credit charge card,

01:04:58.330 --> 01:05:03.060
debit card and you
tap it on the--

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.470
there you go.

01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:07.610
You can pass it if you want.

01:05:07.610 --> 01:05:08.190
Can I see it?

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:14.160
So you tap it just
like you would

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.550
a Charlie card or an
Oyster card in London

01:05:17.550 --> 01:05:24.450
and there's the dialogue
between the fare and the card.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:26.950
Strong encryption.

01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:29.640
As I said, the full
validation process

01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:33.120
doesn't always happen,
especially in bus,

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.864
because you can trust the card.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.030
There is a separate antenna.

01:05:36.030 --> 01:05:38.820
Of course, the frequencies and
the protocols are different.

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:40.380
But there are good
standards for this

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:43.890
and London has moved to this.

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.860
CTA's system is based
on this technology,

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:54.890
even though they opted
to only use token cards.

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.500
So it's the same
technology, but it's

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.070
branded as their own thing.

01:05:58.070 --> 01:06:00.850
And I don't know if they can--

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:01.810
now it does, right?

01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:03.229
But at the beginning, it wasn't.

01:06:03.229 --> 01:06:05.020
AUDIENCE: I met someone
who had a problem--

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.311
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:06:06.311 --> 01:06:07.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.921
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:14.170
So with this, as you
have more and more cards

01:06:14.170 --> 01:06:15.670
on your wallet that
are contactless,

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:19.030
you should get like
a copper-lined wallet

01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:21.360
or something, to
like copper sleeves.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:26.480
They exist to sort of prevent
two reads from the same card.

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:29.450
AUDIENCE: So if I have
a contactless bank card,

01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:31.940
can I just walk up to one
of those systems and tap in?

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:33.340
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:34.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
absolutely nothing?

01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.380
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Absolutely nothing.

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:37.090
You just get on the bus.

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:38.290
Yeah.

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:39.860
It used to be the
case in Chicago

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:41.350
that it was kind
of their own thing

01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:43.656
and you were given a card.

01:06:43.656 --> 01:06:45.280
It was the same thing
as a credit card,

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.720
but just as a token with no
balance or account on it.

01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:53.530
And now they've enabled this.

01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:55.461
So that's the new way.

01:06:55.461 --> 01:06:56.960
AUDIENCE: But there
are other issues

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.940
about that because
there are issues of what

01:07:00.940 --> 01:07:04.360
if the card is from a different
country and things like that?

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:06.485
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Again, you do validation.

01:07:06.485 --> 01:07:07.390
There are policies.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.019
That's what these
card companies do.

01:07:10.019 --> 01:07:10.810
They're good at it.

01:07:10.810 --> 01:07:13.690
There is insurance for fraud.

01:07:13.690 --> 01:07:17.240
So they-- yeah.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:17.870
Yeah.

01:07:17.870 --> 01:07:19.630
AUDIENCE: It's a big push
from Visa and MasterCard

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:22.180
to get [INAUDIBLE] contact
list because [INAUDIBLE] money

01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:23.440
[INAUDIBLE].

01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:26.110
So every way they can make
it easier to spend money

01:07:26.110 --> 01:07:27.140
is better for them.

01:07:27.140 --> 01:07:28.080
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Eli, you have a comment?

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.430
AUDIENCE: And in Chicago,
it doesn't process transfers

01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.970
or passes.

01:07:30.970 --> 01:07:34.851
They're just charging
you a la carte, one trip.

01:07:34.851 --> 01:07:37.690
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So there's

01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:39.190
they don't have
a capping scheme.

01:07:39.190 --> 01:07:40.735
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:07:40.735 --> 01:07:41.860
And it doesn't [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:43.600
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
So if you want a pass,

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.350
that's not an option for
you is what you're saying.

01:07:45.350 --> 01:07:47.010
AUDIENCE: You need to
actually [INAUDIBLE]..

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:47.340
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: OK.

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:47.840
Yeah.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:51.010
So that's an interesting
comment which no one heard.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.440
I'm sure the comments on the
back are also interesting.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.390
AUDIENCE: They're just
asking me about [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:04.960
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
I'm generally interested.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.410
Can you share with the class?

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:08.576
AUDIENCE: They were just
asking whether you actually

01:08:08.576 --> 01:08:09.602
have to [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:09.602 --> 01:08:10.810
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Oh.

01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:11.820
OK.

01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:13.736
AUDIENCE: You do have
to take it [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:13.736 --> 01:08:16.000
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
As opposed to EMV, yeah.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.375
AUDIENCE: But
[INAUDIBLE] Chicago

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.670
have it because I
thought it [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:21.340
penetration [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:23.715
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: But
I think they will increase.

01:08:23.715 --> 01:08:26.380
And that I think could be driven
by agencies in big cities,

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:26.899
actually.

01:08:26.899 --> 01:08:29.050
That's one example of that.

01:08:29.050 --> 01:08:31.600
The US has been a little
late in adopting credit card

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:32.560
technology in general.

01:08:35.851 --> 01:08:36.350
All right.

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.069
Smart cards.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:41.270
So I've already talked
a little bit about them.

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:43.819
They enable more
complex fare structures,

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:47.060
they allow faster boarding
and higher gatebank throughput

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:49.520
because the validations are
much faster than a ticket.

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.520
A magnetic stripe ticket
needs to be fed in

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:54.439
and read multiple
times sometimes

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:56.479
and it takes more
time to do that.

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.330
Certainly, cash is slower.

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:03.020
So account registration is one
of the benefits of smart cards.

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:07.040
You don't have to do
this, but you often can.

01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.620
So you open an account and that
gives you balance protection.

01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.350
If your card is lost, you
can log into your account

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.880
and remove that card.

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:16.011
The balance could be
retained on the account

01:09:16.011 --> 01:09:18.260
so you can get a new card
associated with that account

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:20.220
and you have your balance.

01:09:20.220 --> 01:09:22.340
Autoload is another convenience.

01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:26.090
You might have a rule that says,
if my balance drops below $5,

01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:27.500
charge $20.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:31.700
So if it's top up
or pay-as-you-go,

01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:35.180
then this one feature.

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:40.939
Of course, it's much better for
us sort of researchers and data

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:43.430
nerds, better data for
analysis and planning,

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:45.020
longitudinal studies.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.970
You can track a
token longitudinally

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:49.970
and understand more
about behavior.

01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:53.859
It's embeddable in employee and
student budgets, as we've seen.

01:09:53.859 --> 01:09:55.400
They are more
expensive than tickets.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.520
Now there are some smart
tickets so you can print a card

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.800
with a chip circuit inside.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.660
Those are a little cheaper.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:06.110
One issue with smart cards is
that a lot of these systems

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:07.370
are proprietary.

01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:09.830
And there are some standards,
but there are several

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.970
standards-- too many of them--

01:10:11.970 --> 01:10:14.080
and they don't all
work everywhere

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.670
and so you can't
really use a card

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.470
from one system
on another system.

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:20.130
That's usually not the case.

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:21.770
There are some
exceptions to that.

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:25.280
There is a move towards open
source hardware specifications.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.000
New York is a good
example of that.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.970
They recently did
some procurements

01:10:28.970 --> 01:10:32.670
where they asked all
the parts to be--

01:10:32.670 --> 01:10:35.120
it was for an AVL
system in this case--

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:40.380
to be open source hardware
and communications technology.

01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.720
That means they're not
locked into that vendor.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:47.780
So if they need to replace
one aspect of that system,

01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:50.090
they can hire someone
else that also

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:52.760
complies with that standard
and that part can be replaced.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:56.270
That lowers costs,
increases competition,

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.855
and it means again that they're
not locked into that vendor.

01:10:58.855 --> 01:10:59.354
Lee.

01:10:59.354 --> 01:11:01.904
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] security
at all or [INAUDIBLE]..

01:11:01.904 --> 01:11:03.820
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
Usually, the systems

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:05.990
have strong standard encryption.

01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:08.180
Part of the standard is
what encryption is used

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:14.480
and what encryption algorithms
are used, hashing, et cetera.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:14.990
Yeah.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:17.840
So the Charlie card has
pretty weak encryption,

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:25.390
40 bits I think, and the
same key on every card.

01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:28.930
So a long time ago, someone
cracked the key by brute force

01:11:28.930 --> 01:11:31.000
and that's the same key
on every Charlie card.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.300
So once that key is public,
anyone with the equipment

01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.080
could load a fake
balance to the card

01:11:38.080 --> 01:11:41.770
because the cards are the ones
having the balance in the AFC

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.470
system here and not
the fare engine.

01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:47.290
That means that effectively,
you can lie to the fare system

01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:50.620
and say that you have
more money than you have.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:53.380
Much harder to do with
any modern system,

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.210
certainly contact
with a bank card

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.730
which has a very strong
encryption and unique keys

01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:58.909
per card.

01:11:58.909 --> 01:12:00.950
AUDIENCE: Did MIT students
get caught doing that?

01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:02.700
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ:
The MIT students

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.540
were the first to do this.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:08.120
They were caught and
there was some issue.

01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:10.650
Which I think it ended up
being just a slap on the wrist,

01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:15.557
but there was a lot
of issue with it.

01:12:15.557 --> 01:12:17.140
Because they wanted
to publish a paper

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:20.000
or publish something and
then that was an issue.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:20.500
OK.

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.410
So integration across agencies
of a region is possible.

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:28.160
That's one of the reasons for
moving towards smart cards,

01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:31.030
especially in regions
that have many providers.

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:33.100
But it's challenging, and
usually the challenges

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:37.190
are less technical and more
about trust and business

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:40.420
and who gets to decide
what color the card is

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:44.314
or exactly what the
fare policy will be.

01:12:44.314 --> 01:12:45.730
This is another
interesting thing.

01:12:45.730 --> 01:12:49.540
In some countries, and
I'm thinking specifically

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:53.980
of Japan and China, there
are examples of retail stores

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.960
that have partnered
with a transit agency

01:12:55.960 --> 01:13:00.707
and you can use the card
at retail locations.

01:13:00.707 --> 01:13:02.040
Hong Kong is an example of that.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:06.880
There's more than 100 retail
locations that accept Octopus.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.570
And in Japan, I know that
there are entire cities where

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:13.600
there's like a whole mall and
this is what most people use

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.160
as a charge card.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.490
So that's interesting.

01:13:18.490 --> 01:13:21.100
If you don't have very
tough privacy laws,

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.780
as you do in Europe and the US--

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.750
I'm not sure what
they are in Japan,

01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:28.420
but there was some
research where

01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:33.130
they were combining all the
data from shopping and transit

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:38.110
to get really interesting
behavioral analytics.

01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:39.790
And you can do
interesting things

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:46.290
like offer discounts at stores
if you do something in transit.

01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:51.295
So there's a lot of very
interesting [INAUDIBLE]..

01:13:51.295 --> 01:13:53.346
AUDIENCE: Our company
did the same thing

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:55.796
and once [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:00.075 --> 01:14:04.264
So after that, we are
very careful about dealing

01:14:04.264 --> 01:14:05.169
with [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:05.169 --> 01:14:06.460
GABRIEL SANCHEZ-MARTINEZ: Yeah.

01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:07.680
Yeah.

01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.200
Thanks for sharing.

01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.400
So contactless bank cards.

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.899
We started talking
about this, we've

01:14:12.899 --> 01:14:14.430
mentioned that multiple times.

01:14:14.430 --> 01:14:16.560
Here's the logic for it.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.090
A transit agency
would prefer not

01:14:18.090 --> 01:14:20.550
having to deal with the
complexities and costs of fare

01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:21.776
collection.

01:14:21.776 --> 01:14:23.400
Essentially, if you
have a fare system,

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.320
it's like having a small bank.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.890
It doesn't give out loans,
it doesn't do other things

01:14:28.890 --> 01:14:30.780
that banks do, but
you are dealing

01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:33.570
with money and the cards
and customer service related

01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:36.150
to cards and all those things.

01:14:36.150 --> 01:14:37.950
Banks do that, and
they do it very well.

01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:42.840
So why not outsource that
part of the business to banks?

01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:46.780
There are multiple banks so
they can get competition.

01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:50.190
So credit card companies
specialize in payment;

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:52.380
contactless bank
cards are very secure,

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.950
much more so than
say the Charlie card;

01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:59.860
you can use cards like
this in several ways.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.150
So you could directly
use them for payment

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:05.070
as you would at
a retail location

01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:09.570
or you can use the token that
identifies that card, tying it

01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:10.890
to an account.

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:14.460
And then your fare engine can
calculate what the fare will be

01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:15.990
and capping and all that.

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:21.270
And then on a
regular basis, there

01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:25.050
would be a charge to your
credit card or account

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:29.940
for whatever total
was calculated.

01:15:29.940 --> 01:15:34.140
So that also enables
Apple Pay and Android Pay.

01:15:34.140 --> 01:15:36.580
If you can put your
credit card on your phone,

01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:40.350
then you can use your phone
to get into the system.

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:43.110
In London, people love that.

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:44.860
It reduces fare
collection costs.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:47.610
So why?

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:49.770
Not necessarily obvious.

01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:52.050
So it simplifies
customer communication.

01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:55.260
You don't have to issue
new cards to people,

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:59.310
you don't have to explain
how you pay because people

01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.500
know how to use cards.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.150
It relies on open
standards so there's

01:16:03.150 --> 01:16:04.660
more competition on the market.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.780
There's several
banks, for example,

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:10.980
and you could have
banks compete for who

01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:16.140
will give you a better deal in
terms of fees on these cards.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.480
It outsources some aspects
of customer service to banks.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.340
So if my card stopped
working, who's

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:27.630
going to get the phone call,
the transit agency or the bank?

01:16:27.630 --> 01:16:30.570
And it eliminates costs of sort
of creating and distributing

01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:31.380
smart cards.

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:35.250
So there's several ways in
which this is reducing costs.

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:39.580
London has successfully
been able to reduce

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:46.950
the number of station attendants
and especially of booths

01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:49.580
where they sell Oyster cards and
have customer service related

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:50.540
to Oyster cards.

01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:53.726
They've been able to close
those and save money.

01:16:53.726 --> 01:16:55.100
And then there's
an equity issue,

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.420
and this is what is
always sort of brought up

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.750
when you talk about
contactless bank cards, which

01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.580
is what about the unbanked?

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:06.120
The poorest people are the ones
who don't have a bank account.

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:08.120
So what can you do about that?

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.340
Does that make this not work?

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.160
So there are multiple
ways of addressing that.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.520
An agency can issue cards
that have preloaded balance.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.510
So that person could interact
with the agency, not the bank.

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:23.030
They don't necessarily
need a bank account.

01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:25.240
You can have banks
offer free accounts.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.780
So you can try to
encourage people

01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.500
to open accounts that have
no fee, no minimum balance.

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:34.830
So some [INAUDIBLE] special
accounts created for that.

01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:36.800
And one other issue
is that you must

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.310
be able to obtain these
cards at many locations.

01:17:40.310 --> 01:17:43.520
If you move towards
a system like this

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.630
and you can only get one
of these sort of equity

01:17:47.630 --> 01:17:54.380
issued cards if you want from
one station downtown, that

01:17:54.380 --> 01:17:58.580
means that the person who
depends on two or three buses

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.450
to get into downtown
can't easily get a card.

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:05.600
So you must be able
to maybe get these

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:08.390
at several retail
locations or have

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:13.980
fare vending machines
in multiple places,

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.510
especially in zones of high
concentrations of people

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:22.960
that depend on transit and
don't have bank accounts.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.860
OK.

01:18:23.860 --> 01:18:27.800
So there are ways of
dealing with that.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.119
Boston is considering now
what they call AFC 2.0.

01:18:31.119 --> 01:18:32.660
They're sort of
branding it that way.

01:18:32.660 --> 01:18:37.100
And they're probably
going to be moving forward

01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.840
with the London model of
using contactless bank cards.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:43.910
So we'll see how it
plays out and we'll

01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:47.210
see what that does to the
payment industry in general

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:52.590
in the US in terms of that means
more people will have these.

01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:57.710
Does that mean that a lot of
readers at retail locations

01:18:57.710 --> 01:19:01.050
will start accepting that,
and what will that do?

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:01.910
It's a question.

01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:04.620
We'll see what happens.

01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:05.310
OK.

01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:06.650
Last topic is fare analytics.

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:09.440
So obviously, lots of data is
generated by these systems.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.120
We've used it for
all the [INAUDIBLE],,

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.380
you've looked at it
in your homework.

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:18.950
So here's an example from one of
the students in the transit lab

01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:20.510
who has one more
year to graduate,

01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:22.940
but he's done great work.

01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:24.980
His name is Andrew Stutz.

01:19:24.980 --> 01:19:27.260
And one of the
examples of his work

01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:33.710
is dashboard, where you can
look at all sorts of fare

01:19:33.710 --> 01:19:41.750
transactions by fare product, by
pass or no pass, by user type.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:44.750
And you can sort of filter
and see exactly who's

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.430
using your system how often.

01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:48.292
Let me see if I can
show that to you live.

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:51.870
OK.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:57.840
So here's AFC validations
for October 2015.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:02.736
So if I want to
see, for example,

01:20:02.736 --> 01:20:04.110
here we're looking
at everything.

01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:07.080
So we're looking at tickets and
cards and passes and monthly

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.830
passes and pay-as-you-go.

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:12.502
So if I want to look at
stored value, so no passes,

01:20:12.502 --> 01:20:13.710
I'll sort of filter that out.

01:20:13.710 --> 01:20:17.640
Then of course tariff type
becomes 100% pay-as-you-go.

01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.340
And then you see the breakdown
between cards and tickets

01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:22.260
for stored value use.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:27.120
We see the trends by time
of day here and by date.

01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:31.331
So you can see that weekends
are lower and the user type

01:20:31.331 --> 01:20:31.830
right here.

01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:36.630
So adults very high and then
senior students below that.

01:20:36.630 --> 01:20:42.670
If you want to look at
passes, for example,

01:20:42.670 --> 01:20:46.540
we could then say passes and
monthly passes in particular.

01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:49.320
You see that most of those
are cards, not tickets.

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.360
Makes sense.

01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:55.244
Higher number of students
than we saw before, et cetera.

01:20:55.244 --> 01:20:56.910
So you can really
sort of play with this

01:20:56.910 --> 01:21:02.510
and understand how the
market segments itself

01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:06.960
with these different
fare products

01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.150
that people are purchasing
based on the fare policy.

01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:14.160
And there's another
dashboard for fare revenue.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:19.860
So these are fare revenues
by month across many years.

01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:23.607
And you can see
the total up here.

01:21:23.607 --> 01:21:24.940
But you can break it down again.

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:28.750
So you can look at how much
of it is monthly passes

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:31.980
and you can see how much
of it is normal commuter

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:33.540
pass versus commuter rail.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:39.990
And you can see, if you're
interested in students,

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:41.790
here's your students.

01:21:41.790 --> 01:21:44.910
So you can really slice and
dice it any way you want to.

01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:46.410
And there's many
more applications,

01:21:46.410 --> 01:21:49.811
but I just wanted to
demonstrate a few.

01:21:49.811 --> 01:21:50.310
OK.

01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:52.120
So that was it.

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:55.980
I'm not going to lecture
anyone for this semester.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:59.820
So I'll still come.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:02.700
And I'll let you
know about the test

01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:05.140
as soon as I have more
information on it.

01:22:05.140 --> 01:22:09.040
Any questions on fare
policy, fare structure,

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.300
fare technology?

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:10.800
No.

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:11.860
All right.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:12.360
Thank you.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.780
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20 Special Relativity.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.340
In our quest to understand how
we get to general relativity,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.910
there is two things to consider.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.910
The first one,
this lecture is not

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.620
meant to give you
a full description

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.860
of general relativity,
but just a view into where

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.680
this might lead, where
this discussion might lead.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.070
So in this quest,
we can understand

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.640
the theory of general
relativity as a theory on how

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.050
to patch together the different
reference frames which each can

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.160
be described in special
relativity, in the framework

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.880
we discussed up to now, and
it's valid in short intervals

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.770
in spacetime.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.720
Consequences of
general relativity

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.510
are that spacetime is curved.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.450
So we have modified geometries.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.560
We learned that, because
of gravitational effects,

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.010
matter curves spacetime.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.320
As a consequence
of that, there must

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.300
be modification of gravity
based on matter distributions,

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.540
and so there must also
be gravitational waves,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.130
gravitational lenses which
bend light, black holes,

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.800
and there's cosmological
predictions coming out

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.420
of general relativity.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.990
So let's have a
discussion first.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.150
What does it mean to have a
changed or modified geometry?

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.320
What could that mean?

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.510
So you are all used to
Euclidean geometry, where,

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.970
when you draw a
triangle, you add up

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.250
all the angles to 180 degrees.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.130
If you try to parallel
lines that never cross,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.230
they also don't diverge.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:55.050
But if you have a
modified geometry--

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.040
for example, the geometry on
a sphere, like on our globe--

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.220
the angles do not add
up to 180 degrees.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.560
Actually, the sum is
larger than 180 degrees,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.310
and parallel lines will cross.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.240
We will call this kind of
space positively curved,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.820
but you can have the opposite
example, like on a saddle.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.440
So you can have other spaces
and other curved spaces,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.240
and they can be
negatively curved.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.830
In this example, if
you add up all angles,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.450
you find they add up to
less than 180 degrees.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.180
Parallel lines do not cross,
but they will diverge.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.730
Mass changes the
geometry of spacetime.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.850
We just talked
about light bending,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.340
and because of the
change in geometry,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.540
light will not go on a
straight line anymore,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.720
but will bend around
massive objects.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.950
Spacetime is curved.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.090
Geometry of spacetime tells
us how the mass is moved.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.730
You can think
about a trampoline.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.310
When you put a heavy
object on a trampoline,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.290
all the other objects
on the trampoline

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.170
will gravitate towards
the heavier object,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.130
and that's kind of a picture
on how spacetime actually

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.840
looks like.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.390
Einstein used those
findings in order

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.240
to redefine Newton's
first law and found

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.130
the so-called Einstein
field equation.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.220
So on one side of
the equation, there's

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.280
a description of spacetime
and its curvature,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.110
and on the other
side of the equation

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.260
is the energy momentum
tensor, the description

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.250
of how energy and momentum
of object is distributed.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.220
And those two things, spacetime
and energy and momentum,

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.050
they're kind of interlinked
in this equation.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.960
So if you read this
description, you

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.880
can read it from one
side to the next.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.808
Spacetime tells
matter how to move.

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:50.350
Or you read from
the other direction,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.630
say matter tells
spacetime how to curve.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.603
That is an equation,
and you can just

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:58.020
read it from the
left to the right

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.250
or from the right to the left.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.150
Our understanding here.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.370
It says space and time
are not fixed things

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.890
through which matter and
energy moves through.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.420
The matter and energy
themselves define spacetime.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.440
And matter, because of
spacetime, is dynamical.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.279
It's changing.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.460
It's interacting with the
matter and with the energy.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.700
This is a super exciting picture
from Hubble, the Hubble Space

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.690
Telescope.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.860
And you see galaxies,
but what you also see

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:38.730
is those structures which
looks like the light has

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.200
come through lenses.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.230
Those lenses are actually
matter distributions, galaxies,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.320
which actually lead to
the bending of the light

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.490
and those lensing effects.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.310
OK.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.400
If you want to summarize
general relativity,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.860
you can first say that
spacetime is curved

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.770
and it follows the
pseudo-Riemannian manifold

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.450
with a specific metric.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.490
We have seen the metric before.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.280
It's minus, plus, plus, plus.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.560
And the relationship
between matter and curvature

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.060
is given by the
Einstein equation,

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.160
and here I give you a
slightly different form

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.530
where there is the
dynamics, again, on one side

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.860
and the energy momentum
on the other side.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.690
Let's just look at
one example here.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.050
So we discussed, in
special relativity,

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.142
invariant intervals, and
we have this delta squared,

00:05:28.142 --> 00:05:29.600
or we have a
different name for it.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.030
I given by minus dt squared
plus dx squared plus dy

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:37.820
squared plus dz squared, and
we could have just written

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.950
this in polar
coordinates as well,

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:42.050
where you find that dr
squared and r squared

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.230
d theta squared, and
then r squared sine

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.790
squared theta d phi squared.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.290
OK.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.930
Same thing.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.930
It's just a different
coordinate system.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.620
So as a solution to
Einstein equation,

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.950
we find something which
looks very, very similar.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.660
That's not a surprise, as
we find general relativity

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.590
as a patchwork of small
spaces of special relativity.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.700
So the solutions
might be very similar.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.000
And the solution found here,
the so-called Schwarzschild

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.340
solution, which is a
unique solution in vacuum

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.160
with spherical symmetry
of a matter distribution.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.410
So you have a spherical matter
distribution like our sun,

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.400
and this is a solution
which describes

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.080
spacetime around this.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.630
You find this
invariant interval here

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.210
has two interesting features.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.520
There's two
singularities in here.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.700
This should be a minus 1.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.000
You find those
two singularities.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
One is at r equals 0.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That's kind of expected.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.625
In the middle of the
mass distribution,

00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:52.600
this thing is not
defined anymore.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.000
There's no mass left.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.650
But there's also a second
singularity at 2GM.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.410
This is called the so-called
Schwarzschild radius,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.110
and if you get to
the singularity,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.040
you basically don't
define anymore

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.130
this invariant interval.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:16.300
You can think about the
surface of a black hole

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.610
as this singularity.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.910
At this r value, at
the singularities,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.200
everything becomes timelike,
or everything within the radius

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.650
becomes timelike.

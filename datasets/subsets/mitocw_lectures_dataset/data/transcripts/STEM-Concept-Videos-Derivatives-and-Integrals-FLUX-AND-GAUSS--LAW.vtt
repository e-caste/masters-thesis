00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:10.350
What do rain, bees, and vectors have in common?
They're all ways that MIT physicists visualize

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.160
the concept of "flux." In this video, we'll
explore flux as it relates to Gauss' law.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.480
If you've ever had trouble choosing the right
Gaussian surface, getting a quantity out of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.970
an integral, or just wanted to know what flux
is, get ready: this video is for you.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.330
This video is part of the Derivatives and
Integrals video series.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.190
Derivatives and integrals are used to analyze
the properties of a system. Derivatives describe

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.999
local properties of systems, and integrals
quantify their cumulative properties.

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:44.249
"Hello. My name is Peter Fisher. I am a professor
in the physics department at MIT, and today

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:48.239
I'll be talking with you about electric flux
and Gauss' Law.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.149
By this time in your course you've seen and
used Gauss' Law quite a bit. You have a good

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.899
handle on the electric field, what it does
and how it works. We will also assume that

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.559
you know how to take an area integral, a skill
that is important to Gauss' Law but which

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.510
is not taught in this video.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.180
Our end goal is to improve your ability to
use Gauss' Law. To do this, we'll help you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.030
develop an organized view of electric flux
and what goes into it. We'll also spend a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.549
lot of time talking about symmetry and how
to use it to your advantage.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.020
We're going to start by thinking about what
goes into flux and the interrelationships

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.049
between these quantities, so that we can use
flux more effectively.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:33.509
As a refresher, here are the two equations
we'll be working with today: the definition

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.729
of flux and Gauss' Law. You may have seen
these written with a double integral, or with

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.320
slightly different notation, so take a quick
look to make sure you're familiar with all

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.770
the pieces.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.609
To really use symmetry to our best advantage
in Gauss' Law, we need to understand a few

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:57.810
more basic things. We need to be able to use
vector areas, to categorize charge distributions,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.109
and to determine when and how the two can
work together.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.359
The underlying reason we want to use symmetry
is that integrals are difficult, significantly

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:12.050
more difficult than derivatives. There are
many situations in which we cannot determine

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.140
the flux integral. Therefore, we seek to simplify.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.450
The integrals we're dealing with are surface
integrals, also called area integrals. There

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.970
are two basic kinds, open and closed, as you
can see on the screen. An open surface uses

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.440
an open integral, and a closed surface uses
a closed integral. Flux can be defined for

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.000
any surface, but Gauss' Law uses only closed
integrals.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.220
When we take the integral, we use dA, a tiny
piece of the area. dA is a vector piece of

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.500
the area, so it has a direction to it as well.
dA always points perpendicular to the surface.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.740
With closed surfaces we usually choose dA
to point outward from the surface.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:01.740
dA usually gets represented as two other differentials,
such as dx times dy. Which two depends on

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.840
the coordinate system you choose, with some
being more complex than others. Sometimes

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.120
we will need these, so it's good to have them.
The good part is that if we use symmetry correctly,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.970
we can avoid having to do an integral at all.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.090
Let's pursue our goal of not doing an integral.
We have this integral of E dot dA. Let's write

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.470
the dot product as a cosine. Under certain
circumstances, we can remove the E from the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.200
integral. We can only do that when our electric
field has uniform magnitude over the entire

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.000
surface. You can see some examples on the
bottom of the screen.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.230
We can remove the cosine(theta) from our integral
only when the angle between the area and the

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.340
electric field doesn't change. The left-hand
example shows a field that always points in

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.829
the same direction, and an area that always
points in the same direction. The middle example

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.800
has a field whose direction changes, but it
always points outward, just like the area

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.390
vector from the cylinder points outward. It
still works. In the right-hand example, the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.800
field has a constant direction, but the area
vector does not. The angle between them changes,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.370
so we couldn't remove the cosine from the
integral.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.350
If we want to move both the field and the
cosine out of the integral, we need to fulfill

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:32.470
both conditions. The left-hand and center
examples only fill one condition each. The

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.500
example on the right has both, and would be
ideal to use.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.930
Before we move on, a reminder about flux and
angles. Only electric field lines that actually

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.010
pass through a surface provide flux. When
the surface is parallel to the field, no flux

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.080
is provided. This is particularly useful for
some three-dimensional surfaces, such as the

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.730
empty cylinder to the right. If we remember
this, we can really simplify our integrals.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.690
Another thing to remember: Flux is a scalar.
As long as the field strength is the same,

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:00.660
and the angle between the field and surface
stays the same, the flux will be the same.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.560
We don't have to worry about the flux pointing
in a particular direction, because it's just

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.840
a number with no direction.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.720
Now we know how we would like the field and
the area to line up. Next we need to understand

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.680
the circumstances that make that possible.
We need to look at electric charge distributions

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.400
and their symmetry.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.070
Electric charge can come as a single point,
as in an electron or proton, but it can also

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:24.040
take other shapes. It might be stretched into
a line, spread throughout a volume, or spread

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.480
over a surface. Not a Gaussian surface - remember,
that's something we make up to solve a problem.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.490
Charge is spread on a physical object. You
can stretch the charge out into lines, spread

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.970
it on thick wires or spherical shells, build
a solid ball out of it, or even just smear

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.220
it around on an object.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.800
An object has symmetry when it has exactly
similar parts that are either facing each

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:53.290
other, or arranged around an axis. On the
screen are some pictures of objects that have

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.510
symmetry.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:06:01.310
There are three categories that we'll investigate,
and three types of symmetry to consider. Our

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.460
hope is to have a highly symmetric charge
distribution, with any of the three types

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.389
of symmetry. That's when Gauss' Law is easiest
to apply.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.490
These examples have little or no symmetry
to them, and are not the sort of thing for

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.280
which we can use Gauss' Law.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:21.330
These three charge distributions have visible
symmetry, but it's not enough. We need a charge

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.580
distribution so symmetric that the field it
generates is also symmetric.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.290
Let us show why. Let's say we have a charged
cube, which is certainly a symmetric object.

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.669
We can draw the field from it fairly easily.
If we place a cubical Gaussian surface around

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:43.310
the charge, we can see the problem: the field
and the surface have different angles in different

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.139
places. There's some symmetry here, but not
enough to allow us to pull everything out

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.870
of the integral.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.639
These cases are ideal: a point charge, a spherical
shell, an infinite sheet of charge, or an

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:03.419
infinite cylindrical shell of charge. No doubt
you've used Gauss' Law with these charge distributions

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:09.639
before. How can we describe such distributions
and find others like them?

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:14.630
All three of those have a special quality:
if you move in two directions, they look exactly

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:20.510
the same. No matter how far you move across
the plane in the x or y directions, it looks

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:26.699
identical. Move along the cylinder or around
it, and it looks the same. Rotate around the

00:07:26.699 --> 00:07:31.990
sphere around the equator or the poles, and
you can't tell the difference.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.580
We can also add similar objects together or
scale them however we like. By integrating

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.199
the fields from a lot of shells, we can create
a solid object, just like these Russian nesting

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.400
dolls.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.210
Of course, perfectly symmetric charge distributions
are rare in real life. This is probably because

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.510
infinitely long cylinders are so hard to find.
Thus we often use Gauss' Law in cases where

00:07:56.510 --> 00:08:02.040
the charge distributions are close to one
of our symmetric cases. We can usually obtain

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.800
excellent estimates of the true electric field
in this way.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.699
Two approximations are particularly common:
when the object is so large that we can treat

00:08:10.699 --> 00:08:16.430
it as being infinite, or when we are so close
to the object that its large-scale features

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:23.150
become unimportant. In these cases, we often
treat the object as being an infinite plane.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:28.370
Here's an example of the first approximation.
Compare the distance from your point of interest

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:34.250
to the object, to the size of the object itself.
If the smallest dimension of the object is

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:39.999
ten times your distance from it, you can rely
on a very good estimation from Gauss' Law,

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:42.938
even if your plane isn't really infinite.

00:08:42.938 --> 00:08:48.089
To use the other approximation, we want a
situation where the curvature is very small

00:08:48.089 --> 00:08:52.709
in the place we care about. For example, it
would be very difficult for us to find the

00:08:52.709 --> 00:08:58.699
field at this point. However, if we zoom in,
we can reach a point where the surface looks

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:05.699
like a flat plane. Finding an estimate for
the field at this point will be much easier.

00:09:06.589 --> 00:09:11.290
Now we have the background we need. It's time
to put all the pieces together and pick our

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.699
Gaussian surface.

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:18.249
We'll do a quick review in case you missed
something, and give you an example or two.

00:09:18.249 --> 00:09:23.430
After that, it's your turn to pick the best
surface for a given situation.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:28.350
In order to simplify our integrals as much
as possible, we seek out situations with as

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:33.110
much symmetry as we can get. The symmetry
in the charge distribution isn't something

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:38.439
we can control, but our choice of surface
will determine whether there is symmetry in

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:43.410
how the electric field meets the Gaussian
surface. And that's always the key: you choose

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:47.980
the surface to make the problem easier for
you. Finally, it's important to remember that

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:53.480
in some cases, Gauss' Law won't be helpful,
and it's good to look for another method.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.480
Here are three charge distributions: a long
cylinder, a sphere, and a flat plane. To maximize

00:10:00.699 --> 00:10:06.499
the effects of symmetry, we choose surfaces
that match up well with the charge distributions.

00:10:06.499 --> 00:10:11.629
To find the field near a cylinder, we surround
it with another cylinder. To find the field

00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:17.619
near a sphere, we encase it in a sphere. To
find the field near a charged plane, we use

00:10:17.619 --> 00:10:22.949
a box-shaped surface. Sometimes people will
use a cylindrical surface instead, and count

00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:29.100
the flux that goes through the top of the
cylinder. Both approaches are valid.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:35.490
Here is your first challenge: choose the Gaussian
surface that will best fit this charge distribution.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:41.879
We want to know the electric field at a certain
distance from the center of this solid sphere.

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:46.220
What surface would you choose?

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:53.220
A sphere inside our existing sphere will be
easiest. This example helps us remember that

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.170
the Gaussian surface can be inside an object.
The area of the surface will be the usual

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:03.379
four thirds pi r cubed. We'll need to remember
to use only the charge inside our volume,

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:07.980
not the whole charge of the sphere.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:13.240
Here's challenge number two. We would like
to know the electric charge contained in a

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.059
thundercloud. Let's say that the inside of
the cloud has an electric field that looks

00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:18.860
like this.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:25.860
What surface would you choose?

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:33.829
A box-shaped surface will take advantage of
the Cartesian symmetry in this electric field.

00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:37.959
Because of the alignment between the sides
of the box and the electric field, they will

00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:43.139
not contribute to the flux integral. We can
use just the area of the top and bottom of

00:11:43.139 --> 00:11:50.139
the box, and the field at those locations,
to find the flux. This is a common technique.

00:11:51.249 --> 00:11:55.540
Here's challenge number three: finding the
electric field at a certain distance from

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.869
the center of charged disc.

00:11:58.869 --> 00:12:05.869
What surface would you choose?

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:11.600
No surface will work! The problem is that
there's not enough symmetry in this situation

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.959
to pick an appropriate surface.

00:12:13.959 --> 00:12:19.739
If we can't get an exact solution, we would
like to approximate the field. Unfortunately,

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:24.199
if we look at the distances involved, we are
not close enough to the disc to make a good

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:25.730
approximation.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:30.899
In the end, this is not a good Gauss' Law
problem. It is solved much more easily through

00:12:30.899 --> 00:12:35.929
other techniques, such as integration and
Coulomb's Law. An example can be found in

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:39.319
the supplemental materials for this video.

00:12:39.319 --> 00:12:44.300
Here is the final challenge. A top and side
view of the field are shown.

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:51.300
What surface would align well with this field?

00:12:52.589 --> 00:12:57.769
A cylindrical surface would work very well
with this circular field. You can see that

00:12:57.769 --> 00:13:03.350
the field is perpendicular to the area vector
at all points. Our dot product is now giving

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:09.569
us a cosine of ninety degrees at all times.
This means a zero value for the flux at all

00:13:09.569 --> 00:13:14.589
points. We don't even need to determine the
area of the cylinder.

00:13:14.589 --> 00:13:20.559
If our flux is zero, the total charge inside
must also be zero. We might guess that positive

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:26.149
and negative charges together could create
this field, but as it turns out, they cannot.

00:13:26.149 --> 00:13:30.529
Fields that look like this are created by
a changing magnetic field, using Faraday's

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:34.559
Law, which you will learn more about later
in your course.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:38.749
There are some times when you'll just have
to integrate; there's no way around it. Not

00:13:38.749 --> 00:13:44.139
every situation is perfectly symmetric. When
you come to these situations, look for the

00:13:44.139 --> 00:13:50.649
following things to help you out. First, an
area vector that you can define easily. Second,

00:13:50.649 --> 00:13:56.959
an electric field that you can easily find
or that is defined for you in a problem. Third,

00:13:56.959 --> 00:14:01.730
see if you can create a surface where either
the magnitude of the field or its angle is

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:07.809
uniform. The more of these you can take advantage
of, the better.

00:14:07.809 --> 00:14:08.939
Let's review.

00:14:08.939 --> 00:14:13.519
The more symmetry we can take advantage of
in our problem, the easier time we'll have

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:20.209
with Gauss' Law and flux. Ideally, we want
a situation where the charge, the field it

00:14:20.209 --> 00:14:25.049
creates, and the Gaussian surface we choose
all have the same symmetry, so that we can

00:14:25.049 --> 00:14:29.600
simplify the integral as much as possible.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.660
For the final segment of this video, we wanted
to answer a common question about electromagnetism.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.549
What is flux? What does it mean? How can we
understand it?

00:14:40.549 --> 00:14:45.499
We took a video camera into the physics department
at MIT to find out how physics professors

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:52.499
and students think about flux. Here's what
we found out.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:06.110
Thank you

00:15:19.879 --> 00:15:26.879
for watching this video. We
hope that it has

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.620
improved your understanding of flux and Gauss'
Law. Good luck in your future exploration

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:42.490
of electromagnetism.

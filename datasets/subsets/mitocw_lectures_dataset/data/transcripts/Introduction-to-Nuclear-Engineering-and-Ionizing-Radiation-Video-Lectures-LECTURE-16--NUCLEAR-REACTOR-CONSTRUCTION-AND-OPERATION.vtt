00:00:21.173 --> 00:00:23.590
TEACHING ASSISTANT (TA): So
if you guys don't remember me,

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.460
I'm one of your TAs.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.418
I'm TA number three,
that's what I call myself.

00:00:26.418 --> 00:00:27.240
I'm Ka-Yen.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.740
And I'll be teaching your lesson
today because, well, Mike's

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.460
in Russia.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.320
So, yeah.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.715
Yeah, so I know you
guys had your first exam

00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:35.590
a couple of days ago.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.370
How did that go?

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.040
OK, sounds good.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.582
All right, so we
won't talk about it.

00:00:42.582 --> 00:00:45.340
But because you guys just
had a super intense exam,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.930
we just want to give
you guys a break.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.310
So today, I'll be teaching
you guys a little bit

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.430
about nuclear energy.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.580
So this lesson won't
be super in-depth.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.272
There won't be a lot
of crazy intense math.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:56.230
Actually, there won't be
any crazy intense math

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.670
because we just want to
give you guys a break.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.410
You guys are going
to be starting up

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.970
full cycle on Friday with
really cool topics like stopping

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.470
power.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.012
So for now, we're
just kind of like--

00:01:05.012 --> 00:01:06.190
it's a refresher.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.360
A couple of fun facts.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.950
A couple guys might already
know some of the concepts

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.570
that I'm mentioning, because
you guys are intelligent people.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.235
But I walked into MIT not
knowing a single thing

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:14.110
about nuclear energy.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.830
I was like, I wish someone
could have told me these things.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.440
So that's what I want
to do for you today, OK?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.102
So I'm going to be talking
about the functionality

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.310
and the benefits and the
problems associated nuclear.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.268
But first let's start
with a very brief history

00:01:26.268 --> 00:01:27.050
in a nutshell.

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.980
So between 1895 to
1945, that's really cool

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.050
people were developing
nuclear science.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.920
So people like Madam Curie
or like Fermi, et cetera.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.685
They were all designing
this nuclear science,

00:01:38.685 --> 00:01:40.810
like they were developing
it, which is pretty cool.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.230
Most of this development
happened between 1939 and 1945.

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.950
Does anyone want to
take a gander as to why?

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.562
What?

00:01:49.562 --> 00:01:50.770
AUDIENCE: Manhattan Project?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.520
TA: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.820
But what field of the
Manhattan Project?

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.130
AUDIENCE: Nuclear weapons.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.890
TA: World War two.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.420
Yeah.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.770
So World War two was
happening during those times,

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.380
and they were trying to
develop the atom bomb, which

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.390
is why the majority
of nuclear science

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.360
was developed between these
like five or six years.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.259
Then 1945 to 1960.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.640
They've entered a phase of
like, well, the war is over.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.270
Now what do we do
with ourselves?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.390
So luckily we decided
to redirect this science

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.720
into using it for
energy and harnessing it

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720
in a controlled fashion.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.210
So mainly the focus was
actually for Naval submarines,

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.840
but they also realize that
we can use this for energy

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.410
as well, for
electricity as well.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.270
So there's a lot of
really cool things

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.812
that happened in
between these years.

00:02:29.812 --> 00:02:32.920
So in 1951, the first nuclear
reactor to produce electricity

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.990
was the experimental
breeder reactor,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.630
the EDR1 was
developed and designed

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.380
and operated, and
actually kind of worked.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.460
It was created by
Argonne National

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.460
Labs, which is in Idaho.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.870
And they actually still exist.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.650
So if you want to go work there
this summer, you totally can.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.870
And then in 1953,
President Eisenhower,

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.240
he created something
called atoms for peace.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.400
So this is just a
program that advocated

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.590
using nuclear for things
that were peaceful,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.640
such as electricity instead
of nuclear weapons and stuff.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.700
Also 1953 was the
creation of Mark 1.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.750
So Mark 1 is the first prototype
Naval reactor that was created.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.200
It was created in March.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.540
And then finally in 1954,
the first nuclear powered

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.340
submarine, the USS
Nautilus was launched,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.690
and is up and running.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.098
So lots of cool things
happened between this time.

00:03:13.098 --> 00:03:14.890
But the real heyday of
nuclear was actually

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.830
between 1960 to 1975.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.750
So during the span
of 15 or so years,

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.270
this was the real
commercial energy boom.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.660
People like Westinghouse were
creating nuclear reactors.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.850
I think the first one
was called Yankee Rowe.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.790
It's a 250 megawatt
electric nuclear power

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.820
plant, which is not
insignificant for a time

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.273
like the 70s.

00:03:35.273 --> 00:03:37.690
So other different companies
and other different countries

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.740
were doing this as well.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.413
basically, there was this
huge boom in nuclear energy.

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:43.330
So if you look at this
little chart over here,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.120
this is nuclear
reaction construction

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.300
throughout the years.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.830
So if you look in
this little chunk,

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:51.580
you can see what a
massive peak there was.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.440
This was when everyone was
building nuclear reactors,

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.060
people thought it
was super jazzy,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.187
and everyone tried
to jump on that.

00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:59.770
Unfortunately, all good things
have to come to an end, though.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:03.880
From 1975 to 2002, which is
about this chunk over here,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.242
you can see a massive decline.

00:04:05.242 --> 00:04:06.700
And you can see
that nothing really

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.010
happened between the 90s and
the 2000s, other than the fact

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.930
that we were all born.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.880
But no new nuclear
reactors were being

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.250
commissioned during this time.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.980
And then today, we're kind of--

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.204
I say we're back,
but basically we're

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:21.579
entering what
people like to call

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.400
a nuclear renaissance, which is
between this chunk over here.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.662
You can see that there's
been a slight increase

00:04:26.662 --> 00:04:28.120
in nuclear reactors
being produced.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.600
But basically there's been a
whole new push for creating

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.490
more advanced reactors.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.690
And currently, China,
India, and South Korea,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.260
they are the main
players in this game.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.320
So China itself has 32
operate reactors operating

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.830
at the moment, and have
20 more commissioned,

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.950
like literally right now,
which is kind of insane.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.240
So yeah, do you guys have
any questions about this?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.290
Great.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.863
So what causes
nuclear resurgence?

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:56.530
This is the perfect time to talk
about why nuclear power's cool.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.227
Again, you guys
probably know this.

00:04:58.227 --> 00:04:59.810
But the main reason
is sustainability.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.730
So right now we've
entered a phase in time

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.230
where people are
starting to realize

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.040
that we've done damage
to our environment,

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.200
we've got to fix this.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.700
So global warming is a thing.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.440
I promise you, it's
actually a thing.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.240
And basically, we're
looking for a way

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.730
to produce electricity without
creating such a large carbon

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.390
footprint.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:15.470
So if you look at
this chart over here,

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:17.330
you can see that
this is where nuclear

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.280
lies in the amount
of carbon that it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.960
produces per-- what's the unit?

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.832
Per gigawatt hour
of electricity.

00:05:22.832 --> 00:05:24.290
When you look at
that in comparison

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.690
to coal and natural gas, which
is our two primary sources

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:29.203
of energy at the moment, you
can see that this is definitely

00:05:29.203 --> 00:05:29.870
more attractive.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.610
So the statistic is
actually that nuclear

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.260
creates 75 times less carbon
emission than coal does,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.840
and 35 times less
than natural gas does,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.490
which is incredible and amazing.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.740
So that's the main reason
why we're going for nuclear.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:45.992
But there's other kinds
of really good reasons.

00:05:45.992 --> 00:05:47.450
One is the amounts
of power output.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.700
You guys actually calculated
this yourself in pset 1.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.910
You know just how much
power or energy comes out

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.830
from one fission reaction.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.550
So just so you guys
can double check

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.130
that you got that statistic
right in your pset,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.610
it turns out that

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.740
It turns out that you get
3.5 million times more

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.953
energy than burning one
kilogram of coal does.

00:06:02.953 --> 00:06:04.370
So you can see
that you definitely

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.290
need a lot less fuel
in a nuclear reactor

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.810
than you do in a normal
coal burning reactor.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.700
And then finally the last
thing would be energy security.

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.530
So one of the good
things about nuclear

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.905
is that it can serve as a good
baseload source of energy.

00:06:19.702 --> 00:06:21.410
So if you're working
in the energy sector

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.610
you probably see this
chart all the time

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.860
of like time versus like
energy that's being consumed.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.650
And it's kind of like this
fluctuating little mass that

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.080
stays fairly constant, but
at certain times of the day

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.880
you need more energy than usual.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.700
So this is just the energy
demand during the day.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.460
That's what this chart
kind of crudely depicts.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.280
So nuclear power is able to
provide a good baseload source.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.830
That means it can provide
conserve energy at a really

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.700
high level all the time.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.520
So this is why we kind
of want to replace

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.020
coal and natural
gas with nuclear,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.185
because it can take this role.

00:06:50.185 --> 00:06:51.560
Other alternative
forms of energy

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.300
might be better for the
environment, it might be safer,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.530
and things like that, but it's
not really able to do this.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.072
So for example, if you wanted
to replace all the coal burning

00:06:58.072 --> 00:07:01.400
fire plants with solar panels,
if it's not sunny that day,

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.230
you're kind of out
of luck, right?

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.080
Like you can't produce energy
if it's not sunny outside.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.045
Similar for wind.

00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:08.420
If it's not windy
outside, you're

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:09.890
not getting any electricity.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.390
Luckily for nuclear,
it doesn't have

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.890
to rely on any of these factors.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.097
You can continuously
produce energy.

00:07:16.097 --> 00:07:16.885
Right?

00:07:16.885 --> 00:07:18.260
So do you guys
have any questions

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.620
about what I've mentioned?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.930
Awesome.

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.305
So now we'll talk a little
bit about reactor types.

00:07:24.305 --> 00:07:26.430
I'll just tell you guys
about some of the main ones

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.720
and how they work.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.330
So how people like to
divide up the reactor

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.993
types is in generations.

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.660
So generation one,
which, is all the way

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.558
over there, that refers
to the trial reactors.

00:07:36.558 --> 00:07:38.100
These are the ones
that didn't really

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.880
produce all that much
electricity at all.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.290
They're more proof of
concept kind of things,

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.630
so that would be like
the Mark I that I

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.130
mentioned to you guys earlier.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.540
Now we move on to
generation two.

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.980
So generation two is actually
what most of US reactors--

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.390
the category that most
US reactors fall into.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.400
So these were developed between
the '70s and the '80s-ish, and

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.047
these are the ones that are
functioning mostly today.

00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:04.380
And then we have generation
three, three plus, and four.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:05.640
So these are the new
types of reactors

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.840
that people are
trying to build on

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.090
to create several improvements,
but we'll talk about them

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.090
a little bit more later.

00:08:10.090 --> 00:08:11.760
OK?

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.040
So I want to start off
with light water reactors,

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.510
because these are
the reactors that

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:17.310
are most common in
the United States.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.220
So light water
reactors, or LWRs,

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.050
are mostly broken up
into two subcategories:

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.930
boiling water reactors and
pressurized water reactors.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.510
So how you guys can
think about reactors

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:30.360
is that honestly they're
just kind of glorified steam

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.120
turbines.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:32.880
That's what they're doing.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.770
So let's start with
boiling water reactors.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.100
So boiling water reactors,
or BWRs, comprise about 21%

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.440
of the reactors that are located
and working in the United

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.512
States.

00:08:42.512 --> 00:08:44.220
So it's a really,
really simple mechanism

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.020
and we can walk
through that right now.

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.680
So over here, this little
nubbin right over here,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.152
this is the fuel core.

00:08:51.152 --> 00:08:52.860
So this is what the
inside of a fuel core

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.620
looks like, that
picture over there.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.370
So the fuel core is
basically just a bunch

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.595
of rods of uranium,
sometimes it's

00:08:58.595 --> 00:08:59.970
clad in something
like zirconium,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.090
and there's also control rods
to help slow down the process.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.420
So uranium undergoes what?

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.220
AUDIENCE: Fission.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.030
TA: Yes, fission.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.572
So what gets released
during fission?

00:09:08.572 --> 00:09:09.840
AUDIENCE: Heat.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:10.492
TA: And?

00:09:10.492 --> 00:09:11.617
AUDIENCE: Fission products.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.117
TA: Cool.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:12.630
And?

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.020
AUDIENCE: Neutrons.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.937
TA: Neutrons, awesome.

00:09:13.937 --> 00:09:16.590
So those three things
are all flying around

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.680
inside the reactor core at the
moment as the uranium undergoes

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.550
fission.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.710
So the isotopes, we just
kind of let them be.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:23.580
Like I don't--

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.720
I'm not completely sure
what we do with them.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.220
We might filter them out, but
I think they just kind of hang

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:27.840
out there.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.750
The heat obviously
goes to create power.

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:32.460
We'll talk about that
in just a second.

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.230
But the neutrons
come flying around.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.320
So those other neutrons can
simulate other fissions,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.403
and the control rods
are there to make sure

00:09:39.403 --> 00:09:40.820
that there's not
too many fissions

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:45.607
happening in the fuel
core at a certain time.

00:09:45.607 --> 00:09:47.690
Anyway, going back to the
heat, the heat that gets

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:50.450
created during these
nuclear fissions, that

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.140
goes and heats up the water.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.463
So this is just one loop
of water, basically.

00:09:54.463 --> 00:09:56.630
So the water flows through
the core and heats it up.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.060
It creates steam so the steam
goes and spins a turbine.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.110
The turbine creates electricity.

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.737
And it comes back
and gets recondensed.

00:10:01.737 --> 00:10:02.570
That's literally it.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.570
That's all that
happens during a BWR.

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:07.400
Yeah, that's actually just it.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.700
So a cool thing about the BWR
is, because it's so simple,

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:12.620
it's also incredibly--
well, not incredibly,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.245
but it is the cheapest
option out there

00:10:14.245 --> 00:10:15.443
for creating nuclear power.

00:10:15.443 --> 00:10:17.360
One of the downsides is
just that it might not

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.043
be as energy efficient as
it possibly could be, or not

00:10:21.043 --> 00:10:23.210
be able to create as much
power as it possibly could

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:25.110
if it was a cooler technology.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:26.060
But yeah.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:28.190
Oh, and another downside
is that because we

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.590
have the nuclear material
interacting with the water

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.720
and-- so this is a coolant pump.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.010
This is a coolant tube.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:36.800
This is basically connected
to a lake or an ocean

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.120
or some other source
of cold water,

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.143
and that runs through
the primary loop

00:10:41.143 --> 00:10:43.310
to cool down the water and
recondense it into steam.

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:45.143
If there ever is a
breach between these two,

00:10:45.143 --> 00:10:47.940
the chances of leaking nuclear
material into the environment

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.440
exists.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:52.347
Like it's not high
per se, but with BWRs

00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:54.680
there is a higher chance of
leaking radioactive material

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.555
into the environment.

00:10:55.555 --> 00:10:57.640
So that's one of the
downsides of BWRs.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.780
Do you guys have any
questions about this?

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.400
Awesome.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.525
So I just want to show you
guys this picture again,

00:11:05.525 --> 00:11:07.310
because here's the
underside of a BWR.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.490
I make it sound like
it's super simple

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.070
and like a walk in the
park, but this is actually

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:11.690
the amount of
technology that goes

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:12.830
into one of these reactors.

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.000
Like look at all those wires.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.458
I don't even know
what they all do.

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:18.460
But it's kind of insane.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.140
So the next kind of reactor
that falls under the light water

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.810
reactor category is the
pressurized water reactors.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:29.900
So PWRs are actually more
important, if you will,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:30.770
than BWRs.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.050
So remember, BWRs
comprise about 21%

00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:34.630
of the reactors in
the United States.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.870
PWRs comprise about 60% of the
reactors the United States.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:41.000
But they are functionally
essentially the same,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.050
and it's just slightly
more complicated.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.110
So over here we have
our fuel core again,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.150
and again all it's doing
is heating up water

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:48.470
with its fission reactions.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.545
But this time this
water is pressurized.

00:11:50.545 --> 00:11:51.920
So does anyone
know why you would

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.890
want to pressurize the water?

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:55.390
Yeah?

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:56.598
AUDIENCE: So it doesn't boil?

00:11:56.598 --> 00:11:57.480
TA: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.470
So when you increase
the pressure,

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:00.762
you're also increasing the
boiling point of the water,

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.220
and that allows you to function
at even higher temperatures

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.520
than if you're working
with a BWR, which gives you

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.600
more energy efficiency.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.645
You guys will learn all about
that in 2005, by the way.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:10.973
So yeah.

00:12:10.973 --> 00:12:12.390
It heats up this
pressurized water

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.820
and this pressurized water
goes into a second loop which,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.000
again, just heats up water.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:16.990
That turns into
steam, that spins

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.448
a turbine that
creates electricity,

00:12:18.448 --> 00:12:20.040
gets recondensed, et cetera.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.890
And that's, again, all
that there really is.

00:12:21.890 --> 00:12:24.313
So one of the upsides of using
a PWR is, like I mentioned,

00:12:24.313 --> 00:12:25.230
the higher efficiency.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.080
But also the chance of
leaking nuclear material

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.610
into the violent
becomes mitigated.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:33.660
Because you have two separate
loops with the nuclear fuel

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.512
being more isolated
from the environment,

00:12:35.512 --> 00:12:37.470
if there is a breach
between the condenser loop

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.120
and the secondary
loop, not a big deal.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.410
Nothing really bad happens.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:42.577
You'd have to have breaches
in both the loops, which

00:12:42.577 --> 00:12:44.660
is very unlikely to happen.

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:45.210
Yeah.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:47.710
So do you guys have any
questions about those two?

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.366
Yeah?

00:12:48.366 --> 00:12:50.699
AUDIENCE: What's the standard
like operating temperature

00:12:50.699 --> 00:12:51.840
of these kinds of reactors?

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.882
TA: I'm not completely
sure, but if you Google it

00:12:53.882 --> 00:12:55.950
you should be able to
find it very easily.

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:57.660
OK.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.160
So this next picture
is, again, just

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.840
to show you that like I
make it sound really simple

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.882
and like a walk in the
park, but it's really not.

00:13:02.882 --> 00:13:03.965
There's a lot going on.

00:13:03.965 --> 00:13:06.090
So this picture over here
is basically just showing

00:13:06.090 --> 00:13:08.340
that there are a lot
of redundancy systems

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.700
inside these reactors.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.927
Like we don't just have
one single primary loop

00:13:12.927 --> 00:13:14.010
and if it fails, it fails.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.380
We actually have four
at the same time,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.050
and this is just called the n
minus two redundancy, something

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.550
like that.

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:22.130
OK?

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:24.160
So the next kind is
something much cooler.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.485
It's got a heavy water reactor.

00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:27.110
Actually it's just
a little bit cooler.

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.530
But the main heavy water reactor
that everyone can kind of

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:31.930
think of on their
minds is CANDU,

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.760
which is the one that's
located in Canada.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.800
So the only difference
between heavy water reactors

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.883
and the light water reactors
as I mentioned before

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:40.558
is that it uses heavy water
instead of light water.

00:13:40.558 --> 00:13:42.100
Does anyone know
what heavy water is?

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.330
AUDIENCE: Deuterium oxide.

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:44.080
TA: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.288
So it's just deuterium oxide.

00:13:45.288 --> 00:13:49.480
So remember-- I'm sorry,
this might seem inane,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.390
but this is water, right?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.805
And this is heavy water,
where the D is just

00:13:54.805 --> 00:13:59.020
a hydrogen with two
atomic particles instead.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:02.620
So one proton and one neutron.

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.650
So the reason why they decide
to use heavy water instead

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.780
of light water is
because heavy water

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.300
has a much lower
absorption cross-section

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.860
than light water does.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:16.210
So what this means is that
when neutrons are flying around

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.930
in the reactor there is a
chance of it hitting a fission

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.900
product and a piece of
fissionable material

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.950
and undergoing fission.

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:26.380
But there's also a chance that
the water that surrounds it

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:27.620
will absorb that neutron.

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:29.230
So if that neutron gets
pulled out of the system

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:30.850
you're not able to
create any more fissions.

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:31.900
This is actually
kind of a bad thing

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.820
because the whole point
of nuclear reactors

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:35.070
is to create heat and fission.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.820
So we don't want those
neutrons to be absorbed.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.150
You can see, if you look
at those statistics,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.710
you can see that
the absorption cross

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:47.200
section of H2 or deuterium
is like 0.00052 barns,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.150
in comparison to H1,
which is 0.332 barns.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:53.400
So I'm bad at math, but I
think it's like 600 times less,

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.760
right?

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.260
Maybe?

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.390
Anyway, so you can see
why deuterium would

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.830
be a good option for this.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.080
So because it's absorbing less--

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:04.960
because it has a chance of
absorbing less neutrons as it

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.760
undergoes its processes,
you're actually

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:09.340
able to use a lower enriched
uranium, which is really great

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.070
because that lowers fuel costs.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:12.730
Yeah.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.407
But the main downside of this
is that, even though you're

00:15:15.407 --> 00:15:17.740
lowering your fuel costs,
deuterium is really expensive.

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:20.068
It's about 1,000 or so
dollars per kilogram,

00:15:20.068 --> 00:15:22.360
which is kind of ridiculous
because a kilogram of water

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.470
is really not much
at all, you know?

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:27.520
So even though you're
counteracting the lower fuel

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.580
costs with higher water cost.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.982
Also, because you're
using your reactor

00:15:32.982 --> 00:15:34.690
with lower enriched
uranium, you actually

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.520
have to change out
your fuel more often.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.775
That fuel gets
spent more quickly

00:15:38.775 --> 00:15:40.660
and I'll describe
that in just a second,

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.030
and therefore you just
have to keep replacing it

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:45.520
more often than you would for
a normal light water reactor.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.140
Cool?

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:49.283
Questions about this one?

00:15:49.283 --> 00:15:50.700
Oh, I forgot to
mention, but aside

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.400
from that, everything else
with the heavy water reactors

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:58.260
and the PWRs, they're
the same mechanisms.

00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.810
And finally we're going to
move on to breeder reactors.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.920
So breeder reactors
are a really cool idea,

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.380
and they were most
popular between like

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.400
the '50s and the '60s-ish in
the very beginning of creating

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.570
nuclear reactors.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:12.220
So what breeder
reactors are are,

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:13.300
again, they're
essentially the same thing

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.467
as light water reactors I
mentioned you guys before.

00:16:15.467 --> 00:16:17.410
But instead, now there's
two little chunks

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:18.402
of extra material.

00:16:18.402 --> 00:16:20.860
So do you guys know what the
difference is between fissile,

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.310
fertile, and
fissionable material is?

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.130
Cool.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:32.110
All right, so all right, let's
start with fissile material.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.650
So fissile material is
basically just the material

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.200
that is willing to undergo
fission with a thermal neutron.

00:17:15.453 --> 00:17:16.277
OK.

00:17:16.277 --> 00:17:17.819
So basically when
the thermal neutron

00:17:17.819 --> 00:17:20.290
gets absorbed by this
fissionable material,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.500
it's going to undergo a fission.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.155
Makes a lot of sense, right?

00:17:24.155 --> 00:17:25.530
So do you guys
happen to remember

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.990
what the energy of a
thermal neutron is?

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:28.515
You guys calculated
this in pset 1.

00:17:28.515 --> 00:17:29.015
Huh?

00:17:29.015 --> 00:17:30.600
AUDIENCE: 1 eV?

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.620
TA: Lower than that.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:32.520
AUDIENCE: 0.025?

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.190
TA: Yeah, 0.025 eV.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.430
Like super low energy.

00:17:38.208 --> 00:17:40.250
And while we're at it,
how do you calculate this?

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.380
Bozeman constant times T. Cool?

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:48.880
Whew.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.770
So main examples
of fissile material

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:56.590
would be U235 and plutonium 239.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.540
There's four in
total, but those are

00:17:58.540 --> 00:17:59.820
the two most important ones.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:06.430
OK.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:11.380
So this is the main fuel that
is inside a nuclear reactor,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.103
but it's not all just U235.

00:18:13.103 --> 00:18:15.520
Like you guys have heard of--
oh, shoot, what's it called?

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.803
Enrichment, right?

00:18:16.803 --> 00:18:18.220
Enrichment is
basically the amount

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.400
of fissile material versus the
amount of other fissionable

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.000
material.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.590
So moving onto
fissionable material.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.690
So fissionable material
is just material

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.040
that is able to undergo fission
after the absorption of a more

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.367
energetic neutron.

00:18:40.367 --> 00:18:41.200
So that's all it is.

00:19:12.705 --> 00:19:14.000
So that's all it is.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.770
So an example of
fissionable material

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:20.250
that's inside the other reactors
at the same time is U238.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:24.020
So if a U238 absorbs
a thermal neutron,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.530
it's not going to do much.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:28.640
But if it absorbs a neutron
of about like, I would say,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.130
like 2 meV, then it's more
willing to undergo fission.

00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:33.580
Cool?

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:36.580
And finally we have
fertile material.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.050
So fertile material is the
basis for breeder reactors.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:43.910
But fertile material is just
material that absorbs a neutron

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.480
and then is able to become
a piece of fissile material.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.870
So for our purposes,
the main types

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:13.005
of fertile material we use
are U238 and thorium 232.

00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:14.380
So if you look at
these processes

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:16.510
you can see that U238
absorbs a neutron,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.480
becomes U239, undergoes a
beta decay to come neptunium

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.670
and undergoes one more
beta decay to become

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:24.010
the beautiful plutonium 239.

00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:26.170
If we start with
thorium 232 instead,

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:28.810
absorbs a neutron,
becomes thorium 233,

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.330
undergoes a beta decay
to become protactinium,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.690
becomes uranium 233, which
is another fissile material

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.240
by the way, through a
series of beta decays.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.430
Cool?

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:40.180
So that's what breeder
reactors are doing.

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.630
They're adding extra
chunks of uranium 238

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:45.970
and extra chunks of thorium
232 into the reactor.

00:20:45.970 --> 00:20:48.180
If one of the
neutrons-- so imagine--

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.930
if you're looking at
the little fuel core,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.013
there's a bunch of neutrons
that are flying around

00:20:52.013 --> 00:20:54.080
and heat and other isotopes
and things like that.

00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.455
So some of the neutrons will
go and create other fissions

00:20:56.455 --> 00:20:58.480
with the material that's
hanging out in the red.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.307
But other neutrons
might escape, and when

00:21:00.307 --> 00:21:02.140
they escape, instead
of going into the water

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:04.557
dissipating and never to be
seen again or being reflected,

00:21:04.557 --> 00:21:07.425
they instead create
more fissile material.

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:08.800
So you can understand
why this is

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.870
a kind of an attractive
idea, is that you're

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.280
creating your own fuel.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.770
You're able to work at
a higher fuel efficiency

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:17.500
because you don't need to add
in as much fissile materials

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.268
as you would for a normal
light water reactor.

00:21:20.268 --> 00:21:22.810
So people were really fascinated
with this idea, like I said,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:23.650
in the 50s and 60s.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.690
Because back in the
day they legitimately

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:27.860
thought that we would
run out of U235.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.410
But luckily in the
60s we discovered

00:21:29.410 --> 00:21:31.750
that we have a lot more uranium
ore than we thought we did.

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.810
We're probably not going
to run out anytime soon.

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.460
And after that discovery, people
were not nearly as interested

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.050
in breeder reactors.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.930
The reason being is that,
one, because there's just

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:42.897
this extra material
that's hanging out,

00:21:42.897 --> 00:21:44.980
this extra material could
be more fissile material

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:46.147
that creates more reactions.

00:21:46.147 --> 00:21:50.200
It's not nearly as
power efficient.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:52.773
And it's also slightly
more expensive

00:21:52.773 --> 00:21:54.940
because you're not being
able to be power efficient.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:58.750
And it also is better on paper
than it ever is in reality.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:00.970
So on paper you're
like, oh, this is great,

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:02.470
because I can just create
more fissile materials.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.580
I never need to add more.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.040
This is never really
truly sustainable.

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.332
They always have to keep
adding more fissile materials,

00:22:07.332 --> 00:22:10.510
because it's not as perfect
as they want it to be.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:12.100
Any questions
about these things?

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:17.370
Great.

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:18.185
Cool beans.

00:22:18.185 --> 00:22:19.810
And then finally
we're going to move on

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:21.090
to generation four reactors.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.850
So generation four reactors are
all the new kind of reactors

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:25.390
that people want to build.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.362
So the primary objective for
these new designs of reactors--

00:22:28.362 --> 00:22:29.820
like, the ones I
just told you guys

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:30.990
about, they're
all good and well,

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:32.640
but we want to make
them better, right?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.130
We want to make them cleaner and
safer and more cost effective.

00:22:36.130 --> 00:22:37.950
Keep them robust
yet sustainable,

00:22:37.950 --> 00:22:40.650
and also make them more
resistant to people

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:43.980
being able to divert materials
into creating nuclear weapons.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:44.670
So yeah.

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:46.500
Here are the six
kinds of generation

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.360
four reactor types
that were deemed

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.870
to be the most promising.

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:53.430
So there's gas-cooled
fast reactors,

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.540
lead-cooled fast reactors,
molten salt reactors,

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:59.010
sodium-cooled fast reactors,
very high temperature gas

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:02.253
reactors, and supercritical
water-cooled reactors.

00:23:02.253 --> 00:23:03.920
So I'm going to be
honest with you guys.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.650
I don't know all
that much about these

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.733
and I don't want to like
spew out information that

00:23:07.733 --> 00:23:08.922
might potentially be false.

00:23:08.922 --> 00:23:10.380
So if you guys are
interested, one,

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:11.755
you can talk to
other lab members

00:23:11.755 --> 00:23:13.330
or people in this department.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:15.480
I know they're-- mostly
Mike's group, actually.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.938
A lot of people in
Mike's group are

00:23:16.938 --> 00:23:19.320
working on molten salt
reactors so you guys can go

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.120
ahead and ask them about that.

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.680
Or if you're interested you
can read more about them

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.210
with this hyperlink that
I included over here.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:25.830
Hopefully he will
post the slides online

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:27.413
and you guys just
click it and there's

00:23:27.413 --> 00:23:30.726
a awesome source all about these
different kinds of reactors.

00:23:30.726 --> 00:23:31.226
OK?

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.450
All right.

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.480
Any questions?

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:39.980
Hi.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:41.688
AUDIENCE: Do any of
these actually exist,

00:23:41.688 --> 00:23:44.032
or is it all just theory?

00:23:44.032 --> 00:23:46.240
TA: I'm pretty sure that
they were just kind of proof

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.365
of concept stage right now.

00:23:47.365 --> 00:23:50.000
Like there aren't any that
are producing electricity

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.155
in the United States, at least.

00:23:54.155 --> 00:23:55.580
Cool.

00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.750
Good question.

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:58.280
All right.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:00.920
So all the things that we've
mentioned before like how

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.260
great nuclear is and all
the cool applications of it

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.960
and how simple and
easy reactors are,

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.670
why aren't we using more of it?

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.060
So currently in the US there's
only 99 operating reactors

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:14.780
that are producing electricity,
which makes up about 19%

00:24:14.780 --> 00:24:17.300
or about 20% of the
total electricity

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:18.890
output in the United States.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.780
The main players
are still, you would

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.030
imagine, coal and natural gas.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:27.532
So this is actually even worse
in the rest of the world.

00:24:27.532 --> 00:24:29.740
In the rest of world, there's
only about 440 reactors

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:32.930
spread around 30 countries
and produces only 14%

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:34.760
of the global electricity.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.300
So these proportions
are pretty low.

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.788
And you're wondering,
like, why aren't we

00:24:38.788 --> 00:24:39.830
using more nuclear power?

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:42.170
What exactly is holding us back?

00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:44.840
So it turns out that the main
things that are holding us back

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:51.200
is just social, economic,
and therefore like government

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.260
hesitance to start using
nuclear power more often.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.120
So the main reason
why we're a little bit

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.870
hesitant to start using
more nuclear power

00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.660
is because of safety issues.

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:02.730
So nuclear-- none of us can
argue that nuclear is like 100%

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:03.230
safe.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.090
It actually does have
some dangers associated

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:07.173
with it, which is why it's
so important that we're

00:25:07.173 --> 00:25:08.210
doing what we're doing.

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.270
But if you guys
look at this chart

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.900
that I showed you guys in like
the first or second slide,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.260
you'll notice that there are
these events listed above.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.990
What are these words?

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:20.416
Three Mile Island, Chernobyl,
Fukushima, what are they?

00:25:20.416 --> 00:25:21.190
AUDIENCE: Nuclear accidents.

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.210
TA: Yeah, so they're some of
our biggest nuclear accidents

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.710
that we've experienced
in history.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.720
And you can see that
after a nuclear accident

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.640
you can see a
pretty steep decline

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.230
in the amount of
nuclear reactors

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:31.520
that are being commissioned.

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.700
So this is especially noticeable
at Three Mile Island, which

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.720
is essentially the first nuclear
reactor accident that we all

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.490
had to go through.

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.240
You can see that, after
Three Mile Island,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.642
you can see this
massive steep decline

00:25:44.642 --> 00:25:46.850
in the amount of nuclear
reactors being commissioned.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.058
This is probably causational.

00:25:48.058 --> 00:25:49.580
We can pretty much assume that.

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:51.500
And then you can see
that Chernobyl-- once

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.480
Chernobyl happened, you
can see like this also

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.740
another massive decline.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.440
And again Fukushima, once
again, with the amount

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:00.140
of reactors being commissioned
after the accident just

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.740
declines dramatically.

00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:04.243
So I'm assuming
you guys probably

00:26:04.243 --> 00:26:06.910
don't know exactly what happened
during each of these accidents.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:08.510
Like you probably
know that they exist,

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.968
but like what
happened during them?

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:11.970
So if you do know, sorry,
but if you don't know,

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.165
you're about to know.

00:26:13.165 --> 00:26:15.040
So Three Mile Island,
which is the first one,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.860
it happened in 1979 on March 28.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:22.390
So Three Mile Island reactor is
a PWR located in Pennsylvania.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:26.200
So during this time it
underwent a core meltdown.

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:28.240
The cause of this
is just the fact

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.020
that there was some kind of
mechanical or electrical system

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.700
that prevented coolant
water from being

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.230
pumped into the primary system.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.040
So because there
wasn't enough water

00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:42.490
coming to cool up the core,
the core began to overheat.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.320
So as the temperature
of the core rises,

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.700
the pressure also rises.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.030
So they notice this and
they're like, oh, shoot,

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:47.830
we got to fix that.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:49.990
So luckily there is like
a little emergency valve

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:52.032
that you can see in this
animation gets opened up

00:26:52.032 --> 00:26:53.270
and pressure gets released.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.073
So that's all good and
well, but unfortunately

00:26:56.073 --> 00:26:57.490
after the pressure's
released, you

00:26:57.490 --> 00:26:59.657
should close the valve again
and continue operation.

00:26:59.657 --> 00:27:01.180
But it became stuck.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.830
So this valve became
stuck and they

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.288
didn't realize that
it became stuck

00:27:04.288 --> 00:27:07.000
because their equipment
and their instrumentation

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.200
wasn't able to detect that.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.918
So they continued to operate
again but this valve was open,

00:27:10.918 --> 00:27:13.210
so there was actually water
that was getting leaked out

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.245
of this primary loop.

00:27:16.245 --> 00:27:18.008
So because the water
was getting leaked,

00:27:18.008 --> 00:27:20.300
they noticed that, oh, shoot,
the pressure is dropping.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:22.383
Well, what do you do when
the pressure's dropping?

00:27:22.383 --> 00:27:24.520
Apparently you have to
make sure that there's not

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.603
too many vibrations that
could damage the reactor,

00:27:26.603 --> 00:27:28.600
so they shut off
the coolant pumps.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.030
Or they lower the operation
of the coolant pumps.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:34.030
So now there's water leaking out
so the core is getting hotter,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.770
but then they also
took out the water

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:38.553
that is usually used to
cool the reactor core,

00:27:38.553 --> 00:27:39.970
so again it's also
getting hotter.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:43.450
So this combination of events
led to a core meltdown.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:45.730
So the core melted down.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:48.990
That's never a good
thing, by the way.

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.555
Yeah.

00:27:49.555 --> 00:27:52.008
And yeah, so the
core melted down,

00:27:52.008 --> 00:27:53.800
the reactor wasn't able
to operate anymore.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:55.420
But luckily at Three
Mile Island there

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.790
was containment that
prevented radioactive isotopes

00:27:57.790 --> 00:27:59.650
from leaving the system.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:01.343
So they actually
took a brief survey--

00:28:01.343 --> 00:28:02.260
or not a brief survey.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.890
That's probably a
long, long experience.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:05.932
But they realized that
the two million people who

00:28:05.932 --> 00:28:07.750
are around Three Mile
Island at the time,

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.950
within like a two mile radius
or like maybe a 30 mile radius

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.113
or something like that,
they realized that they

00:28:14.113 --> 00:28:15.280
didn't get much dose at all.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.650
They collected about a total
of 1 milligram more dose

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:18.520
than usual.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.190
So to put that in perspective,
an x-ray is six milligrams.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:23.692
So really nothing that
happened at Three Mile Island

00:28:23.692 --> 00:28:25.150
other than they
had to shut it down

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:26.692
and they had to do
expensive repairs.

00:28:26.692 --> 00:28:27.728
But people weren't hurt.

00:28:27.728 --> 00:28:29.020
The environment wasn't damaged.

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:31.060
It wasn't that bad
of a situation.

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:33.130
I think the effect
was bigger in concept

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:36.130
than it was in actual damage.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:40.050
Questions about Three
Mile Island accident?

00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:40.750
All righty.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:43.250
The next reactor accident, the
big kahuna I like to call it,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.260
is Chernobyl.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.750
So on April 25,
1986 an RMBK reactor

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:50.600
that was located in
Ukraine exploded.

00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.885
So what they were
doing at Chernobyl

00:28:52.885 --> 00:28:54.260
during the time
of this explosion

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.427
is that they're actually
running, ironically enough,

00:28:56.427 --> 00:28:57.600
safety tests.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.510
They were running the
reactor at low power

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.987
to see how it behaves.

00:29:00.987 --> 00:29:03.320
So at low power, I don't think
they quite realized this,

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.940
but the coolant
pumps in the reactor

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.620
were also powered by the
nuclear reactor being generated.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:09.610
So if they're running
this at low power,

00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:11.690
their coolant pumps weren't
getting enough energy

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:13.850
to properly cool the fuel core.

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:16.250
So that was unfortunate,
and they realized

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:17.550
that this is a bad thing.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.878
So the reactor starts
to go supercritical.

00:29:20.878 --> 00:29:23.420
So when they realize that the
reactor was creating a lot more

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:25.515
fissions than it should
have been creating,

00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:27.140
they decide to insert
the control rods.

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.640
So thank goodness we have these
high absorption control rods

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.340
to slow things down, right?

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.410
For some reason, I'm
not completely sure

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:37.010
why they did this, but
RBMKs, they have graphite

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.155
tipped control rods.

00:29:38.155 --> 00:29:39.530
So as they lower
the control rods

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.030
into the water, this graphite
tip, which doesn't effectively

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:44.540
absorb neutrons, it displaced
a little bit too much water

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.873
than was necessary, and that
caused the first explosion.

00:29:46.873 --> 00:29:49.880
So it went super duper critical
and caused the first explosion

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.880
at Chernobyl.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.415
Then, for some reason like
a couple of minutes later,

00:29:55.415 --> 00:29:56.540
there's a second explosion.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.000
They're not completely sure why
the second explosion happened.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.708
To this day we can't
really pinpoint why.

00:30:00.708 --> 00:30:03.470
It could have been like
building up helium or just

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:04.845
a ton of other
fission reactions.

00:30:04.845 --> 00:30:06.887
But there's a second
explosion that actually just

00:30:06.887 --> 00:30:08.090
blew this entire core apart.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.740
So that kind of stunk, but it
did stop the whole reaction.

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:15.127
Because a super critical
mass was all blown apart,

00:30:15.127 --> 00:30:16.460
it was no longer super critical.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:17.230
It was fine.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.980
The whole debacle stopped.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.720
But unfortunately,
there was a lot

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.320
of radioactive isotopes being
spread into the environment.

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.362
First of all, Chernobyl
didn't have the same kind

00:30:26.362 --> 00:30:28.112
of containment that
Three Mile Island had,

00:30:28.112 --> 00:30:30.320
so these isotopes were
just able to go everywhere.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.330
And also the second
explosion had a lot of steam

00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:34.747
with it that carried these
isotopes even further than they

00:30:34.747 --> 00:30:35.983
probably should have gone.

00:30:35.983 --> 00:30:38.150
So if you're looking at the
statistics of Chernobyl,

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.950
it turned out that
28 highly exposed

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:42.830
reactor staff and emergency
workers die from this radiation

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:44.930
or from thermal burns
during this time.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.500
And officials also
believe that there

00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.910
is about 7,000 cases of
thyroid cancer that occurred

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:51.050
because of Chernobyl.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:52.430
They're pretty sure it was
Chernobyl because these

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:54.230
are all cases that
happened in people

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.690
who are less than 18 years old.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.150
So you guys know that no one
really lives near Chernobyl

00:30:59.150 --> 00:30:59.930
at the moment.

00:30:59.930 --> 00:31:01.400
It's kind of been
deemed unlivable

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.350
because these radioactive
isotopes literally went

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:04.310
everywhere in this environment.

00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:06.380
Like it was in the water,
it was in the plants.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:07.280
It's not safe to live there.

00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.720
It's a pretty
radioactive environment.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.030
Luckily we see that there are
animals coming back now now.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.620
If you look on
NationalGeographic.com

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.140
there's like little deer
roaming around Chernobyl.

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.260
But it's been about-- how long
has it been, like 30, 40 years?

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.280
People aren't advised
to live here still.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.690
So Chernobyl was terrible.

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:25.590
Questions?

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.757
Yeah?

00:31:26.757 --> 00:31:29.340
AUDIENCE: What does it mean for
a reactor to go supercritical?

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:30.173
TA: Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:31:30.173 --> 00:31:33.107
So you guys will learn all about
criticality in a little bit,

00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:34.690
but basically when
I say supercritical

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.648
it just means that there's
way too many fission

00:31:36.648 --> 00:31:39.184
reactions happening.

00:31:39.184 --> 00:31:40.975
Yeah?

00:31:40.975 --> 00:31:43.100
AUDIENCE: You said it went
supercritical because it

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.990
wasn't being cooled enough or?

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:46.740
TA: I think I might
have skipped a detail.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.500
It wasn't being cooled enough
so the water was evaporating

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:50.000
and then it became supercritical
because there was not

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.150
enough neutrons being
slowed down or absorbed.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.120
My bad, I'm sorry.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.530
Good?

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:57.380
All right.

00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:00.380
So the next reactor accident
that we were alive for,

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:03.380
which is cool, was
Fukushima Daiichi.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:06.390
So Fukushima Daiichi
happened in 2011 on March 11,

00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:10.920
and Fukushima is in Japan.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.080
So these reactors, I think these
are pressurized water reactors.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:16.090
Yeah, I think so.

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.210
So following a major earthquake,
the generators that were--

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:21.310
pardon.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:23.660
Yeah, so following
a major earthquake,

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.200
the things that were cooling
the core, they broke.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.840
I think they're just like power
generators on the side that

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.200
did--

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.700
yeah.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.480
They broke the cooling pumps.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.980
So there wasn't
enough water being

00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:35.327
able to go to the fuel core.

00:32:35.327 --> 00:32:36.910
This is a very similar
problem, as you

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.055
can see that in all these
instances of the reactor

00:32:39.055 --> 00:32:41.180
incidents, it's just kind
of like the fuel core was

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.010
misbehaving and we
weren't able to get

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:44.510
enough coolant water to it.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:47.010
So following the earthquake,
these coolant pumps broke.

00:32:47.010 --> 00:32:48.238
They're like, oh, that's OK.

00:32:48.238 --> 00:32:50.030
What we can do is we
have backup generators

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.280
to continue running the pumps.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:52.700
It'll be all OK.

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.965
Nothing will happen.

00:32:53.965 --> 00:32:54.590
We're all good.

00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:55.640
And then a tsunami hit.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.290
So it was a foot
tsunami I think--

00:32:57.290 --> 00:32:57.920
I think that--

00:32:57.920 --> 00:33:00.010
15 meter tsunami, oh good gosh.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.360
So a 15 meter tsunami
hit and it broke

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.050
the generators and then at that
point they're like, oh, no.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.090
So they had no other
redundancy factors

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:10.340
to continue pumping cool
water into the fuel core.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.798
So again, there
wasn't enough water

00:33:11.798 --> 00:33:13.360
in the core, it
became supercritical,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:17.090
it began to melt. So the
fuel rods began to melt,

00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:19.470
but this is actually another
additional bad thing.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.610
So the water was
evaporating, creating steam.

00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:24.440
The fuel rods were
coated with zirconium.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.180
So what you guys
might not know is

00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:28.880
that when zirconium and steam
interact with each other,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.090
that's not a good thing.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.790
It starts to explode.

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:37.280
So as you can see, the
reactors at Fukushima Daiichi

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.450
began to explode.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:41.918
There was radioactive
isotopes being spread out all

00:33:41.918 --> 00:33:42.710
around the country.

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:44.030
You guys probably saw
the lovely flow charts

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:45.950
of the radioactivity
flowing out from Japan

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:47.630
and making it to California
and contaminating your fish

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.620
and stuff like that.

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:52.500
But luckily, no one was directly
hurt by burns or radioactive

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.000
exposure.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.230
Cool?

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:55.090
All right.

00:33:55.090 --> 00:33:56.467
Questions about Fukushima?

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:00.290
Solid.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.050
So aside from these
safety issues,

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:06.130
these safety issues that happen,
they get elevated in the news

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:06.761
quite a lot.

00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:09.219
So these are mainly the things
that people who don't really

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.750
have any background
in nuclear energy

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.650
hear about nuclear energy.

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.275
They're like, oh
shoot, well this thing

00:34:13.275 --> 00:34:14.900
is going to explode
every 20 years.

00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:16.458
Like, why do we keep using this?

00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:18.250
Reactor accidents are
actually pretty rare.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.520
If you think about it, it's
been about 60 or 70 years,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.219
we have 440 reactors
operating around the country.

00:34:24.219 --> 00:34:26.219
There's three main accidents
that have happened.

00:34:26.219 --> 00:34:28.636
But because these are the
things that people get ingrained

00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:30.610
into their mind-- thank
you, news stations--

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:32.350
people think that
nuclear reactors

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:33.719
are incredibly dangerous.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.920
And that's why we have this
social hesitance, which

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.250
is why we aren't able to get
enough government funding

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:39.880
and which is why there's
all these bureaucracy

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.830
loopholes to jump through,
which is why nuclear power isn't

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:42.900
more of a thing.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:43.480
Makes sense?

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.027
Yeah.

00:34:45.027 --> 00:34:47.110
Another issue that's
associated with nuclear power

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:48.429
is nuclear waste.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.409
So what in the world
do we do with it?

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:54.100
So first of all, the main thing
in nuclear waste is spent fuel.

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:56.440
So like I mentioned to
you guys, spent fuel rods

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.750
are made out of uranium oxide.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:59.458
But after undergoing
a bunch of fissions,

00:34:59.458 --> 00:35:02.380
these uranium particles get
transformed into other isotopes

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.980
that aren't fissionable or
fertile or even remotely

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:07.810
fissile, right?

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:10.300
So we eventually have to replace
them and add in new rods,

00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.080
and this is a process that
happens every 12 or so years.

00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.830
I'm not completely
sure on that statistic.

00:35:14.830 --> 00:35:16.690
But the main issue's
like, what do we

00:35:16.690 --> 00:35:18.700
do with all this material?

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.220
So this material that comes
out is pretty radioactive

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.110
and it's also
incredibly hot, so it

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:25.710
can be dangerous if someone
decides to come and eat it.

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:29.630
So that's why we've got to
figure out a way to expose it.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.260
So the primary way of
disposing of the spent fuel

00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:34.330
is putting it into
spent fuel pools.

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:36.850
So spent fuel pools are
just giant tanks of water

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.380
that exist at the reactor.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:39.850
So these tanks of
water are mixed

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:42.707
with I believe it's boron,
which is a neutron absorber.

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.290
They basically just
put the spent fuel

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.082
rods all the way at
the bottom of the pool.

00:35:46.082 --> 00:35:48.170
So this pool's about like
20 meters high, I think.

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:49.330
This is actually a
really good solution

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:52.290
because the water in the pool,
it cools down the reactor rods

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.010
and also prevents
a lot of neutrons

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.712
from escaping because water is a
really great neutron moderator.

00:35:56.712 --> 00:35:57.670
You guys all know this.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:00.427
It turns out it's
actually fairly safe.

00:36:00.427 --> 00:36:03.010
Apparently you can go swimming
on the top of the reactor spent

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.200
fuel pool and
you'll be OK and not

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.330
be exposed to too much
radiation if you want.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:09.413
So yeah.

00:36:09.413 --> 00:36:11.080
So this is the main
solution that people

00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.538
have been using
for years, but they

00:36:12.538 --> 00:36:14.410
realize that this isn't
super sustainable,

00:36:14.410 --> 00:36:16.702
because the amount of space
that we have in these spent

00:36:16.702 --> 00:36:18.140
fuel pools is not infinite.

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.070
We have way too much
spent fuel to be

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.570
able to just continue to store
it in these spent fuel pools.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:24.403
So like shoot, got to
find another solution.

00:36:24.403 --> 00:36:25.820
So the next solution
was something

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:26.990
called dry cask storage.

00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:28.840
So dry cask storage
is just a way

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.080
to keep this spent fuel
surrounded by an inert gas.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.130
And it's held inside a cask,
a cask just being probably

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.260
like a steel drum
that's bolted and welded

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.600
shut, and then there's
additional pieces

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.400
of shielding around it like
cement and lead, et cetera.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:46.330
So there's just
like gigantic tanks

00:36:46.330 --> 00:36:48.130
basically that are
sitting outside.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.290
So they put them
outside the reactor.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.707
As you can see,
it looks like it's

00:36:50.707 --> 00:36:53.400
sitting in a parking
lot outside the reactor.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.120
And so this is an OK solution.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.730
So basically what they do
is they take a spent fuel,

00:36:57.730 --> 00:37:00.700
let it sit in the pool
for about a year or so,

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.742
maybe two or three years.

00:37:01.742 --> 00:37:04.158
And then they're able to take
it out because at that point

00:37:04.158 --> 00:37:06.610
it's significantly less
radioactive because, you know,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:07.750
you guys know how to
calculate this, too.

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.250
You guys know like the half
life of different radioisotopes.

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:12.730
You see that the radioactivity
declines at a certain point.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.063
It's also more cool now so
they put them in these tanks,

00:37:15.063 --> 00:37:17.110
so they let these
tanks hang out outside.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:18.700
And this is an OK solution,
except for the fact

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:20.742
that, again, we just have
way too much spent fuel

00:37:20.742 --> 00:37:21.659
to be able to do this.

00:37:21.659 --> 00:37:24.200
It turns out that if you were
to just keep all the spent fuel

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.940
that we create in
fuel casks, it'd

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.600
take about 300 acres of land,
which is absolutely insane.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.578
And obviously no one
wants to take up that.

00:37:32.578 --> 00:37:34.870
Brief little side note, when
I was googling like images

00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:36.190
of dry cask storage
and I was looking

00:37:36.190 --> 00:37:38.020
for the different types,
what I found particularly

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.700
disturbing was that there's
only two types listed:

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.320
vertical storage and
horizontal storage.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.670
Like there's no
other solutions other

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:43.900
than these are giant tanks.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.000
Anyway, so people
realize that we

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.620
need to figure out
yet another way

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:49.540
to dispose of the
spent fuel, hopefully

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.420
a way that doesn't get in the
way of people's backyards.

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.270
So the idea was something called
deep geological repositories.

00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:58.600
So deep geologic
repositories literally just

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:00.400
means that they want to bury
the nuclear waste very deep

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.692
into the ground and never be
able to retrieve it again.

00:38:02.692 --> 00:38:04.847
So the main push for this was--

00:38:04.847 --> 00:38:07.180
well, first of all, it's a
permanent method of disposal.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.830
They hope to put
it in the ground

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:09.940
and never have to
think about it again,

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.530
so therefore the
regions that they

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.300
choose to bury in
the ground have

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.520
to fulfill a lot of criteria.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.947
So this criterion
includes not having

00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:19.030
a lot of seismic activity.

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.670
Because we are keeping this
nuclear waste underground

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.650
in these casks for like
thousands of years,

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:25.870
if there is a huge
earthquake, those casks break,

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.020
radiation gets everywhere.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.190
That's obviously
not a good thing

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:29.380
so we want to make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.580
We also have to make
sure that there's not

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:32.140
a lot of water
that leaks through,

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.518
because the water can
carry the radioisotopes

00:38:35.518 --> 00:38:37.810
and carry them into the
environment, which is something

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:39.418
else that we don't want to do.

00:38:39.418 --> 00:38:41.710
A lot of you guys chuckled
when you saw Yucca Mountain.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:45.400
So Yucca Mountain is the primary
push by the United States

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.867
to find a deep geological
repository somewhere

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:50.200
in the United States so we
can deal with our spent fuel.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.720
So in 2002 the main
push for this began.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.070
They spent a lot of money.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:55.528
They spent like
billions of dollars

00:38:55.528 --> 00:38:57.957
finding the perfect location
to put our spent fuel.

00:38:57.957 --> 00:38:59.540
They had like nine
different locations

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.680
and they finally narrowed
it down to Yucca Mountain.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.200
They're like, yes,
this is the one,

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.450
and they started digging
down deep into Yucca Mountain

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.610
and making this happen.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.560
But then things
weren't as peachy keen

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:11.150
as they hoped it would be.

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.340
So Yucca Mountain is
located in Nevada.

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:15.300
People in Nevada weren't
happy about this.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:18.113
They're like, why are we
getting tossed on nuclear waste?

00:39:18.113 --> 00:39:20.030
We don't even have nuclear
reactors in Nevada.

00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:21.320
This is not fair.

00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.940
There was a lot of opposition.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.440
And because of the
social opposition

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.790
there was government
opposition and many loopholes

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.540
we had to jump through,
and so it was just

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.720
becoming a huge disaster.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.430
They also realized that
it wasn't as geologically

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:32.270
sound as they had hoped.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.250
There's a lot more groundwater
running through and seeping

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.650
through Yucca Mountain than
they thought there would be,

00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:40.170
so it's actually not as
safe as they had hoped.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.510
So there's a huge debacle.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.490
Basically the costs are rising,
nothing much was happening,

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:45.740
there's a bunch of different
things preventing progression

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:46.490
from happening.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.610
And then 2011, under the
Obama Administration,

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:49.610
he just called it quits.

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:51.380
There's no more government
funding to Yucca Mountain.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.170
It's been abandoned, as you
can see from this lovely Google

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.950
picture.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:56.210
It's permanently closed.

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.793
And you can also see that like
14 people went out of their way

00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:00.023
to review Yucca Mountain.

00:40:00.023 --> 00:40:01.190
But we're actually doing OK.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.100
It's at like 3.6 stars,
just like a normal motel

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.510
or something like that, so
that has been abandoned.

00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:10.010
This idea has currently been
abandoned in the United States.

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:12.200
We're kind of still looking
for other solutions,

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.140
but we really don't have it
figured out all that well.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.200
There is one other kind of way
of dealing with nuclear waste,

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.220
which is repurposing.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:20.928
I personally think
nuclear repurposing is

00:40:20.928 --> 00:40:22.310
the coolest option out there.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.810
And basically
repurposing just means

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:25.560
you take the spent
fuel and you chemically

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.753
separate out any material that
could be continued to be used--

00:40:28.753 --> 00:40:30.170
any fissile material
that could be

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:31.820
continued to be used
in other reactors.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.700
So basically you
take the spent fuel--

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.820
and it turns out that 96%
of a used fuel assembly

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:37.460
is recyclable.

00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:38.840
So you take the spent
fuel, you take out

00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.620
what it is useful, you throw
away what's not useful,

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.170
which is also still
radioactive waste that

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.337
has to be put in a fuel
pool or something like that.

00:40:44.337 --> 00:40:46.460
But you have this
precious fuel that you

00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:48.470
can put into another reactor.

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:50.568
So this is actually
something that France

00:40:50.568 --> 00:40:52.610
and other places in Europe,
and Russia and Japan,

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:56.480
they use repurposing
quite a lot.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.610
For some reason the United
States doesn't do it.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.087
So the reason being is that
this is a really cool idea.

00:41:01.087 --> 00:41:01.920
It's like recycling.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:04.077
It's like very--
it's very clever.

00:41:04.077 --> 00:41:06.660
I think I think it's personally
one of the cleverer solutions,

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:10.520
but the issue is that it's kind
of a really expensive process.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.218
So repurposing fuel
takes a lot of money

00:41:13.218 --> 00:41:15.260
and it turns out that the
act of repurposing fuel

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:16.790
actually costs more
than just buying

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.620
a new chunk of uranium 235,
which is why we don't do it.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.600
It's not economically sound.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.400
So yeah.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.150
You guys have any
questions about anything

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.010
I've mentioned, about
deposition of nuclear waste?

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.510
Almost done.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.290
OK.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:31.880
So all these are issues.

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:33.963
Like, we have a lot of
nuclear waste to deal with.

00:41:33.963 --> 00:41:34.880
It is kind of--

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.328
there is an inherent danger
with using nuclear power.

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.870
But the real thing
that holds us back

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.880
from just having
nuclear power everywhere

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.550
and creating about
90% of our electricity

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:46.470
as we would hope it
would is economics.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.700
So in this world, money
really matters a lot.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.575
The economics of nuclear
power is actually

00:41:51.575 --> 00:41:54.470
a really complicated
topic and it changes

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:55.730
depending on who you talk to.

00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.990
There's a lot of factors
that are involved,

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.430
so you can include
certain factors

00:41:58.430 --> 00:42:00.740
into your calculations
like, oh, the cost

00:42:00.740 --> 00:42:02.738
of building the reactor
in the first place

00:42:02.738 --> 00:42:04.280
or like fuel costs
or operating costs

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:06.697
or maintenance costs or the
amount of money that comes out

00:42:06.697 --> 00:42:08.000
of damaging the environment.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.650
You can weigh all these
different factors in,

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:11.470
and everyone churns
out a different number.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.053
But basically everyone you talk
to, if you look at this chart,

00:42:14.053 --> 00:42:17.510
yellow is nuclear
power, the gray is coal,

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:18.973
and the blue is the natural gas.

00:42:18.973 --> 00:42:20.390
But basically,
anyone you talk to,

00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:22.160
you can see that
nuclear is not nearly as

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.520
economic of a source of
electricity generation

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.505
as any other of these
ones I mentioned.

00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:29.630
Unless you talk to UK.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.160
UK thinks it's OK.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:35.030
But everyone else is saying that
it's not as money efficient.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:37.548
So where are all these
costs coming from?

00:42:37.548 --> 00:42:39.590
So the primary costs
actually lies with something

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.465
called capital costs.

00:42:40.465 --> 00:42:42.230
So capital cost is
basically the sunk cost

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.790
of just building the reactor.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.890
Building reactors takes
billions of dollars.

00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.015
It also takes tons of time.

00:42:47.015 --> 00:42:48.473
And because it
takes a lot of time,

00:42:48.473 --> 00:42:50.660
interest rates also jack
up that price even further.

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:52.880
So basically it's just
this massive investment

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:55.150
they have to throw
in immediately,

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.900
and this is where most
of the issues lie.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.722
Like it's really hard to go to
an investor and be like, hey,

00:42:59.722 --> 00:43:02.180
can I have a billion dollars
to build this nuclear reactor?

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.350
It's going to take
five years and it's

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.910
going to take 20 more years for
you to get your profit back.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:06.980
How does that sound?

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:09.560
No investor is going to be
like, yeah, that's a good idea.

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:10.640
That's the main
reason why we can't

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.450
get nuclear up and running.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.980
We have a lot of plants
and we have the possibility

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.030
to create a lot of
plants, but we just

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:15.560
don't have the money to do so.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:19.190
Because it's a huge chunk of
money, like I mentioned before,

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:20.930
it takes a while to
get your profit back.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:23.415
And also, if for some
reason something happens,

00:43:23.415 --> 00:43:25.040
you have to stop
building your reactor.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.373
You just lost a billion dollars.

00:43:26.373 --> 00:43:27.970
Like, there's no
turning back, right?

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:29.720
If you look at this
chart over here, which

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.700
is breaking up the
cost of nuclear energy

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:32.960
per kilowatt hour, I believe--

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.710
gigawatt hour?

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:34.430
Kilowatt hour.

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.180
Kilowatt hour.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:37.350
You can see nuclear,
coal, and natural gas.

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:39.475
So this giant white chunk
over here refers to fuel.

00:43:39.475 --> 00:43:41.850
So if you can look at nuclear
power, the majority of cost

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:44.210
actually doesn't come
from nuclear fuel at all.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.880
It's just about $0.01
per kilowatt hour,

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.040
as compared to
natural gas, which

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.720
the majority of the
costs of electricity

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.920
actually come from the fuel.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:53.270
If you look at operation
and maintenance,

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.390
again it's not that
large of a chunk.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.750
It's about the same as
maintaining a coal power plant.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:58.340
But then if you look at
the capital cost, which

00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:00.298
is the dark gray color,
you can see how massive

00:44:00.298 --> 00:44:02.587
that is in comparison to
building natural gas and coal

00:44:02.587 --> 00:44:03.170
firing plants.

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.850
So yeah, I think
that's the main thing.

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.720
So because it is
more expensive, we

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.858
can't compete with other
forms of electricity.

00:44:12.858 --> 00:44:14.650
People buy the electricity
that's cheapest,

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.233
not necessarily the
electricity that's

00:44:16.233 --> 00:44:19.900
best for our grandchildren
or something like that.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:22.340
Yeah, so that's why nuclear
power isn't more of a thing,

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.830
and that ends my pretty
lengthy slide show.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.830
So do you guys have any
questions about anything

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.892
I mentioned?

00:44:27.892 --> 00:44:30.100
If you guys are interested
about any of these topics,

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:32.320
like if any of these things
piqued your interest,

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:33.670
I recommend going to NRC.gov.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:35.462
They have a lot of
really cool information.

00:44:35.462 --> 00:44:37.530
Let me write that down,
because I talk quickly.

00:44:43.552 --> 00:44:46.010
That's basically where I got
the majority of my information

00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:48.050
for the slide show, and
it is a reliable source.

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.092
It might just be skewed
a little bit pro nuclear,

00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:51.540
so just keep that in mind.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:53.600
But there's a lot
of crazy sources

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.820
out there on the interwebs.

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.850
Take them with a grain of
salt. Take NRC.gov with less

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:00.540
grains of salt than usual.

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.363
Or if one of these things
really piqued your interest,

00:45:03.363 --> 00:45:05.030
you guys can take
22.04, which is really

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:07.610
cool class that's offered
here I think this spring,

00:45:07.610 --> 00:45:09.110
and if not this
spring, next spring.

00:45:09.110 --> 00:45:11.060
But basically it's called
nuclear power society.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.643
It's taught by a guy
named Scott Kemp.

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:14.990
He talks about all these
things and in a lot

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:16.770
of detail and slower.

00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:18.120
So yeah, cool.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.770
So thank you guys
so much for coming.

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.728
I know you guys could
have slept an extra hour,

00:45:21.728 --> 00:45:24.910
but instead you heard
me ramble for an hour.

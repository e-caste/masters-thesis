00:00:25.715 --> 00:00:27.090
PROFESSOR: What
we're going to be

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.460
doing over the next few
days, today and on Tuesday,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.380
is really diving into
the device fundamentals,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.120
and then on Tuesday,
the materials

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.830
fundamentals, of how a solar
cell device really works.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.240
And what we've done so
far is skimmed along

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.130
at a very high level using
only the necessary physics

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.270
and nothing more to describe
how solar cell works.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.960
Because we want to give you
an intuition about solar cell

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.700
device operation.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.450
PROFESSOR: The alternative
way of teaching

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.700
PV is that we go heavy on
the device physics upfront,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.030
you're completely overloaded,
your RAM is completely full,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.910
and by the time we
actually get to IV curves,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.170
you're completely lost.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.460
So hopefully you have
some intuitive sense now

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.210
about how a PV device works.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.640
Now we're going to be
doing some deep dives

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.390
into some advanced
concepts so that we really

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.620
have a sophisticated
understanding of how

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.740
a solar cell works.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.820
So let's dive into the lecture
material for the 1D device

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.290
model, we want to be able
to create a one dimensional

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.870
model that describes how
a solar cell operates.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.010
So we want to capture all
of the necessary physics

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.540
from the materials
and the device

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.050
to describe the
IV characteristics

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.300
of a solar cell.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.680
So we'll do at
the very beginning

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.500
is start a little
bit of nomenclature

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.680
so we understand what we're
talking about in terms

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.767
of energy conversion efficiency
and quantum efficiency.

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:49.100
And then we'll start describing
the different parameters

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.121
that effect energy conversion
efficiency and efficiency here.

00:01:54.121 --> 00:01:56.620
So one of the first key concepts
that's very, very important

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:58.980
to understand is that energy
conversion efficiency is not

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.521
the same thing as
quantum efficiency.

00:02:00.521 --> 00:02:02.570
You'll here these two
terms used quite frequently

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.860
the PV community.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.910
Now, I would say we're really
starting to get sophisticated

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.950
about their use.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.130
In the very beginning of
the field-- well let's

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.390
put it this way, in the
third wave of PV, which

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.740
began at around late 1990s
early 2000s, which was really

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.090
when, say, some of
the novel materials--

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.410
quantum dot-based solar cells,
some modern organic material

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.770
based solar cells-- really
started to take off,

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.610
there wasn't that sophisticated
of understanding of some

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.040
of the nomenclature in PV.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.360
And so terms were used
in a confusing way.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.820
When you read some of the papers
back from the early 2000s,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.130
you might pick up
on some of this.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.530
And So that's why I have this
slide right here describing

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.155
very clearly what is
quantum efficiency

00:02:43.155 --> 00:02:45.329
and what is energy
conversion efficiency.

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.870
So energy conversion efficiency
is pretty easy to understand.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.390
We've been talking
about that all class.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.848
We've been talking
about how photon

00:02:50.848 --> 00:02:52.690
comes in with a certain
amount of energy.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.230
And you extract electrons
for your solar cell device

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.730
that of a certain
amount of energy.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.188
And that ratio would be the
energy conversion efficiencies,

00:02:59.188 --> 00:03:01.520
essentially the
energy coming out

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.760
divided by the energy going in.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.570
So if, for example, one
photon comes in with three EV

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.770
and generates an electron
hole pair, which is then

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.420
extracted from the device with
a voltage of say 0.6 volts,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.920
we would have an
energy conversion

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.300
efficiency less than 1,
somewhere around 15% or so.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.280
Whereas if we looked
at quantum efficiency

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.960
and define quantum efficiency
as the number of electrons

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.820
out per incident
photon, that means

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.460
if we have one photon coming
in and one electron coming out

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.020
of our device, we have a quantum
efficiency of 1, or 100%.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.970
So quantum efficiency
can be thought

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.990
of as collection efficiency.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.450
It means how many electron hole
pairs were generated inside

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.200
of the device, and how
many were collected

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.022
coming out of the device.

00:03:47.022 --> 00:03:48.730
There's a little bit
more to it than that

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.479
dealing with reflectivity
off the surface.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.900
I'll get to that slide or two.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.316
But it can be thought of roughly
as collection efficiency,

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:56.540
as whereas energy conversion
efficiency is really

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.790
what you think of in terms
of thermodynamic efficiency

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.640
of a device.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.730
Why is this important?

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.600
Well, there are
papers out there--

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.200
this is an old one, I think,
in nature of materials,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.110
if I'm not mistaken,
that started

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.420
using a bunch of terms, right.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.649
So under 5 volts
bias and illumination

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.940
from a 975 nanometer
laser-- so nothing

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.480
like a polychromatic
solar spectrum,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.440
this is a monochromatic
light source--

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.800
our detectors show an internal
quantum efficiency of 3%.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.700
The photovoltaic response
under this monochromatic light

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.620
results in a maximum open
circuit voltage of so and so,

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.150
a short circuit current 350
nanoamps-- very, very tiny--

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.040
and a short circuit current
internal quantum efficiency

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.090
of 0.006%.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.760
So what they're
talking about here

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.780
is a quantum
efficiency of 0.006%.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.150
As we've already done just
by the simple example the 3 V

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.941
phonon coming in and
exciting electron hole

00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:57.620
pair, quantum efficiency
of 1 but energy conversion

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.820
efficiency below
20%, we can already

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.990
guess that the energy
conversion efficiency

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.630
of a device like this, even
for monochromatic light,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.260
is going to be very low.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.010
So the reason I'm highlighting
this abstract right here

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.810
is because it's a great
example of the plethora

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.750
of different terms that you
can find in reading a paper.

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.170
And if you focus on just a few
of them, like oh, 3%-- wow,

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.030
that's awesome, 3%
device efficiency.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.150
No, it's not energy
conversion efficiency.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.630
That's the quantum efficiency
under a very specific bias

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.340
condition, reverse bias is
like a photo detector, not

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.860
a solar cell, not under
forward bias conditions.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.000
OK, so what does
this really mean,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.240
this 0.006% short circuit
internal quantum efficiency?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.900
Well, we defined our energy
conversion efficiency

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.400
or solar conversion efficiency
as power out divided by power

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.600
in.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.330
That was done in the
previous lectures.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.680
The power out to would
the power and the current

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.120
and the voltage product at the
maximum power point divided

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.164
by the solar flux coming in.

00:06:03.164 --> 00:06:04.830
And that would be
equivalent to the fill

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.371
factor times the short circuit
current times the open circuit

00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.320
voltage.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.420
And typical values for
energy conversion efficiency

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.700
are in the 12% to 20%
range, I would say.

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.600
Maybe less than 10% for
emerging technologies.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.700
But these are typical values.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.610
And the solar flux, the
illumination intensity

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.490
might vary as well.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.180
But typically we talk about
one sun, or AM 1.5 illumination

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:29.930
conditions, right.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.665
So that's our spectrum
at AM 1.5 conditions,

00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:35.060
what we did on
homework number one.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.715
Now the quantum efficiency
has two flavors.

00:06:38.715 --> 00:06:40.465
One we'll call external
quantum efficiency

00:06:40.465 --> 00:06:42.215
and the other internal
quantum efficiency.

00:06:42.215 --> 00:06:43.923
And basically the
difference between them

00:06:43.923 --> 00:06:46.240
is the reflectance off the
front surface of the device.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.830
The internal quantum
efficiency essentially

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.230
factors out the reflectance.

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.670
The external quantum efficiency
is really taking reflectance

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.110
into account as well.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.090
So external quantum
efficiency is

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.380
defined as electrons out per
photons toward the device.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.520
We say photons in,
but this is really

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.519
how many photons are impingent
upon the device itself.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.310
Some of those photons
will be reflected off

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.450
the front surface.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.250
Other photons will
go into the device

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:13.659
and generate
electron hole pairs.

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:15.450
Or some will go straight
through the device

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:18.420
and be absorbed in the
back surface or so forth.

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.300
So the EQE, external quantum
efficiency, typical peak

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.490
values range between
60% and 90% depending

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.540
on the reflectivity for
moderate efficiency devices.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.740
So the reason peak
values ranging 60 to 90

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.170
is because there's going to
be some band of wavelengths

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.660
at which the solar cell
really responds well.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:42.870
It's really efficient at
converting those photons

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.560
into electron hole pairs.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.030
And were the sun-- instead
of a beautiful polychromatic

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.310
blackbody emission
source-- if the sun where

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.280
a monochromatic
light source tuned

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.430
to that particular
wavelength, the solar cell

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.910
would be wicked efficient.

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:56.810
But it's not.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.725
So this is why EQE is
an interesting parameter

00:08:00.725 --> 00:08:02.770
is because it tells
you the response

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.290
of the solar cell to
different spectral conditions.

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:08.780
And that's why we sometimes
call it spectral response

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.550
of a solar cell device.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.024
By the way, those
who need notes,

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:13.940
if you would be so kind
as to raise your hand,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:18.124
Joe will pass them around as
well so we can have enough

00:08:18.124 --> 00:08:19.290
for everybody to write down.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.630
Any questions thus far on EQE,
external quantum efficiency,

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:29.850
the difference between QE and
the difference between ECE,

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:35.040
or shall we say, the energy
conversion efficiency?

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:35.539
Okay.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.864
AUDIENCE: Quantum
efficiencies, they also

00:08:37.864 --> 00:08:39.570
include [INAUDIBLE]
photons, right?

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:41.638
Or do they just
include photons which

00:08:41.638 --> 00:08:43.679
have a potential to make
an electron [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:48.170
PROFESSOR: In principle,
QE, or sorry, EQE,

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.440
should have EQE as a
function of lambda, really.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.960
And the photon in
is going to be,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.640
obviously, at a certain
wavelength usually.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:01.600
I've rarely heard EQE given
in a polychromatic sense where

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.209
they take an entire
solar spectrum

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:05.000
and measure the quantum
efficiency average.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.940
Usually quantum efficiency
is measured wavelength

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:08.870
by wavelength.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.420
And so you might change
your monochrometer settings

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.650
20 or 30 times
over, or even more,

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.840
over a quantum efficiency
measurement to really

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.700
map out the entire
solar spectrum

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.500
from short wavelengths
in the ultraviolet

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.060
all the way to longer
wavelength and the infrared.

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.226
And you're absolutely right.

00:09:23.226 --> 00:09:25.200
Some of those wavelengths,
the photo response

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.330
of the solar cell will
be very close to 0

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.690
because it just doesn't respond
well at that wavelength.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:31.340
Maybe the wavelength
is too short

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.340
and is being absorbed
by some surface layer.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.839
Or maybe the wavelength is too
long it's just going straight

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:37.730
through [INAUDIBLE] photon.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.700
Whereas energy conversion
efficiency is really

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.360
taking the entire solar
spectrum and matching or testing

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.750
the energy, the power
coming out of the solar cell

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.690
versus the power going in.

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:51.830
So a typical quantum
efficiency curve

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.000
might look something like this.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.830
Let's walk through the
axes first and then

00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:57.130
talk about the curve.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:01.180
So the axes, we have wavelength
on the x-axis, on the abscissa.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.770
Then on the ordinate, we
have quantum efficiency.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.720
Wavelength is varying
from, let's say,

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.630
the ultraviolet to the
infrared and beyond.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.050
Well, beyond the red into the
near infrared and probably

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.220
ending somewhere on
the mid-infrared.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.950
And the quantum efficiency
extends from 0 to 1,

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.390
in other words from 0% to 100%.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.330
And we have this box that's
represented by this maroon line

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.870
right here entitled
Ideal Quantum Efficiency.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:33.420
And this would be if at the
band gap energy, all of a sudden

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.080
our quantum efficiency turned
on to 100% and cut across.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.740
And this was the assumption
that we made in our homework,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:43.220
that the solar cell device would
respond in this ideal manner.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.580
In reality, at longer
wavelengths here,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:47.950
what's going on?

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.280
Why would there be a decrease
of the quantum efficiency

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:53.080
at longer wavelengths?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.540
What effect is happening there?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.252
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:56.252 --> 00:10:59.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the absorption
coefficient is dropping.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.020
And this light is starting to
go straight through the device.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.810
There's a growing
fraction of photons

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.890
that are not being absorbed
by the solar cell device.

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.950
In the very short wavelengths
right here, as I said before,

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.210
oftentimes there's
a dead layer right

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:16.470
near the surface of the device
that's impeding good electron

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.710
hole pair charge separation
and eventually a collection.

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.500
And right here in
the middle, there's

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.350
a slow but steady decrease
of the quantum efficiency

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:26.840
typically.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.354
These are photons that are being
absorbed in the absorber layer.

00:11:30.354 --> 00:11:32.520
If you think about your
solar cell in cross section,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.190
here's your solar
cell in cross section,

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:35.890
these are photos being
absorbed in the absorber

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:38.265
layer generating electron hole
pairs which are then being

00:11:38.265 --> 00:11:40.230
separated by the junction.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.334
And as we go to longer
and longer wavelengths,

00:11:42.334 --> 00:11:44.750
if you remember your optical
absorption coefficient begins

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.439
dropping, that means that
the penetration depth

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:48.980
of the light, the
average penetration

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.840
that the light is increasing.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.930
And so the average distance
that the electron hole

00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:56.390
pairs are being generated from
the junction is increasing.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.900
So in other words, as we
go from short wavelengths

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.510
to longer wavelengths,
the distance

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.540
from which the
electron hole pairs

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.760
are being generated from
the junction is increasing.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.820
That means that the electron
hole pairs generated

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.570
at these wavelengths
have further

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:13.760
to travel to reach the junction
than those electron hole

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.350
pairs generated at
these wavelengths

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:17.590
closer to the front surface.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:19.800
And since there's a
finite probability

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.020
that the electron hole
pair will recombine

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.100
as it travels
through the material,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:29.570
that's why you get this very
slow but steady decrease

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:33.230
of quantum efficiency over
the mid-wavelength range.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.250
And on Tuesday we'll
talk more about that.

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:40.030
Internal quantum efficiency.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.680
So for those who
say, well you know,

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.740
there's a certain
delta right here

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:49.930
between 1 and my
maximum response, here

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:51.710
my maximum quantum efficiency.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.900
And I suspect that's
really due to the fact

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.410
that a certain
percentage of my photons

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.830
are being reflected
off the front surface.

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.360
I know how to
calculate reflectance.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.485
We did that in lecture number
two or three, I believe.

00:13:03.485 --> 00:13:05.110
So we know how to
calculate reflectance

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:06.170
off the front surface.

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.490
We can also measure reflectance
using a spectrophotometer.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:14.050
And what we can do is normalize
the effect of reflectance out.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:16.440
By dividing our external
quantum efficiency

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.370
by 1 minus R, what in
effect we're doing is

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:21.500
we're normalizing the
effective reflectance

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.710
out of our measurement.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.810
So now we're only
considering those photons

00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.255
they get into the device.

00:13:27.255 --> 00:13:29.630
If you want, you can think
about the extreme cases there.

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:33.352
If reflectance is 0, that means
your EQE is equal to your IQE,

00:13:33.352 --> 00:13:34.810
your internal
quantum efficiency is

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.240
equal to the external
quantum efficiency.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.520
But if reflectance is, say,
50%, if 50% of your photons

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:43.000
are being reflected off the
front surface of your device,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.740
now your IQE is
probably going to be

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.950
double your external
quantum efficiency.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:52.880
And so now this is an
interesting parameter because,

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.050
for example, in our lab
scale devices when we're

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.510
testing them, oftentimes
we don't optimize

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:58.980
for optical properties.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.700
Sometimes we do,
but many times where

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.242
we're focused on the material,
we're focused on the junction,

00:14:03.242 --> 00:14:05.533
and we don't bother to put
the perfect entry reflective

00:14:05.533 --> 00:14:06.150
coating on it.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.000
It would take too
long to fabricate it.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.160
And so IQE gives
us a good metric

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.840
of how the solar
cell is responding

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.140
if we were to go
through all the effort

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:17.950
to make the light capture
ideal for our device.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.590
Okay?

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:23.510
And that's why we sometimes
use a report IQE in studies.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:27.140
And typical peak values
are between 80% and 98%

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.250
for moderate efficiency devices.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.560
So it would essentially--
the curve would look

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.190
very much like the EQE curve.

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:38.690
It would just be boosted up
by 1 over 1 minus R. Okay?

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:44.010
So any questions so far?

00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.550
Make sure we're on
the same page here.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:47.050
Yeah?

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:52.460
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.650
So IQE is a function
of wavelength.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.190
R, reflectivity, is also
going to be a strong function

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.930
of wavelength because
the real component

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.534
of the refractive
index is changing

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:03.700
as a function of wavelength.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.920
Yeah, absolutely.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.660
OK, so this gives you a sense.

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:13.190
Sorry for the poor choice of the
reflectivity colors right here.

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:15.500
This baby blue, which is
almost impossible to see,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:17.520
but I've just traced it
out with my finger, that

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.750
denotes the reflectivity
as a function of wavelength

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.020
from some data that it
took as a graduate student.

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:28.382
So you have some typical quantum
efficiency curves right here.

00:15:28.382 --> 00:15:30.590
And then the quantum efficiency
curves that are shown

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:33.190
are for a pretty
poor quality device.

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:37.900
And in this particular case,
I measured quantum efficiency

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.730
under short circuit conditions,
but with different illumination

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.820
intensities.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.120
So going from 0 sun
illumination all the way up

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.420
to 1 sun illumination.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:48.620
But the device was still in
short circuit conditions.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:51.510
So what I was doing, in
effect, was flooding the device

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.490
with more and more
and more carriers,

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.490
and I got this boost here in
the middle wavelength range.

00:15:57.490 --> 00:15:59.189
I still was limited
by my surface.

00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:01.730
I was still limited by my band
gap and non-absorption effects

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:02.560
over here.

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.700
But in the middle, I was able
to get this boost in performance

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:09.947
simply because I was filling in
trap states inside of material.

00:16:09.947 --> 00:16:11.530
This is an advanced
concept that we're

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.349
going to get to over
the next few lectures.

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:16.390
But it gives you a sense
of what a QE curve might

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.710
look like for device, what the
reflectivity might look like,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.520
and these curves right here
were IQE, or internal quantum

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.650
efficiency.

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.930
OK, so take efficiency
with a grain of salt.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.680
When you hear somebody
reporting an efficiency value,

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.060
ask-- think about what
efficiency is being measured.

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.250
Is it energy conversion
efficiency?4 is it quantum

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:37.120
efficiency?

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.520
Internal, external?

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.507
What wavelengths?

00:16:39.507 --> 00:16:41.590
What is the nature of the
light being used, right?

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.730
Is a 1 sun illumination source
that has been well calibrated

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:49.550
to within 2% spectral
fidelity, spatial uniformity,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:50.599
temporal stability?

00:16:50.599 --> 00:16:52.390
Is it a really bona
fide good light source?

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.690
Or is this some
monochromatic light source

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.640
that somebody set up
because they knew, aha,

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.560
my solar cell really
responds well to, say,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.570
500 nanometer lights, right?

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:04.339
So I'm going to test my-- I'm
going to report my values right

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.800
at that wavelength.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:09.730
You have to take it
with a grain of salt.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:10.367
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:10.367 --> 00:17:11.950
And what is the
intensity of the light

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.280
that's being used as well.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.630
That's very important as
we just saw right over here

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:18.510
because the bulk material is
going to respond differently.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.611
There are certain trap
states for electrons

00:17:20.611 --> 00:17:21.569
inside of the material.

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:22.760
And as you add more
and more light,

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:23.810
you're flooding those traps.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.410
They become filled,
and the electrons

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.339
can move through the
material more easily.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:29.940
That's why you get
this boost of response

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.690
as you increase the
illumination intensity

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:33.706
in this particular experiment.

00:17:33.706 --> 00:17:36.080
So these are all questions
that you should ask yourselves

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.130
when you see
quantum efficiency--

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.100
internal quantum, external
quantum efficiency

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.470
values reported and/or energy
conversion efficiencies.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:46.840
What is really happening?

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:48.350
What are they measuring?

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:52.580
This right here, a paper out of
Paul Alivisatos' lab from 2002

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:54.950
was, in my humble opinion,
an excellent example

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.370
of honest efficiency reporting.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:02.267
First off, they picked
their highest values and put

00:18:02.267 --> 00:18:04.600
their best foot forward, and
said look we have a quantum

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.220
efficiency over 54% , and a
monochromatic power conversion

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:14.750
efficiency of 6.9% under very
low intensity light at 515

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:15.500
nanometers, right.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.833
So first off, they put their
best foot forward and said,

00:18:17.833 --> 00:18:19.690
under optimal conditions
monochromatic light

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:20.481
that's what we get.

00:18:20.481 --> 00:18:24.570
But also under air mass 1.5
global solar conditions,

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:26.540
under the standard
solar spectrum,

00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:29.110
we obtained an energy conversion
efficiency, or a power

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:31.910
conversion efficiency of 1.7%.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.170
So both values are put
there out on the table,

00:18:34.170 --> 00:18:37.360
and they say look, here's a
characterization of our device.

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.620
So I really like this paper.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.590
It was back in 2002
right at the beginning

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:45.190
of the new wave of new
materials in PV, so to speak,

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:48.570
this third wave of PV
in the United States.

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:52.120
And it was a beautiful example
of a really well-reported,

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.560
carefully described efficiency.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:58.370
Any further thoughts
or comments before we

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.760
jump on to the next
topics of the day?

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.100
AUDIENCE: How do you have
a QE curve for 0 suns,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.564
I noticed on your plot?

00:19:05.564 --> 00:19:07.022
Or is that kind of
an extrapolated?

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:11.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so this is the
bias condition-- sorry the bias

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.960
lighting condition, not the
bias voltage as in battery,

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.640
but bias lighting as in
I shine a light source,

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.926
a polychromatic light
source at my material.

00:19:20.926 --> 00:19:22.550
I believe in that
case it was a halogen

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:26.010
lamp with a series of filters
to simulate the solar spectrum.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:29.660
And obviously you can't
measure a quantum efficiency

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.290
without having some
light involved.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:35.280
And so the light that was being
generated by the monochrometer

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.530
was much lower in intensity
than these illumination

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:40.450
intensities here.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.370
And so it was more of
a perturbation on top

00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:43.840
of a steady-state background.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.150
And we ran the measurement
exactly those conditions.

00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:47.980
We had a steady-state
background light,

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.730
and then we chopped the
monochrometer light coming in ,

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.040
and used a lock in amplifier
to track that particular

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.710
frequency.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.710
So we were able to detect
the small perturbation

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.800
due to the monochromatic
light coming in on top

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.580
of the steady background.

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.080
Yeah?

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.968
AUDIENCE: There's no
international centers

00:20:03.968 --> 00:20:06.328
to report efficiency
or convention?

00:20:06.328 --> 00:20:07.290
PROFESSOR: There are.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:09.340
There are conventions,
international conventions,

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.900
to report energy
conversion efficiencies.

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.800
And I believe there might also
be for quantum efficiencies

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.510
as well.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.740
Let me look into that.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.980
Why don't we take note of that
and bring back the precise ASDM

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.560
standards next time.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.080
And I believe also there are
other entities like IEC that

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.800
have their own systems for it.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.780
There about four
laboratories worldwide

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:37.240
that are authorized to
give standard efficiency

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:37.790
measurements.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.204
So they have very carefully
calibrated quantum efficiency

00:20:41.204 --> 00:20:43.120
measurement devices,
very carefully calibrated

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.250
solar simulators.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:48.280
And if you really think you
have a record efficiency cell,

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.700
you should get it checked at
one of those laboratories.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.430
You shouldn't just report
what you have coming up

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.829
your lab-based system.

00:20:54.829 --> 00:20:57.370
You may even want to go around
to a few different labs at MIT

00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.190
first because one might
have a better calibrated

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:01.500
solar simulator than another.

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.210
What we're going
to do now is dive

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.460
into some of the
common factors that

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.350
cause solar cell IV curves to
deviate from normal ideal diode

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.620
model.

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.000
We're going to talk about
shunt and series resistance,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.340
recombination
currents-- maybe we'll

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.440
get to current crowding,
some other effects.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.315
Basically what we're
doing now in number two,

00:21:19.315 --> 00:21:20.731
is we're beginning
to say, OK, now

00:21:20.731 --> 00:21:22.280
that we understand
an ideal diode,

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.040
now that we have an
ideal picture of how

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.820
our solar cell works, let's
bring it down to real life

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:29.232
and talk about all the
things that can go wrong.

00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:31.440
Because when you try to make
a solar cell in the lab,

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.898
these are the things
that are going

00:21:32.898 --> 00:21:35.240
to start nipping at
your heels, so to speak.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.860
So we'll start out with
an equivalent circuit

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:40.590
diagram of a solar cell device.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.500
And this might be
new to some folks,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:44.930
but it's all stuff
you've seen so far.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.860
What we have over here is
the current generation source

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.530
of the solar cell operating
under forward bias conditions,

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:54.800
under illumination, generating
a voltage and a current.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.960
We have a diode
here that prevents

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.480
the back flow of
current, and forces

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:02.170
the current to go out through
the external circuit loop.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.695
And it forces it to drive
the external load, which

00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:06.820
would be attached to that
little circle over there,

00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:08.650
and that other little
circle over there.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:10.108
So you can imagine
external circuit

00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:12.110
attaching itself right there.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.130
So the diode-- if the diode
quality is high, if it's good,

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:18.210
it will prevent the
backflow of current.

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.550
If the diode
quality is poor, you

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.860
will have so-called leakage
current, current leaking

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.179
into the diode back-- if
you want to think about

00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.720
under forward bias conditions,
here's your solar cell forward

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.380
bias.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.620
You have light, your
electrons coming in,

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.149
separated by the electric field.

00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:35.690
Instead of powering
the external load

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:37.840
and coming back into the
device through the back,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:40.170
leakage current would be
the electrons going back

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:43.030
up the barrier, going
back into the base

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.970
of the device, the
so-called diffusion current.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:49.510
So this is that diode right
here representing the diffusion

00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.420
current, or in that
particular case,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:55.080
in the ideal, the
equivalent circuit diagram,

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.390
this is representing the
resistance to diffusion,

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:58.410
if you will.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.270
So we have this voltage
and current being generated

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:04.020
by the solar cell, and
that would be described

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.870
by the ideal diode equation.

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:09.310
My apologies, there should be
actually a x of this minus 1

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:09.830
right there.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.621
We should take note of
that and correct it.

00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:14.060
I just happened to notice that.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.510
OK, so the ideal diode
equation is right here.

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:19.670
And this is the current
density versus voltage.

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:26.110
So we have in linear
log scale or axes,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.650
we have a straight line.

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:29.590
That would mean
on a linear scale,

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:32.640
we would have an
exponential curve.

00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:36.720
So an exponential function,
exponential curve up here,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.950
and a straight line
in linear log scale.

00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:43.660
I'm trying to sensitize
you to the two

00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:47.330
ways of looking at this,
both a linear scale and a log

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:51.220
scale of current in the y-axis
because both will tell us

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.550
something.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:55.190
From the linear scale up
here in the upper right,

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.016
it will be very easy for
us to see the fill factor.

00:23:58.016 --> 00:23:59.890
We can just glance at
that curve and see, oh,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.440
it looks really box like.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.310
It must have a
large fill factor.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:06.550
From this curve down here we
can begin to see deviations

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:07.630
from ideality.

00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:10.430
If anything causes this curve
to bend up or down, either

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:11.920
down here or up
here, we're going

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.110
to see it really quick
on the log scale.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:19.450
And that's why looking at the IV
curve in both ways is helpful.

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:23.206
It's a method of diagnosing
the problem quickly.

00:24:23.206 --> 00:24:25.830
So what we're going to do now is
to take our equivalent circuit

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:28.780
and begin adding a
few things to it that

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.532
represent realistic effects that
we might see in a real device.

00:24:33.532 --> 00:24:34.990
So the first thing
that we might do

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:38.090
is say, well listen, a real
device has a finite series

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.550
resistance.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.560
And that can come from
a variety of sources.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.590
We'll talk about those
in a few minutes.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.846
But we might add a series
resistance component

00:24:45.846 --> 00:24:46.470
right up there.

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:47.299
So let's look back.

00:24:47.299 --> 00:24:49.590
I'm going to flip back and
forth between the two slides

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.820
just so folks can really
see what the difference is.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:52.940
This was the ideal case.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.510
That's the with
series resistance,

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.910
again ideal with series up
there in the equivalent circuit.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:24:58.510
Great.

00:24:58.510 --> 00:24:59.384
So what have we done?

00:24:59.384 --> 00:25:01.950
Well, we've added a series
resistance component

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.490
which is essentially
dropping the voltage output

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.320
of our solar cell.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.750
And notice what else happened.

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:09.626
Now we have a
nonlinear equation.

00:25:09.626 --> 00:25:11.000
Our current density
is a function

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.790
of our current density.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:19.130
So this is becoming
more difficult to solve

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:20.251
analytically.

00:25:20.251 --> 00:25:22.250
And what is happening to
our IV characteristics?

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:25.620
Well, let's look-- we'll go back
once again to our ideal diode

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:26.690
equation right here.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:29.120
We have a very sharp
box-like IV curve

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.360
under the ideal conditions.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:32.610
Now when we introduce the
series resistance component,

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:36.260
we begin smoothing
out that IV curve.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:38.180
The fill factor has dropped.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:38.870
Take a look.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:41.760
Ideal conditions, sharp,
very large fill factor.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.760
Now we've added the series
resistance component,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.720
the fill factor
has begun dropping.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.390
If we look at it
in log scale, it's

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.110
very easy to detect
that series resistance.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.670
We can see it right here.

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.270
This used to be
our curve, right?

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:57.590
So again, this was the
ideal case, straight line.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:00.780
Again, this is log of current
verses linear voltage.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.340
So the x-axis of the two
plots here are the same.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.820
I'm only changing the
y-axis from linear scale

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.420
up there to log scale down here.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:08.420
And notice what happens.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.128
If I add the series
resistance component,

00:26:10.128 --> 00:26:13.850
now I begin dropping off.

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:16.410
So this is a telltale sign
when you take an IV curve

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.580
and you see that, then you have
some series resistance effect

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.290
inside of your external
circuit or your solar cell,

00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:24.101
or some combination of the two.

00:26:24.101 --> 00:26:24.600
Yes, Ashley?

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.090
ASHLEY: So from this curve it
looks the series resistance

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:30.938
really only starts
to have an effect

00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:31.790
once you have a higher voltage.

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:32.620
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.070
And that, you can begin to
see directly from the equation

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.600
right here as well.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:39.500
Take the limit of low voltage
and the limit of high voltage.

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:44.320
Or another way to put it would
be the high current, really.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.910
And the high current
to voltage ratio

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.340
only begins to take on up
at higher voltages because

00:26:49.340 --> 00:26:52.580
of the exponential
function of that curve.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.180
So that's a very, very
important and astute observation

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.830
that the series
resistance begins

00:26:56.830 --> 00:27:00.310
to kill you at high forward
bias voltage conditions.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.550
You hope that you design
your solar cell in such a way

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.840
that the series resistance
only really begins

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.880
to kick in above the
maximum power point voltage.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:10.957
That's the goal.

00:27:10.957 --> 00:27:13.939
AUDIENCE: This is not
voltage out, this is voltage

00:27:13.939 --> 00:27:17.350
applied to the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.710
PROFESSOR: This is the
voltage that is being

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:21.915
measured across the solar cell.

00:27:21.915 --> 00:27:23.220
AUDIENCE: The output voltage.

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.950
PROFESSOR: The
output voltage, yeah.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:31.160
Yes, you can think of this
as the biasing condition

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.650
of your solar cell device.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.910
The two are almost equivalent.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.930
The only difference is you
have that series resistance

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:36.650
in series there.

00:27:36.650 --> 00:27:38.316
So you have to be
careful whether you're

00:27:38.316 --> 00:27:40.640
talking about the voltage
here at the solar cell itself

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.760
across a junction,
or the voltage

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.470
coming out of your device that
is effected by that series

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:47.640
resistance as well.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.180
So think of it is
doing that IV sweep

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:52.530
that we did in
class the other day.

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:54.590
So you're taking the IV
sweep of your device,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:58.050
and you're seeing the impact
of the series resistance

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:01.190
in the output voltage you're
measuring of your solar cell

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:03.500
device, just like
we did in class.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.540
So again, series resistance
will effect you at some point.

00:28:06.540 --> 00:28:07.960
It is almost inevitable.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.250
But you have to design
your solar cell such

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.855
that it effects you only
after the maximum power point.

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.900
Likewise, we're going to
introduce another resistance

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.080
term inside of our equivalent
circuit diagram, what

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:21.610
we call a shunt resistance.

00:28:21.610 --> 00:28:23.140
Let me back up one step here.

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.280
This was just a
series resistance,

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.440
now I've added a shunt
resistance term here as well.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:34.560
And whereas we wanted our series
resistance to be small, right?

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.180
The smaller our series
resistance, the less

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.230
this effect would be, the more
ideal this curve would be.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:44.970
We want our shunt
resistance to be large,

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:48.450
because we want to prevent the
current from flowing inside

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:52.291
of the device back to the base.

00:28:52.291 --> 00:28:53.790
Instead, we want
the current to flow

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.350
through the external circuit.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.620
So we want the shunt
resistance to be large.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.820
In other words, we don't
want our solar cell device

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.590
to full of shunts.

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:02.670
That's pretty obvious.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:06.020
OK, so what does shunt
resistance do to you?

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.790
Well, if we compare
the IV curves

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:10.630
once again between
the solar cell just

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:16.090
with the series resistance, we
had a very low forward current

00:29:16.090 --> 00:29:18.380
here under low forward
bias conditions.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:21.420
If we have a very
poor shunt-- if we

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.502
have a plethora of shunt
pathways in our device,

00:29:24.502 --> 00:29:26.710
we're going to get current
flowing through our device

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.710
even at low bias conditions.

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:31.620
That's because the
pn-junction is weak.

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.820
And even though we have a
very large field in there,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.010
there are some regions where the
field is much smaller because

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.720
of the shunt pathway,
and current is going

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:38.680
to be flowing through there.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:40.140
Diffusion current
will be flowing

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.130
through that shunt pathway.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:45.640
So think of this as being
a very strong diode, right.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.100
In the absence of
shunt resistance,

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.308
you have a very strong diode.

00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:51.440
You have in your p-type
region and your n,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.840
and that large
barrier is preventing

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.300
the diffusion of electrons
back into the device.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.280
It's preventing
this from rising.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.050
It's keeping it low.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.540
And that can only happen
when the pn-junction barrier

00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:06.280
is uniform throughout
your entire device.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.870
If you have one
region if your device

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:10.245
that is poor that
has a shunt pathway,

00:30:10.245 --> 00:30:12.870
maybe you have a piece of metal
that fired through the junction

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:15.830
and is making good ohmic
contact to both sides.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:18.090
If you have a shunt
pathway, now the current

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:21.090
can flow even under
small bias conditions.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.340
The diffusion current can
flow into your device.

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.900
And that, of course, drops
on the linear log scale

00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:30.260
right up here, you
hardly detect it.

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.090
Notice, if we go back
and forth between

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.230
with and without
shunt resistance,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.010
you can hardly
detect it right here

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:39.070
until you start getting to some
really leaky diodes, in which

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:42.770
case you begin to impact
your fill factor as well.

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:48.970
So shunt resistance is important
for a solar cell device

00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.750
that it not be too, too high.

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:53.500
Because at some
point it does begin

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:55.770
impacting your fill factor.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.060
Sorry, the shunt resistance
not be too, too low.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.492
Yes, your shunt resistance
can't be too, too low

00:31:00.492 --> 00:31:01.950
because at some
point it will begin

00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:03.980
impacting your fill factor.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.330
But more importantly,
shunt resistance

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.030
is usually indicative
of some localized

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:11.190
failure in your pn-junction.

00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:12.940
It's usually not
homogeneously distributed

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:14.260
throughout the
entire pn-junction.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.259
Maybe your first solar
cell device you ever make

00:31:16.259 --> 00:31:17.506
might be effected by that.

00:31:17.506 --> 00:31:18.880
But as you get
better and better,

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.170
you'll start making
higher quality junctions.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.460
And usually the
shunt resistance is

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.330
indicative of one little spot.

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.350
And what happens at
that one little spot?

00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:31.790
Well, current is flowing in
from the entire emitter region

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:35.537
into that one little shunt and
locally heating up your device.

00:31:35.537 --> 00:31:37.870
And so that's why people worry
about shunts in industry,

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:40.078
is because if you have
current crowding into that one

00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:42.580
little spot, it's heating
up, it's becoming a hotspot,

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.880
and it can even melt the
encapsulated materials

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.750
in your module.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:49.730
Perhaps even create a fire
in extreme conditions.

00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:53.990
And so when you test
the solar cell devices,

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:58.400
typically the IV tester will
measure the shunt resistance

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.080
in a solar cell by
looking at what's

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.780
happening under very small
bias conditions right here,

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.680
and comparing it
against the healthy cell

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.000
that it would expect.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.750
And if it finds cells with
high shunt leakage current,

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.800
in other words, low
shunt resistance,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.370
it will advise the
tester and sorter

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.400
to throw out those
cells, and so they'll

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.160
be put into the scrap pile.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.090
And so the shunt resistance
manifests itself right here

00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:25.665
in the ideal diode equation
in this term right there.

00:32:25.665 --> 00:32:27.730
And so it's essentially
an add-on term

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:32.000
after your exponential,
looking something like this.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:35.041
Essentially, at low
bias conditions,

00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:36.790
you can extrapolate
this point right here,

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.320
determine the slope
of that point,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.085
and find the shunt resistance.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:46.100
And likewise, you'll notice
that the shunt resistance really

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.232
isn't impacting you up here.

00:32:49.232 --> 00:32:51.190
The shunt resistance
really isn't impacting you

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:52.960
at higher forward
bias conditions.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.535
That's mostly series resistance
in the illumination current

00:32:55.535 --> 00:32:58.520
that's overwhelming
any shunt pathway.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.286
Ashley, yeah?

00:32:59.286 --> 00:33:01.941
ASHLEY: Do you know
for, I don't know,

00:33:01.941 --> 00:33:03.316
a high-quality
manufacturer, what

00:33:03.316 --> 00:33:06.597
percentage of produced cells
get tossed because [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.597 --> 00:33:07.430
PROFESSOR: Very low.

00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:12.450
The manufacturing yields of
a well-oiled manufacturing

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.780
line- I say oiled in
a figurative sense.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.420
We're not typically-- yeah,
some of the parts, I suppose,

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:19.260
use oil.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.170
In a well-functioning
manufacturing line,

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:26.610
the yields are upwards of
95% for cell fabrication.

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:28.340
So it's a very small percentage.

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.770
You typically see
this when you're

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.610
developing a new process.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:33.317
And that's why I'm
informing all of you

00:33:33.317 --> 00:33:35.900
about this is because we're all
developing new processes here,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.400
right?

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.540
We're all working on
new solar cell devices.

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:42.290
And it's very important to be
aware of what's going wrong

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:44.920
in your device, not just that
you're getting a low efficiency

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.561
because this is the first
step to troubleshooting.

00:33:47.561 --> 00:33:48.060
Yep?

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:48.758
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but why is it

00:33:48.758 --> 00:33:50.424
bad that we have a
high current density?

00:33:50.424 --> 00:33:52.409
[INAUDIBLE] current
density [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:52.409 --> 00:33:54.950
PROFESSOR: Why is it bad that
we have a high current density?

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:56.408
Why don't we go
back to simple case

00:33:56.408 --> 00:33:59.560
right here where we have a
series instance, for instance,

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.070
right?

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.170
And so at, say, 0.5
volts forward bias,

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.410
we now have with the
series resistance, a higher

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.550
forward currend-- we'll
call a dark forward current

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.420
because we're measuring
this in the dark.

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.030
That's why we have 0 here.

00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:13.489
And it's forward
current, meaning

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:16.400
it's like a diffusion current
going from the emitter

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.420
back into the base.

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:20.679
And so we have a higher
dark forward current here

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:22.730
in the dark with the
series resistance,

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:25.210
then if we didn't have the
series resistance, right?

00:34:25.210 --> 00:34:26.210
So let me do that again.

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.699
We're up here at,
say, 1 times 10

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:30.580
to minus 2 milliamps
per square centimeter,

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:34.969
whereas before we were
down at around a quarter.

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:36.590
So why is that bad?

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.880
That's bad because when we
illuminate our solar cell

00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.780
device, we are going to be
shifting that curve down,

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:44.070
and that's going to reduce
the total current output

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:46.199
at the maximum power point.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.020
So anything that goes up here
when it's shifted or transposed

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:51.590
by a finite fixed
amount, it will

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.940
be closer to the 0 point of
current than it used to be.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:57.280
That's why it's bad.

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:00.470
So anything that
increases that blue curve

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.330
and shifts it up in
the dark is going

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.950
to be bad for our solar cell.

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.720
In an ideal case, we want
our dark forward current

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.400
to be as small as possible.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:12.002
We want our J0 to be
as tiny as possible

00:35:12.002 --> 00:35:13.210
for a good solar cell device.

00:35:16.678 --> 00:35:17.178
OK.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:24.550
Good let me show you dynamically
what happens in a solar cell.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:26.190
Oops, sorry about that.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.940
Here we go.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:30.680
So this is a PV CD-ROM
again in a beautiful example

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.030
of, in this particular case,
looks like series resistance.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.320
So now we're at 1
ohm series resistance

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.970
for the entire device.

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:40.240
The ideal solar cell
is shown in red.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.392
The IV curve for the ideal
solar cell is shown in red.

00:35:43.392 --> 00:35:44.850
It would be a short
circuit current

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.120
of 35 milliamps per
square centimeter,

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.970
an open circuit voltage
of 624 millivolts,

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.160
and a fill factor of
83%, ideal solar cell.

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:57.490
The real solar cell now with 1
ohm series resistance, the fill

00:35:57.490 --> 00:36:03.340
factor has dropped by
5% absolute down to 78%.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:06.004
And now I'm going to
increase the fill factor.

00:36:06.004 --> 00:36:07.920
What would you expect
to happen to that curve?

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.820
Flattens, right?

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:13.240
The fill factor drops.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.740
So let me start increasing the
series resistance by manually

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.200
dragging this forward.

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:23.910
So now we're at around
2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:27.000
So now we're at 10
ohms series resistance.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.970
That means we have
a large resistance

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.890
inside of our solar cell
device at some point.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.072
And our fill factor has
now dropped precipitously.

00:36:34.072 --> 00:36:35.530
And if you remember
that efficiency

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.520
is proportional to fill,
factor that means we

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.410
have a problem with our device.

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.860
We're really dropping
the maximum power point.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.870
We're really dropping
the operating point

00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:46.520
of our solar cell.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:50.220
So if you were to do
an extreme condition,

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:52.640
you might have so
much series resistance

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.560
that your IV curve looks
like a straight line,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.250
you have an ohmic resistor now.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.340
The resistance component
is swamping out

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:03.100
any diode-like behavior
of your solar cell.

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.537
And that's why you have a line.

00:37:04.537 --> 00:37:06.620
Likewise, you're dropping
the total current output

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.360
of your device,
right, because you

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.860
have a resistor in
series now that's

00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.400
preventing the current flow.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:15.580
OK, so that's, again,
an extreme case of what

00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:17.840
can happen in a
shunt resistance.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.690
Let me show you that as well.

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.890
So we have another beautiful
example shunt resistance here.

00:37:23.890 --> 00:37:26.610
Now we start out with a
very high shunt resistance,

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.170
because in our equivalent
circuit diagram,

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:32.100
if we go back up here,
we have a large barrier

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.930
that prevents the current
from flowing back internally

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:36.142
inside of the device.

00:37:36.142 --> 00:37:37.600
The current is
forced to go outside

00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:38.808
through the external circuit.

00:37:38.808 --> 00:37:41.640
But as we drop that red
shunt resistance component

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.700
right there, as we
decrease the magnitude

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:46.800
of the shunt resistance,
we will allow the current

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.190
to flow inside of the device.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.750
Now we have internal
current loops,

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.208
and that means that we no longer
are forcing the current go

00:37:52.208 --> 00:37:54.270
outside through the
external circuit.

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:58.140
And somewhere around
between 1,000 and 100 ohms

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:59.820
for our shunt
resistance, we really

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.490
begin to see that
drop in fill factor.

00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:03.300
And as expected,
it's really begin

00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:07.610
to impact us at the lower bias
voltages down here like we saw.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:10.440
And at some point, we
drop the shunt resistance

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:14.530
so much that now the voltage
across our solar cell

00:38:14.530 --> 00:38:17.510
is even suffering
because there's not

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:20.740
enough separation
of charge sustained

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.110
to make that voltage large
because the current is being

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:27.330
shunted back inside the device.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:31.310
And again, we have what appears
to be very linear IV curve.

00:38:31.310 --> 00:38:33.525
So you can see when you
measure your solar cell

00:38:33.525 --> 00:38:37.110
and you test it, and you get
a linear IV curve instead

00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:38.810
of that nice
exponential, you have

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:40.935
to do a little bit of
troubleshooting to figure out

00:38:40.935 --> 00:38:42.191
what exactly is going on.

00:38:42.191 --> 00:38:42.690
OK.

00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:47.380
Good.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:49.850
So key concepts so far.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.590
We can add the effects
of parallel resistance.

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.720
What we typically refer
to a shunt resistance

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.500
is also called
parallel resistance

00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.080
because it appears in
parallel with the diode inside

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.540
of the device, right.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.040
So we can have a parallel or
shunt resistance and series

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.550
resistance in our devices.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.580
And as an advanced
concept, I really

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.780
wanted to expose
you once, and we

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:15.680
can talk more about this in
office hours, to the notion

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:20.180
that in addition to just
having one saturation current,

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.010
you could envision difference
saturation currents coming

00:39:23.010 --> 00:39:25.060
from different regions of
your solar cell device.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.690
Let me walk you through that.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:32.240
Under low bias conditions where
we have a large built in field,

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.130
and we have very
low bias conditions.

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.660
Before bias, obviously the
field is going to be decreasing,

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:38.826
the barrier height's going
to be decreasing as well.

00:39:38.826 --> 00:39:40.580
So under low forward
bias conditions,

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:42.660
current is going to have a hard
time getting all the way up

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:44.850
into the base and recombining
inside of the base,

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.308
but some of the current could
recombine in the space charge

00:39:47.308 --> 00:39:48.630
region of our device.

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:50.900
And that's why under low
forward bias conditions,

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.390
we might have what is called a
J02 current, or recombination

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:56.180
current in the
space-charge region.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.770
And then there are high
forward bias conditions when

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:01.410
a lot of the carriers can
diffuse into the bulk,

00:40:01.410 --> 00:40:03.100
and recombine
inside of the bulk,

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.040
we might be driven by different
recombination mechanisms,

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.370
bulk recombination mechaniss.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:09.490
So that's sometimes
where you see

00:40:09.490 --> 00:40:12.620
what is called a two-diode
model for a solar cell.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:14.347
And the two-diode
model for a solar cell

00:40:14.347 --> 00:40:16.180
would look very much
like this, except you'd

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:20.099
have two diodes one
right next to the other.

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:22.640
One that would effect you at
low bias conditions, another one

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.060
at large bias conditions.

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.610
You might see this
in your research.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:27.485
It's really an advanced
concept more targeted

00:40:27.485 --> 00:40:30.050
towards the graduate
students here.

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.880
Another thing you
might see pop up

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.240
is this ideality factor
showing up right down here.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.850
The ideality factor
is a slope factor.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.630
What that means is--
here if we go back

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.300
to this, if you change
your ideality factor,

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.830
you're changing the
slope in log scale.

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:48.416
It'd still be a straight line,
but if your ideality factor

00:40:48.416 --> 00:40:50.290
increases, you would
get something like this.

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.350
If it decreases, the slope
would increase, right?

00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:56.190
Because you have the
equation dependent on 1

00:40:56.190 --> 00:40:58.190
over this parameter.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:00.840
So the ideality
factor is important

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.760
as well because it indicates the
type of recombination mechanism

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.410
that's driving
the current inside

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:06.650
of that region of the device.

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:09.220
If anybody ever comes across
this in their research,

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.090
come talk to me.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:12.850
I'd be happy point to
the right directions.

00:41:12.850 --> 00:41:16.270
Or you could look up the
thesis of Keith McIntosh

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:18.530
from University of
New South Wales.

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:20.550
Excellent, excellent
thesis entitled,

00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:24.780
"Humps, Lumps and Bumps:
Three Dimensional Effects

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:27.030
of the Current Voltage Curve
of Silicon Solar Cells."

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:29.700
Some of which might apply as
well to other material systems

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:30.706
as well.

00:41:30.706 --> 00:41:32.330
And you can tell
where the lumps, humps

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.205
and bumps comes from.

00:41:33.205 --> 00:41:36.420
It's really these lumps, humps
and bumps in the IV curve

00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.920
he's talking about.

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.360
Excellent read,
very good thesis.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.660
Highly recommended for those
who want to look into their IV

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:44.710
curves a little bit more.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.640
It's kind of like looking
to the tea leaves, right?

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:48.080
Because there are
a number of things

00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.580
that can be effecting
the IV curves.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:53.720
We'll get to some of
those on Tuesday as well.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.520
These are IV curves,
again in log scale

00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:01.279
on the ordinate, linear
scale on the abscissa.

00:42:01.279 --> 00:42:02.820
You notice there's
little commas here

00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:07.120
because I took this data in
Germany so the decimal place is

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.980
written as a comma.

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:13.860
The IV curves vary in
shape and in style.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.040
Let's look at this one
right here, this black one.

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.790
It starts up like this, and
then it goes flat for a while,

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.070
and then it becomes series
resistance dominated way up

00:42:22.070 --> 00:42:24.110
at higher bias voltages.

00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:27.650
Whereas this blue curve
right here, this one again,

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.050
you have the effect of shunt
resistance at lower buys

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.020
voltages.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:34.340
Then you have one diode,
two diodes, and eventually

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.910
the series resistance
component coming in as well.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.393
Or perhaps it's a
large shunt as well.

00:42:40.393 --> 00:42:42.976
You don't really know until you
start fitting it, and modeling

00:42:42.976 --> 00:42:45.059
it, and maybe measuring
the temperature dependence

00:42:45.059 --> 00:42:46.230
and so forth.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:50.400
So this gives you a
sense of the real life

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.820
diode IV curves that
you might get over

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.490
the course of your research,
and it gives you some tools

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:58.490
to use to begin parsing
through and figuring out

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:00.250
what's going wrong.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:01.510
Let's talk about that.

00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:03.340
Let's talk about
solving problems.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.300
So fill factor.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:05.770
What can impact the fill factor?

00:43:05.770 --> 00:43:09.210
Well, we talked about the
need for a high fill factor

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:10.940
to produce a high power cell.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.110
Very easy to understand.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:16.270
The larger the fill factor, the
larger the maximum power point.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.300
If you have a low fill factor,
your maximum power point

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:20.570
is going to drop.

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.430
Let me show you back and forth.

00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:26.420
Good device, bad device, large
fill factor, low fill factor,

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:31.080
high maximum power point,
lower maximum power point.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.870
OK, we talked about this.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:36.270
OK, so causes of shunt
resistance, physical causes.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:38.150
I alluded to this
earlier, but let's imagine

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.780
you have that weak spot
in your pn-junction.

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.270
This is meant to represent
pn-junction in two dimensions

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.120
now.

00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.770
So, so far we've only taken
a cross section like this.

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:49.632
Now you have a
real device in 2D.

00:43:49.632 --> 00:43:51.090
And what this is
meant to represent

00:43:51.090 --> 00:43:53.880
to some local weakness
in the pn-junction.

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:57.640
And the current is now flowing
through that local weakness.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:01.680
So that's a representation
in a 2D energy band diagram

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:09.880
E versus x versus y of a
shunt in realistic conditions.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.170
So shunt series resistance,
on the other hand,

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.426
we talked about the effect
of high series resistance,

00:44:15.426 --> 00:44:17.050
and we're going to
calculate the series

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:18.257
resistance for a solar cell.

00:44:18.257 --> 00:44:19.840
In part, because
this is asked for you

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.650
on your homework assignment.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:22.108
At least the graduate
students have

00:44:22.108 --> 00:44:24.260
a problem pertaining to this.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:26.960
So let's talk about the
different components

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.190
of series resistance.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.000
We have a bulk current and
then a lateral current inside

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.590
of a typical solar cell device.

00:44:32.590 --> 00:44:36.240
So sunlight comes in, shines,
generates electron hole pairs.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:39.700
These electrons will diffuse
to the junction region,

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.690
and then they'll drift
across the junction,

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.560
wind up in this emitter
front surface region.

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:47.890
And eventually through lateral
diffusion reach the context

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:49.730
and be pulled out of the device.

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.229
So we have to consider these
two different components,

00:44:53.229 --> 00:44:55.770
and pretty much the current all
the way from the back contact

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.000
to the front contact.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.060
Any one of those things could
contribute to series resistance

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.860
in an additive sense.

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:04.190
So to put that pictorially,
we have bulk resistance,

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.280
emitter sheet resistance,
the contact resistance,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:09.160
and in line losses
out of plane as we

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.370
travel along those front
contact metallization.

00:45:13.370 --> 00:45:15.320
So bulk resistance.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.280
This is another way to state
how to choose an absorber

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.630
thickness.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.699
So we've talked about
choosing absorber thicknesses,

00:45:22.699 --> 00:45:24.490
in other words, we've
talked about choosing

00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:26.190
the thickness of our
solar cell device

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.270
based on how much light
we want to capture,

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:30.450
based on the optical
absorption coefficients.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.660
Well guess what?

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.380
This is a
co-optimization problem.

00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.520
We also have to worry
about the finite resistance

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.090
of the bulk
material, and we have

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:39.080
to spec the
thickness accordingly

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:42.120
so that we don't wind up with
too thick of a bulk material

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.930
and the series resistance
component will be too large.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.352
So how to choose the
appropriate absorber thickness.

00:45:47.352 --> 00:45:48.810
Let's talk about
that for a minute.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:53.490
So you can measure a parameter
in the bulk called resistivity.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:56.780
Resistivity will be given
as a function of q, which

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.350
is the charge, u, which is the
carrier mobility, which means

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.530
how easy is it for that carrier
to move around the lattice,

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.064
and n being the carry density.

00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:07.230
So let's think that through.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:09.589
Resistivity-- if our
carrier density goes up,

00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:11.630
if we have more carriers
to transport the charge,

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:12.900
the resistive should go down.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:13.730
That makes sense.

00:46:13.730 --> 00:46:14.450
Check.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.991
If the mobility goes up, meaning
it's easier for the carriers

00:46:16.991 --> 00:46:20.000
to move around the lattice, then
the resistivity should go down.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.500
Check.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:23.120
OK, so that makes
good, intuitive sense.

00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.980
Now the base resistance, in
other words, the resistance

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:29.650
that we should have as current
travels across the base,

00:46:29.650 --> 00:46:32.200
across the absorber of our
material, which we also call

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.880
the base of our solar cell.

00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.620
So as the total resistance, as
current goes across the base,

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.530
should be given as Rho, which
is a fundamental material

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:45.040
parameter combined with some
geometric parameters that

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:47.540
define the size
of our solar cell.

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.200
So l is going to be the length
of the conductive of path

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.070
which typically would be given
as the thickness of the device,

00:46:53.070 --> 00:46:55.100
and A is the area
of current flow.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.970
In other words, the dimension or
size of our solar cell device.

00:46:58.970 --> 00:47:01.040
So to minimize
base resistance, we

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.540
want to have a very
thin solar cell device.

00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:04.290
But wait a second.

00:47:04.290 --> 00:47:05.670
If we make it very
thin, then what happens?

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:06.476 --> 00:47:07.600
PROFESSOR: You get
less absorption.

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.570
So you have to make
it a certain thickness

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.232
to get a good enough absorption.

00:47:11.232 --> 00:47:12.190
Then we can compensate.

00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:14.080
If we still need to drop
the base resistance,

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:17.560
we can increase the
area of the base.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.850
And so far that
makes good sense.

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.550
There's nothing else
tugging for the area

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.700
to be the other
direction, right?

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.720
So we can make this solar
cell infinitely large, thick

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.460
as we want to be to
absorb all the light.

00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.019
Great, OK.

00:47:32.019 --> 00:47:33.560
Hold on to that
thought because we're

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.601
going to have another
constraining parameter that

00:47:35.601 --> 00:47:37.980
pushes us in the opposite
way in a few slides.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.490
All right, so the
emitter sheet resistance.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:43.570
In other words, how to design
front contact metallization.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:46.780
Emitter sheet resistance
refers to the resistance

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:48.700
of lateral current
that the carriers

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.410
will experience as
they move laterally

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.360
to reach the front contacts.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.770
And again, we go back to this
fundamental material parameter

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:58.880
where we have resistivity
as a function of mobility,

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:01.520
and total dopant concentration.

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:04.190
Sorry, for some reason, I used
the big N here and a little n

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.910
on the previous slide.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:05.910
But it's the same thing.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.050
It's carrier density.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:09.914
So again, our resistivity is
a function of carrier mobility

00:48:09.914 --> 00:48:12.330
and carrier concentration, how
easy it is for the carriers

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.200
to move, and how many
of them are there.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.830
For a thin layer,
a sheet resistance

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:21.200
can be described as the
integral of the resistivity

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:23.780
by the thickness of that layer.

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.990
Or to put it more simply,
if you have a uniform layer,

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:31.380
you simply multiply the
denominator here by thickness.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.580
So this can be thought
in the following way.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:39.830
If we have a thicker emitter,
we will be dropping the emitter

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:41.090
sheet resistance.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:44.680
We will be dropping the
resistance component

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.324
that carriers experience as they
travel laterally through this.

00:48:47.324 --> 00:48:48.990
And that makes sense
because, in effect,

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.260
as we increase the thickness
of this emitter region,

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.885
we're increasing the total cross
sectional area for the charges

00:48:53.885 --> 00:48:56.620
to travel through.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.560
So folks with me so far.

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.310
For the emitter sheet
resistance to be low,

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:05.220
we need the thickness
to be good enough,

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.300
the thickness to
be thick enough,

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.220
the carrier density
to be high enough,

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:11.170
and the mobility
to be large enough.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.350
And oftentimes, the
resistivity of a material, you

00:49:14.350 --> 00:49:17.060
might spend months trying
to optimize the resistivity

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:18.590
of your emitter region.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.290
For those doing
thin film materials,

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:22.990
you might be working on
zinc oxide, aluminum doped,

00:49:22.990 --> 00:49:25.100
or fluorine doped zinc
oxide, for instance.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.570
And after months of tuning
the temperature and the oxygen

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:30.650
partial pressure during
the deposition process,

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:32.690
you're there and you
have what you have.

00:49:32.690 --> 00:49:34.690
You have a certain carrier
density and a certain mobility.

00:49:34.690 --> 00:49:37.230
And you can't do much more than
vary the geometric parameter

00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:39.120
varying the thickness.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:41.600
So what next?

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.560
If my thickness is
too big on my emitter,

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.390
if my thickness is
too big, I'm going

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:49.110
to be absorbing all of my
short wavelengths photons

00:49:49.110 --> 00:49:52.460
in the front surface
of my device.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:55.080
And maybe the current
collection probability

00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.750
from that layer up here,
that has a very high carrier

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:02.240
density, is not going to be
as large-- in other words,

00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.490
the current collection
efficiency won't be as large as

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.344
if I generated the carriers
here in the bulk because

00:50:07.344 --> 00:50:09.010
of an effect called
Auger recombination,

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.830
which we'll get
to a few lectures.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:13.170
So this front
surface region here

00:50:13.170 --> 00:50:16.110
oftentimes is considered a
dead layer to a solar cell.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.960
Its electrical properties
are very, very poor.

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:21.270
So if I make this
layer too thick,

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:25.110
sure I get rid of my emitter
sheet resistance term.

00:50:25.110 --> 00:50:27.780
But at the same time I'm
killing my quantum efficiency

00:50:27.780 --> 00:50:29.472
in the short wavelengths.

00:50:29.472 --> 00:50:31.680
Because I'm not able to
absorb those short wavelength

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:34.890
photons and convert them
efficiently into electron hole

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:37.740
pairs.

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.660
So this is a story
about co-optimization

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.940
of different device parameters.

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.780
So let's keep this
thought for a minute.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.526
And let's now try to
calculate the total power loss

00:50:46.526 --> 00:50:48.650
due to the emitter sheet
resistance, because now we

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:52.450
have this weird unit
of ohms per square.

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:53.450
In reality, it's ohms.

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.650
But when we think about
emitter sheet resistance,

00:50:55.650 --> 00:50:57.680
we're thinking about a
square of the material.

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.100
We have units of
ohms per square,

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:00.900
square being a
unit-less parameter.

00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:03.440
So it has, let's
see, resistivity

00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:07.074
had units of ohm centimeter,
we divided our resistivity

00:51:07.074 --> 00:51:08.740
by our thickness of
that emitter region,

00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:10.910
so our units became ohms.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.840
And ohms per square here is
the units typically given

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.730
for emitter sheet resistance.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:20.580
And now we have to convert this
into some meaningful parameter

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.149
for actual solar cell device.

00:51:22.149 --> 00:51:24.190
So if we want the calculate
the fraction of power

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:27.430
lost due to this emitter
sheet resistance,

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.180
it's fairly straightforward.

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.500
We would have to think
about the current.

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.740
Since power is I
squared R, we have

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:37.270
to think about the current as
a function of the resistance,

00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.769
right?

00:51:37.769 --> 00:51:39.350
As a function of
the position here,

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:45.170
we're integrating over y, y
being the lateral dimension.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.170
And we're integrating-- imagine
the separation between contacts

00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:50.870
is S. So here's one
contact metal finger.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.610
Here's the next
contact metal finger.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:54.720
It's extracting charge
from the material.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:58.160
And we have a certain distance,
S, right here between them.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.014
So the maximum distance
that the current

00:52:00.014 --> 00:52:01.430
would travel in
principle would be

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.842
S divided by 2, since
any current that

00:52:03.842 --> 00:52:05.800
reaches the emitter over
here will be collected

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:08.650
by this contact grid, and
any electrons reaching

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:11.130
the emitter over here will
collected by that contact grid

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:12.880
finger.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.694
OK, so now we have our current.

00:52:14.694 --> 00:52:16.235
We can translate
that into here where

00:52:16.235 --> 00:52:20.670
we have our b, b being
the vertical dimension,

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:24.190
y being the horizontal
dimension here.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:26.927
And we would get this
equation coming out right

00:52:26.927 --> 00:52:29.260
in the other side, which is
a function of the separation

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:32.740
of our contact metallization
fingers to the cubed,

00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:34.640
to the third power.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.770
So the power loss coming
from the solar cell device,

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:40.120
as we separate our
contact metallization

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:46.460
by small amount, this power loss
is going to go up very quickly.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:49.230
That's a really deep
point to recognize here

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:51.020
because what this
means, in effect, is

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.860
that we can lose a lot of power
very quickly in our solar cell

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.340
device if we place our contact
fingers too far apart, due

00:52:57.340 --> 00:53:00.270
to this emitter sheet
resistance effect,

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:03.860
due to the row sub s,
which is our emitter sheet

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:07.840
resistance right here.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:12.142
OK, so then if we divide the
power loss by the maximum power

00:53:12.142 --> 00:53:15.750
point, we essentially get
a normalized power loss.

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.440
And so if we want to,
say, limit this ratio

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.220
to a certain fraction,
say 4% of total power

00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:23.632
is lost due to emitter
sheet resistance, now we

00:53:23.632 --> 00:53:25.090
can define the
geometric parameter,

00:53:25.090 --> 00:53:27.090
the distance between
the contact metal

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.270
that we need to do
an actual solar cell.

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:31.900
And if you run through
the calculations

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:36.350
with a typical set of parameters
for a silicon-based solar cell,

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:40.420
you'll find out that your
metallization fingers should

00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:42.340
be separated on the
order of 4 millimeters.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.339
And if you remember the
real solar cell devices

00:53:44.339 --> 00:53:45.880
that you saw embedded
in that module,

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:49.140
the separation of the fingers
is just about 4 millimeters.

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.200
So this is where that finger
separation comes from.

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.226
In one case, you'd want to have
your fingers spaced really,

00:53:55.226 --> 00:53:57.350
really close together to
minimize the emitter sheet

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:58.094
resistance.

00:53:58.094 --> 00:54:00.510
But on the other hand, if you
place your fingers too close

00:54:00.510 --> 00:54:02.176
together, your shading
the front surface

00:54:02.176 --> 00:54:03.920
of your solar cell
with metal and light's

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.562
not going to get in to
generate electron hole pairs.

00:54:06.562 --> 00:54:08.020
So that's the
optimization function

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.520
that's run right there.

00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.870
Wow, so far I'm
counting three or four

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:14.000
of these different
parameters tugging

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.370
in different directions, right?

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:18.540
So you can begin to sense how
constrained the solar cell

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:21.130
device is in terms
of optimization

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.860
of all these parameters,
and how easy it

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:25.460
is to make a very low
efficiency device as a result,

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.930
how difficult it is to make
a high efficiency device.

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:31.515
So this is interesting.

00:54:31.515 --> 00:54:33.640
So we have now the spacing,
the appropriate spacing

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.810
between fingers.

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:38.010
It's about 4 millimeters.

00:54:38.010 --> 00:54:41.220
Which means if we're going to
be making a solar cell device,

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.370
say a thin film solar cell
device on a sheet of glass

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.897
with some transparent conducting
materials [INAUDIBLE],

00:54:46.897 --> 00:54:48.480
and then we have our
source of device,

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.160
and we have their front surface
here, and we have, let's say,

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.580
something else on
top, we have to limit

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.510
how wide we make that device.

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:59.730
Otherwise, we could be
limited by our sheet

00:54:59.730 --> 00:55:03.520
resistance in, say, the zinc
oxide layer of our device.

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:07.370
And this is interesting
now because previously

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:10.170
for the bulk resistance--
let's think back over

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:11.290
to our bulk resistance.

00:55:11.290 --> 00:55:14.430
We wanted our area to be large
because we wanted to minimize

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.330
the bulk resistance.

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:21.045
Now we want the area to be small
so that we minimize our emitter

00:55:21.045 --> 00:55:22.840
sheet resistance.

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:24.929
So you can see how
the current traveling

00:55:24.929 --> 00:55:26.970
in two orthogonal directions
inside of our device

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:29.070
is really causing us
problems because we're

00:55:29.070 --> 00:55:31.700
having to optimize
the same parameter

00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:35.010
in different
directions for each.

00:55:35.010 --> 00:55:36.181
It's tricky.

00:55:36.181 --> 00:55:37.680
And I'm providing
you the tools here

00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:40.170
to be able to sit
down and calculate out

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.270
what is the optimal
thickness, what

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:44.799
is the optimal thickness of
your emitter, of your base,

00:55:44.799 --> 00:55:47.340
and what is the optimal lateral
dimensions of your solar cell

00:55:47.340 --> 00:55:50.630
device to simultaneously
minimize your bulk resistance

00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:53.700
and your emitter resistance
instead of a device.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.770
And you can do it all now with
equations that I just gave you.

00:55:56.770 --> 00:55:58.320
So it's pretty cool.

00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:00.438
At least to first order.

00:56:00.438 --> 00:56:02.670
AUDIENCE: How did you
define B, again, in that?

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:03.836
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:56:03.836 --> 00:56:05.520
So B was a vertical dimension.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:07.670
B is just given as
the distance here.

00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:09.950
Yeah.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:11.559
AUDIENCE: And that's
going across like

00:56:11.559 --> 00:56:12.850
if you look down on your model?

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:15.141
PROFESSOR:Yeah, you're looking
down on your solar cell.

00:56:15.141 --> 00:56:19.268
So the pn-junction would be
planar to this view right here.

00:56:19.268 --> 00:56:21.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:23.065
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:56:23.065 --> 00:56:24.965
It's a bird's eye view
on the solar cell.

00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:32.190
Any other questions?

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:36.450
OK, so contact resistance.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.150
This is the next thing that
can kill a solar cell device.

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:43.200
Contact resistance-- we
want to minimize the contact

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.100
resistance, but the
first step to minimizing

00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:49.020
is to measure, to know what your
contact resistance really is.

00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:51.990
And one simple way to
measure contact resistance

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:55.120
is to take a cross section
of your solar cell device.

00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:58.650
We have deposited, say,
four metal fingers on it,

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:00.850
and they're appropriately
spaced by, I don't know,

00:57:00.850 --> 00:57:03.050
how many millimeters or so.

00:57:03.050 --> 00:57:05.790
So you have a certain
contact resistance right here

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:10.210
between the metal and your
semiconductor material that's

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.170
denoted as R sub C. And then
there's a certain emitter

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:19.110
resistance that we just talked
about, R sub em right here.

00:57:19.110 --> 00:57:25.060
And if you were to measure the
current passing through here

00:57:25.060 --> 00:57:26.970
to here, or another
way to say it

00:57:26.970 --> 00:57:29.360
is, the resistance for current
to pass from this point

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.620
to that point, you
might get, let's say,

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.970
this data point right here,
a total resistance value

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:40.460
of some value, and a distance
between the two probes of, say,

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:44.430
1 times d sub f we're
d sub f is the unit

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:48.790
distance between two adjacent
contact metallization fingers.

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.060
Now if we measure the
resistance between this point

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.810
and that point, we might
wind up with that data point

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:55.700
right here.

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:58.040
And if we measure the
resistance between this point

00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.440
and that point-- we already
did that-- to this point

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.880
and that point, we might
wind up with that data point

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:04.896
right here, and so forth.

00:58:04.896 --> 00:58:05.770
And what's happening?

00:58:05.770 --> 00:58:08.500
Well, as a current
goes into the device,

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.150
it passes once through the
contact resistance, a certain n

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:16.680
times R sub em, n being the
number of metallization,

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:20.591
number pops, the number of
times we travel distance df.

00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:22.090
And then it goes
out the other side,

00:58:22.090 --> 00:58:25.260
again traveling through
the contact resistance.

00:58:25.260 --> 00:58:30.230
So the slope of this line here
should be equal to the emitter

00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:32.100
resistance.

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:36.360
And the offset, the
intercept at x equals 0 here,

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:38.767
the intercept should be 2
times the contact resistance.

00:58:38.767 --> 00:58:40.850
Because in principle, that
would be the equivalent

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:43.767
of current going in and going
back out through this contact

00:58:43.767 --> 00:58:45.600
resistance right here,
through the same one,

00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:47.466
not traveling at all
through the emitter.

00:58:47.466 --> 00:58:49.340
Obviously since that's
impossible to measure,

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.298
we have to determine that
through extrapolation

00:58:51.298 --> 00:58:53.435
back to the y-axis.

00:58:53.435 --> 00:58:57.289
So this so-called TLM method,
the transmission line method,

00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:59.330
is a method that is used
to determine the contact

00:58:59.330 --> 00:59:02.530
resistance of a
solar cell device.

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:04.660
You could either
perform it linearly

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.590
in this fashion right
here, or using a circular,

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.020
essentially an array
of concentric circles.

00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:14.060
And the latter method is
typically preferred, especially

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:16.480
in thin film devices.

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.560
So this is how you measure
the contact resistance.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:21.350
And then there are line losses.

00:59:21.350 --> 00:59:23.420
So what can-- let me back
up one step-- what can

00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:24.990
effect the contact resistance?

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:26.960
Typically, what effects
contact resistance

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:31.060
is the atomic interface
between your metal

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:32.770
and your semiconductor,
whether it's

00:59:32.770 --> 00:59:35.180
an organic or an
inorganic semiconductor.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:35.920
Bless you.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.770
So the interface here is
what determines the contact

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.940
resistance, typically.

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.440
And of course,
the dopant density

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:49.320
within your semiconductor.

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.920
So components of the series
resistance in the line losses.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:55.880
So line losses are
essentially the losses

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.810
in the contact metallization
lines out of plane.

00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:03.400
What can cause a resistance in
the contact metallization line?

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.140
Well, intuitively we know that,
OK if the line is too small,

01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:08.380
if the cross section
that line is too tiny,

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:12.240
then there's going to be a high
resistance to current travel

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.270
along that line.

01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:14.430
And indeed that's the case.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:16.280
Whoa, we have the
same exact equation

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.940
as we had for our
base resistance.

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:19.900
Now it's applied to the line,
because in principle it's

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:20.524
the same thing.

01:00:20.524 --> 01:00:22.860
We have current traveling
through in one direction

01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.850
along a constrained
cross sectional

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:28.220
area, a certain distance,
a certain length.

01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:30.800
So we have now a resistivity
given by the metal

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.360
obviously, because now we're
talking about the metal itself,

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.610
not the semiconductor anymore.

01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:36.460
Currents traveling
along the contact metal

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.260
so that the row becomes the
resistivity of the metal, the A

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:41.940
becomes a cross sectional
area of the contact finger,

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.380
and the l is the length
of the conductive path.

01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.640
In other words, how
long does the current

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.440
have to travel along
that contact metal

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.040
before it reaches a
highway, a bus bar, one

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:55.460
those really thick strips of
metal on our social device,

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.980
in which case it's home free.

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:01.350
So the R, the row rather,
the metal resistivity,

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:06.090
resistivities of several
metals and non-metal materials

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:07.510
are given here.

01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:10.850
That's typically why you see
silver contact metallization

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:13.730
used for solar cells.

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:15.840
It's because it has a very
low resistivity, which

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.489
means that the resistance
line losses will be small.

01:01:19.489 --> 01:01:21.030
Now, what is the
problem with silver?

01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:23.200
Does anybody know what
percentage of the world's

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.160
silver right now manufactured
each year is currently

01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:29.507
being used for contact
metallization on solar cells?

01:01:29.507 --> 01:01:30.090
Take a number.

01:01:30.090 --> 01:01:30.589
Guess.

01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:31.326
AUDIENCE: 30.

01:01:31.326 --> 01:01:34.690
PROFESSOR: A little lower, but
in that order of magnitude.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:36.150
So he said 30.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:39.300
Somewhere upwards of 10%,
right, would be your guess?

01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:41.450
So around 10%.

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:44.980
And of course PV is growing
at a cumulative annual growth

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.500
rate in the several 10s
of percents per year.

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.600
So silver utilization
is expected

01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:50.960
to continue to increase.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.820
So either we mine
more silver, or we

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.770
venture to another
contact metal material.

01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:59.990
And that's why you see
folks looking into copper.

01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.130
Nickel, which is similar
in electronic structure.

01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:05.050
It's one element to the left of
copper on the periodic table,

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.470
and another metal alternatives.

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.970
Yes?

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:09.345
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
where does nickel

01:02:09.345 --> 01:02:10.712
fall on the resistivity chart?

01:02:10.712 --> 01:02:12.160
PROFESSOR: I have to give
you the exact number,

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.409
but if I were to venture a
guess, what you're noticing

01:02:14.409 --> 01:02:18.070
over here are several
of the metals that fall

01:02:18.070 --> 01:02:19.770
in the noble metal category.

01:02:19.770 --> 01:02:23.820
These are far to the
right on the 3D series.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:25.840
So if you picture the
periodic table again,

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.110
far in the 3D series you
have that d-shell orbital

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.500
completely filled.

01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.410
And those outermost
electrons are then

01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:34.582
screened by all the other
electrons in the system

01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:35.540
and very loosely bound.

01:02:35.540 --> 01:02:38.265
And so you can remove the
electrons fairly easily.

01:02:38.265 --> 01:02:41.830
It's one of the reasons why
these elements in that class

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:44.685
have a higher conductivity,
a lower resistivity.

01:02:44.685 --> 01:02:45.540
Yeah, question?

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.956
AUDIENCE: Copper doesn't seem
that much worse that silver.

01:02:47.956 --> 01:02:49.689
[INAUDIBLE].

01:02:49.689 --> 01:02:52.580
PROFESSOR: So, yes, absolutely.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:54.770
Copper doesn't seem so
much worse than silver.

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:58.800
So the contact
metallization pastes to date

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:00.970
have mostly been using silver.

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:03.980
Copper can oxidize
fairly easily.

01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.290
So that's one
downside of copper.

01:03:06.290 --> 01:03:10.070
Another problem with copper is
that it's a very fast diffuser.

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.000
It's very tiny.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.850
And so the elastic
strain energy turn

01:03:13.850 --> 01:03:16.800
as it tries to move through
a lattice is very small.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.049
And as a result, it goes deep.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.840
So when you fire your
contact metallization

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.930
when you create the
contact between your metal

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:24.400
and your semiconductor
underneath,

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.140
you run the risk of having
atoms diffuse into your device

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.370
and hurting the
efficiency, hurting

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:32.569
the ability of the solar
cell to collect carriers.

01:03:32.569 --> 01:03:34.110
We'll are more about
that on Tuesday.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:35.610
AUDIENCE: So it
becomes an impurity.

01:03:35.610 --> 01:03:37.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.
it becomes an impurity.

01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:39.590
In this case, unintentional.

01:03:39.590 --> 01:03:42.100
So just remember
where the contact

01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:43.400
is right here in the emitter.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:45.720
OK, if it diffuses into
the emitter, it's OK.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.140
The electrons at this point
are the majority carriers.

01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.690
But if the metal diffuses
all the way into the bulk,

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:54.467
the electrons inside of the bulk
in here are minority carriers.

01:03:54.467 --> 01:03:57.050
And they can be impacted by the
presence of that copper there.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:02.760
All right, so I wanted to
get through at least one

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.562
more point to really set
us up well on Tuesday.

01:04:06.562 --> 01:04:08.270
We want to be able to
calculate the Fermi

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:10.145
energy of a solar cell
as a function of dopan

01:04:10.145 --> 01:04:13.240
concentration, illumination
condition and temperature.

01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:15.780
So, so far we've really
talked about the Fermi energy,

01:04:15.780 --> 01:04:18.620
the chemical potential inside
of a solar cell in hand wavy

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:19.420
terms.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.150
We've talked about
general trends,

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.510
about how as we add more
electrons to our system,

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:25.640
say by doping, we shift
the Fermi energy up

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:28.450
because the average ensemble
energy of the electrons

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:29.930
is increasing.

01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:32.370
But now we're going to be
calculating it and determining

01:04:32.370 --> 01:04:33.590
how to calculate it.

01:04:33.590 --> 01:04:36.730
So the question is
calculating Fermi energy.

01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:38.820
So let's introduce
a new concept here.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:42.200
So far we've talked about
and energy band diagram,

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.274
and drawn our valence
band, and drawn

01:04:44.274 --> 01:04:45.690
our conduction
band, and of course

01:04:45.690 --> 01:04:46.970
the band gap in between them.

01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.261
We've drawn the valence band
and conduction bands as it

01:04:49.261 --> 01:04:51.555
they were just continuum
density of states,

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:53.180
as if they were just
these blocks where

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.280
electrons could pile in.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.939
In reality we have what's
called a density of states

01:04:59.939 --> 01:05:01.730
in the valence band
and a density of states

01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:03.060
in the conduction band.

01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:05.442
If you want to think
about electrons as cars,

01:05:05.442 --> 01:05:07.150
the density of states
could be considered

01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:10.840
the number of parking
spaces there are

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.780
per floor in a parking garage.

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.424
As you increase the energy in
the case of a parking garage,

01:05:15.424 --> 01:05:16.840
you increase your
potential energy

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.030
as you move your car
higher and higher.

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.530
In here, you would be increasing
the energy of the electrons

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:22.850
as you go higher and higher.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:24.641
The increase in the
energy of holes as they

01:05:24.641 --> 01:05:25.810
go lower and lower.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:29.820
So we have a certain density of
states that is allowed inside

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.030
of our semiconductor.

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.330
And there's a very
small density of states

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:34.941
right at the band edge.

01:05:34.941 --> 01:05:36.440
And that density
of states typically

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:40.850
increases as you go deeper
and deeper into the bands.

01:05:40.850 --> 01:05:45.950
So now at absolute
zero, and the person

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:47.830
who probably knows more
about absolute zero

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:49.288
than anybody else
here in this room

01:05:49.288 --> 01:05:51.694
is Kristy Simmons in the
back, who for her Ph.D.

01:05:51.694 --> 01:05:53.610
Would work on very low
temperature experiments

01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:56.540
down into the, what, 10s
of millikelvin range.

01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:59.910
10s of millikelvin range--
it's very, very cold.

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:03.920
And then if you cool
things down a lot,

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.530
all the electrons
that were excited

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:08.660
will drop down, say, into
the valence band right here.

01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:11.726
And what this is represented
is as a filled valence band

01:06:11.726 --> 01:06:12.225
right there.

01:06:12.225 --> 01:06:14.887
And as you begin
heating your system up,

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:16.970
some of the electrons will
have the thermal energy

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:19.070
to be excited
across the band gap.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:20.990
So thermally excited
electrons here

01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:23.740
represented in your
conduction band.

01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.510
[WHISPERING]

01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:27.990
So we have a certain number
of thermally excited electrons

01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:33.001
here up into the
conduction band.

01:06:33.001 --> 01:06:38.490
Oh, and these carriers we'll
call intrinsic carriers

01:06:38.490 --> 01:06:40.664
because they're not
added by dopans.

01:06:40.664 --> 01:06:42.580
We're not adding anything
to the semiconductor

01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:44.954
to create dopans to
generate new carriers.

01:06:44.954 --> 01:06:46.620
There are intrinsic
carries because they

01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:49.960
came from the valence band,
went up to the conduction band.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:52.440
So if we plot intrinsic
carrier concentration

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.960
as a function of
temperature, we see

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.690
a curve that looks like this.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.630
And it follows this
expression right here,

01:06:58.630 --> 01:07:01.677
which is called in an Arrhenius
equation in a generic form.

01:07:01.677 --> 01:07:04.010
In this case it would be
intrinsic carrier concentration

01:07:04.010 --> 01:07:05.420
as a function of temperature.

01:07:05.420 --> 01:07:07.140
We'd have to substitute
this big N here

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.639
for intrinsic carrier
concentration,

01:07:08.639 --> 01:07:10.230
some exponential
prefactor, and then

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:12.940
an activation energy,
the activation energy

01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.210
being the energy needed to
create that free carrier.

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.030
The band gap energy
in this case.

01:07:18.030 --> 01:07:20.780
The activation energy
divided by KbT,

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:23.680
the KbT being Boltzmann's
constant times

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.440
temperature in Kelvin.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:28.550
Now, if we plot the same
functions that we just saw

01:07:28.550 --> 01:07:32.460
in the previous slide a little
differently, we plot 1 over T--

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:34.920
see 1 over T right
-- and there--

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:37.520
and we plot the
log of this value.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.160
So again, log of this value, we
can read the activation energy

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.159
off of the slope of this graph.

01:07:43.159 --> 01:07:45.450
So that's why you typically
see Arrhenius plots plotted

01:07:45.450 --> 01:07:48.459
in this way-- 1 over T
verses log of parameter--

01:07:48.459 --> 01:07:50.750
because you can read the
activation energy straight off

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:51.291
of the graph.

01:07:51.291 --> 01:07:54.040
It becomes very easy to see
the carrier concentration.

01:07:54.040 --> 01:08:00.080
So again, at absolute
zero we have,

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:02.050
here the valence band
completely filled,

01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:04.710
the conduction band completely
empty in our semiconductor.

01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:07.650
And the probability of
occupancy of a state

01:08:07.650 --> 01:08:10.490
inside of our semiconductor
is given by this box function

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:11.980
right here.

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.790
Now let's look at what
happens when we heat this up.

01:08:14.790 --> 01:08:17.700
When we heat the sample
up, some of the electrons

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:20.422
that were in the higher energy
states are going to be excited.

01:08:20.422 --> 01:08:22.380
So they used to be here
in lower energy states.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:24.588
They are going to be excited
to higher energy states.

01:08:24.588 --> 01:08:26.939
In the area of this
little shape right here

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:29.010
is equal to the area
of that little shape

01:08:29.010 --> 01:08:30.859
right here because of
conservation of number

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:33.149
of electrons in our system.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:36.920
If we multiply this by
the density of states,

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.950
this is the density of states in
the valence band minimized here

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.381
at the band edges,
and increasing

01:08:41.381 --> 01:08:43.506
as we go deeper into the
bands for the valence band

01:08:43.506 --> 01:08:44.569
and the conduction band.

01:08:44.569 --> 01:08:46.910
So we take our probability
distribution function,

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:48.920
multiply it by the
density of states,

01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:52.569
and we get the occupied density
of states in our semiconductor.

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:56.090
So now we see that there's some
number of missing electrons

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.590
that are now in the
conduction band.

01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.040
They used to be in the valence
band at very low temperature.

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.665
But now as we increase
the temperature,

01:09:01.665 --> 01:09:03.420
they've had the thermal
energy to excite

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:07.580
across given this probability
distribution function.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.920
And these carriers are
now free to conduct

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.310
charge inside of our system.

01:09:12.310 --> 01:09:14.350
So what do we do
with this framework,

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.710
with this understanding?

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:18.974
Well, we can look
at this function

01:09:18.974 --> 01:09:21.390
here and ask ourselves, what
is the name of that function.

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.430
It's called the
Fermi-Dirac distribution,

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:26.439
and it's given by this
equation right here.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:28.910
We'll notice in the
Fermi Dirac distribution,

01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:33.200
we'll notice that this
equation approximates

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:37.590
to an exponential equation as
we move further and further away

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:40.060
from the Fermi energy, the
Fermi energy being defined

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:41.143
as this energy right here.

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:43.680
If we move further way down
here, or further way up here,

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.370
this starts looking an awful
lot like an exponential.

01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:49.319
Meaning this right here
and this right here

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:53.149
start looking like
exponential functions.

01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:57.240
OK, so let's do a quick
little Gedanken experiment is

01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:59.170
a quick little thought
experiment, about what

01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:01.760
happens when we heat
up a semiconductor.

01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:05.300
And how would this impact, how
these free carriers right here

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:11.610
impact the noise, say, in a
camera, in a CCD-based camera.

01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:14.407
A charge couple display
camera, which functions not

01:10:14.407 --> 01:10:15.990
so different from a
solar cell device,

01:10:15.990 --> 01:10:18.200
except that it's biased
a little differently

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:19.575
than an actual
solar cell device.

01:10:19.575 --> 01:10:21.450
But it could be like
a pn-junction, p-i-n,

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:22.770
to be more precise.

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:26.400
So we have our little
camera right here,

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.420
and the camera's
typically placed inside

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.970
of a liquid nitrogen dewar if
we want very high performance.

01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:36.670
These are not your
typical handheld cameras

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:38.630
that you would use for
shots in the street.

01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:41.630
These are cameras that we use
in the laboratory for detecting

01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:45.660
very faint signals inside of
our semiconductor systems.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.470
And we typically cool
our cameras down.

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:49.290
Why?

01:10:49.290 --> 01:10:51.530
Because we want to
minimize the density

01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:54.354
of these intrinsic carriers.

01:10:54.354 --> 01:10:56.270
Because any photon that
comes into our system,

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.270
we want to be able to
count it and to detect it.

01:10:58.270 --> 01:11:00.120
And not have to detect
a very small signal

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.360
on top of a large background
noise of thermally

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:04.780
excited carriers.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:08.210
In a solar cell device, the
intrinsic carrier concentration

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:13.037
is typically much, much less
than the dopant concentration.

01:11:13.037 --> 01:11:14.620
So the intrinsic
carrier concentration

01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.640
matters less for
our semiconductors

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:19.580
than it does for a photo
detector like this.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.080
And that's why,
thankfully, we don't

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.470
have to cool our solar
cells with liquid nitrogen.

01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:28.880
So in terms of have
intrinsic carries,

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.080
let's dwell there just
a little bit longer.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:33.560
Transistors are made of
what semiconductor material

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:38.250
to have less electronic
noise to experience?

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:41.120
OK, so what semiconductor
material, germanium or silicon,

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.780
would experience less electronic
noise at room temperature?

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:45.260
And let me give you a hint.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.950
Silicon has a band
gap of 1.1 eV.

01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:50.290
Germanium has a
band gap of 0.67 eV.

01:11:50.290 --> 01:11:54.020
Which of the two is going to
have greater electronic noise

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:55.087
at room temperature?

01:11:55.087 --> 01:11:55.920
AUDIENCE: Germanium.

01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:58.240
PROFESSOR: Germanium because
it has smaller band gap,

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:01.405
it's going to be easier
for the carriers-- we

01:12:01.405 --> 01:12:04.030
go all the way back here-- it's
going to be easier for carriers

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:06.584
to hop across because
the band gap is smaller.

01:12:06.584 --> 01:12:08.750
Another way to look at it
is on the Arrhenius plots,

01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:10.200
you'll have a higher
carrier concentration

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.570
because your slope is smaller,
your activation energy

01:12:12.570 --> 01:12:13.570
is smaller.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:15.347
And as a result,
you'll have a higher--

01:12:15.347 --> 01:12:17.930
if the band gap shrinks-- you'll
have a higher carrier density

01:12:17.930 --> 01:12:19.240
here in the conduction band.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:21.410
Let me show you that
in pictorial form.

01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:23.770
So this is the silicon band gap.

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:27.530
This is the density of thermally
excited carriers for silicon.

01:12:27.530 --> 01:12:28.830
Now we shrink the band gap.

01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:29.779
Boom, we shrunk it.

01:12:29.779 --> 01:12:31.945
Same probability distribution
function because we're

01:12:31.945 --> 01:12:33.784
at the same temperature.

01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.200
But now we have a
smaller band gap

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:38.340
so we have a higher
density of free carriers.

01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:41.020
And true story, germanium
was one of the first crystals

01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:46.000
to be purified during the
early days of semiconductors,

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.190
and silicon was
following germanium.

01:12:49.190 --> 01:12:51.320
And silicon was
ultimately chosen

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.907
as the material of
choice for transistors

01:12:53.907 --> 01:12:56.240
because the intrinsic carrier
concentration of germanium

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.780
was just too high for
most applications.

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.030
And so you can see the
intrinsic carrier concentration

01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:03.900
at room temperature of
silicon is around 10 to the 10

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.900
whereas for germanium is
around 10 to the 13, three

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:08.780
orders of magnitude higher.

01:13:08.780 --> 01:13:09.810
So, yes, question?

01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:10.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:13:22.185 --> 01:13:24.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
would be most costly.

01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:26.000
Absolutely.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.959
And so you do see solar
cells like Concentrics

01:13:27.959 --> 01:13:29.500
is one company that's
commercializing

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:31.130
gallium arsenide-based
solar cells.

01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:34.530
But they have to concentrate the
sunlight into very small area

01:13:34.530 --> 01:13:38.040
devices because the devices cost
so much to make per unit area.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:41.851
So they take cheap plastic and
concentrate the sunlight down.

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.350
Yeah, and here's a
gallium arsenide.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:44.700
The intrinsic
carrier concentration

01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.074
is even less than
that of silicon

01:13:46.074 --> 01:13:50.540
because the band gap is
1.4 eV instead of 1.1.

01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.810
OK, so I think this is
a good place to stop.

01:13:52.810 --> 01:13:55.010
I'm still not through
all the material.

01:13:55.010 --> 01:13:56.780
Oh, we wanted to do one demo.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:57.430
JOE: Yeah.

01:13:57.430 --> 01:14:00.213
PROFESSOR: Do you want to do
it first thing next lecture?

01:14:00.213 --> 01:14:01.059
JOE: That's fine.

01:14:01.059 --> 01:14:01.905
We've got five more minutes.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:04.000
Ah, we do have five more
minutes before 10 after.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:05.715
OK, why don't we do
a quick demo then.

01:14:05.715 --> 01:14:07.950
So what we're going to
do as Joe sets this up,

01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:11.240
is I'll verbally describe
what's going to happen here.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.670
We are going to
take this-- actually

01:14:14.670 --> 01:14:17.670
let me go back to be Fermi-Dirac
distribution function.

01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:20.190
This function right here,
as we increase temperature,

01:14:20.190 --> 01:14:21.300
what happens to this?

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.850
This will look more and
more, shall we say, flat.

01:14:26.850 --> 01:14:28.350
It won't actually
go flat, but it'll

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:30.320
become more and more
diagonal opposed

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.460
to box-like in function.

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.840
What that means is the
density of carriers,

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.720
the density of free carriers
will increase with temperature.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.560
And because of the
Arrhenius dependence

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:41.650
here, we have an
exponential increase

01:14:41.650 --> 01:14:44.400
of the number of free
carriers with temperature.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.960
Because the function
right around this region

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:49.780
right here, which impacts
the electron concentration,

01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:52.404
the conduction band,
this small portion

01:14:52.404 --> 01:14:53.820
of the Fermi-Dirac
equation can be

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:55.750
approximated by an exponential.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.350
If we have an
increasing temperature,

01:14:57.350 --> 01:15:00.560
we should have a drastically
increasing carrier density.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:02.790
And let's see if
that's indeed the case.

01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:05.850
What we have is a piece
of intrinsic silicon just

01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:08.260
with a battery
pack attached so we

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.697
have a field across that
piece of intrinsic silicon.

01:15:12.697 --> 01:15:13.196
Whoops.

01:15:13.196 --> 01:15:14.340
Here we go.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.769
And we are going
to apply, again,

01:15:15.769 --> 01:15:17.810
that field across the
intrinsic piece of silicon.

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:20.070
A certain current
will flow through it.

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:22.020
And then Joe has a
heat gun, so he's

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:24.610
going to heat up
the silicon and see

01:15:24.610 --> 01:15:29.040
what happens as the Fermi-Dirac
equation here is effected

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:31.800
by temperature, we should
have an increasing density

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.710
of carriers in the
conduction band.

01:15:33.710 --> 01:15:36.280
So let's see if that's
indeed the case.

01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.210
Can somebody read off what the
current is currently measuring

01:15:39.210 --> 01:15:41.038
there on our current meter?

01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:43.180
AUDIENCE: It's about
9.8 microamps right now.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.460
PROFESSOR: 9.8 microamps.

01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.390
So this battery pack
of 3 volts right here

01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:51.790
is it is forcing a
current of 9.8 microamps

01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:54.160
across that little
slab of silicon that

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:55.740
is sitted right here.

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:57.490
And so Joe is going
to apply the heat gun,

01:15:57.490 --> 01:16:00.470
and if none of the
contacts pop off,

01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:01.840
let's see what will happen.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:04.744
So we expect the
resistivity to go what?

01:16:04.744 --> 01:16:05.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:05.660 --> 01:16:06.570
PROFESSOR: Down.

01:16:06.570 --> 01:16:09.200
And the conductivity to go up.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:12.380
All right, so let's see here.

01:16:15.630 --> 01:16:18.640
So what's happening there folks?

01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:19.940
It's going up?

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.238
So that's the --

01:16:22.238 --> 01:16:24.388
JOE: So it went up to
around 50 microamps,

01:16:24.388 --> 01:16:27.625
and can see it's dropping rather
dramatically now [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:29.500
PROFESSOR: So the current
that the material's

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.940
able to pass through
is increasing

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.310
as a result of the increasing
temperature, because you're

01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:36.650
exciting more carriers
into the conduction band,

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:38.450
leaving more holes
in the valence band,

01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:40.750
and these are free charge
carriers are able to conduct

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:43.140
charge through the material.

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.290
Cool, OK.

01:16:44.290 --> 01:16:48.500
So with that, I will leave
you, and I will return Tuesday.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:51.880
And Joe give a fantastic
lecture on device physics

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.920
as well since I
will be at a kickoff

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.390
meeting for a big NSF-related
center in Phoenix, Arizona.

01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:59.710
But it will be great lecture.

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:02.370
You won't want to miss
it, and look forward

01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:04.490
to seeing you on Tuesday.

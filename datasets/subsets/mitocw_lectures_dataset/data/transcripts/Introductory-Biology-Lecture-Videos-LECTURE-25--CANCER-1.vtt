WEBVTT

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.780
PROFESSOR: OK so
on Monday we talked

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.950
about how cell division is
regulated at this single cell

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.180
level.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
On Wednesday we talked
about how regeneration

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.070
is mediated at the level
of an entire tissue.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.470
And today we're going to
talk about how all of that

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.210
can go wrong, OK?

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.120
And when all of
this goes wrong, it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.740
results in a disease, actually
many different diseases,

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.070
but are commonly
known as cancer.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.110
And as illustrated in
this cartoon, what you see

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.090
is that cancer can
often be defined

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.220
as having distinct steps in
its progressive, essentially,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.340
deregulation of normal
cell and tissue behavior.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.760
So when we're
thinking about cancer,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.460
we're thinking about a
stepwise degeneration.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.130
And cancer is a disease
that affects an individual's

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.330
own cells, but those cells get
progressively and progressively

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.890
dysregulate d in their
behavior and the coordination

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.810
of their behavior with
the rest of the tissue.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.385
So it's a stepwise degeneration
of normal cell behavior.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:56.500
And it results from mutations
that are occurring in the cell.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.420
And we'll talk about what
types of mutations right now.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
And then I'll take you
through some examples

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.730
of different signaling
pathways and we'll

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.220
try to classify what
different types of genes

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.550
should be labeled as.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.377
So first, I want to talk
about classes of genes

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:20.710
and their involvement in cancer.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.570
And the first example
that I'll take you through

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.190
is known as an oncogene.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.680
And it's referred
to as an oncogene

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.530
after the mutation
has already happened.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.970
And so an oncogenic
mutation is a mutation

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.720
that's going to promote
growth and survival of a cell.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.600
So this promotes growth.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.270
Before the gene is
mutated, it's referred

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.730
to as a proto-oncogene.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:13.880
So before mutated, the gene
is labeled a proto-oncogene.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.500
And the normal function
of these proto-oncogenes

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.410
is also to promote
growth and survival,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.010
but they do so in
a regulated manner.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.070
So a gene becomes
an oncogene when

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.230
there's a mutation
that causes it

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.910
to be unregulated by the
environment of the cell

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.250
or even the surroundings
of the cell.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.460
And so you can think of this
as a constitutive activation.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.060
Often oncogenes are
constitutively active forms

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.915
of normal genes.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.370
And one way to
think about this is

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.500
you have a gene whose normal
function is to promote growth

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.010
and it's kind of stuck in
the state of the gene that

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.690
always promotes growth, which
is not normally how it works.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.019
Normally there are signals
that tell a cell to grow,

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.810
and those signals come
and go, and that's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.290
how the body regulates
when cells divide.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.370
But you can have a situation
where it's essentially

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.540
the equivalent of what you might
consider a stuck accelerator,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.750
if you're thinking
about an automobile.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.280
So if you have a
stuck accelerator,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.340
and you can only speed up,
and you can't slow down,

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.640
this is analogous to
an oncogenic mutation.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.960
Now a different class
of gene, actually

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.660
kind of the opposite
of an oncogene,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.270
is called a tumor suppressor.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.050
And tumor suppressors are
genes whose normal function

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.270
is to inhibit growth
or even promote death.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:21.120
So tumor suppressors inhibit
growth or promote death.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.940
You could see how these
two different things would

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.390
have the same effect
in that it's not

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.000
allowing one cell to
become a lot of cells

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.820
because the tumor suppressor
will either prevent it

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.120
from dividing or will
cause the cells to die.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.920
And so the cancer
phenotype is associated

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.880
with a loss of function
of the tumor suppressor.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.800
So these result from loss of
function mutations in the tumor

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.680
suppressors.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.490
So if you remove the thing
that's inhibiting growth,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.700
then that allows
the cells to divide

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.410
in a more unregulated way.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.700
And so sticking with the
analogy of an automobile,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:12.480
you could think of the
tumor suppressor mutation

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.060
as a cell having
defective brakes.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.060
So you can think of this
as defective brakes.

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.270
So it's the loss of function
of these that lead to cancer.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.120
Now I want to tell you about
one last class of genes

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.550
that are implicated in cancer.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.970
And these are what, in
the diagram up there,

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.010
are referred to as
caretaker genes.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.970
And what that refers
to is the fact

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.540
that these genes are
involved in maintaining

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.930
the genomic integrity of a cell.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.470
And they can do that
by mediating DNA

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.660
repair when it needs to happen.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:16.320
So these are involved
in the repair of DNA.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.790
Or actually, I
know what I'll say.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.370
We'll say genome.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.510
It's involved in genome repair.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.170
But not only repair, but
also genome stability.

00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:35.600
So making sure that
chromosomes are equally

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.390
segregated to daughter cells
so that you don't end up

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.340
with cells with
extra chromosomes

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.590
or lacking entire
chromosomes, which

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.720
is known as being aneuploid.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.500
So genome repair
and also integrity.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.570
And again, because these
promote genome integrity,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.140
it's a loss of the
function of these genes

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.170
that is what promotes cancer.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:12.980
So a loss of function
mutations in caretaker genes

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.820
are what can drive
a cancer phenotype.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.360
And that's because if you
lose a caretaker gene that's

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.560
involved in DNA repair, actually
one example of a caretaker gene

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.000
is the BRCA1 gene, which is
involved in breast cancer.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.919
And so if you lack
this BRCA1 gene,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:40.190
it makes it so that
the cells are not

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.380
as good at repairing their DNA.

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.580
And then the cell can
accumulate additional mutations,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.730
and the cell might get
an oncogenic mutation

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.160
or it might lose
tumor suppressors.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.680
And that's what drives
that cancer phenotype.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.430
Now I just want to point out
something that just happened

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.420
this week, which is that one
of our very own colleagues

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:10.280
here at MIT, Angelika
Amon, whose lab has

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:15.320
done a lot of research that has
provided fundamental insights

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.700
into how a lack of
genome integrity

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:23.990
influences both normal
and cancer cells.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.340
She just won what's known
as the breakthrough prize.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:33.740
And so this is a prize that was
initiated by Chan Zuckerberg

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.470
initiative, so it's
out of Silicon Valley.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.430
And the point of the prize is
to basically celebrate science,

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:43.490
like we would movies
at the Oscars.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.360
And so this is Angelika here
receiving this breakthrough

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.630
award, and this just
happened this past weekend.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.060
And this is for her
fundamental work

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.560
on how aneuploidy influences
the biology not only

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.950
of normal cells, but also
cancer cells because it

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:04.100
plays an important role
in the biology of cancer.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.720
All right, so now
that we've defined

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.450
some of these key
genes, I want to talk

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:17.510
about one example of a pathway
that influences cell division.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:20.270
And we'll go through all of
the genes in this pathway

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:22.010
and decide whether
or not they should

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:28.430
be considered oncogenes, tumor
suppressors, or caretakers.

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.490
And the pathway we're
going to look at

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.950
involves the G1 to S transition.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.160
And you'll recall
that this G1 to S

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:45.860
transition in the cell cycle
is referred to as START

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.160
and is the point at which
an individual cell commits

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.030
to going through the
entire cell cycle.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:56.210
So this G1 S
transition, or START,

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:01.970
what kicks off the whole process
is the expression of a cyclin.

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.550
And that is specifically
the G1 cyclin.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:15.290
And this G1 cyclin is regulated
by many different things.

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.900
And we've talked
about a lot of them.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:22.170
First of all, there
are growth signals.

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:26.330
These are secreted
proteins that allow cells

00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:28.310
to communicate with each other.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:32.330
And many growth signals promote
growth and cell division

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.240
by up regulating this G1 cyclin.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.030
So you're actually regulating
the gene expression

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:42.380
of this particular cyclin gene.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.930
We also talked about Wnt.

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.040
And Wnt is another type
of signaling system.

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.870
And one of its targets
is also the G1 cyclin.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:55.660
So both of these
signals promote growth.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.390
There are also other
types of signals,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:03.200
like cytokines, which also
promote G1 cyclin expression.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.610
So this is a really
pivotal control point

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:08.650
for the cell to
decide whether or not

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.470
to enter into the cell cycle.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.660
I'll point out
that there are also

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.840
other types of signals
that inhibit growth,

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.990
and I'll call those
growth inhibitors.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.900
And so these growth inhibitors
inhibit G1 cyclin expression.

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.560
So if you have a
cell in your body,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.180
and it's trying to decide
whether or not to divide,

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:34.250
it's basically reading out how
many growth positive signals

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:37.300
it's seeing versus
growth negative signals,

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:40.600
and it's able to integrate
that information based

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.600
on how much G1
cyclin it produces,

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.190
and that determines
whether or not

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.640
it goes into the cell cycle.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.910
So G1 cyclin.

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.000
And G1 cyclin functions with
cyclin-dependent kinase.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.150
So this depends on
cyclin-dependent kinase.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:01.990
This eventually leads to
the expression of the G1

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:04.510
to S cyclin.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:07.420
And it's the G1
to S cyclin which

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:12.550
is responsible for activating
the transition from G1 to S,

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.030
which is known as START in
yeast and the restriction

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.610
point in mammalian cells.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.780
But it all starts really
with this G1 cyclin.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:27.070
So I want to talk about
this step in the cell cycle.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.400
And I'll show you the nitty
gritty of the mechanisms that

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.540
are involved.

00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:35.650
And we'll talk about what types
of genes all of these genes

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:36.310
are.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:39.130
And it's going to involve
a very important gene

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:42.910
that I'm going to tell you
a lot more about in just

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:44.870
a few minutes.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:49.210
All right, so the critical
determinant of START

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.100
is this G1 S cyclin.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.890
So I'm drawing a
piece of DNA here.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.680
Here's the G1 S cyclin gene.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.760
So this is DNA.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.830
I just drew a piece of DNA.

00:13:59.830 --> 00:14:01.370
Part of the genome.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:06.550
This is the G1 S cyclin gene.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.940
And this gene is activated,
its transcription

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:15.290
is activated, by a transcription
factor known as E2F.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.320
So we'll keep track
of what these are.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.425
E2F is a transcription factor.

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:30.700
So E2F is a
transcription factor that

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:35.920
will activate the expression
of this G1 S cyclin.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:43.310
But in early G1, there's a
protein that binds to E2F.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.820
And this protein is called Rb.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:48.950
I'll tell you what Rb
stands for in just a minute.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:52.840
But what Rb does
is it binds to E2F

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:56.650
and it inhibits its
transcriptional activity.

00:14:56.650 --> 00:15:01.780
So in early G1, E2F is
inhibited and the expression

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:04.840
of this G1 cyclin is off.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.230
So this is off or repressed.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:17.960
So before the cell passes
START, this expression is off.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.800
So this is early
G1 before START.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:32.720
Now what happens is this state
is changed by the G1 cyclin.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:36.680
So if there's adequate
levels of G1 cyclin, and this

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.800
is in complex with
cyclin-dependent kinase.

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.560
Because cyclins, their
functions are always

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.140
mediated through
cyclin-dependent kinase.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.170
So the cyclins are never, as
far as I know, functioning

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:49.790
on there by themselves.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:52.160
They're always
functioning through one

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.400
of the cyclin-dependent kinases.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:00.620
So G1 cyclin CDK
phosphorylates Rb.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.840
And so you then get an Rb
that has a bunch of phosphates

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.560
attached to it.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:16.250
And this inhibits Rb's function
such that it can't bind to E2F.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.530
So when G1 cyclin CDK
phosphorylates Rb,

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:27.400
that causes Rb to go away
from the promoter of the G1 S

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400
cyclin.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.120
And now you have this
transcription factor, E2F,

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:35.940
free to transcribe
the G1 S cyclin gene.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.180
So this now gets turned on.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:45.180
And it's this activation
of G1 S gene expression

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.010
which is the signal to undergo.

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:57.470
You get G1 S cyclin CDK
because you express this gene.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:17:00.970
And that activates the
transition into S phase.

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.990
All right, now take
a look at everything

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.270
I just drew on the board.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.450
Who can tell me where
the tumor suppressors

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.410
are in this pathway?

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.534
Miles.

00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:26.740
MILES: Rb.

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.240
PROFESSOR: Rb is a
tumor suppressor.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.440
That's exactly right.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.200
Let me get some
colored chalk here.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:42.070
All right, I'm going to circle
tumor suppressors in pink.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.290
Are there any other
tumor suppressors?

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:48.660
So Rb is a tumor suppressor.

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:49.270
Yeah, Amanda.

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:54.570
Did you have one, Amanda?

00:17:54.570 --> 00:17:55.150
Georgia.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.850
Georgia, sorry.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.810
GEORGIA: The growth inhibitors.

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.480
PROFESSOR: The growth inhibitors
are also tumor suppressors,

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:01.980
exactly.

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.230
OK, how about oncogenes?

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.340
What would be considered a
proto-oncogene in this system?

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:16.215
Jeremy?

00:18:16.215 --> 00:18:17.537
JEREMY: CDK.

00:18:17.537 --> 00:18:20.390
PROFESSOR: CDK
would be one, yup.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:21.490
So oncogenes.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.200
CDK can be considered
a proto-oncogene.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.010
Anything else?

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:40.220
Well, what defines an
oncogene or a proto-oncogene?

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.310
What's its normal
function in the cell?

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.020
Carmen?

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.460
CARMEN: Its function is to move
the cell along the cell cycle.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.040
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.570
So it promotes growth.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:58.470
And moving a cell along the
cell cycle will promote growth.

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.960
So yes, exactly.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.605
So anything here promoting
growth besides CDK?

00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:06.000
CARMEN: E2F.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.230
PROFESSOR: E2F would be
a proto-oncogene, sure.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:11.805
Jeremy, did you have an idea?

00:19:11.805 --> 00:19:13.020
JEREMY: G1 cyclin.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.400
PROFESSOR: G1 cyclin.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.100
Basically everything else
here would be considered

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.020
a proto-oncogene, right?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:20.400
Wnts are proto-oncogenes.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.140
They're promoting
growth by promoting

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.470
the expression of G1 cyclin.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.020
The growth signaling
pathway, all of those genes

00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.390
would be considered
proto-oncogenes.

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:33.510
And so anything that
is promoting growth

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:35.160
will be a proto-oncogene here.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:38.400
Great.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.630
All right, so now we're going to
move on and talk about this Rb

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:49.380
gene, which I just showed you
mechanistically what it does.

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.930
But what Rb stands
for is retinoblastoma.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.250
So Rb stands for retinoblastoma.

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:05.310
And this Rb gene,
as you suggested,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.960
is a tumor suppressor.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.820
It was actually the first tumor
suppressor that was cloned.

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.510
And so retinoblastoma,
as the name implies,

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.500
is involved in a human disease.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:28.830
And it's involved in a
rare childhood eye tumor.

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.290
So I'm going to show you
one last weird eye picture.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:42.070
If you don't want to look, look
down or look the other way.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:45.910
I'm going to show you a
child that has retinoblastoma

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.690
and what it looks like.

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:51.820
So it's going to
appear right now.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.880
So this is an individual
with retinoblastoma.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.150
You can see that there's
something inside the eye,

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:00.040
growing in the back of it.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.280
And to give you a better
picture of what is happening,

00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:06.880
this is now a cross section
through a normal eye.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:10.420
This is a cartoon
of the normal eye.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:13.420
And individuals
with retinoblastoma

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.510
have a growth in
the back of the eye.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.070
From the retinal
tissue you can see

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:22.900
this huge tumor that's present
in the back of this eye.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.260
So this disease
involves the formation

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.510
of these tumors in
the eye that originate

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.680
from the retinal tissue.

00:21:33.325 --> 00:21:33.825
All right.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:41.190
So this disease results -
this is a tumor suppressor.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.550
It's a loss of function
in the retinoblastoma.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:49.995
So there's a defect in
the retinoblastoma gene.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.680
But this disease
of retinoblastoma

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.470
manifests itself
in different ways.

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:01.180
So there are different
forms of the disease

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.270
and I'll tell you how
they're different right now.

00:22:04.270 --> 00:22:06.870
So there are two
forms of the disease.

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.050
The first, it's called sporadic.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:19.290
And it's called
sporadic because this

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:23.370
is a form of the disease
that arises in families that

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.610
have no history of the disease.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:34.380
So the sporadic form, the family
has no history of the disease.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:43.210
And this disease presents
in a certain way.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:48.780
The first is it is what is known
as unilateral, meaning usually

00:22:48.780 --> 00:22:51.420
only one eye is affected.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:53.610
So it usually
involves only one eye.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.670
And this disease can
be treated in children.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:06.830
And if the sporadic
form of the disease

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:11.790
is treated in the child,
then later on in life

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.700
that individual does not
have an increased risk

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.980
of getting further tumors.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:23.740
So there's no increased risk
of cancer later in life.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.450
For example, in a
different organ.

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.160
So this is one form
of the disease.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.160
The other form of the
disease is called familial.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.600
And as the name
implies, familial

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.380
means that the disease
runs in the family.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:50.820
So what familial means is
there's some inheritance.

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:54.780
There's an inherited
form of the disease.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.640
And the familial
form of the disease

00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.790
can be distinguished
from the sporadic form

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.260
because it presents differently.

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.740
The way the familial
form presents

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:11.250
is it's often bilateral, meaning
that both eyes become affected.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.720
So it affects both eyes.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:20.370
And also in individuals
with the familial form,

00:24:20.370 --> 00:24:23.010
even when they're cured
from the eye tumors,

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:26.970
they have a higher risk
of getting other tumors

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.210
in other organs of their
body later on in life.

00:24:30.210 --> 00:24:34.590
So in this case, there is
later an increased risk

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:39.375
of cancer in other organs.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.440
So this is an example
of a familial form

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:54.670
of retinoblastoma, where
affected individuals here

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.130
are colored in green.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:01.270
So what would you say the
inheritance pattern is

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:03.100
for this particular phenotype?

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.938
Carmen?

00:25:14.938 --> 00:25:17.360
CARMEN: Autosomal recessive.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.030
PROFESSOR: Why do you
say autosomal recessive?

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.598
Can you explain your logic?

00:25:21.598 --> 00:25:22.140
CARMEN: Yeah.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:30.333
It looks [INAUDIBLE] are
affected regardless of--

00:25:30.333 --> 00:25:32.625
with colorblindness it was
always the sons that got it.

00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:35.250
[INAUDIBLE] getting it as well.

00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:39.050
But you can see some
generations where neither parent

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.077
had retinoblastoma.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.100
PROFESSOR: So Carmen's
exactly right.

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.400
And she's saying that both males
and females are getting it,

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.240
so it looks like that
would argue that it's not

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.330
sex linked, but autosomal.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.940
So it looks autosomal.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.630
And why do you say recessive?

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.504
Can you explain
your logic there?

00:26:05.504 --> 00:26:07.894
CARMEN: The third from the left.

00:26:07.894 --> 00:26:09.510
The one that has an arrow on it.

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.558
Both parents are
affected [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:12.558 --> 00:26:14.516
The only way that's
possible for their children

00:26:14.516 --> 00:26:18.170
to get the recessive gene.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:21.110
PROFESSOR: So Carmen
is exactly right.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:23.910
She's looking at
this individual here.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:25.880
And in this case,
this individual

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.370
was not affected
with the disease,

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.805
but passed on the disease
to their daughters.

00:26:33.805 --> 00:26:37.880
Now I think one thing.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.980
This is an exception
to the rule.

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:43.310
What you see in pretty
much all the other cases is

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.030
that individuals in this
generation in the middle

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:51.950
here do have the disease,
and they pass on the disease

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:53.760
to the next generation.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:27:00.380
So because I'm seeing the
disease in all generations,

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:06.260
I would say that this is likely
to be autosomal dominant.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.390
And Carmen picked
up on something

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:10.370
that I want to come to.

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.890
It so happens that
this individual

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:18.920
was not affected by the disease,
but still clearly carried

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.430
a disease allele.

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:24.740
And I'm going to talk about
why this is an exception

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.640
and why this is still an
autosomal dominant inheritance

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.570
pattern.

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:39.690
But if we take it that this is
an autosomal dominant disease,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.070
it's kind of counter intuitive,
at least to me, and maybe

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.600
to you, because I just told you
that tumor suppressors result

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.680
from a loss of
function of the gene.

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.580
And we're used to seeing
loss of function mutations

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:58.460
being recessive.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:02.480
And actually, at the
cellular level, it's true.

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.480
The cancer is recessive.

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.310
But in this case,
what you see is

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:11.810
that, at the organismal
level, the inheritance pattern

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.500
actually acts as a
dominant phenotype.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:18.320
So there's kind of a difference
between the inheritance

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.780
pattern at the cell level
and at the organismal level.

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.030
And I want to tell
you why that is

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.450
because I think it's
important for understanding

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.910
the risk to cancer.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:42.230
And so what's inherited is
not the full blown disease.

00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:46.490
What's inherited in the
case of retinoblastoma

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:51.950
and many other cancers is a
predisposition to the disease.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:29:07.865
So what is inherited is the
predisposition to the disease.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:16.190
And that's because
if we look at, let's

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:21.890
consider the top male up here.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:27.680
If that male is heterozygous
for the Rb gene,

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:32.980
then he can have a
gamete, which is Rb-,

00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:36.440
so lacking a functional
copy of the Rb gene.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:43.100
And he married an individual
without a disease a label,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:47.960
so she's going to
just make Rb+ gametes.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.360
And if they have children
and one of the children

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:59.450
gets a gamete that is
derived from Rb- allele,

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.320
then you get an individual
in the zygote here

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.640
which has one functional
copy of the Rb gene

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.550
and one mutant copy
of the Rb gene.

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:15.690
So that's the egg,
and then that egg

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.250
is going to develop
and give rise

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:19.660
to all of the cells of the body.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.700
And so in this case,
all of the somatic cells

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.960
from this individual
are going to be

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.860
heterozygous for the Rb gene.

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:44.390
So all somatic cells
are heterozygous for Rb.

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:47.100
So they're Rb+ over Rb-.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.590
And the effect of
that is, is it means

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:56.160
that each of the cells
in this individual

00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.120
are only one step away
or one mutation away

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.535
from lacking both copies of Rb.

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.210
So by being
heterozygous, it means

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:20.670
that all cells in the individual
are just one mutation or step

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:21.770
from losing Rb.

00:31:28.230 --> 00:31:31.800
And so the inheritance
pattern, what you're looking at

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.130
is the predisposition
to the disease.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:37.290
And the predisposition
doesn't mean

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.860
that a person is guaranteed
to get the disease.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.800
And that's illustrated in
this family tree, right?

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.330
There was an individual here,
this male here with the arrow,

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:51.300
who clearly was a
carrier for the disease

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.570
because he passed on the
disease to his children,

00:31:54.570 --> 00:31:59.490
but who himself never actually
was affected by the disease.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:01.690
So because it's
a predisposition,

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.600
it doesn't mean
there's a guarantee.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:09.690
That if you are
heterozygous for Rb,

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.370
there's not a
guarantee that you're

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.860
going to have the
disease, but you are

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.450
going to be predisposed to it.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:18.910
And in the case of Rb,
more often than not,

00:32:18.910 --> 00:32:21.330
if you lack one
functional copy of Rb

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:24.010
and are heterozygous
for all of your cells,

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:29.072
then you're going to be
affected by the disease.

00:32:29.072 --> 00:32:30.280
Does that make sense, Carmen?

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.140
CARMEN: Yeah.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:31.723
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.210
Yeah, Jeremy?

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:39.270
JEREMY: [INAUDIBLE]
people who are

00:32:39.270 --> 00:32:43.000
heterozygous and homozygous for
the disease are affected by it.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.370
PROFESSOR: Well, actually, if
you are homozygous from Rb,

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.900
the individual would
probably not be born.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.090
Yeah.

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:55.680
So I think it would be
impossible to be heterozygous

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.790
for Rb.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:58.050
Yeah.

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.800
So really what you're inheriting
here is that predisposition.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:06.540
And because the predisposition
just requires heterozygosity,

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.990
it manifests itself like
a dominant phenotype.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.950
Because you only need
to inherit one allele

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.820
that's mutant in order to be
predisposed to get the disease.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:21.210
So that that's why it appears
at the organismal level

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:27.900
to be a dominantly
inherited phenotype.

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.350
But then to get the
disease, you need

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.680
to lose a second
copy of the gene.

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.990
And so for the sporadic
form of the disease,

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:39.480
so we just talked about
hereditary or familial

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.690
retinoblastoma, all of the
cells of the individual

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.090
will start out
being heterozygous

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.940
and then some of
them will lose, what

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.750
is known as lose heterozygosity,
and become homozygous mutant

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.330
in a particular tissue.

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.800
And that would be
the tumor tissue.

00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:58.470
So what are some
ways that there could

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.200
be this loss of heterozygosity?

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.410
Can you guys come up with
some possible ways to do that?

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:05.601
Heterozygosity.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.230
How might a cell lose
that second copy of Rb?

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.949
What are some
potential mechanisms

00:34:17.949 --> 00:34:21.949
that you could lose it?

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:22.449
Rachel?

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:23.620
RACHEL: Point mutation.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.010
PROFESSOR: It could be a
point mutation, exactly right.

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:31.354
So one way would be
point mutation in Rb.

00:34:31.354 --> 00:34:31.854
Other ideas?

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:35.790
Yeah, Patricia?

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:40.725
PATRICIA: There isn't proper
separation during mitosis

00:34:40.725 --> 00:34:44.100
and you only get one copy.

00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:46.590
PROFESSOR: So if you
lose a chromosome, right?

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:48.600
So if you guys
remember back, remember

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.550
way back when we are all young
men and women in early October.

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:57.030
We did the whole
demonstration with mitosis

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:01.050
and we had a case where
we had two good friends

00:35:01.050 --> 00:35:02.820
across the metaphase plate.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:09.000
And that brought both sister
chromatids off to one side.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.540
That would result in
loss of a chromosome.

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.760
And in this case, if
you have a division

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.510
and you lose the
wild type copy of Rb,

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.737
if you lose that
entire chromosome,

00:35:20.737 --> 00:35:22.320
then you're going
to be left with only

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:25.590
the mutant copy of the Rb.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:28.920
So another mechanism
would be chromosome loss.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.070
Where the chromosome that's lost
is the chromosome with the wild

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:41.150
type Rb+ allele.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:43.640
Any other ideas as
to how you might

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.575
lose the second
functional copy of Rb?

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:52.399
Yeah, Miles.

00:35:52.399 --> 00:35:53.899
MILES: I'm not sure
if it completely

00:35:53.899 --> 00:35:56.320
falls under point mutation,
but overall DNA damage?

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:58.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
can have DNA damage.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.970
You can have a
deletion that deletes

00:35:59.970 --> 00:36:03.600
the entire region of the
chromosome that contains Rb.

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.840
There could be even
chromosomal abnormalities,

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:10.470
like translocation,
that somehow delete Rb.

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.790
So I'll just say
deletion for now.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.180
Any others?

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:21.770
Can anyone think
of something that

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.620
wouldn't be necessarily a
genetic change, but more

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.830
of an epigenetic
change, so to speak?

00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.956
Yeah, Natalie.

00:36:34.956 --> 00:36:37.750
NATALIE: [INAUDIBLE]
mutagenized?

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:40.840
PROFESSOR: Being mutagenized?

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.380
NATALIE: Exposed to
rays of something.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:45.880
PROFESSOR: But then
that would cause

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:49.060
a mutation, which might fall
into one of these three classes

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:49.930
here.

00:36:49.930 --> 00:36:56.660
What about without being
mutagenized, non mutagenic.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:57.850
Yeah, Maxwell.

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.933
MAXWELL: Are there any
other environmental factors

00:36:59.933 --> 00:37:01.203
that control expression of Rb?

00:37:01.203 --> 00:37:01.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.480
So Maxwell's saying,
what else would control

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:07.930
the expression of the Rb gene?

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:11.170
What if you had an effect
that would basically

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.946
cause that functional copy
of Rb to be not expressed?

00:37:15.946 --> 00:37:20.980
And so this is another way that
you can lose heterozygosity,

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:29.390
as you have repression
of transcription.

00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:31.390
And I'm not going to go
through the nitty gritty

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:35.620
of the details, but one way
in which genes are regulated

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:41.800
is by modification of DNA
by chemical modifications,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:43.090
like methylation.

00:37:43.090 --> 00:37:46.930
And so promoter
methylation is a mechanism

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.870
that causes repression
of gene expression.

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:53.320
And in many cases in
cancer, the functional copy

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.900
of a tumor suppressor
will basically

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.650
be lost by promoter methylation,
so that you no longer express

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.990
that gene in that cancer cell.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:06.850
And therefore, the cancer
cell has a cancer phenotype.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:12.850
Any questions on Rb
before I move on?

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:20.170
Everyone understands
why retinoblastoma

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.540
is dominant at the
organismal level,

00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:25.222
yet recessive at the cell level?

00:38:25.222 --> 00:38:26.305
That's an important point.

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:34.300
The concept behind that
is also the same for BRCA1

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.680
and other tumor suppressors
like p53 and APC,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.120
which you'll see
in just a minute.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:46.450
All right.

00:38:46.450 --> 00:38:48.790
So now I want to move
up kind of from thinking

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:52.540
about the mechanism of
cancer at the level of a cell

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.670
and let's think about it
at the level of a tissue.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:58.060
And as an example, I
want to use colon cancer.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.090
And you'll recall
from Wednesday,

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:07.810
I talked about the
intestine as a system.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:09.820
And the way it works
is pretty much the same

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.520
for both the small and
the large intestine.

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:15.670
It just happens in the large
intestine or the colon,

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:20.980
you don't have villi, but you
do still have these crypts.

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.110
So that would be
what a colon would

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:26.110
look like, more or less, or
at least one crypt of a colon.

00:39:31.590 --> 00:39:34.160
And remember, at the
base of the crypt,

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.010
there was this
specialized compartment,

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:40.820
which was the stem cell niche.

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:43.730
And this is where
renewal was happening.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:48.410
And renewal and cell division
down at the base of the crypt

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:51.500
then results in this conveyor
belt-like movement up

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:55.820
to the region of the tissue
near the lumen, where cells

00:39:55.820 --> 00:40:00.290
are shut off into the lumen.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:08.090
So what might be one
barrier to cancer

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:10.730
that has to be overcome
in order for a tumor

00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:12.920
to form in this organ?

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:13.500
Yeah, Miles.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.720
MILES: You know the
diagram [INAUDIBLE] cells.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.471
So the one part that [INAUDIBLE]
would be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:22.471 --> 00:40:24.596
It's when the cells get
[INAUDIBLE] into the lumen.

00:40:24.596 --> 00:40:27.580
[INAUDIBLE] system anymore.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:33.440
So if cancer cells, [INAUDIBLE]
just never shed off [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.447
keep [INAUDIBLE] and it would be
just moved along the intestine

00:40:37.447 --> 00:40:38.030
and never die.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:43.180
[INAUDIBLE] undying cells
that won't ever shed.

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.260
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
what Miles is saying

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.170
is that these cells are going
to move up and get shed off.

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:53.780
And so if you have a mutation,
either an oncogenic mutation

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.620
or loss of tumor suppressors,
if it goes up, and sheds,

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.410
and is removed from the
organ, it doesn't matter.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.320
That cell is not going to
be able to form a tumor.

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:06.740
So one thing that has
to happen for a cell

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.880
to form a tumor in this
system is this treadmill

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:16.220
has to be blocked, such that
cells are no longer exiting

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.260
the organ, so that
you have a cell

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.820
actually stay in
the organ that would

00:41:19.820 --> 00:41:22.640
be able to accumulate
additional mutations

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.370
and undergo tumorigenesis.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.120
And this is what
happens because, as we

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:35.980
know in colon cancer, one of
the first steps in colon cancer

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:42.070
is disregulation of the
signaling that really regulates

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:47.380
this movement of cells and
the homeostasis of the tissue.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.860
So step one here.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:56.830
Step one is to dysregulate the
main signaling pathway that's

00:41:56.830 --> 00:41:59.568
involved in this,
which is Wnt signaling.

00:42:04.150 --> 00:42:07.390
And so another famous
tumor suppressor

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:11.800
is called the APC gene.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.180
This is a tumor suppressor.

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:27.850
And this APC gene is associated
with another familial form

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:28.900
of cancer.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:32.650
In this case, it's familial
adenomatous polyposis.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.750
And so this is a normal colon.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:37.900
Normally your colon
has a smooth surface.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.400
It's basically smooth here.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:41.380
I mean, there are some
folds, but I'm not sure

00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:45.460
that that's not an effect
of having this dissected out

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:46.830
of the organism.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:50.140
But in individuals with
familial adenomatous

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.220
polyposis, what happens
is that the colon

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.830
forms many of
these polyps, which

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.740
are benign cancer outgrowths.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.290
But you see all
these polyps here

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.080
and you see how very different
the morphology of the colon

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:09.730
is from a normal individual
and an individual that has

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:13.780
familial adenomatous polyposis.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:19.540
So the formation of a polyp is
kind of equivalent to something

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:20.080
like this.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.630
It's not invasive yet.

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:24.850
It would be known as benign.

00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:26.530
But you can see that
there is clearly

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.010
a dysregulation in
how this tissue is

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:33.670
behaving because you get
all of these polyps forming.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:37.240
And it's thought that
frank carcinoma then

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.740
results from cells in
one of these polyps

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.140
accumulating additional
mutations that

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.510
then cause the
cancer to progress

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.600
to a more malignant stage.

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.920
So I told you that APC
a tumor suppressor.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.720
And in this case,
this tumor suppressor

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.650
is associated with this
disease right here.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:06.070
And I showed you the
Wnt pathway last week.

00:44:06.070 --> 00:44:09.190
And I went through
it quickly, but you

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.620
notice this central
protein right here

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:15.130
in this destruction
complex, that's APC.

00:44:15.130 --> 00:44:19.380
APC stands for adenomatous
polyposis coli.

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.290
I will write that down.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:30.510
So adenomatous polyposis coli.

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:40.060
And what APC does, as
represented in that slide

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:44.350
above, is it's part of this
destruction complex that

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:48.460
destroys beta-catenin, which
is the downstream step of Wnt

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:49.620
signaling.

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:54.940
So the wild type function of
APC is to basically inhibit

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:59.680
beta-catenin, which
then is mediating

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.673
the effects of Wnt signaling.

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:11.650
So you can think of APC
as one of the genes that's

00:45:11.650 --> 00:45:15.440
the brake on Wnt signaling.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.530
And normally, it's
regulated by Wnt.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:25.600
So Wnt would
normally inhibit APC.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.380
But if you just
delete APC in a cell,

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:32.480
then it's like the cell is
seeing Wnt all the time.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.340
So by deleting APC, you get
a constitutive activation

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:40.090
of beta-catenin and you
get constitutive activation

00:45:40.090 --> 00:45:43.240
of Wnt signaling.

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:48.340
So if the organism starts out
being heterozygous for APC,

00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:52.360
then there is a high probability
that another mutation

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.400
will take out the wild
type function of APC

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.700
or the wild type allele of it.

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:00.460
And when you take
out that allele,

00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.680
now you all of the sudden
start having these cells

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:07.870
that it's like they
are always in Wnt,

00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:09.970
even though they're not.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:13.990
And so if you constitutively
activate Wnt signaling,

00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:15.940
what that does is it
prevents the cells

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.880
from leaving the organ.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:20.530
So they're stuck.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.090
So normally in a
normal colon, cells

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:26.750
that are renewed at the bottom
of the crypt, they move up,

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.520
and then they're
shed into the lumen.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:33.920
But in an APC mutant,
the cells are constantly

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.090
feeling like they're
getting Wnt signal,

00:46:36.090 --> 00:46:38.330
and so they stay in the colon.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:42.560
And that allows them to
accumulate further mutations.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:47.540
So step one in colon cancer is
to dysregulate Wnt signaling,

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.660
and that really disrupts
the whole tissue homeostatic

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:53.540
mechanism of the intestine.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:59.240
Then there would be further
steps, at least three

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:01.040
usually in colon cancer.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:04.520
And that would involve
mutations, oncogenic mutations,

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:06.320
loss of tumor suppressors.

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.230
And that would just
cause the cells

00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:13.910
to get more and more oncogenic
and more and more transformed.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:15.980
And eventually, they
can become invasive,

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:18.110
and we'll talk about
what happens when cells

00:47:18.110 --> 00:47:20.840
become invasive next week.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.910
So I wanted to end
today's lecture

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:33.020
by talking about targeted
treatments for cancer

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:35.570
just to see how they
interface with the mechanisms

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:37.070
that we've discussed.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:41.930
And of course, some of the
primary ways to treat cancer

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:45.920
are through surgery
and also chemotherapy.

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:53.900
But there are also more
directed ways to target cancer.

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:57.920
And because time's up,
well, I have one minute.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.170
I'll tell you about
the first one.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.170
And then if I have
more to go, I'll

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:07.348
start with that in
next week's lecture.

00:48:07.348 --> 00:48:09.140
So the first one I
wanted to tell you about

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:14.390
is this disease, chronic
myelogenous leukemia,

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:18.170
which involves activation
of the ABL gene.

00:48:18.170 --> 00:48:19.850
And it's activated,
in this case,

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:24.090
by a translocation between
two different chromosomes.

00:48:24.090 --> 00:48:25.670
So this is chromosome 22.

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:27.680
This is chromosome 9.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:32.480
And in many patients with
chronic myelogenous leukemia,

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.940
a large part of chromosome 22 is
translocated onto chromosome 9,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:42.110
and a little bit of chromosome
9 is attached to chromosome 2.

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:46.760
And this translocation generates
a gene fusion between the BCR

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.220
gene and the ABL gene.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:56.090
And so ABL is a non
receptor tyrosine kinase.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.940
So it's a tyrosine
kinase that is

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:08.070
present in the cytoplasm of
the cell and promotes growth.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.470
So this is a proto-oncogene.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:21.260
And when ABL becomes
hooked up to BDR, then

00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:25.343
this results in the constitutive
activation of BCR ABL.

00:49:25.343 --> 00:49:27.260
So this is now a
constitutively active kinase.

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:39.140
Now when this was
realized, then researchers

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:42.110
started looking for small
molecules that would inhibit

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:45.200
the kinase activity of ABL.

00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:48.500
And the famous
example is Gleevec.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.510
And this is a picture
of Gleevec here.

00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:52.800
You can see it's
a small molecule.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:54.890
And what Gleevec
does is now this

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:59.840
is a crystal structure of the
ABL tyrosine kinase in green.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:02.690
And it has two lobes, an N
terminal lobe, a C terminal

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.910
lobe, like a lot of kinases.

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:08.000
And what Gleevec does is
to bind in the interface

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.590
between these two lobes.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:13.580
And it locks this kinase in
an inactive conformation, such

00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:17.150
that if cells see
this Gleevec, then

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:20.150
their ABL tyrosine
kinase is inhibited.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.440
And this is the driver of
chronic myelogenous leukemia.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:27.650
So Gleevec has been very
effective in treating

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.740
this type of leukemia
and it results

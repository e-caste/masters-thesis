00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.600
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.910
In this segment I'm going
to actually show-- well,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.700
you're actually going to show--
the derivative of tangent

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.300
x using the quotient rule.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.170
So what I'd like you to
do, I wanted to remind you

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.810
of what the quotient rule is.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.750
So u and v are functions of x.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.040
We want to take the
derivative of u divided

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.020
by v. I've written
the formula that you

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.420
were given in class for this.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.850
And I'm asking for you
to take d/dx of tangent x

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.240
using the quotient rule.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.810
And the hint I will give you
is the reason we can obviously

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.640
use the quotient rule
is because tangent x is

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.640
equal to a quotient
of two functions of x.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.050
It's sine x divided
by cosine of x.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.240
So I'm going to give you
a minute to work this out

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.390
for yourself, and then when we
come back I will do it for you.

00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:55.500
OK.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.220
So we want to find the
derivative of tangent x.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.200
So let me-- let me work
on this side of the board.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.370
So I'm actually going to
take d/dx of sine x divided

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.481
by cosine of x.

00:01:11.481 --> 00:01:11.980
OK.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.160
So in this case, sine x is u.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.419
Cosine x is v. So using my
quotient rule I know that first

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:21.960
I have to take the
derivative of sine

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.140
x-- that's cosine x--
and then I multiply it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.000
by the denominator, the
v, which is cosine x.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.320
So my first term in the
numerator is cosine squared x.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.210
Again, one cosine x comes
from the derivative of sine x,

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.630
one cosine x is the v. It's the
cosine x in the denominator.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.250
Then I have to
subtract v prime u.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.270
The derivative of cosine
x is negative sine x.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.710
I'll actually just
write that one down.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.520
And then I bring the
u along for the ride.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.580
So I multiply by sine x here.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.460
And then I take v squared in the
denominator from the formula.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.470
v, again, is cosine
x, so I take cosine

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.125
squared x in the denominator.

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:10.000
Now this at this point
is a little bit messy,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.620
but the nice thing
is that we can

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.820
use some trigonometric
identities to simplify this.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.820
So let me first write out what
it is a little more clearly.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.770
Minus a negative
gives you a positive.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.540
And then here I get
sine x times sine

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.700
x, so I get the sine squared x.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.320
And then I keep divided
by cosine squared x.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.080
Now at this point
some of you might

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.990
have divided by
cosine squared x here

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.870
and gotten 1, and divided
by cosine squared x here

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.890
and gotten tangent squared x.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.600
And then from there
you could simplify

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.430
to another
trigonometric function.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.250
I'm going to go straight a
different way to show you

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.140
what that actually also equals.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.830
So there, at this
point I want to stress

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.640
there are sort of two ways
you can get to the same place.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.910
But I'm going to use the
fact that the numerator is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.950
a very nice trigonometric
identity that we know.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.890
We know cosine squared x plus
sine squared x always equals 1.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.470
So this is quite lovely, the
numerator simplifies to 1,

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.460
the denominator stays
cosine squared x.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.980
What is this function?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.070
1 over cosine x is
actually secant x.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.260
So if you need, at this point,
to rewrite the whole thing

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.180
like this, right?

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.430
1 squared is 1 and in
the denominator we still

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.170
get cosine squared x-- this
tells you that 1 over cosine

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.100
squared x is actually just
equal to secant squared x.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.660
So again, what I
want to point out

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.500
is we've now taken the
derivative of tangent x

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.400
and we got that that's
secant squared x.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.110
Now using this
quotient rule, you

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.720
can do the same kind of
thing with cotangent x,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.760
with cosecant x, with secant x.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.230
You can find all
these derivatives

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.750
of these trigonometric functions
using the quotient rule.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.250
So if you want to know what
the derivative of secant x is,

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.640
you should take d(dx of 1
divided by cosine x and use

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.710
the quotient rule.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.780
Or, in fact, the chain rule
would work well there also,

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.780
to find that derivative.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.200
So we are building up
the number of derivatives

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.540
we can find using
these different rules.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.761
So we'll stop there.

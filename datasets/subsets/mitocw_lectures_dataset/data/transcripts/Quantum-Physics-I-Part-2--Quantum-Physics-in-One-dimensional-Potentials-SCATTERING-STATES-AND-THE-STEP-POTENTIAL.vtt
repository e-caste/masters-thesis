00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.610
PROFESSOR: Scattering states are
energy eigenstates that cannot

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.070
be normalized.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.550
And when you say this
cannot be normalized,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.040
so what's the use of them?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.650
They don't represent particles.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.560
Well, it's like
they e to the ipx

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.470
over h bar, those
infinite plane waves.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.140
Each one by itself
cannot be normalized,

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.320
but you can conserve wave
packets that are normalized.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.570
So the whole intuition that
you get with scattering states

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.790
is based on the idea that
we're going to construct

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.710
energy eigenstates.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.670
This time we cannot think of
them as states of a particle.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.910
Bound states, yes.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.580
We can think of them,
they're normalizable.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:59.010
But this energy eigenstates
and bounded scattering states

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.570
are not states of one particle.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.230
So we definitely have to go
back and produce wave packets.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.160
But the intuition from
those energy eigenstates

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.780
is very valuable.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.515
So scattering states.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.080
And we call them sometimes
scattering states

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.100
because they look like
the process of scattering.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:33.450
This will be non-normalizable
energy eigenstates.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.560
And you've played a
little with some of them.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.690
And we'll now study
one case in detail.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.910
We'll try a couple of cases
between today and next lecture.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.700
So the step potential.

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:57.955
And the step potential
is a potential

00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:02.350
that is 0 up to x equals 0.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.660
Here's the x-axis, and then
suddenly there's a step at v0.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.120
And here is the potential.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.330
But then the wave,
this is here, goes up.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.870
It's a step.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.450
And any energy eigenstates
here has to be bigger.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.320
The energy has to be
bigger than the lowest

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.700
point of the potential.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.730
You know that, you kind
of have an energy that

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.620
is like that less
because this would

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.015
have decayed exponentially
for infinite distance.

00:02:48.015 --> 00:02:51.630
It just, all over it would
have to decay exponentially.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.370
It's impossible.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.690
So all the energy
states, eigenstates here,

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.260
must have positive energy.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.770
So we have actually
qualitatively

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.150
two possibilities.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:12.140
The energy may be less than
v0, might be greater than v0.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.040
It would look like you have to
solve the problem two times.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.520
Happily, we'll solve one,
then let the other happen

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.330
by analytic continuation.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.730
So here is the energy.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.090
I'll take the energy
greater than v0.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.730
But whatever is the energy,
even if it's less than v0,

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.750
the solution over
here is going to be

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.630
an exponential or a cosine and
a sine, a non-decaying function,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.180
and therefore can't be
normalized because it's

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.880
non-decaying forever and ever.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.570
So it cannot be normalized.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.910
So how do we write the solution
for the energy eigenstate?

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.270
It's a psi of x.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.400
Well, I should write two
formulas: a formula for what's

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.280
happening on the left side,
and the formula for what's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.880
happening on the right side.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.519
Now I have a choice
actually here.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.730
There's two ways of
visualizing this.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.130
I can visualize it as a wave
that is coming from the left,

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.540
moving here.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.905
Or a wave that is
coming from the right.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.590
So let's visualize this
solution as a wave that's

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.575
coming from the left.

00:04:37.575 --> 00:04:39.920
It will be a little easier.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.587
So I will write it.

00:04:41.587 --> 00:04:43.722
A e to the ikx.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.380
OK.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.090
Why is it coming from the left?

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.060
Because if you put the energy--

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.850
that I will not put it,
it's in stationary state,

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.560
presumably this is a state
with some fixed energy.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.060
You will have a factor e to
the minus iEt over h bar.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.300
And when you see
kx minus Et, you

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.000
know that that's a wave
that is moving to the right.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:25.065
So this A e to the ikx
is moving to the right.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.940
And then what will happen?

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.070
Now it's a matter of
finding a solution

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:35.530
of Schrodinger's equation.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.860
So you can try to find the
solution of Schrodinger

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.760
equation, but you have to
write some answers for what's

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.285
happening on the right.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.440
I will write an answer
here, that we'll

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.440
put C e to the i k bar x.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.510
And another k.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.920
Well, we'll see now
what those k's are.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.340
I say the following.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.400
Here, the energy is
bigger than the potential

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.990
so it has to be a wave.

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.910
But here they energy is still
bigger than the potential

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.580
so it also must be a wave.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.280
But a wave with
different kinetic energy,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.300
different momentum, therefore
different de Broglie

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.760
wavelength and different k.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.110
But we know from Schrodinger's
equation what that should be.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.540
This wave is also
moving to the right,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.040
because probably if I have a
wave moving to the right here,

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.260
it produces some transmitted
wave to the right.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.951
But then, you could try solving
the Schrodinger equation

00:06:40.951 --> 00:06:41.450
with this.

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.730
It won't be enough
because physically you

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.180
would expect the wave bouncing
back as well from here.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:56.870
So I will put a B e
to that minus ikx.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.880
That's a wave moving
towards the left

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.830
with an unknown coefficient.

00:07:06.806 --> 00:07:10.380
And, now let's get
those constants.

00:07:15.984 --> 00:07:17.975
I'll finish in two minutes.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.540
What is k?

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.850
Well if you have energy E,
you know that the energy is h

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:32.330
squared k squared over 2 m.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:35.890
You can look at the
Schrodinger equation

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.160
with 0 potential over there.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:45.250
And therefore, k squared
is also 2mE over h squared.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.980
It's a combination you've
been seeing quite a bit.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.540
The intuition for
k bar should be

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.110
that k bar squared is 2m
times the kinetic energy,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.820
so it should be e minus
v0 over h squared.

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.770
So these are k and k bar.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:17.610
And the wave function must
be continuous at x equals 0.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:26.350
That gives you A plus B equal
to C. At 0, all the exponentials

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.010
vanish.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:32.650
And the derivative must be
continuous at x equals 0.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.080
And the derivative being
continuous because there's

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.330
no delta function anywhere here.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:44.620
So you have ikA, that's the
derivative of the first term,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:52.210
minus ikB, the same k in
that region of course,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:58.460
is equal to i k
bar C. So from this

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:08.805
you get A minus B is
equal to k bar over kC.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.170
Two equations and two unknowns.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.310
And that's OK, even though
there are three coefficients,

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.410
because the way to think
of this is that you're

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.920
sending in some wave
and you're going

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.870
to get some reflection
and some transmission.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.640
So in some sense,
A is the input.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.100
You could want to
call it 1 or whatever.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:39.180
So what we're looking
for is what is B over A?

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.565
And what is C over A?

00:09:43.565 --> 00:09:48.570
And these two equations,
it's a one line computation.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.550
I'll write the answer.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:58.240
B over A is k minus k
bar over k plus k bar.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.070
Do it for fun.

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:05.390
And C over A is 2k
over k plus k bar.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.550
B gives you a sense of
how much is reflected.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.220
C, how much is transmitted.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.320
But this is the beginning.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:22.430
Because this is not
a particle coming in.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:24.920
So we'll have to
build the packet

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:29.810
and send it in and see
how this relations tell

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.280
you what's going to happen.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.500
So this is a nice story that
we will develop next time.

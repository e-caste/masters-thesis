00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.320
JOHN DOLHUN: Good
morning, everyone.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.840
And welcome, or good afternoon.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.130
Welcome to The Ellen Swallow
Richards Lecture Series.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.320
This is our beloved
Charles River.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.530
This is the river you're
going to be testing.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.770
Once you've tested
this river, you

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.550
can actually take this
testing and apply it

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.500
to any body of water.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.130
Why should we be concerned
about this Charles River?

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.340
Yes?

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.290
Because we live next to it.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.900
Because we live--
that's a good reason.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.430
Because we live next to it.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.300
Anyone else?

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.100
Aisha?

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.985
AUDIENCE: To care
about your environment.

00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:08.860
JOHN DOLHUN: You care
about your environment.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.080
And speaking of caring
about your environment,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.130
we've got some problems
with phosphate out there.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:27.990
We've got high phosphorus
concentrations.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.420
And those high
phosphorus concentrations

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.020
lead to algal blooms.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:56.125
And those algal blooms produce
toxic chemicals and odors.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.040
And when all this algae dies,
it heads down to the bottom

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.980
and breaks off and it's
acted on by decomposers.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.350
These microbes start
to chew it apart

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.510
and they use up the dissolved
oxygen so that we get lower--

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.780
lower dissolved
oxygen in the water.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.505
And what that does is
it leads to fish kills.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.720
And our recreational
ability is impaired.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.890
So here are some examples
of what I'm talking about.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.150
This is Florida, 2016.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.380
This is Lake Okeechobee, one of
the largest fresh water lakes

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.620
in Florida.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.540
This is a 30 mile
long fish kill.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.890
It involves some
50 species of fish.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.760
The cause, most
probably, an algal bloom,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.960
the result of leaking
septic systems,

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.250
fertilizers from lawns
going into the water.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.390
This is an economic disaster.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.100
It's going to take decades
to recover from this.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.860
Is Bradenton, Florida, 2018.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.650
This is their harbor
filled with dead fish.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.870
This started from an algal bloom
that turned into a red tide.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.440
And the red tide
stretched about 150 miles

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.040
off the coast of
Florida, and gradually,

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.850
the wind and the currents
brought it into shore.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.950
And when that red
tide came in to shore,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.450
it started releasing toxins
into the air and water,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.459
and then the nutrients
broke off and microbes

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.339
started digesting them
and used up the oxygen,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.110
and all these fish died.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.740
This is Australia, 2019.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.970
This is the Darling River,
but it also happened in

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.230
the [INAUDIBLE] River.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.040
And they had a successive
run of these fish kills,

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.420
one right after the other.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.590
Again, it's global
hot temperatures

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.710
and agricultural runoff.

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.090
This is the Charles
River, August, 2019.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.850
This is the largest
algal bloom, I think,

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.770
that we've had out there.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.770
It actually stretched
from the BU bridge

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.110
to the Museum of Science.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.290
And cyanobacteria was detected.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.690
This is a health problem.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.890
So we're going to be measuring
phosphorus in the waters

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:13.470
out here.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.600
That's one of the things
we're going to do.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.320
And there are two
types of phosphorus,

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.660
there's the inorganic,
which is simply

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.450
salts of phosphoric
acid, and then

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.060
if you create esters
of the inorganic form,

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.390
you have the organic
form of phosphate.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:38.150
So let's take a
look for a moment

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
at the inorganic phosphate.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.320
I mean, phosphorus is like,
the 11th most abundant element

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.280
on the planet.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.330
And it's not found
in elemental form.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:55.230
You won't find any pure
phosphorous anywhere

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.490
on the Earth.

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.470
It's found in these types of
phosphates, in rocks and soils,

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.390
and that's how it exists.

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:09.060
So the main inorganic player
here is the orthophosphate.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.580
And that's the PO4
to the 3 minus.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.900
This is the most stable
form of phosphorus.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.460
And this is the form that's
readily available to plants

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.800
for uptake by the plants.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:37.470
I mean, all plants and animals
need phosphorus for growth.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:43.050
It's the backbone of our
DNA and the Krebs cycle.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.940
Plants need it in
photosynthesis.

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.340
They have to extract it
from their environment

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.280
because they're not going to
make sugar unless they first

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.540
make ATP to actually connect
those bonds in the sugars

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:58.060
that they're making.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.590
So we've got this
orthophosphate, the main player

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.800
here, but in the
inorganic category,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.720
you can actually
connect several of these

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.780
together and form
a polyphosphate,

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:11.460
such as our detergents.

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.580
A lot of detergents
are polyphosphates.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.150
P3O10 to the 5 minus
would be a polyphosphate.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.460
The interesting thing
about the polyphosphates

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:29.400
is as soon as they
hit the water,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.480
they hydrolyze into
the orthophosphate.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:48.400
And then we've got the
organic phosphates,

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.520
which are esters of
the inorganic form.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:58.370
And organic phosphates are
found in all living tissues.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:06.870
So all living tissues,
both plants and animals,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.690
have organic phosphates.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:15.630
And waste is also another form
of the organic phosphates.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.290
So when something living
dies, it starts to decay.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:31.060
What happens is the
phosphates actually

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.510
convert to the orthophosphate.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.970
That's what happens to them.

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:40.450
So this is what we're
going to be measuring.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.860
And now, I'd like to talk
for a few minutes about how

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:49.440
it gets into the water, where
all this stuff is coming from.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.100
So we're going to look at
some of the primary sources

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.690
of the phosphorus.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.570
The first one is
storm water runoff.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:17.810
Can anyone give me an example
of some phosphoruses, phosphates

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.285
that can get into the water
from storm water runoff?

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:29.307
Yes, Aisha.

00:09:29.307 --> 00:09:33.590
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if
there's a phosphate in dirt.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.590
JOHN DOLHUN: Absolutely.

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.360
There's phosphate in the dirt.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.420
And that would get washed in.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.090
What else?

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:43.670
Yes, Jimmy?

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:46.460
AUDIENCE: Probably less
here, but in agriculture,

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:48.375
I'm pretty sure they're
used in fertilizer.

00:09:48.375 --> 00:09:49.500
JOHN DOLHUN: Oh, gosh, yes.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.280
Fertilizers are a big
thing because of lawns.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.920
So we've got soil
here and fertilizers.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.670
Anything else?

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:12.946
Jimmy?

00:10:12.946 --> 00:10:15.360
AUDIENCE: I guess
animal droppings?

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.530
JOHN DOLHUN: Absolutely.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.700
Animal waste.

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.300
I mean, think about where
do they put pig farms?

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.940
They put them all
by a river, right?

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:30.720
And all those geese, the guano,
droppings, everything, they're

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.070
all out there by the river.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.190
And all that stuff
is being washed in.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:38.520
So animal waste is a
big, big source here.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.720
Anything else?

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.270
You ever got your car
washed in a car wash?

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.610
Do you ever sit in it
while you're going through,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.890
see all that soap coming down?

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.330
Tons of soap.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.910
And all that soap's going
into the sewer systems,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:12.300
and when it starts to rain,
heavy rains, it bubbles over.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.700
So car washes would
be a big source,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:17.130
and there's your polyphosphates.

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:25.680
Another one that you might
not be as familiar with

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.565
is car exhausts.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:39.600
Car exhausts have a
catalyst tube in there.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:44.800
When that tube gets hot,
like 500, 600, 700 degrees,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.570
it can form cerium
phosphate, which is released

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.420
in the exhaust effluent.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:54.450
So cerium phosphate
would be a culprit here.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.730
And then probably
the biggest source

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:07.050
is discharge from
wastewater treatment plants.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:12.830
Did any of you ever go to tour
a wastewater treatment plant?

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:15.120
Anyone?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.370
Oh, you did?

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.600
Kelly, right?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.340
Could you tell us--
tell us about it,

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.410
what your experience was?

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.900
AUDIENCE: It was a school
fieldtrip a long time ago,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:26.730
I think.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:27.800
It was interesting.

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.768
So they purified
or treat the water

00:12:29.768 --> 00:12:31.244
with several different methods.

00:12:31.244 --> 00:12:33.400
On of them was just
like, bacterial,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.644
and then they introduce
it [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:35.644 --> 00:12:37.770
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah, they
aerate it with bacteria,

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.980
I think, in the
secondary treatment.

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.810
And they do that to get
rid of organic matter

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.270
or to digest it down to sludge.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.692
And then there's a UV method.

00:12:51.692 --> 00:12:52.650
JOHN DOLHUN: Very good.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:55.920
I mean, the most modern plants
have this ultraviolet rays

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.270
at the very end.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.350
You can walk along and
you can see a glass floor.

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:03.450
You can see the
water going through

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.940
with the ultraviolet
rays hitting it.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.870
And then, at the end,
they have a faucet

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.110
and they offer you a drink.

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.780
I mean, there was
no one in my group

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:19.710
that availed themself to
take a sip of that water

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.080
after going through that.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.200
But let's put this
in perspective.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:36.540
So wastewater treatment
plants, they're

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.020
all built along
rivers or oceans.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:45.960
And when a heavy rain,
they start to discharge.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.040
They have to discharge.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.750
They can't take the flow.

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.880
First thing, they
may discharge some

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.280
of the secondary treated water.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.550
Sometimes, they have to
discharge the raw sewage.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.850
But to put it in
perspective, all of us

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:08.640
produce about 2.2
grams of pee per day.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.970
I'm talking about
phosphorus here.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:16.980
That's about 1.8
pounds per year.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.370
Now, when that phosphorus hits
the sewage treatment plant,

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:27.090
it's in the effluent,
it gets diluted down.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.400
You're talking
somewhere between 2

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:40.410
and probably 20 milligrams
per liter PPM of phosphorous

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:42.720
in the water.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:46.050
After the secondary
treatment, they only

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:52.120
take out between 1 and
2 milligrams per liter.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:57.060
So you end up with a
large excess of phosphorus

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.770
in the treated water.

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:03.720
So when they release,
it's a ton of phosphorus

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.550
hitting the water.

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:07.890
But the good news is--

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:15.870
I'm going to draw a smiley
face here, because the EPA just

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:18.390
filed a regulation forcing--

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.180
they're going to force all
these wastewater treatment

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:26.197
plants to cut back, get rid of
the phosphorus in the water,

00:15:26.197 --> 00:15:27.780
and they're going
to have to-- they're

00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:30.330
going to have to
take it down to less

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:35.230
than 1.0 milligrams per liter.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:38.460
So all these plants are running
around now trying to figure out

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.960
how they're going to do that.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.990
This, I believe, just went
into effect this year,

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:47.490
and may go-- may be
starting in January of 2020,

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:52.290
but there are EPA regulations
that are just coming out.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:55.590
The other major source
is sewer overflows.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:59.040
And in New England, everyone--

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.730
it's notorious that you have
a sump pump in your basement.

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:07.710
So when your basement
floods, the pump starts up

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:08.880
and it pumps everything.

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.080
They're connected to
the sewer systems.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.960
So everything in
the kitchen sink

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.400
is going into the sewer
system and it's bubbling over.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.260
So those are the
primary sources.

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:24.660
Now, let's look at
the ecological effect

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.420
of all this phosphorus.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.930
This is the Charles River,
the famous Charles River.

00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:33.360
This is up by Newton, Mass.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:37.170
There's a guy in a canoe trying
to pull out the vegetation

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:39.600
out of the water.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.880
What this vegetation
does is two things.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.920
First, it's blocking
the sunlight

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.540
to organisms and other plants
down below the surface that

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.920
need that sun.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.270
And the second thing is it's
going to die and produce

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:01.560
these swamp-like
odors, and then it's

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.800
going to get decomposed
by microorganisms that

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.599
are going to use up the oxygen.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:11.039
This is the result. This
is blue-green algae.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:19.060
This is really-- another name
for this is cyanobacteria.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.839
It's the cyanobacteria that
give it that green color

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.329
on the surface of the water.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:29.660
Here are some other forms of it.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.140
You can get this pea
soup kind of look,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.900
or you can get this
mossy look, or you

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.240
might get a painted look.

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.470
The bottom line is
it's all bacteria.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.350
It's unicellular bacteria.

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:47.600
These are prokaryotic bacteria.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.140
They have no nucleus, but
they make their own food

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.780
and they secrete chemicals.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:57.990
These are the same
bacteria, believe it or not,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:02.530
that gave us life 3.5
billion years ago.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.500
And now, they're out to get us.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.990
Isn't that amazing?

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.300
Every time I look at
this, I can't believe it.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.120
I mean, when we had
no oxygen, these

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.850
were the guys that were
giving our oxygen atmosphere,

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:17.820
and now, look what
they're doing.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.540
Now, if these are out
there in the water,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:24.210
you don't want to
go in the water.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:28.950
If you do, you are dead
meat, and I'll tell you why.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:30.930
You can have all
kinds of symptoms,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.900
you can get covered
with a rash, you

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.430
can have diarrhea, flu-like
symptoms, eye and ear problems,

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.070
respiratory problems.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:44.610
I gave you an
article in the news.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.770
This is The New York Times.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:51.180
Central Park in New
York, all of their ponds,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:53.730
infected with blue-green algae.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.940
Here's a good example.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.860
This is today, "Ohio strikes
a Blow in Algae Fight."

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:05.590
This is The Wall Street
Journal this morning.

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.020
This article just came out.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.680
Interestingly, Ohio had this
algae problem 10 years ago,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.650
and they took around
one of their lakes

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:19.990
and they built up
these wetland areas

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:22.840
to prevent the runoff
from reaching--

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:25.120
the agricultural runoff
from reaching the lake,

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.460
and it's actually working.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:30.490
So there are ideas
out there that you

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:32.605
can come up with an idea
and solve a problem.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.850
So some of these cyanobacteria,
some of the fresh water

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:46.050
bacteria produce
very toxic chemicals.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:50.070
One form of these
are the microcystins.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.910
There are something like 50
different micocystins that

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.220
have been identified to date.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.320
It's a cyclic peptide here.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.950
And this is a hepatotoxin.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:06.310
So once this gets through
your skin into your body,

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:09.660
your liver is going
to get attacked,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:11.850
and you're pretty much gone.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.080
There's not much
you can do about it.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.020
The article mentions the dogs--

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:19.480
one woman had three
dogs in North Carolina.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.840
She let them go for
a swim in a pond.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:25.860
All three dogs died
within a few hours.

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.670
So this is really nasty stuff.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:33.020
And I challenge you to
think about coming up

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.400
with an antidote for this.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.090
There's your startup
company right here.

00:20:39.090 --> 00:20:40.290
I'm giving it to you.

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:47.220
When this stuff is active, you
go out to the Charles River,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:50.700
you'll see these signs posted
warning people and pets

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.460
to stay out of the water.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:57.310
Here's another example.

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:00.720
This is the summer of 2014.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.440
This is a satellite
picture of Lake Erie, one

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.680
of the five Great
Lakes in this country.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:13.170
And the lake actually borders
Canada on one side, separates

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.320
Canada from the US near
Ontario, and then there

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:20.250
are several states
that border the lake.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:25.380
Out here to the west is
Toledo, Ohio, and Toledo,

00:21:25.380 --> 00:21:28.260
fourth largest city in
Ohio, has a population

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.570
of about a half million.

00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:35.130
This was their
tap water in 2014.

00:21:35.130 --> 00:21:40.590
And I had a 5.310 student
in class four years ago who

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:43.200
remembers this.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.380
I mean, this is
serious business.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.580
And it's happening all
over, all over the world.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.280
Here's another picture.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:58.710
This is the largest landlocked
body of water on the Earth.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:01.290
Anybody from Europe
here recognize this?

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.940
What?

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.350
Who said that?

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.710
Yes, Sean, exactly correct,
that's the Caspian Sea.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.750
It's bordered by five countries.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:19.670
But look at the massive,
massive algal growth

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.410
from this satellite picture.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:26.030
Here's the Volga River, Europe's
longest river, pouring into it.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:29.250
It's a 2,000 mile long river.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:33.870
Here's a new word for
you, eutrophication.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:37.220
It's from the Greek
meaning well nourished.

00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:45.410
So how much phosphorus
is acceptable?

00:22:45.410 --> 00:22:48.530
The EPA came out in 2000--

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:50.930
that was almost 20 years ago--

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.760
and said 0.0238
milligrams per liter.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.230
Well, we know today that
if you have anything

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:09.530
greater than or equal to
0.016 milligrams per liter,

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:15.260
you're going to have
really a large algal growth

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:18.890
proliferating in your water.

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:23.590
Now, these concentrations
of phosphorus, they're low.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.890
And it's going to be
challenging to measure those.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:29.150
This is what we're going to do.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.390
The other thing that
makes it challenging

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:38.690
is phosphates are colorless.

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:41.630
So how are we going to
use UV vis to measure

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.040
these concentrations?

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:47.890
Anybody have an idea?

00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:58.480
Yes?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.240
Maybe we can react
them with something

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.090
that will make them colorful?

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:05.340
Maybe we can react
them with something

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.570
that can make them colorful.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.040
Very good.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:09.000
Very good.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.220
Yeah, I like that.

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.650
Keisha, right?

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:14.865
AUDIENCE: Gizelle.

00:24:14.865 --> 00:24:15.740
JOHN DOLHUN: Gizelle.

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.270
I'm sorry, Gizelle.

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.810
Where's Keisha?

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:19.670
There she is.

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:20.960
OK.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.540
All right, so react
them with something

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:26.180
that makes it colorful.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:30.410
So here comes chemistry
to the rescue, right?

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.280
So phosphates are very reactive.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.560
So we can actually take river
water and this method here,

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.590
this is the ammonium
metavanadate method.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:48.320
When I tried to develop this
Charles River water testing,

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.660
I started with this
method because it

00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:54.440
was written up as the
method to detect phosphorus

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.000
in river water.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.860
So you would take
the river water,

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:01.850
mix it with molybdate,
ammonium metavanadate,

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:07.340
and you create this color
heteropoly molybdic acid

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.250
that has a yellow color
and it absorbs light

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:14.240
at 400 nanometers.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.160
What I found is that this
method was not sensitive enough

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.980
to actually measure
the phosphorus

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:25.130
levels in the Charles River.

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:28.700
It's a great method for
measuring phosphorus in sewage,

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:30.560
but not the rivers.

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.690
So I looked around
and I found what's

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:38.120
called the ascorbic acid method,
an EPA-approved method where

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:43.340
you actually took
river water, mixed it

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.210
with molybdate,
sulfuric acid, and you

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:53.090
create this heteropoly molybdic
acid, which is colorless.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:59.090
But the good thing is this
heteropoly molybdate anion

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:03.260
can accept electrons
and be reduced down

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.620
and ascorbic acid can
cause that reduction.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:11.600
And you end up getting this
molybdenum blue complex,

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.810
a mixed valence complex
that absorbs light

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.630
at 880 nanometers.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:22.450
So this is great because
the concentration

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.450
of the phosphorus
in the complexes

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.340
is proportional
to the absorbance

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.620
of the light in these things.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.060
So this is what you're
actually making.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.020
It's beautiful.

00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:36.970
This is a Keggin structure.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:41.770
It captures the phosphorus in
the center, surrounded by 12

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:45.790
molybdenums and 40 oxygens.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:49.360
I want you to take a
moment and look at this.

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.120
And I'd like you all to
close your eyes for a moment

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.490
and think about this image.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:55.390
Close your eyes.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.770
OK, open your eyes, please.

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:09.010
I want you to carry
this image with you

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:13.690
into the lab when you
do this experiment.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:17.280
You're actually going to be
making this in your beakers

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.330
when you add the color
developer to your water samples.

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:26.310
You're creating this in about
15 minutes in your beaker.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:28.695
This is inorganic
chemistry at its best.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:36.410
Now, I want to spend the next
several slides showing you

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.080
how we're going to
actually measure

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.080
the concentrations of this.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.240
So we're going to be shining
electromagnetic energy

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.710
on a sample.

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:52.640
And if you look at
the visible light

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.020
here that I broke out of this
electromagnetic spectrum,

00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:01.100
on the red end of
this, we're going

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.760
to be looking at our
samples on that far red end

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:07.010
in the near IR.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.720
So that's where
you're going to be--

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.670
where you're going to
be taking your readings.

00:28:10.670 --> 00:28:15.585
Now, what can happen when you
shine radiation on your sample?

00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:16.085
Anyone?

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.655
Yes, Kim.

00:28:20.655 --> 00:28:24.904
AUDIENCE: Photobleaching

00:28:24.904 --> 00:28:25.696
JOHN DOLHUN: Sorry?

00:28:25.696 --> 00:28:28.080
AUDIENCE: Some of your sample
could get photobleached.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.840
JOHN DOLHUN: Some of your sample
could get photobleached, yeah.

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.020
That's a possibility.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.910
What else?

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.410
Yes?

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:39.679
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.480
JOHN DOLHUN: Exactly.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:46.600
I mean, electrons
could get chewed up

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.490
to a higher energy levels.

00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.190
Little nuclei could see
that happen and get nervous

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:53.320
and start to
rearrange themselves.

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.980
And the molecule, as Kelly said,
could burst into vibration.

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:06.030
And your UV is
actually monitoring

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:08.850
all of those electronic
transmissions

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:12.570
that we can't see with our eye.

00:29:12.570 --> 00:29:17.980
And what the UV does is it draws
you a smooth curve through all

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:21.400
of those electronic transitions
and you end up somewhere

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.550
with your lambda max.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.390
What UV vis is,
a good definition

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:31.810
is it's just the interaction
of light with matter

00:29:31.810 --> 00:29:33.991
as a function of wavelength.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:39.820
So here's your UV cuvette.

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:43.040
Here's the radiation
hitting that cuvette.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.640
What happens?

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.583
What do you see up
there happening?

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.070
Yes, Ryan?

00:29:58.855 --> 00:30:00.070
Yeah, the lights focused.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.945
And what's happening
to the sample?

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.300
I'm sure it's heating up, yeah.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.570
Yes, Autumn?

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.300
AUDIENCE: It absorbs sunlight
and transmits sunlight and also

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:17.800
re-emits.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.190
JOHN DOLHUN: Yeah, good.

00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:22.920
So some of the
light's going through

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:24.930
and some's getting absorbed.

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.790
So let's look at
that for a minute.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:31.920
So we've got absorbance
minus the log

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.180
of the transmitted light,
which is i over i0.

00:30:38.895 --> 00:30:45.660
Now, absorbance
is-- we're actually

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:47.070
monitoring the absorbance.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.440
We're not monitoring
the transmittance

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.840
because absorbance
is actually directly

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:57.220
proportional to
concentration by Beer's law.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.600
So we have this relationship.

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.260
And E, the extinction
coefficient,

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.440
is the molar
absorptivity constant,

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.840
is simply the amount of
light absorbed per unit

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.140
concentration of your sample.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.840
Let me just rewrite this.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.500
Let me get rid of the logarithm.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.060
I want to show you
something here.

00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:26.040
So I'm going to rewrite this.

00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:41.470
Let's actually
graph the intensity

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:45.180
of the incoming radiation here.

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:56.090
We're going to graph that as
a function of concentration.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:02.740
If you do that, you're going
to see from that equation

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.820
that the transmitted light
decreases exponentially

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.940
as the concentration increases.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:14.110
I want you to keep that
in the back of your mind.

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.450
This equation fascinated me.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.480
I like Beer's law.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.030
What this tells you, this
extinction coefficient

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:25.610
tells you, that it
has to be a constant.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.970
So if you cut your
concentration in half,

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:30.710
absorption should
be cut in half.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:32.390
So I wanted to prove this.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:35.590
So I went out and I
made this compound,

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.230
hexacyanoferrate(III).

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.830
And I made up five
solutions of this,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:45.440
and then I measured the
absorbance of each solution.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.120
It absorbed light
at 420 nanometers.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:53.505
And if you look here, 10
times e to the minus 4,

00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:58.600
if I cut that in half to 5
times e to the minus 4, indeed,

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:02.900
the absorption gets cut
in half as it should.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:07.690
So I graph this, got
a nice, straight line.

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:10.840
The change in absorption over
the change in concentration

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:11.980
is my slope.

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:17.770
And it's 1,056.7 so that's
my extinction coefficient.

00:33:17.770 --> 00:33:21.610
And this worked really well.

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:24.670
But I want to caution you--

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:30.640
if you try this, and
you're graphing absorption

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.510
versus concentration, and
you're doing Beer's law,

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:36.820
you've got this
nice, straight line,

00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:40.180
you might end up with
something like this,

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.600
where Beer's law falls apart.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:47.690
And it all comes
back to this here--

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.790
the intensity of the
transmitted light

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:53.190
decreases exponentially
with concentration.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.930
So eventually, if the
concentration is too high

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.400
your sample becomes
saturated, and you're not

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.310
going to be-- this
Beer's law falls apart.

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.530
I just want you to
be aware of that.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:10.310
What I did is I made up all of
my concentrations are very low.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:13.920
Beer's law worked fine.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:21.350
So now we're going to get
to some serious business.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:25.230
This is what you have to do
for this lab, for it to work.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.110
Otherwise, you will be a goner--

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.489
gonzo.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.719
You've got to clean
this glassware.

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:34.880
This is a list of the glassware
that you'll need to clean.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:38.630
And you've got to do it with
10% hydrochloric acid, triple

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:41.199
rinsed with Milli-Q Water.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.150
Why do you think
you need to do that?

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:48.949
Yes.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.580
AUDIENCE: Any contamination
might change the products

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:55.150
concentration.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.860
JOHN DOLHUN: Any
contamination is going

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.590
to just destroy the experiment.

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.740
It's kind of like
the Nano Building.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.260
You've seen them in there
with their bunny suits on.

00:35:05.260 --> 00:35:10.060
One speck of dust, even
a dander from your hair,

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.510
is like a wrecking
ball to the experiment.

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:18.760
Well, one speck of
phosphate from any detergent

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.920
is going to wreck
this experiment.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.340
So you've got to
judiciously sit down.

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:27.500
There'll be two of you-- you'll
be partnered up for this.

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.650
So you clean this up.

00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:33.310
And you'll do this on day two
after the dissolved oxygen

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:34.455
testing.

00:35:34.455 --> 00:35:35.830
This is what you're
going to need

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.860
for day three for the
phosphate testing.

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:42.070
So you can leave this
glassware in the top drawer

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.570
above your locker.

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:45.070
It's not locked.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.020
And it'll be nice
and ready for when

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:50.570
you come in to do the testing.

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:55.490
So this is what you
have to do in this lab.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.780
First of all, we need to
make up a set of standards

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.670
that we can
interpolate our river

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:04.960
samples against to find the
concentrations of the phosphate

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.260
and phosphorus.

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.710
So you're going to make
seven standards up.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:13.240
And you're going to be
using a stock solution.

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.820
And the formula to use
in all these tables

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.900
is you're going to use
this M1V1 equals M2V2.

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:37.260
So if you have a 10 to the
minus 1/3 molar stock solution,

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:45.810
and you're taking 1 milliliter
of it out, out of the bottle,

00:36:45.810 --> 00:36:48.255
how much molarity
do you want to make

00:36:48.255 --> 00:36:53.850
to make up 100 mil solution?

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.130
You'll be diluting
this 1 mil to 100,

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.400
and you'll see that your
x is 10 to the minus 5.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.470
That's your stock
solution of phosphate

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.140
that you're going to create.

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:09.300
So you just use that
formula for all these.

00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.640
You're taking this
much out of your 10

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.220
to the minus 5 molar
stock solution,

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.800
and you're diluting
it up to 10 mils.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:19.230
What's my concentration?

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.730
Perfect.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:22.590
What you'll do is you'll
come into the lab,

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.170
and the TAs will go
through this with you.

00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:27.990
You'll make up your
stock solutions.

00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:31.410
And then you'll go to the
river to get your water.

00:37:31.410 --> 00:37:36.690
And when you bring the
water back to the lab,

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:38.260
there'll be two of you.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.070
So one of you will
go over to the hoods

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:43.320
and get the color developer.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.190
And these are the four
chemicals that we talked about

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.930
in the color developer--

00:37:48.930 --> 00:37:54.150
the ammonium molybdate,
sulfuric acid, ascorbic acid,

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:56.910
potassium antimonyl-tartrate.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:38:01.080
Potassium antimonyl-tartrate
is there to actually speed up

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:05.190
the reduction that's going
on with ascorbic acid.

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.110
That's important.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.460
If I didn't mention that before,
that's the purpose of that.

00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.830
The ammonium molybdate,
sulfuric acid,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:16.380
you're creating that
Keggin structure,

00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:20.460
that heteropoly,
colorless, molybdic acid.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.520
You also have to take this
color developer in the order

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.050
that it's written here.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.230
It'll be set up in
burettes in the hood.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.620
If you, for example,
take it in a wrong order,

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.170
you could have a side
reaction, and not

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:39.280
get the color developer that
you want to put in your sample.

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.540
So it's important.

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.860
So one of you will go to the
hood, get the color developer.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.910
The other one will go to the
river water you brought back,

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:51.210
use a clean pipette,
10 mL pipette,

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.095
and pipette five beakers
with river water, five

00:38:55.095 --> 00:38:56.790
10-mL beakers.

00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:02.790
So you'll end up with 12-- seven
standards and five samples.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.920
And then you add
the color developer,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:10.240
and you wait 20 minutes,
and you're ready to go.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:15.450
Just a couple other precautions
that you should take--

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:18.020
we're going to be
using 4-mL cuvettes.

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.290
These are big inside.

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:22.410
Don't use the 1 and
1/2 mL cuvettes.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.940
The other thing is all these
cuvettes have a fill line.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:30.000
It becomes frosted at one point.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.900
And you want to stop pouring
when you get to that line.

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.490
You're going to
take your beakers,

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:37.620
and you're going to
swirl them gently.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:39.720
And you're going to
pour them by hand

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.760
until you reach the fill line.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.410
Don't go beyond that.

00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:48.090
Also, all of these UV cuvettes
have an arrow on one side.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.220
You want to be sure
that the arrow is

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:53.580
in the light beam when you
put these cuvettes in the UV

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.960
spectrometer.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.960
A lot of people
have made mistakes,

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.710
put them in the wrong
way, and then you're

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.080
not going to get
very good readings.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.880
So the arrow's clear to see.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.790
What I usually do is
arrange all my cuvettes

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.770
in a box ahead of time.

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.590
And then I pour my samples
and put them in the box,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:12.970
and I know the arrow's
in the right place.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.780
And when I go to the UV, I just
lift them up and put them in.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:23.160
Also, keep in mind what
Dr. Sarah Hewett told you

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:27.120
the other day that there's two
kinds of pipettes in the lab.

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.910
This one is a blowout pipette.

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.480
You've got to blow it all
out to get your 10 mLs.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.660
This one is a to
deliver pipette.

00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.430
You only go up to
that last line.

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.750
You don't blow the tip in,
otherwise you put too much--

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.560
going to wreck your experiment.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.860
So make sure you look at
the pipettes carefully.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.910
So you're going to get your
graph here, a nice graph.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:55.610
And what you're
going to do is you're

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.250
going to interpolate
now your river

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.760
absorbances against the
curve so you can read off

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.050
the concentrations.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:19.330
So the concentrations in
that graph are in micromolar.

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:21.760
So you're going to want
to take those and convert

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.440
them to milligrams per liter.

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.230
So you want to
convert this first

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:31.780
to a molarity, moles per liter.

00:41:34.930 --> 00:41:44.740
Then you take that, and you want
to go down to grams per liter,

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.440
and then finally
milligrams per liter.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.550
So you're going to be
calculating two things.

00:41:54.550 --> 00:42:02.110
You want to calculate the
phosphate concentration in ppm,

00:42:02.110 --> 00:42:04.510
which is milligrams per
liter, and the phosphorus

00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:06.050
concentration.

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:10.630
So you'll take your mass
from the curve in milligrams

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:16.090
per liter, and take it times
the ratio for phosphate of PO4

00:42:16.090 --> 00:42:18.040
over KH2PO4.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.770
And that ratio is 0.70.

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:23.680
And then for phosphorus,
do the same thing.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.410
The ratio there is 0.23.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.380
And this is the most
important part of this lab--

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:32.290
this is the whole
thing, calculating

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:35.140
these concentrations in the end.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:39.650
So it's important to
know how to do that.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:42.070
So once you get
your concentrations,

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:45.550
you've got a series of
things to go through here

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:48.190
for your data analysis.

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:52.210
There's no error propagation
on this part of the lab, which

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.680
is good for you.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:57.370
You will have to use
the LINEST equation

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:01.570
that Sarah talked about,
which is pretty easy to use.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.750
And that'll help you calculate
the errors of your slope

00:43:04.750 --> 00:43:07.070
intercept and y values.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:10.120
And then you find your
average and standard deviation

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.080
of the five measurements,
calculate the 95% confidence

00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:15.520
interval.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.460
Most importantly, report
the final concentration

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.980
of P and PO4.

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:26.260
Make sure all these results
show up in your abstract.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.570
First thing I do when
I get lab reports is I

00:43:28.570 --> 00:43:29.920
look at the abstract.

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:35.890
I want to see a line
that shows my results.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:39.670
And they also should
appear in your conclusion,

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.970
and then you can discuss them
in your discussion of your lab

00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:44.470
report.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.390
So any questions about this?

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:55.320
I know you're going to have
a busy weekend because you're

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:58.980
going to be working on your
ferrocene lab, your first lab

00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.360
report.

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:02.340
And I want to tell
you that please,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.370
feel free to reach
out to me or Sarah

00:44:05.370 --> 00:44:07.680
if you have any questions.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.930
I'm going to be here tomorrow.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.620
I probably will be here
Saturday and Sunday.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.290
So if there's a last
minute question,

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:20.910
just send me an email, and
I'm happy to invite you in,

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.240
and we can answer your question.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.400
I should be here in the
afternoon, probably,

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:29.190
on Saturday and Sunday.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:39.510
Now, I'd like to end the lecture
today by doing a demonstration.

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:41.080
Actually, did I turn that off?

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:42.930
I can show you this here.

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:47.100
I'm going to do this
Briggs-Rauscher reaction.

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:54.300
Actually, we're going to
make this iodomalonic acid.

00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.480
We're going to actually attach
an iodine to malonic acid.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.120
We're going to create
this in a beaker.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:01.980
The reason I'm showing
you this reaction

00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:06.720
is because it has everything
in it, including starch.

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.000
And it has a lot of colors.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
And these colors are
things that we're

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:16.140
going to talk about in the
next lecture, what starch does

00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.290
and how it works.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:21.540
And this is kind of
a preview to that.

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:23.160
This reaction that
you're going to see

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.410
was actually discovered by two
high school chemistry teachers.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:31.860
They're Briggs and Rauscher
from Galileo High School,

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.680
my favorite city, San Francisco.

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:39.370
So these guys came up with
this back in, I think, 1973.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:43.290
They published a paper in the
Journal of Chemical Education.

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:48.690
And they had every scientist
in the country puzzled.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:50.940
And it took about
10 years to work out

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.130
all the and sundry
reactions that

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.140
are going on in this reaction.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:00.300
So I'm going to put on
some safety glasses.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:07.400
And what I'm going
to be doing is

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.270
going to be mixing three
colorless solutions in here.

00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:14.280
This is my first one.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:17.580
And I'm going to use
kitchen chemistry, which

00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.668
means I'm kind of looking
at that scale over there

00:46:20.668 --> 00:46:21.960
and I'm going to pour these in.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.820
So let's put a little more.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.050
That's colorless, right?

00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:40.485
OK, next colorless solution.

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.780
That's about right.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:02.120
And the final colorless
solution-- keep your eye on it.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.530
Oh my goodness, wow.

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:15.940
It wasn't supposed to do that.

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:24.690
What?

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:25.590
Are you kidding me?

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:33.440
What's going on here?

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:38.450
Get your clock out.

00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:40.120
This is a clock reaction.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:41.630
You can keep time with this.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.770
So I'll give you a little hint.

00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:00.940
There iodide in there, I minus.

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.550
And I minus is colorless.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:15.580
There is iodine in there,
and iodine is amber.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:27.520
When they're both
present, it's blue-black.

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.610
And we're going to see why
that is in the next lecture.

00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:40.180
So there's a lot of
reactions going on in there.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:45.640
When these reactants react,
they form hypoiodous acid.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:50.890
And sometimes, the
hypoiodous acid actually

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:54.170
oxidizes iodide to iodine.

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:56.720
So you've got collarless
going to amber.

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.650
But sometimes, there's so
much hypoiodous acid formed,

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:02.520
you can't handle everything.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:05.690
And what happens is you
have a little bit of I

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:08.300
minus and I2 present
at the same time.

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:09.957
And you get blue-black.

00:49:09.957 --> 00:49:11.540
This is kind of the
color you're going

00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:13.250
to get when you
do your titrations

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.710
and you add the
starch, because there

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:19.670
is starch present in this.

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:21.950
So I'm going to
leave you with that.

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:26.000
And I'll see some of
you up in the lab.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.170
Yes, you have a question.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.630
JOHN DOLHUN: She just asked
me if this will ever stop.

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:35.470
Can someone--
Hannah wants to know

00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.520
if this is going to ever stop.

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:43.050
Who can tell me, anyone?

00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:43.550
Aisha?

00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:46.175
AUDIENCE: I feel like it won't,
because it's not releasing gas.

00:49:48.393 --> 00:49:50.810
JOHN DOLHUN: Aisha says it
probably won't because it's not

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:52.700
releasing gas.

00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:54.320
But in a minute, it's going to.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.080
Iodine vapor is going to
start pouring out of it,

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:00.470
and Tristan is going to carry
it up to the lab in a bucket

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.780
quickly.

00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:10.700
But in answer to Hannah's
question is, will this stop?

00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:12.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.180
JOHN DOLHUN: Limiting
reagent, right?

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.220
There's always a
limiting reagent.

00:50:17.220 --> 00:50:19.690
OK, see you.

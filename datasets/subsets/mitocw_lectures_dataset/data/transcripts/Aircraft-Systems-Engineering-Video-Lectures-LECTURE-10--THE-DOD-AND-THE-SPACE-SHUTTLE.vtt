WEBVTT

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.680
I'm going to do that.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.139
I encourage questions.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.710
I may not be able to answer all your questions
either because, A, I don't know or, B, I cannot

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.960
say.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.960
I am going to leave it to you to figure out
which one is which.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.949
[LAUGHTER] I would like to say a few things
before I start.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.130
One is I'm not a historian so I'm not here
to give a history of the military and the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.380
Shuttle.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.670
I am here to give you my experiences with
it which is a very select data slice, I think,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.530
as you will see.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.530
Second, the things I say here, although we're
going to tape them, I have to [NOISE OBSCURES]

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:45.160
very carefully.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.719
And, third, I really speak from a different
era.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.920
I speak from an area of the '70s and early
'80s when the political situation was a lot

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.219
different than it is today.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.289
When a Cold War was hot.

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.350
When there was a real threat of a massive
land war, plus worse, in Northern Europe.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.850
When there were real threats of nuclear exchanges
between the super powers.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.620
Things which are not true today, thank goodness.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.640
We have now been overcome by other threats
and challenges, but I speak really from an

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.579
era of the '70s and '80s.

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.110
So, with that, I would like to start.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.240
Again, I encourage questions.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.509
Here is what I would like to do today.

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.439
I would like to give you a little bit of intro
and background.

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.810
Talk about DoD and Air Force space missions.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.439
There is a difference which I shall highlight.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.539
I will talk about military system requirements
and impacts on the Space Shuttle as a system.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.770
I will talk about facility impacts because
that is easy to do, but there are impacts

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.658
that are far more far reaching than that.

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:49.399
I will close a little bit on national space
policy and then I will show you a ten minute

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.649
video.
For the video I would like Tom to turn off
the recording and we will just watch it kind

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.689
of in silence.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:57.789
OK.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.990
Any questions?

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.159
My background is I served 29 years in the
Air Force.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.729
As you folks know, you can retire up to 20,
so I couldn't count.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.939
I stayed far longer than I should have.

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.770
The reason I stayed was because the Air Force
gave me assignments I could not turn down.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.760
I have had lots of experience from a program
office payload user perspective on Shuttle,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.930
Titans off both coasts, MX, Pegasus XL.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.930
Last January I gave a talk, which I will repeat
this year, on my activities on two accident

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.390
investigations.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.280
One on Titan IV and one on Pegasus.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.239
I do that at one time.

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.140
It takes about an hour and a half.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.500
If any of you are on campus in January, please
come by.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.010
It's an interesting story.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.650
I served in multiple program offices in programs
A and B.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.190
Programs A and B are subsets of the NRO.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.129
I won't say any more about that, but Program
A is the Air Force element.

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:58.159
Program A not only built Air Force satellites
for the intelligence community, they also

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:00.980
provided all the launch services for the intelligence
community.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.769
I have been director of two major programs.

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.599
The first one Space-Based Infrared Low.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.080
The second one was the DoD Space Test Program.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.450
I have also been the NRO Director of Safety.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.959
In general, Air Force and DoD space missions
fall into this laundry list.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.959
The first one is Navigation which you know
from GPS Communication which has many satellites

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.220
of which Nelstar and DSCS are the ones you
recognize.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.799
DSCS was launched on the Space Shuttle I believe
twice, I'm not sure.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.540
Meteorology, the Air Force launches the DMSP
which is the polar orbiting weather satellite

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.980
now replaced now by the NPOESS system.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.980
For missile launch detection, the intelligence
community and the Air Force have either operated

00:03:54.099 --> 00:04:01.099
the DSP satellite system or else proposed
SVRS which is suffering tremendous programmatic

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.930
problems currently.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.180
For arms free verification, it is terribly
important to have complied at one time with

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.870
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] limitations.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.610
That is an interesting slice of history where
at one time the total number of warheads,

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.170
total number of bombers, submarines, ships,
this sort of thing was limited by international

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:26.370
agreement but it was the responsibility of
the other side to verify compliance.

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.390
There is also nuclear weapons test detection
on Vela.

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:36.390
And then a whole handful of what I call intelligence
community or IC programs.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.330
Bob Siemens, a retired professor emeritus
is planning to drop by today for the Q&A.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.730
His position, his role in this story is really
very central.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.190
His influence is woven throughout the whole
story of the DoD and the Space Shuttle, and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.650
I hope you will get a chance to talk to him.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.640
An extremely interesting and very pivotal
guy.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.380
I would like to concentrate on Vandenberg
Air Force Base right up on the Eastern Range

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.290
for the Space Shuttle because the Vandenberg
Air Force Base launch site was really built

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.480
up for sun synchronous polar orbits, for really
one payload, and that was the fellow here

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:21.540
depicted in the late 1970s, launching out
of the Western Range.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:24.360
This is a Titan IIID.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.070
I have helped launched, I think, eight of
these off the West Coast.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.380
This is a heavy lift machine.

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.690
It is roughly 30,000 pounds in low earth orbit,
27,000 to 30,000.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.090
It has two solid strap-ons.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.090
I saw the first one go in 1970 and subsequently
was able to transition into the Program Office

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.400
to launch several times out of there.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.780
As some of you are aware because I have talked
to you out of class, I served for many years

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.280
not in what we call the regular Air Force
but what is called the Office of Special Projects.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.659
It is called an Air Force Element.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:03.190
We did not report for the usual chain of command
through the Air Force chains.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:08.910
We went straight up to the secdef of the JCS.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:15.280
We were given the responsibility to launch
things quickly, quietly, with great national

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.300
pressure.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.180
And we did that.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.380
And the machines we used to launch, payloads
included, are Titans of various kinds, Atlases,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.940
as well as the Space Shuttle.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.120
The story I am going to tell you is really
the special projects utilization of the Shuttle.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.670
More so than what I call the regular Air Force
missions.

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.670
In any case, when I joined SAFSP in the late
1970s, life was really exciting.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:48.770
We were in the midst of phasing out all the
expendables for the Space Shuttle.

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.620
And when I went in there, I found within the
first week they said the Space Shuttle is

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.770
designed for our program, because we were
flying on a regular basis out of the Western

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.550
Range.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:04.100
So, the payload that sits inside here is a
form, fit and function drop-in in the Space

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.190
Shuttle bay.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.710
At the time, there were no Space Shuttle payloads
of that size yet on the drawing boards.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.630
The intent was to have a seamless transition
from Titans into Space Shuttle, first for

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.170
our program and then for others.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.930
We drove the payload bay size, as you've heard
from Professor Hoffman and Aaron Cohen, 15

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.050
x 60.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.330
The cross-range requirement dictated the configuration
of the vehicle plus the wing size because

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:35.010
the Air Force and the DoD was very, very insistent
on having a return to launch base capability.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:39.220
First orbit deploy, come back cross-range,
land back at Vandenberg, recycle, be ready

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.120
to go hopefully in a matter of days.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.570
It is interesting to note the evolution of
the Titan space launch family.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.360
In the 1970s we pick it up with the Titan
IIID we see here.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.940
The 3E was a Transtage version used for basically
out-of-space missions.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.740
This is a commercial version.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:04.740
But the DoD use went from the 34B, 3C, 34D
through this family here, and now we see the

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.900
4A and the 4B which are the heavy lift guys.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:15.620
These guys basically were the follow-on to
Shuttle.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.080
They lifted the Shuttle payloads that the
Shuttle could not carry.

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:23.030
And I will explain that in a few minutes.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:27.310
Very large, expensive, complex machines, complex
programs.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:33.338
At Vandenberg, it turns out that back in the
'60s there was a program called the Manned

00:08:33.338 --> 00:08:35.529
Orbiting Laboratory, MOL.

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:39.549
Many of the original Space Shuttle Mercury
astronauts were part of that.

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:45.250
They built up a space lodge complex up there
called Slick-6 to launch the MOL.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:50.060
It was going to be a space capsule with military
officers onboard to do recognizance and surveillance

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.400
flying off a rather large Titan IIIC.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.200
To do that, again, back in the '60s, they
built a launch pad.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.700
I'm sorry.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:02.330
As we got ready for the Shuttle, they took
the MOL things and did all these things to

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.930
it to make it shuttle-ized.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:05.440
They operated a launch pad.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.640
They put in a Mobile Service Tower.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:12.140
As you know, at the Cape, what they do is
kind embrace the Shuttle and its stack with

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:12.760
a gantry.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.510
And they pull back a little bit and then they
launch.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:20.580
The Mobile Service Tower is a large, almost
like a skyscraper complex that completely

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:26.820
encloses the rocket during processing and
then rolls back several hundred yards to expose

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:31.060
the vehicle for launch, a totally different
OPS concept.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:36.560
This facility here, the OMCF is similar to
the KSC Orbiter Processing Facility.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.000
Then they have other facilities here.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.400
The payload preparation room where the payloads
are received from transportation put together

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:43.440
and tested.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.910
The PCRs were the payloads actually put into
the shuttle bay.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:50.370
The Vandenberg runway was almost doubled in
length.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:54.140
And then all this infrastructure is put in
here, including crew quarters for the astronauts.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.360
And they were able to reuse the MOL facilities.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.440
A lot of [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:04.210
But what you see here is the buildup of a
complex very similar to Cape Kennedy only

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:05.580
on a California coast.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.650
Very, very elaborate, very, very complicated,
very expensive, and taking a tremendous amount

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:15.970
of budget to go do it.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:22.110
Back in the '70s by law or by policy, which
is perhaps even more powerful, the Space Shuttle

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.970
was going to be the only launch system for
all military, civil and commercial payloads.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:31.590
This is somewhat of a forgotten fact, but
at one time the cry went out from the advocates

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:37.440
that said by having a reusable spacecraft
that can launch 25, 30 times a year from both

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.360
coasts, so that is times two, we can do great
things.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:45.750
And certainly, coming from the folks that
gave us Apollo, this did not seem that farfetched.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:51.820
The idea of launching a spacecraft like an
airliner, as we know, did not happen in our

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.070
generation.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:56.710
I think in your generation, if you can make
that happen, that would be extremely wonderful.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:03.070
But at one time there was going to be a phase
out, a shutdown of all the launch vehicles.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:08.060
All the launch vehicle folks were told fly
out what you have, close up business, break

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.480
up your tool and dies, send your people home,
we are going to go with Shuttle.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.190
And to do that there was extensive redesign
of payloads to fit the payload bay, the width,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.570
the length, to fit the safety requirements.

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:22.590
All these things changed.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:27.980
So, it was not just a matter of just taking
your existing payloads for these guys and

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.440
dropping them into the shuttle payload bay.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.310
It was a huge engineering effort.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:36.860
And we thought at one time this is the way
it is going to be forever.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:42.150
The things that are unique about this is,
first of all, liftoff and flight loads are

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.440
much different because of not only the main
events, everything from the SRBs, the staging,

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.040
but also being able to survive safely, things
like slap down on landing if you had to come

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.440
back home with a payload.

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.750
Many of the heavy payloads require, as you
know, upper stages.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:04.500
The PAMs are the small payload assist module,
small [UNINTELLIGIBLE] upper stages.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.240
The IUSs, as you probably heard, are much,
much more elaborate solid fuel devices.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.500
The Shuttle Center, Cryo Center was going
to be a cryogenic upper stage that was going

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:17.430
to take our biggest payloads up to GEO.

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:22.840
That never got through the safety process
but they worked it hard.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:27.160
The safety requirements, to make sure that
the crew was not endangered at any time by

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:32.340
anything, either accidental or inadvertent
or a mishap, were huge.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.570
That is a whole separate discussion in itself,
which I will be glad to have with you, but

00:12:36.570 --> 00:12:42.800
basically everything was looked at in terms
of being dual fault tolerant so that in no

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:49.660
case could any two events link up to cause
hazard to the crew, even including accommodation

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.110
of hardware and software errors.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:59.110
This was huge and caused, in many cases, extensive
retests and redesign of payload systems.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:03.170
National Space Policy, back in the '70s and
'80s.

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:08.840
First of all, in '78 there was "strong endorsement
for the Space Shuttle to be the prime mover

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.010
for national security and civil missions".

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:13.730
What is missing from this lineup here?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.630
Commercial.

00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:19.360
There were very few, almost no commercial
missions at the time.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.470
Civil means NASA.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:26.500
The launch business of that time was dominated
by the government, NASA and the DoD.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:29.850
1982 the position was strengthened.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.890
And, by the way, I suggest if you haven't
already to look up these documents.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.500
National Space Policy is voiced in these documents.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.320
It is extremely powerful.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.750
It is the basis for programs.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:43.170
It is the basis for legislation.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.020
It is the basis for budgets.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:46.520
It is huge.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:52.060
Every word in these documents is worked over
at great length by all the competing stakeholders,

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.910
and it is big.

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:59.990
But in '82, SCS was going to be the primary
launch for national security in civil missions.

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:05.390
What that really meant was anybody else with
a rocket was told you're in the wrong list,

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.080
don't come back.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:08.910
Then we had Challenger.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.980
And in 1988 there was now a directive.

00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:18.570
A 1988 PD that said we shall have a mix between
man and unmanned launch systems.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:21.570
This is in contradiction to this I'm sure
as you notice.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:28.570
An NSPD4 in 1981 now gave us the words "assured
access to space." Code words.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:36.260
Anybody here care to tell me what that really
means in plain English, anybody?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:36.650
Yes.

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:41.720
Even if the Space Shuttle won't fly they want
to have some alternatives.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.500
That's right.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.610
It says don't put all your eggs in one basket.

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:51.080
Have two ways to get to space for your heavy
payloads.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:54.360
This is authorization for what we now know
as the EELV.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:15:01.360
But also at the time shortly after Challenger,
Pete Aldridge who was Secretary of the Air

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.180
Force at the time, now an executive of the
Aerospace Corporation, previously the director

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:14.420
of the NRO, prior to Challenger in the '84,
'85 time period started getting a little bit

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.860
antsy about access to space because of all
the delays in the Shuttle Launch Manifest.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:25.240
And so he authorized, on his own authority,
a start-up of the Titan fleet again.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.710
This led to huge problems with NASA because
what they saw that as, correctly, was a loss

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:35.210
of support for the Space Shuttle Program.

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:36.130
But he did that.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:42.990
And when the Challenger disaster occurred
in '86, the Air Force was about 18 to 24 months

00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:44.110
ahead of where they would have been.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.020
Here is Dr.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:45.320
Siemens.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:45.930
Hi, Bob?

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.540
Hi, Pete.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.360
You want to sit over here?

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.779
I would like to have you meet Dr.

00:15:50.779 --> 00:15:51.390
Bob Siemens.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.380
And he will be here for the Q&A afterwards.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:16:02.180
Bob, I'm just going over some of the National
Space Policy.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.940
Write-ups that kind of led to where we are
today.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:07.730
This was NSC37.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.380
This was NSC42, the primary launch.

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:14.850
This was the post-Challenger mix between the
manned and unmanned systems.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:21.850
And then this was the assured access to space
presidential declaration.

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.860
From a user perspective, the security requirements
to fly on Shuttle were huge.

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.880
What was required to be protected was any
information on the mission type and details.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.649
LEO, GEO, HEO, you name it, that could not
leak out.

00:16:38.649 --> 00:16:43.800
Any information on the spacecraft, who made
it, where it was supposed to go, of course

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.210
what the payload did had to be protected.

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:51.060
Also protected was the Program Office and
the prime contractors because often you can

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.339
tell from that who does what.

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:57.820
And during operations the deployment time
location and the final payload orbit had to

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:58.960
be protected.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.510
This is huge.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:04.398
As you know, thousands of people participate
in getting a mission together for the Shuttle.

00:17:04.398 --> 00:17:08.630
It starts with a mission planning template
that is roughly two to three years prior to

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.029
flight.

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:13.959
It goes all the way through preparation of
the flight plans, the mission rules, the launch

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:19.550
constraint documents, the processing, and
finally the on orbit ops.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.959
All that had to be protected.

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:22.740
And that was big.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.709
It was a huge and expensive philosophy.

00:17:25.709 --> 00:17:30.380
It was called the Control Mode Security System.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.190
It took a lot of effort from all parts and
was almost airtight.

00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:34.200
Yes, a question.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.570
Was this for every shuttle mission or just
DoD payloads?

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.640
No, this is for what I call the intelligence
community DoD missions.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.640
If you go back and look on the Shuttle Manifest,
and I am not going to do it for you but you

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:54.350
can do it if you want, you will see a number
of missions where they will say DoD mission

00:17:54.350 --> 00:18:01.120
payload type, not unknown, but not available,
NA.

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:07.470
Also, the DoD/Air Force missions were all
military astronauts.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:12.679
That is felt to be a safe thing to do.

00:18:12.679 --> 00:18:18.160
For implementation of encrypted voice data
and commanding links starting, really, with

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.720
the testing at the launch sites but also going
through the flight ops.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:27.890
I mention all these things having been involved
in the safety certifications.

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.290
I will say that was long and arduous.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:36.730
The safety review process has to be extremely,
extremely thorough starting early on.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.540
It is not just a whitewash of what the hardware
is that comes with the pad.

00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:48.330
In many cases, it changed the design of the
spacecraft, the design of its deployment systems

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:51.600
and things like that.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.410
To protect classified information there also
had to be need-to-know access to program details.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:02.090
This was a major, major set of impacts to
the Space Shuttle system and payload mission.

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:05.910
All these areas, which I can talk to you about
at great length afterwards.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:12.480
I will say, thought, that when I do get back
to JSC or when I talk to my NASA friends,

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.200
they all say they were proud to have been
on those missions.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.480
They were all hooked together on missions
of great national importance.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.910
To the best of my knowledge, security has
held tight over all those years, despite all

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.260
the people who were cleared of the programs.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.240
And the programs were extremely successful
as a result.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:29.700
Yes.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.270
You said all military crews.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.309
Does that mean active military or people who
have been transitioned to the regular astronaut

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:36.600
corp.

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:37.450
from the military?

00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:42.970
These are military folks who transitioned
to the astronaut corp., yes.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:47.000
There were also impacts of the Air Force Satellite
Communication Networks.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.890
As you know, these are the worldwide set of
tracking stations that were going to be replaced

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:52.809
by TDRS.

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:53.960
That is an interesting story.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.010
The selling point for TDRS was they would
shut down the AFSCNs which were getting old

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:58.960
and were very labor intensive.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:01.740
Well, we still have them both today.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:06.970
Worldwide network scattered around the world,
but to provide secure Shuttle communication

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:12.170
there had to be extensive upgrades because
working with the Shuttle with a complicated

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:17.470
payload in orbit, getting it initialized,
tested and deployed was something new for

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.340
the SCN.

00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:24.650
The SCN ordinarily just did space-to-ground
data transfers through orbiting satellites,

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:30.580
so to be working with a human crew and human
system, to have all the contingencies in place

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.740
was big.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.330
The SCNs were involved in the all the prelaunch
testing and commanding, health and status

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.910
checks, as well as all the deployment and
post-deployment payload communications.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.670
I wish I could show you the contingencies,
all the workarounds, the plan As, the plans

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:47.040
Bs required for a complicated mission.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:47.790
It is immense.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.880
It takes a long time to do it right.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:54.980
The point is that when you're ready to fly,
you should be ready for all know contingencies,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.910
even up to loss of communication, failure
of critical computer systems and that sort

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:00.160
of thing.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:06.160
You never want to fly and have to scratch
your head and say what should we do next?

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.870
Pre first flight issue was an STS1.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.620
Another MIT professor, Gene Covert who is
also here and someone you should really talk

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:18.179
to at some point in time, was part of our
panel that reviewed Space Shuttle main engine

00:21:18.179 --> 00:21:20.350
quality testing.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.880
And they were the folks that really came to
grips with this new and emerging issue called

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:24.760
turbine micro-cracks.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:31.760
The turbine blades in the SSME were found
to be developing very small cycle dependent

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:33.970
micro-cracks.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.690
The question came up what is the ultimate
failure mode?

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:39.820
How many cycles can they stand?

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:41.370
How good are they good for?

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:45.840
The original intent, as you know, was to be
able to re-fly the SSMEs with zero maintenance

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.940
between flights many times.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:49.299
That hasn't happened.

00:21:49.299 --> 00:21:54.030
But even the question of would it be good
even for one mission was a big, big question.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:22:00.110
And Gene, who is an extremely thorough manager
and engineer, a lot of common sense, a lot

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.980
of smarts, worked that very, very hard.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.220
There were also issues, of course, about thermal
tile loss.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.820
There were questions about whether those would
fall off.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:08.530
This is not ice now.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:09.520
This is thermal tiles.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.520
And, at the same time, there were huge costs
growing in the development of the IUS, the

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.420
Shuttle Centaur upper stage and also Vandenberg
facilities.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:23.929
Everything was either late and/or over cost.

00:22:23.929 --> 00:22:27.500
Many folks thought that the IUS would never
fly because the development problems were

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.880
so huge.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.270
The fact that it has flown as many times as
it has, on a variety of launch platforms,

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.360
is truly amazing from my sight.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:43.390
And we also saw, prior to first flight, several
delays, two and a half years is about right.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:45.179
And then more delays ensued.

00:22:45.179 --> 00:22:51.950
And so, from a user perspective, all these
delays really added up to lost opportunities,

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:57.040
extensive cost growth and things like that,
really a heartbreaking story.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.340
This is a picture of a Defense Satellite Program,
DSP.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:05.070
A machine lifting out of the shuttle bay.

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.790
I think you have seen this.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:11.250
This is the IUS turntable that rotates the
vehicle up and pushes it out with springs.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:16.929
This is a two-stage solid misconfiguration
that takes the beast out to geosynch.

00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:22.390
Post-Challenger, the space policy was changed.

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:27.100
The Shuttle was not to be used anymore for
lifting all satellites but only for mission

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.590
where human presence was required.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.470
But there was a problem.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:36.820
Because of the backup of missions, the SCS
had to fly out the existing DoD payloads.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.890
We looked very hard at converting them back
to the Titans.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:43.679
Since we were taking steps to shut down the
Titan line, the Titans weren't ready at that

00:23:43.679 --> 00:23:45.210
time.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:52.210
But what we saw afterwards was increased use
of, a restart, really, of these efforts, modernizations.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:57.230
And that was interesting because there was
always the chance the Shuttle could come back

00:23:57.230 --> 00:24:00.660
and launch, hopefully, 15, 20 times a year.

00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:03.490
And we hoped it would happen but it never
did.

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:08.460
Steven Dorfman from Hughes was here as a visiting
professor several years ago.

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:13.000
He was extremely bitter about the fact that,
from a satellite manufacturing point of view,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.990
he had to eat the cost to switch back to extendables
from Shuttle.

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.390
First he was told by National Space Policy,
"Thou shalt fly on Space Shuttle." Then he

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:27.950
was told, "You are now bared from flying that
Space Shuttle." A huge lost to him.

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:29.530
And I think Hughes is still contesting it.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.169
I don't think it will ever win that in court.

00:24:32.169 --> 00:24:37.919
And kind of most importantly, from a Central
California point of view, the Vandenberg shuttle

00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:40.679
facilities were shut down completely.

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:47.530
My DoD SCS mission involvement personally
was I worked on the very first DoD sponsored

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.880
mission STS4.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:55.880
It was Columbia launched in late June of '84
flown by Ken Mattingly and Hank Hartsfield.

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.910
This was a pathfinder for the DoD.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:06.790
It was a test not only of the security procedures
but also the ability to do launch operations,

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.130
orbital operations in a classified way.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:10.419
It came out truly successfully.

00:25:10.419 --> 00:25:11.980
We learned a lot.

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.309
It was not easy.

00:25:14.309 --> 00:25:19.080
Getting any complicated mission to fly on
the Shuttle is a very, very difficult process.

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.440
To do it under the cloak of security makes
it even harder.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.320
I was a primary DoD launch integrator, the
interface between the Program Office and the

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.360
Air Force, for two primary missions.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.820
I shadowed three others.

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.600
I was also member of the NASA DoD Safety Review
Team.

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.780
This was interesting.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:44.780
The Safety Review Team or SRT was a very small,
streamlined, fast-moving team that basically

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:47.900
reviewed and bought off on the payload.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:54.059
As opposed to having the figurative casts
of thousands, we had a cast of just a very

00:25:54.059 --> 00:25:57.679
small number of people both from the DoD and
the NASA side.

00:25:57.679 --> 00:26:01.940
And we moved as quickly as we could to get
these missions approved and bought off.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:08.630
And, lastly, in the mid '90s, I was a program
manager for the DoD space test program.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.320
STP is in existence today.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.990
Their charter is to be the sponsor for space
experiments with military relevant.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:20.840
They flew, among other things, the first atomic
clocks that led to GPS as we know it today.

00:26:20.840 --> 00:26:26.830
They continue to fly numerous secondary and
piggyback missions not just on Shuttle but

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:31.290
also on Ariens, Russian vehicles, Korean vehicles,
Indian vehicles.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:33.520
When I was the manager of the program it was
great.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.210
It was like you were running a big used car
lot and you were offering rides to everybody.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.140
It was terrific.

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:45.190
The emphasis here is to use excess launch
capacity to fly space experiments that you

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:47.480
would screen every year.

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:53.230
And then, on rare occasions, you would build
a dedicated satellite and launch vehicle about

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:57.650
every four years to launch the bigger satellites.

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:04.309
My summary is that the DoD had requirements
that really went back to the first years,

00:27:04.309 --> 00:27:06.510
the first days of the Shuttle Program.

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.580
They were extremely demanding and dramatically
affected the architecture of the Space Shuttle

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:12.150
system.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:17.650
The heartbreak, of course, as we know, is
that we never were able to achieve the launch

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.760
rates and the low recurring costs that were
promised.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:26.520
That really when we realized it was slipping
away, those were truly sad days.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:33.320
I don't think anyone ever anticipated the
one-time expenses and effort required to redesign

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.380
payloads.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.280
Not just for mechanical form-fit function
but also for safety.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:45.280
No one realized the extensive work required
to certify the payloads for manned operations.

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:51.210
The mission integration at the Cape was very
complicated, and security, as you can tell,

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.480
permeated everything.

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:59.480
And, lastly, the sad thing is that MOL and
SCS at Vandenberg all suffered from the curse

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:06.240
of Slick-6, which was that both programs were
cancelled despite millions of dollars put

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:10.830
into refurbishing the facilities.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:13.650
I have here a list of references.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.500
Heppenheimer's book "Development of the Space
Shuttle" I found was quite good.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.669
It talks a lot about the programmatics of
the Space Shuttle.

00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:21.100
I hope you've had a chance to read it.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.410
I took some information from here.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.510
The Federation of America Scientists, the
FAS site is interesting.

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:29.110
I think it is still current on the Space Shuttle.

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:34.350
And there are these books here which I point
you to give you a little bit more insight

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:40.030
into the missions, the roles of the intelligence
community doing things such as flying and

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:41.530
operating satellites in space.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:47.750
If there are any questions, I will be glad
to take them now and then I will show a short

00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:48.600
ten-minute video.

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.160
How am I doing on time?

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.440
I'm moving fast.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.289
Yes, question.

00:28:53.289 --> 00:28:56.280
How many times was the [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]?

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.690
Was it even used to launch the Shuttle?

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:03.640
Slick-6 never saw anything launched out of
there until they launched a Lockheed low-cost

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:08.539
machine called the Athena in about 1996.

00:29:08.539 --> 00:29:13.539
Presently, the Delta 4, remember the big machine
that flew out of the Cape about nine months

00:29:13.539 --> 00:29:18.820
ago, is stacked there at Slick-6 ready to
go with an operational payload.

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:23.760
They are having big concerns, though, about
fuselage so their launch date, which was going

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.010
to be last week, has been rolled off to the
right several months.

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:32.150
They had a problem on the first flight of
basically fuel cavitatation.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:34.380
And they are not happy with it yet.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.429
It is ready to go.

00:29:35.429 --> 00:29:41.690
When the Delta 4 launches out of Slick-6,
it will be the first large payload system

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.990
to go out of there for the first time.

00:29:44.990 --> 00:29:45.240
Question.
Yes.
I don't know if it is really fair, but in
hindsight, was it worth it for the military

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.990
to get onboard with the Shuttle from the military's
perspective?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.799
Well, if the promises had been kept it certainly
would have been worthwhile.

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:04.620
With the way things have turned out, was it
worth it?

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.820
We were kind of driven into it.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:10.990
Can you say was it worth it from a cost point
of view, from a schedule point of view?

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:11.890
The answer is no.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:18.890
I think from the perspective of having people
do extremely difficult tasks under very pressing

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:27.559
circumstances, it showed us what NASA and
the Air Force could do, although at a great

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:28.100
cost.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:34.169
It was certainly one of the more, I will say,
exciting times.

00:30:34.169 --> 00:30:37.190
It was one of the more exciting times for
NASA.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:38.190
Questions?

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.190
Yes.

00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:45.960
When you talked about safety certifying these
payloads, was it mainly an issue of the fuel

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.390
supplies for the payloads?

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:50.510
Well, I will just give you one example.

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:56.270
To get a payload into the bay and withstand
launch loads, you have to have very large

00:30:56.270 --> 00:31:01.870
structural members, steel rods, for example,
that had to take all of the launch loads and

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:06.330
not have the satellite break away inside the
payload bay in the worst case either during

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.909
liftoff or in the worst case on landing.

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:15.710
You could have as many as 18 to 24 steel bolts
that all had to be fractured simultaneously

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:19.630
within seconds by pyrotechnics to get them
out.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:24.270
You had to prove by analysis and by test that
you could have these simultaneous events for

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.030
which you could not have any redundancy.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:27.720
You just couldn't do it.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.070
These were must-work devices.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:35.659
As probably Professor Hoffman has told you,
on every Shuttle launch there is a large number

00:31:35.659 --> 00:31:39.260
of must-work category-one issues and items.

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:44.350
Like the bolts that free the external tank
from the vehicle, if those don't work you've

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.049
got a big problem.

00:31:46.049 --> 00:31:50.090
From a safety certification point of view
on the Shuttle, we had to make sure that in

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:57.090
no case could the payloads pose any hazard
to the crew under any circumstances, including

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:03.409
the ones that are the most farfetched such
as landing overseas in Spain or Morocco.

00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:09.289
But the things we were worried about was having
a payload hung up during deployment so the

00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:16.070
Shuttle couldn't return or a payload damaging
the Shuttle at any time and causing obviously

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:18.419
big problems there and things like that.

00:32:18.419 --> 00:32:22.640
Plus things such as propulsion systems accidentally
activating.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.990
Liquid solids, it didn't matter, all extremely
hazardous.

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:31.470
And we found out a lot, because it is one
thing to design a payload for launching an

00:32:31.470 --> 00:32:31.770
expendable.

00:32:31.770 --> 00:32:34.429
There are certain things that you can or should
not do.

00:32:34.429 --> 00:32:38.890
But when you go to a Shuttle context, we have
a lot of commanding going into the vehicle.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:45.890
Pre-flight, during assent and ops, it becomes
a much more tough a problem.

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:48.230
For example, I will just give one example.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:52.980
If you have a very complicated payload which
consists of a spacecraft bus, all the housekeeping

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:58.460
and the payload front-end which may have all
kinds of hazards associated with it like antenna

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:04.049
booms that come out on command, how do you
verify final configuration before you liftoff?

00:33:04.049 --> 00:33:10.230
How do you know every system is in the state
that you think it is?

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.940
How do you verify that?

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:12.990
That is very hard.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.490
Because you can go in there with test equipment,
but test equipment has subtleties all its

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.990
own.

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.480
OK.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.980
Questions?

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:24.980
Do you think it would be possible to do the
one orbit and return to base type mission?

00:33:27.900 --> 00:33:31.240
It sounds very difficult to do.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:33.490
It is not that hard.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.280
First orbit deploys were not easy but they
were done.

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.669
Coming back, I think the big problem is that
it really forces the timelines.

00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:47.360
Because, as you know, to do a de-orbit burn
and return to earth, it requires quite a bit

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.549
of mission planning, real-time updates to
verify you're on the right track, plus making

00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:55.360
sure that you have everything right so when
you do the de-boost you're going to be within

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:56.030
your corridors.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:01.539
To the best of my knowledge, NASA has never
done a first orbit return.

00:34:01.539 --> 00:34:02.750
And I don't think they would want to.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:07.809
It's very stressing because in 90 minutes
you have to not only get the spacecraft out,

00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:12.989
but then the vehicle re-safed and buttoned
up and planned out to land back either at

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:16.049
the primary or an alternate landing site.

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:19.139
That's a lot of work to do in 90 minutes.

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:20.518
Any other questions?

00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:20.978
Yes.

00:34:20.978 --> 00:34:27.978
Is there any way to give a ballpark figure
of how many DoD payloads can be put in space

00:34:29.478 --> 00:34:30.339
by the Shuttle?

00:34:30.339 --> 00:34:30.719
Ten or hundreds?

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:31.379
Oh, not, it's not hundreds.

00:34:31.379 --> 00:34:35.498
The NASA Manifest is published.

00:34:35.498 --> 00:34:39.849
From what they call a regular Air Force site,
they launched a whole series of communication

00:34:39.849 --> 00:34:42.168
satellites, DSCS, DSP.

00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:48.339
In fact, the very last DSP satellites are
still Shuttle compatible and could be launched

00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:49.779
if there was a problem with the Titans.

00:34:49.779 --> 00:34:53.569
They are up there in storage in Southern California.

00:34:53.569 --> 00:34:57.349
And then there are a fairly large number of
what are called Intelligence Community Missions

00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:58.869
that are flown.

00:34:58.869 --> 00:35:04.690
And all the manifest will say is that these
were just DoD missions.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:06.170
Let's see.

00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:13.170
What I would like to do is ask Tom to shut
off the videotape and I will give you a little

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:17.200
introduction to my video which I hope will
run.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.529
We are ready to start her, folks.

00:35:23.529 --> 00:35:29.410
Bob Siemens is really a very pivotal person,
not only in the Space Shuttle story, but also

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.009
in the Apollo Program, which he can probably
talk to you at a separate time.

00:35:33.009 --> 00:35:36.150
But I think he will like to spend ten or fifteen
minutes talking about his role in the Space

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:37.680
Shuttle story.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.660
OK.

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:40.180
Here we go.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:44.410
I'm just wondering where to go to get comfortable.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:48.359
Can we turn that off?

00:35:48.359 --> 00:35:49.940
We cannot.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:51.519
All right.

00:35:51.519 --> 00:35:54.989
I would just like to get comfortable here.

00:35:54.989 --> 00:36:01.989
You know, as Pete said -- First of all, I
thought that was a great summary of actually

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:09.979
a very difficult subject to discuss.

00:36:09.979 --> 00:36:16.249
Let me just take you back, first of all, to
the early '60s.

00:36:16.249 --> 00:36:23.249
I know that is going awful far back, but that
was when I joined NASA as a general manager.

00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:29.940
And, before we knew it, we had gone from a
billion dollar a year operation with the Mercury

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:36.940
Program to a situation where we were given
the assignment of putting men on the moon.

00:36:37.099 --> 00:36:44.099
And that was a gigantic shift in our responsibility.

00:36:44.119 --> 00:36:51.119
And in all of the planning and the discussions
and so on, and we did work very closely with

00:36:54.759 --> 00:37:01.690
the Department of Defense, the Department
of Defense had all kinds of assets that were

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:04.880
going to be required in the Space Program.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.819
The Navy, for example, to pick up the astronauts.

00:37:07.819 --> 00:37:14.819
One example, a major example most people never
heard of, was we had to construct very large

00:37:16.339 --> 00:37:17.460
facilities.

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:23.289
The most famous and obvious is the Vertical
Assembly Building and the large facility down

00:37:23.289 --> 00:37:24.420
at the Cape.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:29.569
You just saw the Shuttle taking off from that
facility.

00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:35.769
And, in operating down there at the Cape,
there already was Cape Canaveral.

00:37:35.769 --> 00:37:40.849
And there was not room for what we were going
to do to fit on Cape Canaveral.

00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:46.190
We looked at seven different world sites and
finally decided to camp on Merritt Island

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:53.190
which is just across the river from Cape Canaveral
because, again, the Department of Defense

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:58.710
had all kinds of facilities down there with
a tracking range and so on.

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:03.219
But the biggest support that we got was in
the building of those facilities.

00:38:03.219 --> 00:38:10.219
There was absolutely no confidence in NASA
to build the largest structure in the world,

00:38:12.729 --> 00:38:18.410
the VAB, or many other facilities for assembly
and for tests and so on.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:22.680
The Corp of Engineers was a major part of
the operation.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:29.680
I am bringing this out because we had to figure
out how far we were going to go with our launch

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.219
vehicles on a shared basis.

00:38:35.219 --> 00:38:42.219
This is before anybody thought of a manned
shuttle that would carry stuff up and stick

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.869
it into orbit.

00:38:45.869 --> 00:38:52.869
But we put together a planning organization
that actually operated for over a year's time.

00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:02.380
A fellow named Golivan for NASA, a fellow
named Cavanaugh for the Department of Defense

00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:04.869
put this together.

00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:09.130
One of the big emphases was the use of the
Titan.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:15.809
The Titan was coming along to the point where
we thought that the earliest version would

00:39:15.809 --> 00:39:19.589
be suitable for the Mercury Program.

00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:26.589
And, at that time, in 1961, we were thinking
that Mercury only weighed 3,000 pounds.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.249
You could put one man in it.

00:39:30.249 --> 00:39:32.279
You couldn't do much with it.

00:39:32.279 --> 00:39:38.599
But if we could, in effect, just enlarge it
and have a more powerful vehicle, an Atlas,

00:39:38.599 --> 00:39:45.599
namely the Titan, we could really have a vehicle
that would have some capability to run through

00:39:47.739 --> 00:39:52.789
a lot of the orbital operation and so on that
we're going to ultimately be required for

00:39:52.789 --> 00:39:54.630
going to the moon.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:40:01.630
And out of that came the planning for the
Titan III, the Titan IV and vehicles that

00:40:04.339 --> 00:40:11.339
proved right off the bat, and over time, they
still are very important to our defense capability.

00:40:13.749 --> 00:40:17.339
Well, I don't think that is quite true.

00:40:17.339 --> 00:40:23.969
I don't think we are using any of those assets
today within NASA.

00:40:23.969 --> 00:40:30.969
And if you then go forward in time, in 1968,
I have been down there in NASA for 7.5 years.

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:37.329
I planned to go down for two.

00:40:37.329 --> 00:40:38.190
I came back.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:45.190
MIT was nice enough to invite me back, and
I came back right here as a Hunsaker professor.

00:40:45.799 --> 00:40:52.799
To my very great amazement, I got a call one
day from somebody I had never met, a man named

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.209
Mel Laird.

00:40:56.209 --> 00:41:03.209
I just barely knew that he had been designated
by Nixon to be the next Secretary of Defense.

00:41:05.009 --> 00:41:07.999
He said are you going to be down here in Washington
the next day or two?

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:13.880
As a matter of fact, I was because I was going
to go down the next day to get on a plan and

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:20.880
fly down and see the launch of Apollo 8 which
was going to fly around the moon.

00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:23.700
And he said come on for lunch.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:29.119
That is when he asked if I would be the willing
to be the Secretary of the Air Force.

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:31.079
I told him that was absolutely impossible.

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:33.410
We just moved our family back here.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:36.539
My wife is in the hospital, which she was.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:38.239
But he was very persistent.

00:41:38.239 --> 00:41:45.239
And after about ten days I agreed to go back
down in the government, but that is a long

00:41:45.529 --> 00:41:50.569
story you don't want to hear the details of
getting my wife well and getting a house and

00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:53.160
all that stuff.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.569
One thing that I inherited right off the bat
was the Manned Orbital Laboratory.

00:41:57.569 --> 00:42:04.569
And, even then, it was clearly in some jeopardy.

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:10.529
When programs start getting a ceiling built
in where they say we're going to keep it going

00:42:10.529 --> 00:42:16.549
but it is going to be kept going at a level
of, and I forget what the level was for MOL,

00:42:16.549 --> 00:42:22.890
something like $500 million or something like
that.

00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:28.609
Because any large program over time there
is always opposition to it and there is more

00:42:28.609 --> 00:42:34.069
time for it to be shot down and ultimately
eliminated.

00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:41.069
I realize that it was in deep trouble when
I was over in the Bureau of the Budget talking

00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:48.420
to a junior member of the Bureau of the Budget
and he said I hope you realize that the Shuttle

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:55.420
is in deep trouble from a standpoint of support
here in the White House.

00:42:55.559 --> 00:43:02.299
And so I went back to Mel Laird and said,
look, one thing I want to do is to have one

00:43:02.299 --> 00:43:09.299
shot with the President to be sure he fully
understands what the capability of the MOL

00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:10.269
will be.

00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:14.749
It was far along.

00:43:14.749 --> 00:43:21.749
Lots of expense had gone into it, including
major facility construction out of Vandenberg.

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:27.079
I had my day in court.

00:43:27.079 --> 00:43:28.890
It was a sunny afternoon.

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:34.190
I got General Stewart, who was very involved
in the MOL, to join me and Mel Laird.

00:43:34.190 --> 00:43:34.890
And we went over there.

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:40.420
It was just Kissinger and the President.

00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:46.390
And I had a few simple-minded charts that
showed what we were going to do from a resolution

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:53.390
standpoint if we kept going with the MOL and
what that would mean in terms of understanding

00:43:54.509 --> 00:44:01.509
more clearly what was going on in a given
situation.

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:03.700
I had my half-hour in court.

00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:08.029
I could see a band outside getting ready to
play so I knew that the President was about

00:44:08.029 --> 00:44:12.469
to be rushed out for some kind of a ceremony.

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:13.650
That was a Saturday.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.450
Monday morning I got a call from Kissinger.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:21.729
And he said Bob, and I cannot really imitate
his German accent, that was a very, very fine

00:44:21.729 --> 00:44:22.849
presentation.

00:44:22.849 --> 00:44:28.959
And a day later I found out that MOL was cancelled.

00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:31.359
That was with President Nixon.

00:44:31.359 --> 00:44:32.339
He sat there the whole time.

00:44:32.339 --> 00:44:37.529
He had a yellow foolscap and took prodigious
notes of everything I was saying, which was

00:44:37.529 --> 00:44:43.059
sort of nerve-racking, the President of the
United States bothering with what I am saying.

00:44:43.059 --> 00:44:50.059
Anyway, that was sort of where I came from,
from the MOL.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:59.140
The next step along the way was after Apollo,
what was going to happen in space?

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:06.440
There were to be eight launches of the Apollo
Lunar Program.

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:11.019
Nixon cut that back to two sort of arbitrarily.

00:45:11.019 --> 00:45:15.140
And there were no plans for using those assets.

00:45:15.140 --> 00:45:19.869
Jim Webb was my boss in NASA.

00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:22.930
And I used to see him.

00:45:22.930 --> 00:45:25.739
He was very, very ill the latter part of his
life.

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:29.849
And I would drop by.

00:45:29.849 --> 00:45:36.749
And he would ask me strange questions like
what do you plan to do with your life before

00:45:36.749 --> 00:45:39.479
you kick the bucket kind of questions like
that.

00:45:39.479 --> 00:45:41.869
And he said I haven't got long to live.

00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:44.589
And I would say you're doing fine, Jim.

00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:49.950
And I am just going to work along and see
what I can do to help out here and there.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:56.950
Anyway, his big thrust was we felt we were
building a major capability for the country

00:45:57.380 --> 00:46:01.390
and now it is all being washed away.

00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:08.390
And what is going to replace it?

00:46:11.029 --> 00:46:15.609
The Shuttle came up as an option.

00:46:15.609 --> 00:46:22.609
Actually, to say on the surface, it makes
an awful lot of sense to recover something.

00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:30.569
We could easily visualize a transportation
system for the country where every time a

00:46:35.599 --> 00:46:40.489
747 went across the country with a payload
everybody jumped out and then you threw it

00:46:40.489 --> 00:46:41.509
in the ocean.

00:46:41.509 --> 00:46:43.809
It didn't seem to make much sense.

00:46:43.809 --> 00:46:48.209
You just knew it had to be more efficient
to reuse something.

00:46:48.209 --> 00:46:52.279
Although, with Gemini, we had looked into
that possibility.

00:46:52.279 --> 00:46:56.650
We were recovering the Gemini's, why didn't
we use them again?

00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:03.650
And we found that we are going to have to
put probably 75% of the original cost into

00:47:04.109 --> 00:47:06.440
reactivating the Gemini's.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:11.680
So, actually, I had a hunch that it wasn't
going to be quite as simple as landing an

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:18.459
airplane and then taking off again.

00:47:18.459 --> 00:47:22.430
The Air Force was going to be one of the prime
users of the Shuttle.

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:29.430
And the question was how large did the bomb
bay -- Not the bomb bay.

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:36.839
[LAUGHTER] How large did the experimental
bay have to be for the missions that were

00:47:36.949 --> 00:47:38.599
going to be carried out?

00:47:38.599 --> 00:47:44.359
There was no thought, let me just quickly
say, of putting armament aboard the Shuttle.

00:47:44.359 --> 00:47:47.999
I misspoke.

00:47:47.999 --> 00:47:54.999
And then one of the questions was how rapidly
did you have to recover it if something happened

00:47:57.289 --> 00:48:04.130
and you wanted to bring something back in
a hurry?

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:11.130
And to bring it back you had to make up a
co-planer change, and that was going to take

00:48:12.749 --> 00:48:18.009
a certain amount of energy, to put it mildly.

00:48:18.009 --> 00:48:21.219
Anyway, those are many of the issues.

00:48:21.219 --> 00:48:27.759
And I think, as I remember it, my friends
in NASA thought the Air Force was being pretty

00:48:27.759 --> 00:48:31.180
tough on them.

00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:37.400
But if we were going to accept the use of
a vehicle, in all seriousness, as you've just

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:44.400
heard, it had to have ability to carry out
the missions.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.319
And so that was sort of the next step along
the way.

00:48:48.319 --> 00:48:55.319
And then, after I got through in the government,
I ended up some years later out at Aerospace

00:48:57.509 --> 00:49:00.640
and ended up as the chairman of the corporation.

00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.829
And they worked closely with that element
in the Air Force that was so much involved

00:49:05.829 --> 00:49:11.930
in these type programs that you've just been
hearing about.

00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:18.930
And we were beginning to go into shock, at
least
those in the nucleus who were sort of running

00:49:27.949 --> 00:49:29.489
the aerospace.

00:49:29.489 --> 00:49:32.739
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] and myself.

00:49:32.739 --> 00:49:37.920
More and more it appeared that we were going
to not be allowed to put anything in space

00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:40.579
except through the Shuttle.

00:49:40.579 --> 00:49:41.999
And that seemed to be imminently wrong.

00:49:41.999 --> 00:49:46.019
To think that you're going to have to risk
the life of astronauts every time you wanted

00:49:46.019 --> 00:49:49.150
to put any kind of a satellite in orbit.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:56.150
From the standpoint of a paperclip individual
who is looking at cost, to just have the one

00:49:58.729 --> 00:50:05.729
vehicle and use it and use it and use it and
thereby supposedly cutting the cost, had a

00:50:06.529 --> 00:50:09.499
lot of charm.

00:50:09.499 --> 00:50:16.499
And it reached the point where he and I decided
we had to try to do something about it.

00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:26.479
And we made an appointment with the then Secretary
of the Air Force and said you've just going

00:50:26.479 --> 00:50:33.479
to be stashing away Titan somewhere so that
if we run into trouble with the Shuttle we

00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:41.109
are going to be able to move over and put
these very important payloads into orbit.

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:47.829
And then they had the Challenger accident.

00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:54.829
At that point this, I think, major fallacy
in policy was changed back where it should

00:50:57.479 --> 00:50:59.479
have been.

00:50:59.479 --> 00:51:02.719
You just shouldn't rely on a single vehicle.

00:51:02.719 --> 00:51:05.359
And that is my introduction.

00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:06.119
Yes.

00:51:06.119 --> 00:51:11.969
You wanted reusability, but some people also
didn't want to risk the lives of astronauts.

00:51:11.969 --> 00:51:17.180
Why not make a reusable unmanned vehicle?

00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:23.130
That's a very good question.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:25.019
Why couldn't we do it?

00:51:25.019 --> 00:51:31.559
That might be a good design challenge for
you guys here in this class to investigate

00:51:31.559 --> 00:51:34.359
that possibility.

00:51:34.359 --> 00:51:36.949
Unmanned.

00:51:36.949 --> 00:51:43.949
We've gone partway in that direction by, say,
recovering the Shuttle casings, obviously

00:51:48.759 --> 00:51:50.589
the Shuttle itself.

00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:57.589
But, trying to recover at least elements of
the unmanned launch vehicles, I'm not prepared

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:04.670
to really give you a definitive answer on
that.

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:07.579
That's a good question and we will talk about
it later.

00:52:07.579 --> 00:52:07.849
Yes.

00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:14.849
Before the Shuttle concept was finalized and
military requirements were finalized for the

00:52:24.599 --> 00:52:31.599
Shuttle, the military had been launching their
satellites and their missions using Titan's

00:52:31.739 --> 00:52:33.390
and Atlas's, correct?

00:52:33.390 --> 00:52:39.539
So why this requirement of the Shuttle having
to be able to bring back a satellite using

00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:44.959
really a military satellite when that wasn't
being done or required beforehand?

00:52:44.959 --> 00:52:47.259
Like why was that created?

00:52:47.259 --> 00:52:50.009
What was so special about it?

00:52:50.009 --> 00:52:57.009
We worked very hard on proposals to bring
back satellites that were out of fuel or needed

00:52:58.009 --> 00:53:02.509
refurbishment, but when I was referring to
landing with the Shuttle with payloads in

00:53:02.509 --> 00:53:04.279
the bay that is for a failed mission.

00:53:04.279 --> 00:53:06.869
And for some reason the payload could not
get ejected.

00:53:06.869 --> 00:53:11.819
You still had to be able to land back what
was now a very heavy spacecraft and glide

00:53:11.819 --> 00:53:13.459
on it and land safely.

00:53:13.459 --> 00:53:16.660
That turns out to be a really hard thing to
do, especially if you're carrying solids and

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:22.959
liquids onboard that were close to being ready
to ignite, so to speak.

00:53:22.959 --> 00:53:25.009
But there is talk of retrieving satellites.

00:53:25.009 --> 00:53:30.749
And, as you know, NASA did bring back some
small satellites, the Palapa one from Hughes.

00:53:30.749 --> 00:53:33.799
And also did a lot of very innovative repairs
in space.

00:53:33.799 --> 00:53:37.920
But when we looked at it from a customer point
of view, it turns out there is a lot that

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.630
wears out in satellites, not just using a
propellant.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:47.630
But the processors degrade due to radiation,
solar panels degrade just due to micro dust

00:53:47.819 --> 00:53:48.989
and things like that.

00:53:48.989 --> 00:53:54.640
And so bringing back a satellite for reuse
was never felt, at the time we looked at it,

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:56.219
to be a worthwhile thing to do.

00:53:56.219 --> 00:54:01.160
And that ties in directly with what I was
saying about recovering a Gemini.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:07.880
And, of course, on top of that with a Gemini
is the fact you are landing them in the water

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.140
so they got a good dousing of salt.

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:19.140
And so the degradation of the Gemini's were
such that we just didn't think it made any

00:54:22.289 --> 00:54:25.779
sense to try to refurbish them.

00:54:25.779 --> 00:54:26.880
Yes.

00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:33.880
The military was only really looking to capture
and service in space, then release, not necessarily

00:54:34.359 --> 00:54:36.359
capture and bring back?

00:54:36.359 --> 00:54:39.699
They never seriously went after the capture
and refurbish and release.

00:54:39.699 --> 00:54:43.839
They really went after launch and deployment.

00:54:43.839 --> 00:54:48.880
But I would say that in that theme the most
successful story actually of refurbishment

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.699
is the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:54:50.699 --> 00:54:52.299
And not for the reasons that you think of.

00:54:52.299 --> 00:54:55.719
When you think about stories of the Hubble
Space Telescope you hear about Jeff Hoffman

00:54:55.719 --> 00:54:59.199
going up there and changing processors and
fixing the optics.

00:54:59.199 --> 00:55:05.239
Also on those missions they replaced solar
panels that were causing huge problems due

00:55:05.239 --> 00:55:09.650
to thermal warpage and shrinkage and what
they call oil canning due to thermal stresses.

00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:16.160
And so the replacement of those solar panels,
which turned out to be not very good as initially

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.559
designed, is one of the really true success
stories of man in space.

00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:26.729
And there is actually a very nice video which
maybe you have seen of the lady astronaut

00:55:26.729 --> 00:55:33.599
who did the replacement of the solar panels
on Hubble pushing out and releasing the solar

00:55:33.599 --> 00:55:35.150
panels.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:39.329
Things fly away in the sunshine looking like
giant butterfly wings reflecting all the colors

00:55:39.329 --> 00:55:40.880
and then finally fall into the atmosphere.

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:44.119
It is almost poetic, I tell you.

00:55:44.119 --> 00:55:45.239
It's amazing.

00:55:45.239 --> 00:55:52.239
On the Hubble, one of the considerations right
from the beginning was that it should be a

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.199
serviceable satellite.

00:55:57.199 --> 00:56:03.809
It was designed so that you could get inside
of it relatively easily and so on.

00:56:03.809 --> 00:56:09.939
Frankly, I don't know of any other satellite
that was really designed quite that way.

00:56:09.939 --> 00:56:11.930
Maybe I'm wrong.

00:56:11.930 --> 00:56:14.589
I believe you're right.

00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:15.249
Yes.

00:56:15.249 --> 00:56:20.249
On the solar panel, it wasn't designed to
replace the panel.

00:56:20.249 --> 00:56:27.249
But you can go back to SkyLab, which was the
next to last launching of the Apollo.

00:56:29.859 --> 00:56:35.640
On that one, I guess, we decided to take what
was the third stage of a Saturn and just gut

00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:42.640
it, not have any propulsion in it and fit
it out to be a spacecraft, namely a space

00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:45.099
station.

00:56:45.099 --> 00:56:51.019
And, when they got up there, the solar panels
got fouled up.

00:56:51.019 --> 00:56:57.749
And one of the real tricks when the astronauts
first got to it because it was not launched

00:56:57.749 --> 00:57:04.749
manned was to unravel some wires that got
caught on it so actually the panels could

00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:10.329
spread out and it could start to operate again.

00:57:10.329 --> 00:57:17.029
Colonial Siemens, I don't know if either of
you would know, but what are the duties involved

00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:23.069
in like the heavy payload aspect of the new
CEV project?

00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:26.900
Delta 4 going out of Vandenberg was carrying
classified payload.

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:29.079
It's not a dummy either.

00:57:29.079 --> 00:57:30.400
It is real.

00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:35.219
They have standing requirements for these
types of things.

00:57:35.219 --> 00:57:37.069
The national needs go on.

00:57:37.069 --> 00:57:40.739
The international stage, as we know, is filled
with new actors and new threats.

00:57:40.739 --> 00:57:46.130
We have what is called unsymmetrical warfare,
things that are hard to counter by conventional

00:57:46.130 --> 00:57:47.359
means.

00:57:47.359 --> 00:57:51.209
Back in the '70s and '80s we had symmetrical
warfare, submarines versus submarines, missiles

00:57:51.209 --> 00:57:51.969
versus missiles.

00:57:51.969 --> 00:57:54.660
Now, as we know, it is much harder, much tougher,
but the needs are still there.

00:57:54.660 --> 00:57:59.969
But is the collaboration between NASA and
the military still pretty active?

00:57:59.969 --> 00:58:01.439
It is not in terms of payloads.

00:58:01.439 --> 00:58:07.059
It is there in exchange of technologies, things
like development of more efficient sensors,

00:58:07.059 --> 00:58:08.569
processors, that sort of thing.

00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:12.660
It is everybody's benefit, for example, to
have more powerful, faster, rad-hard space

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:13.269
processors.

00:58:13.269 --> 00:58:17.579
Everybody wins in that type of situation.

00:58:17.579 --> 00:58:19.739
Back to your question on reusability.

00:58:19.739 --> 00:58:24.349
You will notice that one of the real strong
pluses or the calling cards of the Space Shuttle

00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:28.199
Program was the fact that it was a reusable
launch vehicle.

00:58:28.199 --> 00:58:33.279
In this current environment of the CEVs and
new launch vehicles, what do you hear today

00:58:33.279 --> 00:58:34.999
about reusable launch vehicles?

00:58:34.999 --> 00:58:35.559
Nothing.

00:58:35.559 --> 00:58:42.099
Isn't it amazing how things have changed just
in a matter of 25 years?

00:58:42.099 --> 00:58:46.759
One thing I just sort of forgot to mention
with regard to the Manned Orbital Laboratory.

00:58:46.759 --> 00:58:53.759
It was thought, at that time, that by having
men there and their ability to inspect a fairly

00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:03.170
wide swath that they would have time in flying
over that swath to do some searching.

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:10.170
And could do a better job of detecting possible
items of tremendous interest from a military

00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:15.729
standpoint than trying to do it all automatically.

00:59:15.729 --> 00:59:22.729
And, of course, what finally washed out that
argument was the ability to have satellites

00:59:25.079 --> 00:59:30.529
that had almost instantaneous transmission
of information back home.

00:59:30.529 --> 00:59:37.529
What was the design for the MOL for crew transportation?

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:45.079
They were going to take off on a Titan, they
were going to aboard a Gemini, and they were

00:59:46.189 --> 00:59:53.189
going to have a laboratory of sorts which
would have the necessary reconnaissance and

00:59:55.289 --> 00:59:56.180
other equipment aboard.

00:59:56.180 --> 01:00:03.180
So it was similar to SkyLab in that you had
a non-reusable capsule as the crew transfer?

01:00:04.410 --> 01:00:09.359
It had a Gemini type return vehicle, but it
was definitely going to be very small and

01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:10.369
cramped compared to Shuttle.

01:00:10.369 --> 01:00:15.969
There was no thought of having another Gemini
come up and make use of it.

01:00:15.969 --> 01:00:16.719
Yes.

01:00:16.719 --> 01:00:23.719
Why did Gemini, Apollo and Mercury all land
on water, because that is very expensive,

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.089
and the Russians landed on land?

01:00:31.089 --> 01:00:31.339
Well, very simple.
If you take a look at where the launch sites
were for the Soviets, if they aborted they

01:00:36.799 --> 01:00:43.119
had to have the capability of coming down
on land, any kind of abort mission.

01:00:43.119 --> 01:00:50.119
Similarly, operating out of the Cape Canaveral
area, if you abort, you have to come down

01:00:50.699 --> 01:00:51.849
on the water.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:56.369
The question was then was it worthwhile to
have the capability of doing both?

01:00:56.369 --> 01:00:58.019
Well, that just added weight.

01:00:58.019 --> 01:01:01.559
And so we stuck with the water and they stuck
with the land.

01:01:01.559 --> 01:01:08.559
Do any of the new defense payloads require
human intervention in their deployment or

01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:15.199
are they all completely [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?

01:01:15.199 --> 01:01:18.739
They are all Titan IV EELV compatible.

01:01:18.739 --> 01:01:20.180
Anything else?

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:24.479
I think we wore everybody out.

01:01:24.479 --> 01:01:30.199
Well, you know, Bob and I will stick around,
but we're not going to hold you down here

01:01:30.199 --> 01:01:31.839
if there are no questions.

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.779
I guess we will call the class.

01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:36.499
And we will stick around if anybody wants
to ask any more detailed questions or have

01:01:36.499 --> 01:01:36.900
follow-ups.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.150
My phone number and email is up there.

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:42.549
I will be glad to talk to any of you one-on-one
about any of this.

01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:45.979
There is quite a lot more detail we can provide,
either Bob or myself.

01:01:45.979 --> 01:01:50.819
And, if I have to, I will write Bob a note
asking for further information.

01:01:50.819 --> 01:01:51.579
OK?

01:01:51.579 --> 01:01:53.400
Well, thanks a lot.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:53.690
[APPLAUSE]

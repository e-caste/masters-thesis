BOGDAN FEDELES: Hello
and welcome to 5.07

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.630
Biochemistry online.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.750
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.220
This video is about pyridoxal
5 phosphate, or PLP,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.440
an essential metabolism cofactor
derived from vitamin B6.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.230
All animals are
auxotrophic for PLP,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.900
meaning they need to supplement
their diet with vitamin B6

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.180
in order to survive.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.780
PLP is one of the most
ancient cofactors,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.820
and surprisingly,
it can catalyze

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.390
chemical transformation,
such as a transamination

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.970
even without an enzyme.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.120
PLP is actually involved
in a staggering number

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.730
of biochemical transformations.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.080
This video summarizes the most
important reactions involving

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.620
PLP that you will see
in 5.07, and will also

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.110
show you how to write
the complete curved arrow

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.420
mechanisms for these
transformations.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.010
Let's talk about
PLP-catalyzed reactions.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.590
As we just mentioned,
PLP is the cofactor

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.640
derived from vitamin B6.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.340
This cofactor is very important
for a number of reactions.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.340
In this course, we're
going to look particularly

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.020
at the transamination reaction.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.980
This is a crucial reaction for
the metabolism of all amino

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.660
the acids, and we're also going
to encounter this reaction when

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.960
we replenish the intermediates
in the TCA cycle, what

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.280
we call anaplerotic reactions.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.090
And we're also going to see
PLP involved in reactions

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.240
in the malate-aspartate
shuttle that transfers redox

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.010
equivalents,
reducing equivalents,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.470
between mitochondria
and cytosol.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.070
Let's take a look at the
structure of vitamin B6, also

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.990
known as pyridoxine.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.540
This is the molecule that
we ingest when we get

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.030
our daily vitamin supplement.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.270
Now in the body, this
gets oxidized to form

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.940
intermediate called pyridoxal.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.540
Notice the aldehyde
group here, which

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.530
is going to be the business
end of the molecule.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.560
Now, the active co-factor, PLP--

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.820
it's actually the phosphorylated
version of pyridoxal.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.340
This requires one
molecule of ATP

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.650
and the enzyme pyridoxal kinase.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.530
And we get PLP, or
pyridoxal 5 phosphate.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.360
The name PLP comes from the
initials as outlined here.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.540
Now, this nitrogen
on the pyridine ring

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.010
tends to be protonated
because it's pKa,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.410
it's close to physiological
pH, between 6 and 7.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.440
Now, for the rest
of this presentation

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.120
we're going to be abbreviating
this phosphate group as such,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.640
and throughout the course.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.570
Now, a related molecule is
pyridoxamine 5 phosphate,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.160
which we'll see,
it's an intermediate

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.870
in the mechanism of
PLP-catalyzed reactions.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.490
Also known as PMP.

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.590
Now, notice the PMP
has an amine group here

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.670
which replaces the aldehydic
group, which is the business

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.950
end of the molecule.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.460
Now, in all reactions
with PLP, this co-factor

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.960
is actually covalently bound
to the enzyme that uses it.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.790
Typically, there's a lysine in
the active site of the enzyme.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.060
As you remember, lysine
has an amine group,

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.490
and this can form a Schiff
base with the aldehyde.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.280
The reaction proceeds
in two steps.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.890
First, we form a
tetrahedral intermediate.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.100
As such.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.800
And then, we form
the Schiff's base.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.360
So this will be the
enzyme-bound PLP.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.400
And this is where all the
PLP-catalyzed reactions start.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.830
Let's take a closer look at
the transamination reaction.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.140
Transamination reaction
occurs between an amino acid

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.510
and an alpha keto acid.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.680
We have here amino acid 1, where
we highlighted the amine group,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.440
and alpha keto acid 2.

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.190
As you can see, there's a keto
group next to the carboxyl.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.380
Now, in a transamination
reaction catalyzed by PLP,

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.070
the amine group moves
from the amino acid

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.570
to the keto carbon of
the alpha keto acid.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.510
And we obtain a new alpha keto
acid, and a new amino acid.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.870
So in effect, the PLP-catalyzed
transamination reaction

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.300
facilitates the transfer
of the amine group

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.660
from an amino acid to
an alpha keto acid.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.850
Now, this reaction actually
occurs in two steps.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.820
In the first step, the amino
acid transfers the group

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.140
to the co-factor itself.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.130
So if you remember from
the previous slide,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:00.260
the PMP contains an amino
group, and that will actually

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.760
contain this amino
group that was

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.560
taken from the amino acid 1.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.330
Now in the second step, the PMP
will transfer its amino group

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.990
to a different alpha keto acid
to generate a new amino acid.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.400
Now, there are
enzymes for virtually

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.950
every single amino acid
that can accomplish

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.220
this first transformation,
where by using PLP,

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.350
to transfer the amine group
and form an alpha keto

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.574
acid and PMP.

00:06:33.574 --> 00:06:35.240
Now, in the second
part of the reaction,

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.040
however, the alpha keto acid
2 is typically alpha keto

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:42.050
gluterate or oxaloacetate.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.550
So in this case, not any
alpha keto acid can function.

00:06:49.262 --> 00:06:53.430
Alpha keto gluterate
or oxaloacetate.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.920
Now, let's take a
look at an example.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.990
For example, glutamate.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.900
It's going to be our amino acid.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:10.320
And oxaloacetate is going
to be our alpha keto acid.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.290
And in a PLP-catalyzed
transformation,

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.760
we will obtain the alpha
keto acid corresponding

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:18.540
to glutamate,
which is alpha keto

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.500
glutarate, and the amino acid
corresponding to oxaloacetate,

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.990
which is aspartate.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.480
This enzyme that catalyzes
this transformation

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.790
is in fact ubiquitous,
and it's found

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:42.690
both in the liver and the
muscles, and it is in fact a--

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.250
we can call it, depending
and the product,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:52.640
we can call it aspartate,
transaminase or glutamate

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.440
oxaloacetate transaminase.

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.960
In fact, if we find
this in the bloodstream,

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.280
this enzyme acts as a biomarker.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.080
And it tells us
about some damage

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:08.340
that might have occurred
in muscle or liver, which

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.460
forced the cells to
spill out their contents.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:15.780
This biomarker is--
you'll often see as SGOT--

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.910
serum glutamate
oxaloacetate transaminase.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:24.170
And this is just one
of the biomarkers that

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.900
are measured in blood tests
that tells us about heart

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.420
disease or liver disease.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.700
Let's take a look at the
mechanism of the transamination

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:35.795
reaction.

00:08:35.795 --> 00:08:37.669
And in particular, we're
going to take a look

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.280
at part one, which as
we discussed before,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:46.450
the amino acid reacts with
PLP to form an alpha keto

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.340
acid and PNP.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:09:00.210
Here is our co-factor
PLP, covalently bound

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:04.220
to the lysine in the active side
of the enzyme via a Schiff's

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.940
base.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.395
And here is our amino
acid starting material.

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:17.340
So in the first step, the lysine
that forms the Schiff base

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:19.680
with the co-factor is
going to be replaced

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.250
by the amine functionality
of the amino acid,

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.520
and it will form a new Schiff
base with the co-factor.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:36.460
This starts with the amine group
attack on the pyridoxal carbon

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.400
to form a tetrahedral
intermediate.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.730
And following an
additional proton transfer,

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:52.920
the lysine can be kicked off
to form the new Schiff base.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:05.170
So far, we have started with
the Schiff's base corresponding

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:10.150
to the PLP bound to
the enzyme and we now

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:14.650
obtain a co-factor
forming a Schiff base

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.170
with the incoming amino acid 1.

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.640
So this portion of the mechanism
is called transamination,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.070
because we're starting
with one amine

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:26.680
and we're forming
a different amine.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.960
Now, let's take a look
at the alpha proton

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.790
attached to the
alpha carbon, which

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:33.770
we're going to highlight here.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:39.320
This proton is now in between
two carbonyl-like groups.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.370
Here is the carboxyl group and
here is the Schiff base group.

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:46.580
So it becomes acidic
enough that it

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.030
can be removed by an active
side base, for example

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.200
the lysine in the active site.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:54.950
This will generate a
carbanium alpha carbon.

00:11:00.351 --> 00:11:03.580
This carbanium can
only form because it

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.710
is resonance stabilized.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.650
And indeed, the
PLP link system--

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:13.610
it's highly conjugated, and
it's a good electron sink.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:15.980
For this carbanium,
we can write,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.235
in fact, many different
resonance structures.

00:11:18.235 --> 00:11:19.610
Let's take a look
at one of them.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.366
This symbol denotes
resonance structures.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.350
Notice in this structure
that the positive charge

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.200
on the pyrodine
nitrogen is now gone,

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:48.190
and highlights the fact that
this is a good electron sink.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:52.060
And the ring now looks
more like a quinone.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.520
That's why we call this
a quinoid structure,

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.401
or intermediate.

00:11:56.401 --> 00:12:00.550
This quinoid structure shows us
a glimpse into how the reaction

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:03.730
will proceed, because the
alpha carbon now-- it's

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.730
doubly bonded to a
nitrogen, which anticipates

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:11.200
how this alpha carbon
will become a keto group

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.390
and a product of the reaction
will be an alpha keto acid.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:17.250
What happens?

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.420
The quinoid structure
can be re-protonated,

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.830
but at a different place.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:25.780
For example, on the aldehydic
carbon of pyridoxal.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:29.850
To highlight that these facts--

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:34.285
these structures are in
fact resonance structures,

00:12:34.285 --> 00:12:35.785
we're going to put
them in brackets.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.020
So let's take a look
at what happened

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.180
in this past couple of steps.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.390
So we had an alpha proton
that was fairly acidic,

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.720
it was able to be removed
by the active site lysine.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.960
And then this proton came
back to a different position.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.340
So all that's happened
in just a couple of steps

00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:07.600
was a proton transfer.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.980
Now, looking at
this intermediate,

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:14.110
we can see that in fact the
Schiff's base or the imine

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:19.810
of the PMP form of the co-factor
and the alpha keto acid

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.090
corresponding to amino acid 1.

00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:27.680
So via a hydrolysis reaction,
these two can come apart.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.910
So in the first step, an
activated water molecule

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:37.631
attacks alpha carbon, forming
a tetrahedral intermediate.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:48.950
And one more proton
transfer and we're

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.480
going to kick off
the pyridoxamine form

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.110
of the co-factor.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:09.060
And notice we obtain PMP
and the alpha keto acid

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:13.390
corresponding to
the amino acid 1.

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.800
This last step is, in fact,
just a hydrolysis reaction

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.660
of a Schiff base.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.470
Now, let's take a look at
the second part of the PLP

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.340
transamination reaction.

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.830
The part one left us off
with formation of PMP.

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:37.280
So in this second part, PMP
will react with a new alpha keto

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:45.670
acid to regenerate PLP
and a new amino acid.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:48.020
In fact, this part
of the mechanism--

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:52.420
it's the exact
reverse of part one.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:57.290
Here is PMP and our
alpha keto acid.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.590
In the first step,
we're going to form--

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:04.570
as we've gotten used so far--

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.616
to a new imine between the
keto group of alpha keto acid

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:09.740
and the amine group of PLP.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.056
As usual, first we're going to
get a tetrahedral intermediate.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:29.300
And one more proton
transfer, and we can kick off

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.670
the OH group to form the imine.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.960
Now, this portion
of the reaction

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.090
is, in fact, imine
formation, which

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:52.880
is the reverse of the hydrolysis
step that we saw in part one.

00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:01.100
Now, as you remember, there
is an active site lysine which

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.800
can act as a general base.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:13.730
And it's going to de-protonate
one of these two protons

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:15.930
on the pyridoxal ring.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.830
The reason that we can
form this carbanion

00:16:30.830 --> 00:16:33.290
here is because
this negative charge

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:38.430
is delocalized throughout
the entire ring system.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.381
And let's show one important
resonance structure.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.590
Which is none other than
the quinoid structure

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:57.790
we saw before.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:17:00.450
Just as before, the
protonated lysine

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:03.110
can now donate proton
on a different position.

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:06.920
For example, the alpha carbon
of the alpha keto acid.

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:28.480
As you can see
here, now the proton

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.970
is on the alpha position.

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.480
And now where this
starts to look more

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:38.410
like the Schiff's base
formed by an amino acid

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.940
with the PLP version
of the co-factor.

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:47.080
So from here on
onwards, we're just

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:50.028
going to substitute the PLP--

00:17:50.028 --> 00:17:52.170
the amino acid
bound to the PLP--

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:56.320
with the active site lysine
in the transimination reaction

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.650
that we saw before.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:14.950
So first, the lysine
can attack this carbon,

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.506
forming a tetrahedral
intermediate.

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:25.980
And then, following
some proton transfer,

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:30.240
we can kick off the amino acid
and generate the Schiff's base

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.840
corresponding to the PLP
co-factor bound to the enzyme.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.620
So here we have
PLP, enzyme bound,

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.680
and the new amino acid 2.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.370
We mentioned PLP is a
very versatile co-factor,

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.350
so let's take a look
what other reactions

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.360
besides transamination
can PLP catalyze.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:07.600
One interesting reaction,
used especially by bacteria,

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.980
is a racemization.

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:19.820
This involves taking an L amino
acid, for example L alanine,

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.900
and converting it via a
PLP-catalyzed reaction to D

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.832
alanine.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.880
This is an important
reaction for bacteria,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.040
because they incorporate
the alanine into the cell

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.130
walls, which make it
very hard to recognize

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.250
by the immune system,
and makes it very hard

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:46.860
to digest by the host proteases.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.230
Let's take a look at
a key intermediate

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.630
in the PLP-catalyzed reaction.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.000
As before, L alanine
is going to react

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.507
with the PLP bound
to the enzyme,

00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:57.840
and it's going to form an amine.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:08.800
Here we're highlighting
the stereochemistry

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:20.460
of the alpha hydrogen. And
here is our active site lysine.

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.480
As we've seen before,
this alpha hydrogen

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.580
is acidic enough that it can
be removed by the lysine.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.903
And it's going to form a
carbanion at this position.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.960
Now, this carbanion,
as we've seen before,

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.650
is able to form because the
charge is, in fact, delocalized

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:54.780
through the entire system
of the pyridoxal ring.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.800
So for this structure,
we can write

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.450
a number of resonance
structures, which we're not

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.890
going to mention here.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:07.440
Now, this carbanion
can be re-protonated.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.400
And here we had a--

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.050
the hydrogen was
pointing up on the top

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:17.610
of the plane of the page,
but we can re-protonate it

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.030
from the bottom, and that will
change the stereochemistry

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.300
of this carbon.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:29.760
See if that re-protonation
happens from the bottom,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.658
we will obtain the Schiff base
corresponding to the D alanine.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.195
So by being able to
generate this carbanion

00:21:45.195 --> 00:21:52.710
at the alpha position, the
PLP reaction and co-factor

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:54.840
allows the inversion
of the configuration

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:59.110
and the alpha carbon, converting
L alanine to D alanine.

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.420
Now, another interesting
reaction that requires PLP

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:04.020
is de-carboxylation.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:13.026
Here we're looking at an amino
acid-- for example, glutamate.

00:22:15.942 --> 00:22:22.950
In a PLP-catalyzed reaction,
you can lose this CO2 group

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:36.230
and form this molecule, which is
called gamma aminobutyric acid,

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.870
or GABA.

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.615
This is, in fact, a very
important neurotransmitter

00:22:41.615 --> 00:22:44.300
and inhibitor, a
neurotransmitter

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:49.150
that is required in the brain.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.260
Let's take a look how
this de-carboxylation

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.850
is catalyzed by PLP.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:59.390
As always, have we seen
so far, the glutamate

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:02.840
will react with PLP bound in
the active site of the enzyme,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.330
to form a Schiff base.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.430
Here is the Schiff base.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:15.880
Like that.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:20.030
Now instead of de-protonating
at the alpha position,

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.180
the CO2 is activated to leave.

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:25.730
Because it will leave
behind the carbanion.

00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:29.290
Such as that.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.300
And as we've seen
before, a carbanion

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.280
formed at this position
can de-localize

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.430
throughout the entire
pyridoxal ring,

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:50.470
and therefore it stabilize
and it can exist long enough.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.824
And we're not going
to draw, but there--

00:23:52.824 --> 00:23:55.240
you can imagine, there are a
number of different resonance

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.230
structures.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:02.230
Now, this carbanion-- it
gets protonated quickly

00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:15.640
by a general acid, and will
generate this structure, which

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:19.390
is just a Schiff base
corresponding to gamma

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:23.170
aminobutyric acid with PLP.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.310
And now, from here,
a transimination

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:30.460
where the active site
lysine will remove the PLP

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:35.390
and free up the GABA
products of the reaction.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.830
In this video we talked about
PLP-catalyzed reactions.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.840
PLP is the co-factor that
comes from vitamin B6.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.180
Here's vitamin B6, what
we call pyridoxine,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.365
which is the molecule that
we find in our vitamin pills.

00:24:55.365 --> 00:24:57.540
Now, in the body,
pyridoxine formed

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:02.330
pyridoxal, which is activated
to form pyridoxal 5 phosphate,

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:03.800
or PLP.

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.780
And typically when
it reacts, PLP

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.520
is found as a Schiff's base
bound in the active site

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.960
via a lysine.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.980
PLP is very important for
transamination reactions,

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:20.990
which are essential for the
metabolism of all amino acids.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:24.230
We have seen the transamination
reaction where an amino acid

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:30.050
1 reacts with alpha keto acid 2
and the PLP catalyzed reaction

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.620
forms an alpha keto
acid 1 and amino acid 2,

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:35.180
essentially
transferring the group--

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:38.660
the amino group from the amino
acid to the alpha keto acid.

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.700
The reaction occurs
in two steps,

00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:44.730
where first the amino acid is
transferred to PLP to form PMP.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.365
Then PMP then
transfers this group--

00:25:47.365 --> 00:25:49.595
the amino group-- back
to a alpha keto acid

00:25:49.595 --> 00:25:51.230
to generate a new amino acid.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.070
As we saw, the mechanism
of transamination

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:57.640
involves multiple steps.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:04.450
The first step is a
transimination reaction

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.080
where the Schiff's base that's
formed between the active site

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:12.170
lysine and the PLP
becomes a Schiff's

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.760
base between the incoming
amino acid and PLP.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.370
Next, we have a
proton transfer, which

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.280
is allowed by the
ability of the PLP ring

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:25.420
to stabilize a negative
charge, and move

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.040
the proton from
the alpha position

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:34.460
to somewhere on the PLP ring
via a quinoid structure.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.430
And finally, that the
resulting Schiff base

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:42.580
is hydrolyzed to generate
PMP and an alpha keto acid.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.470
In the second part
of the reaction,

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:48.640
PMP now reacts with alpha keto
acid to form a new Schiff base,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:52.860
and then the proton transfer
happens in reverse, via, again,

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:56.350
a quinoid structure, to
generate the Schiff base

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:00.730
corresponding to the PLP
and the new amino acid 2.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.715
Which, via a
transamination reaction

00:27:02.715 --> 00:27:07.810
will generate amino acid 2
and the PLP enzyme bound.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.420
Finally, we mentioned that
PLP is very versatile,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:12.160
and it can catalyze
other reactions,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.890
such as racemization,
for example,

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.920
switching the configuration
of the alpha carbon from L

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:22.510
alanine to D alanine, or
de-carboxylation, generating

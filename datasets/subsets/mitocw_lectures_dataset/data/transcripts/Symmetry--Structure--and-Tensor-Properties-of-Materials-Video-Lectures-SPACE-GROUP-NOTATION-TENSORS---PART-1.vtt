00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.840
PROFESSOR: Today, we are going
to change gears after the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.870
first hour to a very different
set of topics.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.620
What I wanted to do today was to
take a look at notation for

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:24.920
space groups.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.050
And this is a question that
is far from trivial.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.280
There are conventions, and we'll
see the reasons for them

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.090
with a few examples.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.480
And then I would like to pass
around representations of some

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.290
non-trivial space groups.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.000
First, as they appear in the old
International Tables for

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.680
X-Ray Crystallography,
Volume 1.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.670
And then second, to give you a
look at the larger, heavier,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.890
and much more expensive Volume
A, which gives much more

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.050
information which is both its
liability and its advantage.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.720
There are things in there
that are not in the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.690
international tables.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.560
But there's so much information
and so cluttered

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.890
that it's really overwhelming.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.900
But I'll give you a chance of
what their representations of

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.780
the space group look like.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.640
Let me begin by passing around
an example of the information

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.270
in the International Tables,
Volume 1 for one of the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.910
orthorhombic space groups.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.540
And it all fits on one page.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.560
It's not terribly complicated.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.790
But it is considerably more
complex both in the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.050
arrangement of atoms and in
the cluster of symmetry

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.530
elements, compared to the very
simple monoclinic space groups

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.200
which we looked at in their
entirety and in

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.450
considerable detail.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.030
So first of all, some indication
of what's on the

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.870
lower part of the page.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.050
This is exactly analogous
to what you've seen and

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.390
presumably are familiar
with for the two

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.280
dimensional plane groups.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.490
There are many possible origins
that could be selected

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.440
for the 0, 0, 0, position
relative to which the atomic

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.040
locations are expressed.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.870
So the first thing, just below
the picture of the arrangement

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.360
of atoms and the depiction of
the arrangement of symmetry

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.600
elements is a statement of
where the origin is.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.760
So it says, origin at the
inversion center 2/m.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.070
And if you look at the
arrangement of symmetry

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:44.570
elements, there is nothing but
the representation for screw

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.230
axes normal to the page.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.120
But there is, off on the
right-hand side, a solid

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.270
chevron, and that is the
indication for a mirror plane.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.620
Something again that is nowhere
stated, but always

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:07.560
assumed is that the two
variables x and y or the axes

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:15.080
a and b are assumed to run from
upper left to lower left

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.210
for a and the coordinate x and
from upper left to upper right

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.980
for the axis b.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.230
And therefore, plus c comes out
normal to the plane of the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.480
projection.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.150
Here, for the first time, we're
seeing a complex space

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.530
group that really requires the
full range of symbols for

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.450
representing the atomic
locations.

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.230
You will see, for each circle,
a vertical line

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.500
dividing it in half.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.870
These are two atoms then that
are superposed in projection.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.530
One of them, corresponding to
the little comma inside the

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.780
circle, is the enantiomorph
of those circles which are

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.950
unadorned with that
little comma.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.340
And they are, therefore,
of opposite handedness.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.310
Alongside of each circle, you
will see two symbols giving

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.579
the elevation of that atom
within the cell.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:23.070
The one at the furthest upper
left corner says 1/2 plus.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.380
So this says that the coordinate
is z, whatever that

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.310
is for the representative
atom, plus 1/2.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.280
The half of the circle that
has the comma inside has a

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.620
minus sign next do it.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.200
That means that it is at
an elevation minus z.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.140
Well, where is the
representative atom?

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.080
This is tucked just inside the
corner of the cell where the

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.770
vertical line divides
the circle into 1/2.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.750
That is a plus, so that's
an atom at plus z.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.810
The right-hand side of that
circle has a comma.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.270
It's an enantiomorphic motif,
and that exist at 1/2 minus z.

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.570
So you find labels on all of
the atoms in the cell.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.810
There are a total of four
clusters of eight.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.660
So are a total of 16 atoms
within the unit cell.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.790
If you look at this pattern
and reflect on it for a

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.640
moment, so to speak, you can see
that the same cluster of

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.370
eight sits at the corners
of the cell as in the

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.300
middle of the cell.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.570
Exactly the same.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.050
So therefore, this is a lattice
that is side-centered.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.830
There's a lattice point at the
corner of the cell and one

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.810
lattice point, in addition,
at 1/2, 1/2, 0, in the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.870
center of the cell.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.660
The c-axis comes out of the
plane of the paper.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:54.320
This then is a side-centered
c-lattice.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.680
And that is the capital letter
symbol that appears first in

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.300
the symbol for the
space group.

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.330
It is a side-centered lattice,
and the extra lattice point is

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.660
in the middle of the face
out of which c comes.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.180
Then come, in the space group
symbol at upper left-- this is

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.800
the abbreviated form--

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.050
mcm.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.840
And what I wanted to go over
this example specifically for,

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.570
there are three directions in
an orthorhombic symmetry, no

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.440
one any more or less special
than any other.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.540
So if you look at the
arrangement of symmetry

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.490
elements, there's a 2 sub 1
screw axis coming out in the

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.430
direction of c.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.960
The symbols running left to
right, arrows and barbs, the

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.880
arrows stand for
two-fold axes.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.200
The barbs stand for 2
sub 1 screw axes.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.080
And running up and down parallel
to the a-axis, again,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.430
arrows that indicate two-fold
axes and barbs that indicate 2

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.870
sub 1 screw axes.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.440
So which is the special
direction?

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.510
Which one should come first?

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.790
It's not like a cubic symmetry,
where the direction

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.860
of the four-fold axis is always
along the edge of the

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.200
unit cell, or a tetragonal
symmetry, where the four-fold

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.120
axis is always taken to
be the direction of c.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.430
Here, that's not specified.

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:31.880
So again, the first convention
is that the magnitudes of the

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:51.030
translations determine a, b,
and c in orthorhombic.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.640
Because there's nothing more
or less special about the

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.890
symmetry of these three
orthogonal directions.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.010
And the convention which we've
mentioned earlier is that the

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.470
magnitude of b is greater
than the magnitude of a.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.810
And then seemingly logically,
c is the smallest.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.790
So if this is the direction of a
and this is the direction of

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:21.220
b, then c comes up.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:29.290
And this is the intermediate
length translation.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:33.380
This is the maximum
translation.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.120
And normal to the blackboard is
the shortest translation.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.909
What symmetry goes first?

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:47.010
And here again, for
orthorhombic, we need a

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:48.180
convention.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.460
And the space group
symbol has--

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:53.340
I [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.660
I use lambda for this, but-- a
symbol for the lattice type.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:59.980
And we've seen that the capital
C that comes first

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:03.230
indicates that there is
a c-centered lattice.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:09.080
And then what one does for
orthorhombic is give the

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.340
symmetry elements in
the order abc.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.550
So the axis that is parallel
to a over the plane that is

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:19.940
perpendicular to a.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.450
Next, the axis that's parallel
to b over the plane that is

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.560
perpendicular to b.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:32.180
And then the axis that is
parallel to c over the plane,

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:34.680
if any, that is perpendicular
to c.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:40.910
So then this is a convention
for orthorhombic.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.000
And again, this is the only
crystal system where

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.090
conventions this elaborate
are necessary.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:51.380
If this were tetragonal, 4 or
4/m would always come first

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.040
because that's the
direction of c.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.740
So even the order of the

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.300
symmetry elements is different.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:59.860
But we've got another problem.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.010
If we look at the axes, if any,
that are along a, we've

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.660
got this symbol that stands for
a two-fold axis and this

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.590
single barbed arrow that stands
for a 2 sub 1 screw.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:13.970
So what kind of axis
is along a?

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.980
There are two different
kinds of axes.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:22.380
So in here, we could put either
a 2 or a 2 sub 1.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.720
And if we look at the planes
that are perpendicular to a,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.930
there's two of them.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:31.720
There's a dashed line, and
this is a glide where the

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:34.770
direction of tau is in the plane
of the paper so that

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:38.420
we're looking edge on in
the glide plane and

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.050
perpendicular to tau.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.290
And then there is
a solid line.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.890
That's the symbol for
a mirror plane.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:50.890
This would be a glide in
which tau is a long b,

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.330
so this is a b-glide.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.150
So those are the two sorts of
symmetry planes that are

00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:59.000
perpendicular to a.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.230
Again, there are two of them.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:06.140
So we could put in either m, or
we could put in a for the

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.730
plane that is perpendicular
to a.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.100
So already, there are four
different possibilities for

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.400
the first character.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.620
So obviously, what I'm leading
up to is the fact that we're

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:18.320
going to have to have
conventions of necessity to

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.560
come to a symbol on which
everyone agrees.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.400
I think you get the idea now,
so let me move along quickly

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.400
along the direction of the arrow
for a two-fold axis, a

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.400
barb for 2 sub 1 screw axis.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.070
So again, there are two kinds of
symmetry axes that could go

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:38.720
in here for the axes that
are parallel to b,

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:41.310
either 2 or 2 sub 1.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.820
If we look at the planes that
are perpendicular to b,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.790
there's a dotted line.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:54.510
And this is a glide for which
tau is directed upwards.

00:11:54.510 --> 00:11:58.690
We're looking directly along
the orientation of tau.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.960
The axis that is normal to
the board is the c-axis.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.270
So this is a c-glide.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:11.600
And then appears a dash-dot
line alongside of it.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:14.800
The dash-dot line is a glide
plane where you're looking

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.800
neither perpendicular to tau
nor parallel to tau, but

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.280
halfway in between.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.710
So this is a glide plane where
tau is equal to 1/2 of

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.390
a plus 1/2 of b.

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.680
And that's a diagonal glide
represented, just to confuse

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.780
the innocent, by the symbol n.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.820
So two choices for
axes along b.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:44.960
Two choices for the glide
plane, either c or n.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.910
And finally, mercifully, along
the direction of the c-axis,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:53.460
which is easiest to visualize,
because things are either

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.280
along it or parallel to
it, we've got only a

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.670
2 sub 1 screw axis.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:02.230
So this is the only symbol
which is not ambiguous.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:05.020
And then perpendicular to that,
we have the symbol for a

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:08.740
mirror plane, the solid chevron
off to one side.

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:13.090
And then the chevron adorned
with a diagonal arrow and that

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:19.250
is, again, a diagonal glide n.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:25.600
We notice that the center of the
cell at z equals 0 is the

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.070
same as the grouping of
atoms at the corner.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:31.250
So that is a side-centered
lattice.

00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:38.670
The centered lattice point is
coming out of the face which c

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.330
emerges from.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.265
And so this is a c-lattice.

00:13:42.265 --> 00:13:43.448
You have a question?

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:47.432
AUDIENCE: Professor, for the
first term [? x of the ?]

00:13:47.432 --> 00:13:53.090
plane perpendicular to a,
why is it a and not b?

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:53.630
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:55.130
You're absolutely right.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.550
I wrote it down as a b-glide.

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:59.963
Perpendicular to
a is a b-glide.

00:13:59.963 --> 00:14:01.440
Good.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.690
Congratulations.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:09.510
So we need a convention.

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:13.220
And the convention for
establishing a hierarchy of

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.430
symbols is easy to remember.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:19.480
It's if you have both a two-fold
screw axis and a

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:23.370
two-fold axis, the order of
preference is that the 2 is

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:26.700
chosen in preference to the
2 sub 1 screw symbol.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.010
So by this greater than, I
mean the preference for

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.820
choosing it is greater than
the symbol to the right.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.840
So we get rid of the
2 sub 1 here.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.200
We pick the 2.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.310
Get rid of the 2 sub 1 here,
and that stays at 2 sub 1.

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:46.780
For planes, you pick m in
preference to an a-glide, in

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.670
preference to a b-glide, in
preference to a c-glide, in

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.200
preference to a diagonal glide,
in preference to a

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.950
diamond glide, assuming
you have a choice of

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.330
two different planes.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:03.210
So in this case, we picked
the m in preference to b.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.510
Here, we've got a c-glide
and an n-glide.

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.470
We picked the c, and it's
in preference to the n.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:11.920
And here again, for the plane
that is perpendicular to c, we

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.030
picked the m in preference
to the n.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:22.890
So the full symbol would be
C, 2 over m, 2 over c, and

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:26.360
2 sub 1 over m.

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.590
Now I'll peek and see
if I got this right.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.220
Yes, I did.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:31.380
How about that?

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:39.780
And the short symbol would be
simply Cmcm, which indeed is

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.810
what we see listed in
the upper left-hand

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:46.100
corner of the page.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:56.320
This is a space group based on
the point group 2/m, 2/m, 2/m,

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.530
which is D2h.

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:02.260
And there is the large number
17 in the superscript, which

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.450
is the 17th orthorhombic space
group, which Schoenflies was

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:09.443
able to derive in the order
in which he did them.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.390
Any questions?

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:16.146
Yes.

00:16:16.146 --> 00:16:18.376
AUDIENCE: If you look at the
other symbols to describe the

00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:21.754
space group, would we construct
the same space group

00:16:21.754 --> 00:16:24.070
using that function
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.570
PROFESSOR: Yes, you could.

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.990
And let me say, yes,
it's possible.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.450
But also to answer a question,
you might have about the short

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:38.690
form of the symbol, we're
throwing away information.

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:42.050
We've thrown away the fact that
there are two-fold axes,

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:44.200
and a pair of directions,
and 2 sub 1 only

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:45.490
in the third direction.

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:51.090
Is it possible that two space
groups could have exactly the

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.030
same three symbols in
the short form?

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.900
And the answer is no.

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:01.740
Because if you think about it,
you start with a lattice type.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:05.060
If you put a mirror plane in
one orientation, a mirror

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:09.089
plane in the other orientation,
that really is

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:14.270
all you have to specify in order
to determine every other

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:16.740
symmetry element
that's present.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.690
You simply combine those
operations, and you find that

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.619
when you've taken these
symmetries and rotations and

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:28.480
combine them with the lattice
translation, it comes out to

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.660
one and the same
unique result.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.510
So your question was what
happens if you take another

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:37.470
three symbols.

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.810
You end up with the
same result.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:43.420
Three of them, really, are
enough to specify what the

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.670
group will turn out to be.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:52.580
Now the other thing I wanted
to do was to show you how

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:57.410
remarkably the symbol for the
space group will change if you

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:02.150
take a different set of axes
simply because the relative

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:05.340
lengths of the cell edge for
this arrangement of symmetry

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.050
elements have changed.

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:09.430
This takes dominance.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.040
This determines the labels
that go to the axes.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.020
And then the symbol for the
plane group, and what is a

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:18.010
b-glide, and what is a
c-glide follows from

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:20.350
this choice of axes.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:21.650
So let me take another
example.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.400
And I think if you follow what
I've done so far, I can zip

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.710
through this a little
more quickly.

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:31.070
Somebody pick a new direction
for this axis.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:31.960
Let's not pick a.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.160
We have used that for this.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.380
So somebody pick a b or a c.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.170
Do you want to pick
a b or a c?

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:37.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.340
PROFESSOR: b.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:42.660
So we're going to change
this direction to b.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.092
Somebody want to pick a
label for this axis?

00:18:45.092 --> 00:18:46.070
AUDIENCE: c.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.320
PROFESSOR: c.

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.200
And nobody gets to
pick this axis.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.500
If you think you can,
you're out of here.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.580
Because that now has determined

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:56.940
the coordinate system.

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.930
So we've got b this
way, c this way.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:02.300
We want a right-handed
abc convention.

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:03.550
So a goes up.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.190
So abc right-handed system.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:14.270
So exactly the same arrangement
of symmetry

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:17.100
elements except that we've
now changed the

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:18.280
labels on the axes.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.380
So we have changed the name that
we have to apply to the

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.310
glide planes.

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:31.320
So let me now proceed to write
down here the new collection

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.890
of symbols which would appear
for this setting of exactly

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.480
the same space group.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.580
First of all, the centered
lattice point is now in the

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.460
middle of the face out
of which a comes.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.720
So this is an a-lattice,
side-centered a.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:54.100
If we look along the direction
of a, all that we have for an

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.840
axis is 2 sub 1.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.360
Then we have these two planes.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.620
One is an m.

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:02.050
One is a diagonal glide.

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:08.260
So that is m or n.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.470
If I look along b, I have the
choice of either 2 or 2 sub 1

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.820
as both are present.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:22.720
Perpendicular to b, however,
is a glide for which tau is

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.740
along the direction of c.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.400
So that is a c-glide.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.240
And then the other symbol for
an axis that's perpendicular

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.220
to b is a mirror plane.

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.010
So it's either c or m.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.500
Then finally, along the
direction of c, I once more

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.390
have two-fold axes and
2 sub 1 screw axes.

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:49.080
And then perpendicular to
c is a diagonal glide.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.200
And this is a glide.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.320
The dotted line indicates
that the direction of

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.930
tau is along a.

00:20:54.930 --> 00:21:00.570
So I have a choice of either
a or n in here.

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:04.320
So putting down the symbols in
the order of preference, this

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:14.070
would be A, 2 sub 1 over
m, 2 over m, 2 over a.

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:20.590
Or the short form of the symbol
would be Amma, which I

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.240
submit doesn't look anything
like Cmcm.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:34.040
And when you start out in
diffraction, many people have

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.480
a first disconcerting
experience.

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.390
You spend probably the better
part of a month taking single

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.090
crystal diffraction patterns.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:45.250
You come up with a trial
space group for

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.100
your particular material.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.730
And then you go to the
International Tables, and you

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.930
say, oh, it's not in there,
what did I do wrong?

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:55.530
And you go back, and you check
all your calculations.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.220
You look once more at all of
the systematic absence of

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.780
reflection.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.960
See, I have it right.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.400
Why is it not in there?

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:05.250
Well, the answer is more than
likely that you have a

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.440
different setting for
the labels that you

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.910
applied to the axes.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.820
And you have, therefore,
metamorphosed the symbol for

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:15.660
the space group from one
form to a symbol that

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:16.910
is very, very different.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.440
How do you tell, when you have a
particular space group, what

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.170
all of the possible symbols
for one and the same

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:31.600
symmetry might be?

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.060
So let me now pass
out two things.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:40.050
If you have a question like
that, you can bet your bottom

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:42.700
bippy that it's in the
International Tables if you

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.970
look in the right place.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:46.600
So first of all, let me
do something I should

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:48.660
have done early on.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.240
I meant to hand out a copy
of the space group

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.480
that I drew up here.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.730
If I can find it again.

00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:00.660
It's buried with all of the
stuff that I brought in.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:07.780
So I do have a copy for you, but
it's gone at the moment.

00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:14.460
Let me pass out a listing of all
of the possible variants

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:17.582
of the space groups for the 230

00:23:17.582 --> 00:23:21.100
three-dimensional space groups.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.740
And it starts out simple for
triclinic symmetries.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.150
There's only two possible
symbols period, P1 and P1 bar.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:41.260
And then when you come to
monoclinic, the Schoenflies

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:47.350
symbol has the marvelous
property that it is

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:53.350
independent of the orientation
and labelling of axes.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.530
It depends only on the point
group that the crystal has.

00:23:56.530 --> 00:23:59.890
For monoclinic, either
C2 or Cs--

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:01.230
that's a mirror plane--

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:03.910
or C2h--

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:06.790
that's 2 over a horizontal
mirror plane.

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:11.400
But the labels can still change
depending whether in

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:17.700
the first setting either a, b,
or the diagonal of the oblique

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:21.980
net has to be labeled a and c.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:25.450
So at the top of the column,
you'll see the permutation of

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:28.940
the two symbols a and
b or b and a.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:33.780
And again, the change
is significant.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.090
Number eight, as indicated
in the left-hand column,

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:40.700
can be Am or Bm.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.230
And for the groups that are
based on 2 over m, you can

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.160
see, again, there are
different symbols.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:58.070
A, 2 over b, A, 2 over a.

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.730
Again, not at all similar.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.950
Next, come the orthorhombic
space groups.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.470
And you can amuse yourself
by looking through those.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:16.640
Again, what is called the
standard setting under the

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.640
heading symbols for various
settings, this is the one

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.180
that's listed in the tables.

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.160
But then for various
permutations of a, b, and c,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.210
you can have five other
possibilities.

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:30.210
And you can marvel at how the
symbol for the space group

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.970
changes, as you do nothing but
change the labels a, b, and c

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:37.500
that goes onto the axes.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.400
So there are tons of
orthorhombic space groups

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.840
because you have three different
axes to play with,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.900
and three different
planes, and four

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.430
different lattice types.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:51.630
So there is an absolutely mind
boggling collection of

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.060
orthorhombic space groups.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:59.090
It is the most densely populated
crystal system.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:06.660
For tetragonal, no
real alternative.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.640
Something like P4, 4 is in the
direction of the c-axis.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:22.300
There are two-fold axes parallel
to that, but the

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.030
symbol that is used for the
symmetry part of the space

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.440
group symbol looks very, very
much like the symbol for the

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.830
point group.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:32.430
So these are pretty much
self-explanatory.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:39.630
Notice that there are two
kinds of lattices for

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.710
tetragonal crystals, either
primitive or body-centered.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:49.120
So you see families with P
for primitive or I for

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.490
body-centered.

00:26:50.490 --> 00:26:54.470
But notice how many you can get
out of a single type of

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.080
axis and a single lattice.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:01.110
Numbers 75, 76, 77, and 78 are
a four-fold axis and a

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:04.430
primitive lattice, a 4 sub 1
screw, a 4 sub 2 screw, or a 4

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:06.180
sub 3 screw.

00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:14.140
Then you do the same thing
with I. And so it goes.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:16.580
Then it picks up at the
top of the page again.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:25.160
And you see, again, different
possibilities for the symbols.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.400
Continuing still on-- and I
think you have the idea now--

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.170
same for trigonal crystals.

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:37.150
They chose to list those
separate from hexagonal.

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.190
And then hexagonal symmetries.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.140
The number is fairly large here
because when you take an

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:45.230
axis and add it to a primitive
hexagonal lattice--

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:48.160
for number 168, for example--

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.270
you get P6.

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:53.830
Change the six-fold axis
to a screw axis.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:28:01.690
There are five different types
of six-fold screw axes.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:06.935
So there's a P6 sub 1, a P6 sub
2, a P6 sub 3, a P6 sub 4,

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:08.520
and a P6 sub 5.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.210
And then finally, cubic.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.180
A fair number of cubic
symmetries.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:24.330
But the edge of the cell is
always along the direction of

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:27.410
the four-fold axis or the
two-fold axis, depending on

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.880
whether the symmetry is based
on 2, 3 or 4, 3, 2.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.280
So there are really no
alternative symbols for

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.300
different settings of the
symmetry elements

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:39.990
relative to the edges.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:41.470
So there you have them.

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:46.330
All 230 of our cast
of characters.

00:28:46.330 --> 00:28:51.490
But in forms of the very
different mantles in which

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.740
they can be cloaked.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.220
What else did I want to do?

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:12.550
I want to contrast what is done
for us in the old Volume

00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:15.640
1 of the International Tables.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:28.720
And I will pass out an example
for one of the tetragonal

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.350
space groups.

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:33.400
This is the one with maximum
symmetry 4 over m, 2

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.600
over m, 2 over m.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.850
Sorry.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.800
Can you pass those back?

00:29:47.354 --> 00:29:56.740
And this is something that is
analogous to P4mm in two

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:02.100
dimensions with the four-fold
and two-fold axes extended

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:06.470
parallel to the edge of what
is now a tetragonal cell.

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:10.360
And then there are two-fold
axes perpendicular to the

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.620
four-fold axis.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.220
So actually 4 over m, 2 over m,
2 over m has been dropped

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:20.190
in at a lattice point of a
primitive tetragonal lattice.

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.550
The chevron in the upper right
of the arrangement of symmetry

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.980
elements is the mirror plane
that's perpendicular to the

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.060
four-fold axis.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.870
The other mirror planes
are the same as in

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:31.120
the plane group P4mm.

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:42.100
And the glide plane, which now
would be called a diagonal

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:44.810
glide, is exactly the
same as in the

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.490
two-dimensional symmetry.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:52.920
Notice, however, the exquisite
number of general and special

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.880
positions that are present
in the space group.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.140
The general position has the
letter U. You've gone through

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.470
almost the entire alphabet
before you've labeled all of

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.070
these positions.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.830
And again, either on the mirror
planes, but now there's

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:13.850
a vertical mirror plane, a
diagonal vertical mirror

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:17.460
plane, a horizontal mirror
plane, mirror planes halfway

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:20.420
along each of the axes, mirror
planes halfway along the

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.990
diagonal translation.

00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:26.030
So there are lots of positions
of point group m.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:29.010
Lots of positions with
point group 2mm.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.750
And then finally, 2 over
m, 2 over m, 2 over m.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:36.440
And the highest symmetry, 4 over
m, 2 over m, 2 over m,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:44.190
which occurs at the origin, at
the center of the cell, and at

00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:48.710
the positions 0, 0, 1/2
and 1/2, 1/2, 1/2.

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:57.090
Then I'd like to pass around
one more example of a space

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.260
group from the International
Tables.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:05.250
And I know I copied it, and
I don't have it with me.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.710
I left some stuff behind,
which we'll get

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:12.850
after we take our break.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.760
No, here it is.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:20.870
This is an example from Volume
1, the older edition, for one

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.600
of the cubic point groups.

00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.840
And this is a very
high symmetry.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.860
This is symmetry 4 over m, 3
bar 2 over m, the highest

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.400
symmetry cubic point group
dropped into a

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.460
body-centered lattice.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:41.350
So this turns out to be, in the
long form, I, 4 over m, 3

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:42.720
bar, 2 over m.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:52.120
Let me pass these back.

00:32:55.490 --> 00:33:00.560
So the first thing you'll
notice is no picture of

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.870
symmetry elements.

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.830
How do you draw something where
the symmetry elements

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:10.350
are not merely parallel to the
plane of the depiction or

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.700
perpendicular to it?

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:14.090
Here, you've got mirror planes
that are inclined to the

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.600
paper, axes that are inclined
to the paper.

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.520
How do you represent them?

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:23.830
You'll notice also the enormous
number of atoms in

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:25.200
the general position.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.890
96 atoms.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:31.550
Drop in one atom at xyz, and
all hell breaks loose.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:34.590
You get 95 other atoms.

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:39.630
And again, when the lattice is
centered, they do not list all

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:41.630
96 sets of coordinates.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:49.310
They denote at the top of the
page 0, 0, 0, 1/2, 1/2, plus.

00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:53.770
That means because the lattice
is body-centered to those 48

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:57.180
positions that are listed, you
add 0, 0, 0, which is easy to

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:01.830
do, and then add 1/2, 1/2,
1/2 to x, y, and z.

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.490
And these are the atoms
that hang at the

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:04.740
centered lattice point.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:10.710
Again, because the symmetry is
so high, surprisingly, there

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:12.550
are not that many special
positions.

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.100
Because all of the symmetry
elements can serve as special

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.150
positions are related by the
symmetry that's there.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:24.949
So this is all that you see for
the body-centered lattice

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:29.330
with 4 over m, 3 bar, 2 over
m dropped into it.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:32.580
And again, you can describe some
very, very complicated

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.110
crystal structures with a very
brief set of notes, give the

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:39.110
value of the single lattice
constant a.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:42.100
And then say, you've got an atom
in the general position

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.960
96l with x equals something, y
equals something, z equals

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.989
some number.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:51.710
And another atom in position
16f x, x, x, and just the

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.409
value of x would be given.

00:34:53.409 --> 00:35:00.970
So you've described a structure
that has roughly 125

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:03.350
atoms in it with just
that modest

00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.485
specification of atomic positions.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:18.030
Let me now pass out for you some
samples of what the space

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:23.000
groups look like in Volume A
of the new International

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.220
Tables for Crystallography.

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.420
Not X-ray crystallography,
but just

00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.670
crystallography in general.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:38.160
And I think you will be blown
away because the amount of

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.420
information that's there is
almost suffocating in its

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.200
detail and its density.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.830
The first sample space group
that is given here is, not by

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:58.970
coincidence, one of the
tetragonal space groups, the

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:03.840
one that we just discussed, P,
4 over m, 2 over m, 2 over m.

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.560
They've done some very
useful things.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.420
They have specified the
asymmetric unit within which

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:17.900
you need specify coordinates
of atoms.

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:21.260
And here, they say that you
have to tell what's in the

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:27.310
range x equals 0 to x equal 1/2,
y equals 0 to y equals

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:36.230
1/2, and z equal to 1/2, but
greater or equal to 0.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:40.130
Then they give a representative
set of symmetry

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:44.390
operations which generate
all of the atoms

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:47.960
within the unit cell.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:54.230
The symmetry operations are not
independent, but they list

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.310
16 symmetry elements.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:37:03.880
And now if you look to the next
page on the list of 16

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.850
atomic coordinates in the
general position, you will see

00:37:06.850 --> 00:37:10.120
a number in parentheses
in front of each one.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:15.780
The 15, for example, tells you
that you get this atom from

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.820
the atom at xyz by the operation
of symmetry element

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.560
15, which turns out to be a
mirror plane parallel to the x

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:28.150
minus xz direction.

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:31.260
And this is very, very useful
if you want to describe a

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:39.870
structure and you've labeled
your atoms silicon 1 and

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.710
silicon 2 if they're two
different kinds of silicon ion

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.290
in the structure.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:49.230
And then you're talking about
a silicon, oxygen, silicon

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:53.340
bond, and it's not at all clear
which of the symmetry

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.020
related atoms are involved
in that bond.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:02.860
Well, the presentation of a
standard numbering of atoms

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:06.980
related by symmetry lets you say
that, for example, this is

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:13.300
the bond between silicon
superscript 5, oxygen, silicon

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:14.520
superscript 14.

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.340
And you can identify the
coordinates of the atoms that

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.250
went into that particular bond
angle or bond distance.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.570
And that's very nice.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:28.270
All sorts of information
a la group theory.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:33.220
The maximal non-isomorphic
subgroups, the maximal

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:37.120
isomorphic subgroups of lowest
index, the minimal

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:40.420
non-isomorphic supergroups.

00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.230
At one time, I may have known
what all that meant, and I've

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.920
long since forgotten
and have never

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:48.840
regretted having forgotten.

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:56.860
So this is very exotic,
higher-level information about

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.980
the subgroups that exist
for the space group.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:03.470
Notice how much more information
is present though,

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:10.070
compared to the depiction of
the same space group in the

00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:14.240
earlier International Tables
for X-Ray Crystallography.

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.340
Well, more or less at
random, I picked out

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:20.590
some other space groups.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:24.020
I, 4 sub 1, amd.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:29.590
So this is 4 over m, 2 over m,
2 over m in which the 4 has

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.390
been replaced by a 4
sub 1 screw axis.

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:35.490
The mirror plane perpendicular
to the edge of the cell

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.780
replaced b an a-glide.

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:46.690
The mirror plane for the
second mirrors that's

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.660
perpendicular to the cell edge,
the a-glide is diagonal.

00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:55.120
And then perpendicular
to the diagonal,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.620
two-fold axis is a d-glide.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:06.840
Again, the different operations
are identified by a

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.070
number, the glide plane, and
the inversion centers, and

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:13.450
two-fold axes that
are present.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:17.790
And then in the coordinates of
the general position, you are

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:23.250
given the nature of the symmetry
element that produces

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.800
the atom at a particular set of
coordinates from the atom

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:27.820
that's in the general
position.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:30.250
Now again, the maximal
non-isomorphic this, the

00:40:30.250 --> 00:40:33.790
minimal non-isomorphic
supergroup, and so on.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:35.040
Lots of information.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:41.660
Then some examples of still
higher symmetries.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:47.840
P6 sub 3 over mmc based on 6
over m, 2 over m, 2 over m

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.110
with the 6 replaced by a 6 sub
3 screw axis and one of the

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:54.340
mirror planes replaced
by a c-glide.

00:40:58.036 --> 00:41:01.310
If you go on, here comes the
really exciting part.

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:04.470
The next page gives
you a depiction of

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:07.450
a cubic space group.

00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:08.530
Heroic.

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:13.360
What they do is show
stereographic projections at

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:25.090
locations, such as 0, 0, 0 and
0, 1/2, 1/2, I believe it is.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:29.000
And then the best part of all,
down at the bottom of that

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.050
page, you see the arrangement
of atoms in stereo.

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:36.600
And if you're one of these
people who can stare at the

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:40.350
thing cross-eyed and let your
eyes sort of blonk out, you

00:41:40.350 --> 00:41:42.510
can watch the two
halves merge.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:45.900
And all of a sudden, zing, the
thing leaps out of the page at

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:47.620
you in three dimensions.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:50.570
If you don't have that ability
to cross your eyes and see

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:53.440
stereographic projections, you
have to get a little viewer.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.340
But nevertheless, if you want to
see it in three dimensions

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.370
badly enough, you can do it.

00:41:58.370 --> 00:41:59.060
So there you are.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.260
For the first time, pictures
of the general position in

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.320
cubic space groups.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.370
I think that's kind of fun.

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:12.490
Sometimes I gaze at it for so
long I'm afraid my eyes are

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:13.410
going to get stuck.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.120
And then I'll be in
real trouble.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.380
Here's another one.

00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:22.260
P 4 over m, 3 bar, 2 over m.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.340
You notice the problems that
they have in indicating the

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:28.770
orientation of three-fold axes
which are not parallel to or

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.660
perpendicular to the paper.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.350
You have to do that with
a little stereographic

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:33.600
projection.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:42.610
And then finally, after we've
done a couple of more cubic

00:42:42.610 --> 00:42:50.090
space groups, you come to the
one that I gave you the

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:53.340
handout from the International
Tables for X-Ray

00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.200
Crystallography.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.320
I, 4 over m, 3 bar, 2 over m.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:00.430
And look at all the information
that is there that

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:04.760
no attempt is made to give you
in the earlier tables.

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.530
So this is for better or
for worse what space

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:11.060
group tables look like.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.980
This is the information
that hopefully you'll

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.030
be equipped to use.

00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:18.960
If nothing else, if you can't
derive these things or

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.950
reproduce the arrangement of
symmetries from the symbol, if

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:26.050
you ever have to construct the
atomic arrangement from a

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.820
material from the
crystallographic notation in

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.410
which the atomic arrangement is
provided, you can hopefully

00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:36.260
go to the International Tables,
know where to look,

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.830
and how to go about identifying
the coordinates of

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.550
all of the atoms within
the unit cell.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:45.840
Timed myself to finish just
at five of the hour.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:55.210
So let me, before you leave,
give you one final problem set

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:58.660
on symmetry, problem
set number 10.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:04.500
And this is related to
identifying what the symbols

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.030
used to give atomic locations
represent.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:12.770
First problem asks you to look
at a pair of atoms and

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:17.280
determine the symmetry element
which has related them.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:22.550
The second problem on the second
sheet asks you to do

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.760
what we did here for this
orthorhombic space group.

00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:32.230
Determine the symbol when a,
b, and c are particular

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:35.100
translations of the three
that are unique.

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.740
And then change the orientation,
and see what the

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.070
space group symbol
morphs into.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:53.160
Let me finish with one
final handout.

00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:58.660
And that is could you please
summarize what we spent the

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.970
last month and a half doing?

00:45:00.970 --> 00:45:02.240
Gladly.

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:06.550
I have summarized everything
that we did and the theorems

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:11.590
that we used to derive it
on one piece of paper.

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.710
So all of symmetry theory is
here admittedly written in a

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:17.560
rather tight hand.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:23.030
But here is an indication of
everything we did to get from

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:26.150
a definition of basic
operations, a flowsheet that

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:29.480
gets us down to 230
three-dimensional

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:32.705
crystallographic space groups.

00:45:32.705 --> 00:45:37.500
So I'll pass that around for
your awe and amazement.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.170
Sorry I gave a big
pack out on the

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.360
right-hand side of the room.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.610
They'll come around to you.

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:50.710
So let us take our usual
10 minute break.

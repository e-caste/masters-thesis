00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.350
We've seen the rocket
equation, and we've

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.870
studied the example when
there's no external forces.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.920
Now, let's consider an example
when the external force is not

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.150
0.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.310
Well, one of our
examples is just a rocket

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.380
taking off in a
gravitational field.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.560
And so when we want to focus
on the external forces,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.970
let's draw our
rocket at time, t.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.689
And now, consider-- what are the
force diagrams on this rocket?

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.190
Well, we have a
gravitational force, mg.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.860
So we're going to
choose j hat up.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.590
So now, what does our
rocket equation look like?

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.650
We wrote the exhaust
velocity as minus mu j hat.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.490
And so if we write this now as
a vector equation in the j hat

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.090
component, we get minus mg.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.240
We have the rate that the
rocket mass is changing,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.740
and this is in our-- we
have this as-- remember,

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.200
dm dr/dt is going
to be negative.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.750
So there's a minus.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:18.080
And over here, we have another--
this is u because u is minus u.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.725
And finally, we have
m rocket dvr/dt.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.570
Now, once again, we're
going to try to integrate--

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.460
this is actually equal.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.830
And we're going to try to
integrate this equation

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.850
to find a solution for the
velocity as a function of time

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.340
when all the fuel is burned.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.630
So what we do is we'll
multiply through by dt,

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:54.080
and we have minus dmr
times u equals mr dvr.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.630
And this is mass of the rocket.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.080
And now, let's divide through
by mass of the rocket,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:11.330
so we have minus g minus
dmr over mru equals dvr.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.070
And once again, we can
integrate this equation

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.350
from some initial time
to some final time.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.700
I'll just denote that by
i initial and i final,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.560
and what we see here is we have
minus g times t final minus t

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.270
initial because
we're integrating

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.680
with respect to time.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.329
Here, we're integrating mass,
so that's minus mu natural log.

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:43.579
And I'm going to write this
as mr final over mr initial.

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.310
And over here, we have vr
final minus vr initial.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.590
And let's just
remove that time, t.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.190
And so now, here is
our rocket equation.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.990
Now, what we notice
here is-- let's look

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.370
at some rocket taking off.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.700
So suppose that, at
10 initial equals 0,

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.460
we have the special condition
that vr initial equals 0

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.650
and mr initial equals the
mass of the rocket-- dry mass.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:19.970
That's all.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.980
That's not counting the fuel.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.450
Plus the total mass of the fuel.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.690
And the final-- at t final, when
the engine turns off-- we're

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.440
going to try to find
this velocity at t final.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.960
And our condition
for the final mass

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.140
is all the fuel has been
burned, so this is just

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.750
the dry mass of the rocket.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.510
And so what we get is
we get minus g t final.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.540
Now, I'm going to
switch the sign here,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.630
so we have-- if
I invert the log,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.790
that will give a minus sign.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:11.180
And I have plus u log of mr
of d plus mass of the fuel.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.340
That's the initial
mass of the rocket.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.320
Divided by just the
dry mass, and that's

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.140
equal to vr at t final.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.170
So one of the interesting
questions that you might ask

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:34.580
is-- how fast should
you burn the fuel,

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.430
and what will that have to
do with the final speed?

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.530
So we can see from
this expression

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.290
that, if you burn the fuel for
a very long period of time--

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.220
so t final is big--
then this piece will

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.320
diminish the final velocity.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.830
So if you want the fastest speed
after you've burned the fuel,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.620
you want to burn the fuel so
that t final is as short as

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.430
possible.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.830
We have the shortest
burn time, will give us

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.577
the largest velocity when
all the fuel has been burned.

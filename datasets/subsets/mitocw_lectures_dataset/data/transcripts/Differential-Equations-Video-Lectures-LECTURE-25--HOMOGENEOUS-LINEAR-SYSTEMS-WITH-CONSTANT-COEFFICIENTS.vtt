00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The last time I spent solving a
system of equations dealing with

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the chilling of this hardboiled
egg being put in an ice bath.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We called T1 the temperature of
the yoke and T2 the temperature

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of the white.
What I am going to do is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
revisit that same system of
equations, but basically the

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
topic for today is to learn to
solve that system of equations

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
by a completely different
method.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It is the method that is
normally used in practice.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Elimination is used mostly by
people who have forgotten how to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
do it any other way.
Now, in order to make it a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
little more general,
I am not going to use the

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
dependent variables T1 and T2
because they suggest temperature

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
a little too closely.
Let's change them to neutral

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
variables.
I will use x equals T1,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and for T2 I will just use
y.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I am not going to re-derive
anything.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I am not going to resolve
anything.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I am not going to repeat
anything of what I did last

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
time, except to write down to
remind you what the system was

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in terms of these variables,
the system we derived using the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
particular conductivity
constants, two and three,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
respectively.
The system was this one,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
minus 2x plus 2y.
And the y prime was

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
2x minus 5y.
And so we solved this by

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
elimination.
We got a single second-order

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
equation with constant
coefficients,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which we solved in the usual
way.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
From that I derived what the x
was, from that we derived what

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the y was, and then I put them
all together.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I will just remind you what the
final solution was when written

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
out in terms of arbitrary
constants.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It was c1 times e to the
negative t plus c2 e to the

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
negative 6t,
and y was c1 over 2 e

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to the negative t minus 2c2 e to
the negative 6t.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That was the solution we got.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then I went on to put in
initial conditions,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
but we are not going to explore
that aspect of it today.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We will in a week or so.
This was the general solution

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because it had two arbitrary
constants in it.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
What I want to do now is
revisit this and do it by a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
different method,
which makes heavy use of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
matrices.
That is a prerequisite for this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
course, so I am assuming that
you reviewed a little bit about

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
matrices.
And it is in your book.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Your book puts in a nice little
review section.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Two-by-two and three-by-three
will be good enough for 18.03

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
mostly because I don't want you
to calculate all night on bigger

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000
matrices, bigger systems.
So nothing serious,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.000
matrix multiplication,
solving systems of linear

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
equations, end-by-end systems.
I will remind you at the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
appropriate places today of what
it is you need to remember.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The very first thing we are
going to do is,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
let's see.
I haven't figured out the color

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
coding for this lecture yet,
but let's make this system in

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
green and the solution can be in
purple.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Invisible purple,
but I have a lot of it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Let's abbreviate,
first of all,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the system using matrices.
I am going to make a column

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
vector out of (x,
y).

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Then you differentiate a column
vector by differentiating each

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
component.
I can write the left-hand side

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of the system as (x,
y) prime.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
How about the right-hand side?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Well, I say I can just write
the matrix of coefficients to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
negative 2, 2,
2, negative 5 times x,y.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And I say that this matrix
equation says exactly the same

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
thing as that green equation
and, therefore,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000
it is legitimate to put it up
in green, too.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The top here is x prime.
What is the top here?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.000
After I multiply these two I
get a column vector.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And what is its top entry?
It is negative 2x plus 2y.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
There it is.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And the bottom entry the same
way is 2x minus 5y,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000
just as it is down there.
Now, what I want to do is,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
well, maybe I should translate
the solution.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
What does the solution look
like?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We got that,
too.
How am I going to write this as
a matrix equation?
Actually, if I told you to use
matrices, use vectors,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the point at which you might be
most hesitant is this one right
here, the very next step.
Because how you should write it

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is extremely well-concealed in
this notation.
But the point is,
this is a column vector and I

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
am adding together two column
vectors.
And what is in each one of the
column vectors?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Think of these two things as a
column vector.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Pull out all the scalars from
them that you can.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Well, you see that c1 is a
common factor of both entries

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and so is e to the negative t,
that function.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now, if I pull both of those
out of the vector,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
what is left of the vector?
Well, you cannot even see it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
What is left is a 1 up here and
a one-half there.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So I am going to write that in
the following form.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I will put out the c1,
it's the common factor in both,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and put that out front.
Then I will put in the guts of

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the vector, even though you
cannot see it,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:50.000
the column vector 1,
one-half.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then I will put the other

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
scalar function in back.
The only reason for putting one

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
of these in front and one in
back is visual so to make it

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
easy to read.
There is no other reason.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You could put the c1 here,
you could put it here,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000
you could put the e negative t
in front if you want

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to, but people will fire you.
Don't do that.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Write it the standard way
because that is the way that it

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is easiest to read.
The constants out front,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
the functions behind,
and the column vector of

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
numbers in the middle.
And so the other one will be

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
written how?
Well, here, that one is a

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
little more transparent.
c2, 1, 2 and the other thing is

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
e to the negative 6t.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
There is our solution.
That is going to need a lot of

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
purple, but I have it.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And now I want to talk about
how the new method of solving

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the equation.
It is based just on the same

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
idea as the way we solve
second-order equations.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Yes, question.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Oh, here.
Sorry.
This should be negative two.
Thanks very much.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
What I am going to use is a
trial solution.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Remember when we had a
second-order equation with

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
constant coefficients the very
first thing I did was I said we

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
are going to try a solution of
the form e to the rt.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Why that?
Well, because Oiler thought of

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
it and it has been known for
or 300 years that that is the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
thing you should do.
Well, this has not been known

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
nearly as long because matrices
were only invented around

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
or so, and people did not really
use them to solve systems of

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:47.000
differential equations until the
middle of the last century,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
1950-1960.
If you look at books written in

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.000
1950, they won't even talk about
systems of differential

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
equations, or talk very little
anyway and they won't solve them

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:03.000
using matrices.
This is only 50 years old.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I mean, my God,
in mathematics that is very up

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
to date, particularly elementary
mathematics.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Anyway, the method of solving
is going to use as a trial

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000
solution.
Now, if you were left to your

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
own devices you might say,
well, let's try x equals some

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.000
constant times e to the lambda1
t and y

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
equals some other constant times
e to the lambda2 t.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Now, if you try that,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
it is a sensible thing to try,
but it will turn out not to

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
work.
And that is the reason I have

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
written out this particular
solution, so we can see what

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:55.000
solutions look like.
The essential point is here is

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the basic solution I am trying
to find.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Here is another one.
Their form is a column vector

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
of constants.
But they both use the same

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
exponential factor,
which is the point.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000
In other words,
I should not use here,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in my trial solution,
two different lambdas,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I should use the same lambda.
And so the way to write the

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
trial solution is (x,
y) equals two unknown numbers,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:38.000
that or that or whatever,
times e to a single unknown

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
exponent factor.
Let's call it lambda t.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
It is called lambda.
It is called r.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It is called m.
I have never seen it called

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
anything but one of those three
things.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
I am using lambda.
Your book uses lambda.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It is a common choice.
Let's stick with it.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now what is the next step?
Well, we plug into the system.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Substitute into the system.
What are we going to get?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Well, let's do it.
First of all,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I have to differentiate.
The left-hand side asks me to

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000
differentiate this.
How do I differentiate this?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Column vector times a function.
Well, the column vector acts as

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
a constant.
And I differentiate that.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
That is lambda e to the lambda
t.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So the (x, y) prime is (a1,
a2) times e to the lambda t

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
times lambda.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Now, it is ugly to put the

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:44.000
lambda afterwards because it is
a number so you should put it in

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000
front, again,
to make things easier to read.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
But this lambda comes from
differentiating e to the lambda

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000
t and using the chain rule.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This much is the left-hand
side.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That is the derivative (x,
y) prime.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I differentiate the x and I
differentiated the y.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
How about the right-hand side.
Well, the right-hand side is

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:13.000
negative 2, 2,
2, negative 5 times what?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Well, times (x,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
y), which is (a1,
a2) e to the lambda t.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Now, the same thing that

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
happened a month or a month and
a half ago happens now.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The whole point of making that
substitution is that the e to

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
the lambda t,
the function part of it drops

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
out completely.
And one is left with what?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
An algebraic equation to be
solved for lambda a1 and a2.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
In other words,
by means of that substitution,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and it basically uses the fact
that the coefficients are

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
constant, what you have done is
reduced the problem of calculus,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
of solving differential
equations, to solving algebraic

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
equations.
In some sense that is the only

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
method there is,
unless you do numerical stuff.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
You reduce the calculus to
algebra.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The Laplace transform is
exactly the same thing.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
All the work is algebra.
You turn the original

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.000
differential equation into an
algebraic equation for Y of s,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
you solve it,
and then you use more algebra

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000
to find out what the original
little y of t was.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It is not different here.
So let's solve this system of

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000
equations.
Now, the whole problem with

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
solving this system,
first of all,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000
what is the system?
Let's write it out explicitly.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Well, it is really two
equations, isn't it?

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:50.000
The first one says lambda a1 is
equal to negative 2 a1

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
plus 2 a2.
That is the first one.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
The other one says lambda a2 is
equal to 2 a1 minus 5 a2.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Now, purely,
if you want to classify that,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that is two equations and three
variables, three unknowns.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
The a1, a2, and lambda are all
unknown.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And, unfortunately,
if you want to classify them

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
correctly, they are nonlinear
equations because they are made

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
nonlinear by the fact that you
have multiplied two of the

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000
variables.
Well, if you sit down and try

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
to hack away at solving those
without a plan,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
you are not going to get
anywhere.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It is going to be a mess.
Also, two equations and three

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
unknowns is indeterminate.
You can solve three equations

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and three unknowns and get a
definite answer,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:55.000
but two equations and three
unknowns usually have an

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000
infinity of solutions.
Well, at this point it is the

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
only idea that is required.
Well, this was a little idea,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
but I assume one would think of
that.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And the idea that is required
here is, I think,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
not so unnatural,
it is not to view these a1,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
a2, and lambda as equal.
Not all variables are created

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
equal.
Some are more equal than

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
others.
a1 and a2 are definitely equal

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to each other,
and let's relegate lambda to

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000
the background.
In other words,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I am going to think of lambda
as just a parameter.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I am going to demote it from
the status of variable to

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
parameter.
If I demoted it further it

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000
would just be an unknown
constant.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That is as bad as you can be.
I am going to focus my

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
attention on the a1,
a2 and sort of view the lambda

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000
as a nuisance.
Now, as soon as I do that,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
I see that these equations are
linear if I just look at them as

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
equations in a1 and a2.
And moreover,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.000
they are not just linear,
they are homogenous.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Because if I think of lambda
just as a parameter,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I should rewrite the equations
this way.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I am going to subtract this and
move the left-hand side to the

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000
right side, and it is going to
look like (minus 2 minus lambda)

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
times a1 plus 2 a2 is equal to
zero.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And the same way for the other

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
one.
It is going to be 2a1 plus,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000
what is the coefficient,
(minus 5 minus lambda) a2

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
equals zero.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
That is a pair of simultaneous
linear equations for determining

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:54.000
a1 and a2, and the coefficients
involved are parameter lambda.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Now, what is the point of doing
that?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Well, now the point is whatever
you learned about linear

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
equations, you should have
learned the most fundamental

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:12.000
theorem of linear equations.
The main theorem is that you

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
have a square system of
homogeneous equations,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
this is a two-by-two system so
it is square,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
it always has the trivial
solution, of course,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000
a1, a2 equals zero.
Now, we don't want that trivial

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
solution because if a1 and a2
are zero, then so are x and y

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.000
zero.
Now that is a solution.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Unfortunately,
it is of no interest.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
If the solution were x,
y zero, it corresponds to the

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
fact that this is an ice bath.
The yoke is at zero,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
the white is at zero and it
stays that way for all time

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
until the ice melts.
So that is the solution we

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:58.000
don't want.
We don't want the trivial

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
solution.
Well, when does it have a

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
nontrivial solution?
Nontrivial means non-zero,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
in other words.
If and only if this determinant

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
is zero.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.000
In other words,
by using that theorem on linear

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000
equations, what we find is there
is a condition that lambda must

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:34.000
satisfy, an equation in lambda
in order that we would be able

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
to find non-zero values for a1
and a2.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Let's write it out.
I will recopy it over here.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000
What was it?
Negative 2 minus lambda,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000
two, here it was 2 and minus 5
minus lambda.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000
All right.
You have to expand the

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
determinant.
In other words,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
we are trying to find out for
what values of lambda is this

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
determinant zero.
Those will be the good values

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
which lead to nontrivial
solutions for the a's.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
This is the equation lambda
plus 2.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000
See, this is minus that and
minus that, the product of the

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
two minus ones is plus one.
So it is lambda plus 2 times

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
lambda plus 5,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.000
which is the product of the two
diagonal elements,

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:31.000
minus the product of the two
anti-diagonal elements,

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000
which is 4, is equal to zero.
And if I write that out,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000
what is that,
that is the equation lambda

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
squared plus 7 lambda,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
5 lambda plus 2 lambda,
and then the constant term is

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:54.000
10 minus 4 which is 6.
How many of you have long

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
enough memories,
two-day memories that you

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000
remember that equation?
When I did the method of

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
elimination, it led to exactly
the same equation except it had

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
r's in it instead of lambda.
And this equation,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
therefore, is given the same
name and another color.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Let's make it salmon.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And it is called the
characteristic equation for this

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
method.
All right.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Now I am going to use now the
word from last time.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000
You factor this.
From the factorization we get

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
its root easily enough.
The roots are lambda equals

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
negative 1 and
lambda equals negative 6

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
by factoring the
equation.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Now what I am supposed to do?
You have to keep the different

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:09.000
parts of the method together.
Now I have found the only

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
values of lambda for which I
will be able to find nonzero

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000
values for the a1 and a2.
For each of those values of

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
lambda, I now have to find the
corresponding a1 and a2.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Let's do them one at a time.
Let's take first lambda equals

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:32.000
negative one.
My problem is now to find a1

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and a2.
Where am I going to find them

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000
from?
Well, from that system of

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
equations over there.
I will recopy it over here.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
What is the system?
The hardest part of this is

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
dealing with multiple minus
signs, but you had experience

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000
with that in determinants so you
know all about that.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000
In other words,
there is the system of

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000
equations over there.
Let's recopy them here.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Minus 2, minus minus 1 makes
minus 1.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
What's the other coefficient?
It is just plain old 2.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Good.
There is my first equation.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And when I substitute lambda
equals negative one

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
for the second equation,
what do you get?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000
2 a1 plus negative 5 minus
negative 1 makes negative 4.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000
There is my system that will
find me a1 and a2.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.000
What is the first thing you
notice about it?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000
You immediately notice that
this system is fake because this

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.000
second equation is twice the
first one.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Something is wrong.
No, something is right.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
If that did not happen,
if the second equation were not

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000
a constant multiple of the first
one then the only solution of

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
the system would be a1 equals
zero, a2 equals zero because the

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
determinant of the coefficients
would not be zero.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:35.000
The whole function of this
exercise was to find the value

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
of lambda, negative 1,
for which the system would be

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
redundant and,
therefore, would have a

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
nontrivial solution.
Do you get that?

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
In other words,
calculate the system out,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
just as I have done here,
you have an automatic check on

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
the method.
If one equation is not a

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000
constant multiple of the other
you made a mistake.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000
You don't have the right value
of lambda or you substituted

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
into the system wrong,
which is frankly a more common

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
error.
Go back, recheck first the

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:19.000
substitution,
and if convinced that is right

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000
then recheck where you got
lambda from.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
But here everything is going
fine so we can now find out what

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
the value of a1 and a2 are.
You don't have to go through a

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
big song and dance for this
since most of the time you will

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000
have two-by-two equations and
now and then three-by-three.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
For two-by-two all you do is,
since we really have the same

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.000
equation twice,
to get a solution I can assign

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:53.000
one of the variables any value
and then simply solve for the

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
other.
The natural thing to do is to

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000
make a2 equal one,
then I won't need fractions and

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
then a1 will be a2.
So the solution is (2,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
1).
I am only trying to find one

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
solution.
Any constant multiple of this

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
would also be a solution,
as long as it wasn't zero,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
zero which is the trivial one.
And, therefore,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
this is a solution to this
system of algebraic equations.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
And the solution to the whole
system of differential equations

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
is, this is only the (a1,
a2) part.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I have to add to it,
as a factor,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000
lambda is negative,
therefore, e to the minus t.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
There is our purple thing.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:56.000
See how I got it?
Starting with the trial

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
solution, I first found out
through this procedure what the

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.000
lambda's have to be.
Then I took the lambda and

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
found what the corresponding a1
and a2 that went with it and

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000
then made up my solution out of
that.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Now, quickly I will do the same
thing for lambda

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000
equals negative 6.
Each one of these must be

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:19.000
treated separately.
They are separate problems and

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
you are looking for separate
solutions.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Lambda equals negative 6.
What do I do?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
How do my equations look now?
Well, the first one is minus 2

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
minus negative 6 makes plus 4.
It is 4a1 plus 2a2 equals zero.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Then I hold my breath while I

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:43.000
calculate the second one to see
if it comes out to be a constant

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
multiple.
I get 2a1 plus negative 5 minus

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
negative 6, which makes plus 1.
And, indeed,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
one is a constant multiple of
the other.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
I really only have on equation
there.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I will just write down
immediately now what the

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:15.000
solution is to the system.
Well, the (a1,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
a2) will be what?
Now, it is more natural to make

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:25.000
a1 equal 1 and then solve to get
an integer for a2.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:31.000
If a1 is 1, then a2 is negative
2.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And I should multiply that by e
to the negative 6t

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000
because negative 6 is the
corresponding value.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.000
There is my other one.
And now there is a

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
superposition principle,
which if I get a chance will

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
prove for you at the end of the
hour.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000
If not, you will have to do it
yourself for homework.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Since this is a linear system
of equations,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
once you have two separate
solutions, neither a constant

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
multiple of the other,
you can multiply each one of

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
these by a constant and it will
still be a solution.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000
You can add them together and
that will still be a solution,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
and that gives the general
solution.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
The general solution is the sum
of these two,

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:22.000
an arbitrary constant.
I am going to change the name

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
since I don't want to confuse it
with the c1 I used before,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:28.000
times the first solution which
is (2, 1) e to the negative t

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
plus c2, another arbitrary
constant, times 1 negative 2 e

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
to the minus 6t.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Now you notice that is exactly

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:43.000
the same solution I got before.
The only difference is that I

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
have renamed the arbitrary
constants.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
The relationship between them,
c1 over 2,

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:59.000
I am now calling c1 tilda,
and c2 I am calling c2 tilda.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
If you have an arbitrary
constant, it doesn't matter

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
whether you divide it by two.
It is still just an arbitrary a

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
constant.
It covers all values,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:18.000
in other words.
Well, I think you will agree

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000
that is a different procedure,
yet it has only one

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
coincidence.
It is like elimination goes

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
this way and comes to the
answer.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
And this method goes a
completely different route and

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
comes to the answer,
except it is not quite like

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
that.
They walk like this and then

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.000
they come within viewing
distance of each other to check

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
that both are using the same
characteristic equation,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
and then they again go their
separate ways and end up with

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000
the same answer.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
There is something special of
these values.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
You cannot get away from those
two values of lambda.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Somehow they are really
intrinsically connected.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Occurs the exponential
coefficient, and they are

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
intrinsically connected with the
problem of the egg that we

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
started with.
Now what I would like to do is

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
very quickly sketch how this
method looks when I remove all

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
the numbers from it.
In some sense,

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000
it becomes a little clearer
what is going on.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.000
And that will give me a chance
to introduce the terminology

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000
that you need when you talk
about it.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Well, you have notes.
Let me try to write it down in

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
general.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:16.000
I will first write it out
two-by-two.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I am just going to sketch.
The system looks like (x,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
y) equals, I will still put it
up in colors.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Except now, instead of using
twos and fives,

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I will use (a,
b; c, d).

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000
The trial solution will look
how?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.000
The trial is going to be (a1,
a2).

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000
That I don't have to change the
name of.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
I am going to substitute in,
and what the result of

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
substitution is going to be
lambda (a1, a2).

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:12.000
I am going to skip a step and
pretend that the e to the lambda

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:17.000
t's have already
been canceled out.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Is equal to (a,
b; c, d) times (a1,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
a2).
What does that correspond to?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.000
That corresponds to the system
as I wrote it here.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.000
And then we wrote it out in
terms of two equations.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000
And what was the resulting
thing that we ended up with?

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Well, you write it out,
you move the lambda to the

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:44.000
other side.
And then the homogeneous system

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000
is we will look in general how?
Well, we could write it out.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
It is going to look like a
minus lambda,

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
b, c, d minus lambda.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.000
That is just how it looks there

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
and the general calculation is
the same.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Times (a1, a2) is equal to
zero.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
This is solvable nontrivially.
In other words,

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:19.000
it has a nontrivial solution if
an only if the determinant of

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:31.000
coefficients is zero.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Let's now write that out,
calculate out once and for all

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
what that determinant is.
I will write it out here.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:49.000
It is a minus lambda times d
minus lambda,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:52.000
the product of the diagonal
elements, minus the

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
anti-diagonal minus bc is equal
to zero.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
And let's calculate that out.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
It is lambda squared minus a
lambda minus d lambda plus ad,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000
the constant term from here,
negative bc from there,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
plus ad minus bc,

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.000
where have I seen that before?
This equation is the general

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
form using letters of what we
calculated using the specific

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
numbers before.
Again, I will code it the same

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:51.000
way with that color salmon.
Now, most of the calculations

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
will be for two-by-two systems.
I advise you,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000
in the strongest possible
terms, to remember this

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
equation.
You could write down this

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
equation immediately for the
matrix.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
You don't have to go through
all this stuff.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000
For God's sakes,
don't say let the trial

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:19.000
solution be blah,
blah, blah.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:21.000
You don't want to do that.
I don't want you to repeat the

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:25.000
derivation of this every time
you go through a particular

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
problem.
It is just like in solving

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.000
second order equations.
You have a second order

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
equation.
You immediately write down its

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000
characteristic equation,
then you factor it,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
you find its roots and you
construct the solution.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
It takes a minute.
The same thing,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
this takes a minute,
too.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
What is the constant term?
Ad minus bc,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:53.000
what is that?
Matrix is (a,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
b; c, d).
Ad minus bc is its determinant.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000
This is the determinant of that
matrix.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
I didn't give the matrix a
name, did I?

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I will now give the matrix a
name A.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
What is this?
Well, you are not supposed to

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:13.000
know that until now.
I will tell you.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
This is called the trace of A.
Put that down in your little

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
books.
The abbreviation is trace A,

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000
and the word is trace.
The trace of a square matrix is

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
the sum of the d elements down
its main diagonal.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
If it were a three-by-three
there would be three terms in

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
whatever you are up to.
Here it is a plus b,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
the sum of the diagonal
elements.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
You can immediately write down
this characteristic equation.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Let's give it a name.
This is a characteristic

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
equation of what?
Of the matrix,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:01.000
now.
Not of the system,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
of the matrix.
You have a two-by-two matrix.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
You could immediately write
down its characteristic

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
equation.
Watch out for this sign,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:14.000
minus.
That is a very common error to

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:17.000
leave out the minus sign because
that is the way the formula

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
comes out.
Its roots.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:23.000
If it is a quadratic equation
it will have roots;

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
lambda1, lambda2 for the moment
let's assume are real and

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
distinct.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
For the enrichment of your
vocabulary, those are called the

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.000
eigenvalues.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
They are something which
belonged to the matrix A.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
They are two secret numbers.
You can calculate from the

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:02.000
coefficients a,
b, and c, and d,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
but they are not in the
coefficients.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:06.000
You cannot look at a matrix and
see what its eigenvalues are.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:11.000
You have to calculate
something.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
But they are the most important
numbers in the matrix.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
They are hidden,
but they are the things that

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
control how this system behaves.
Those are called the

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
eigenvalues.
Now, there are various purists,

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:26.000
there are a fair number of them
in the world who do not like

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
this word because it begins
German and ends English.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Eigenvalues were first
introduced by a German

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
mathematician,
you know, around the time

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
matrices came into being in
or so.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
A little while after
eigenvalues came into being,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000
too.
And since all this happened in

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Germany they were named
eigenvalues in German,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:53.000
which begins eigen and ends
value.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
But people who do not like that
call them the characteristic

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
values.
Unfortunately,

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
it is two words and takes a lot
more space to write out.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.000
An older generation even calls
them something different,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
which you are not so likely to
see nowadays,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.000
but you will in slightly older
books.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.000
You can also call them the
proper values.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Characteristic is not a
translation of eigen,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
but proper is,
but it means it in a funny

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
sense which has almost
disappeared nowadays.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
It means proper in the sense of
belong to.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
The only example I can think of
is the word property.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Property is something that
belongs to you.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.000
That is the use of the word
proper.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:49.000
It is something that belongs to
the matrix.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
The matrix has its proper
values.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
It does not mean proper in the
sense of fitting and proper or I

00:39:54.000 --> 00:40:00.000
hope you will behave properly
when we go to Aunt Agatha's or

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
something like that.
But, as I say,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
by far the most popular thing,
slowly the word eigenvalue is

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.000
pretty much taking over the
literature.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Just because it's just one
word, that is a tremendous

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
advantage.
Okay.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
What now is still to be done?
Well, there are those vectors

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
to be found.
So the very last step would be

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:30.000
to solve the system to find the
vectors a1 and a2.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
For each (lambda)i,
find the associated vector.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:46.000
The vector, we will call it
(alpha)i.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
That is the a1 and a2.
Of course it's going to be

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
indexed.
You have to put another

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000
subscript on it because there
are two of them.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:06.000
And a1 and a2 is stretched a
little too far.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:10.000
By solving the system,
and the system will be the

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:15.000
system which I will write this
way, (a minus lambda,

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
b, c, d minus lambda).

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:25.000
It is just that system that was

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
over there, but I will recopy
it, (a1, a2) equals zero,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.000
zero.
And these are called the

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
eigenvectors.
Each of these is called the

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.000
eigenvector associated with or
belonging to,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.000
again, in that sense of
property.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Eigenvector,
let's say belonging to,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I see that a little more
frequently, belonging to lambda

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:04.000
i.
So we have the eigenvalues,

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
the eigenvectors and,
of course, the people who call

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000
them characteristic values also
call these guys characteristic

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:14.000
vectors.
I don't think I have ever seen

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
proper vectors,
but that is because I am not

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
old enough.
I think that is what they used

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:22.000
to be called a long time ago,
but not anymore.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.000
And then, finally,
the general solution will be,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
by the superposition principle,
(x, y) equals the arbitrary

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:36.000
constant times the first
eigenvector times the eigenvalue

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000
times the e to the corresponding
eigenvalue.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
And then the same thing for the
second one, (a1,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:50.000
a2), but now the second index
will be 2 to indicate that it

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:56.000
goes with the eigenvalue e to
the lambda 2t.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
I have done that twice.
And now in the remaining five

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
minutes I will do it a third
time because it is possible to

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
write this in still a more
condensed form.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:15.000
And the advantage of the more
condensed form is A,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
it takes only that much space
to write, and B,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
it applies to systems,
not just the two-by-two

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:26.000
systems, but to end-by-end
systems.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000
The method is exactly the same.
Let's write it out as it would

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:33.000
apply to end-by-end systems.
The vector I started with is

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
(x, y) and so on,
but I will simply abbreviate

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:45.000
this, as is done in 18.02,
by x with an arrow over it.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:51.000
The matrix A I will abbreviate
with A, as I did before with

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:57.000
capital A.
And then the system looks like

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000
x prime is equal to --

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
x prime is what?
Ax.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000
That is all there is to it.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.000
There is our green system.
Now notice in this form I did

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000
not even tell you whether this a
two-by-two matrix or an

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:26.000
end-by-end.
And in this condensed form it

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.000
will look the same no matter how
many equations you have.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Your book deals from the
beginning with end-by-end

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.000
systems.
That is, in my view,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.000
one of its weaknesses because I
don't think most students start

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
with two-by-two.
Fortunately,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
the book double-talks.
The theory is end-by-end,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
but all the examples are
two-by-two.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000
So just read the examples.
Read the notes instead,

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:59.000
which just do two-by-two to
start out with.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000
The trial solution is x equals
what?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000
An unknown vector alpha times e
to the lambda t.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Alpha is what we called a1 and

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000
a2 before.
Plug this into there and cancel

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
the e to the lambda t's.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
What do you get?
Well, this is lambda alpha e to

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.000
the lambda t equals A alpha e to
the lambda t.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:42.000
These two cancel.
And the system to be solved,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.000
A alpha equals lambda alpha.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And now the question is how do
you solve that system?

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Well, you can tell if a book is
written by a scoundrel or not by

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:03.000
how they go --
A book, which is in my opinion

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
completely scoundrel,
simply says you subtract one

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:13.000
from the other,
and without further ado writes

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.000
A minus lambda,
and they tuck a little I in

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
there and write alpha equals
zero.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Why is the I put in there?
Well, this is what you would

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
like to write.
What is wrong with this

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.000
equation?
This is not a valid matrix

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:38.000
equation because that is a
square end-by-end matrix,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
a square two-by-two matrix if
you like.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:45.000
This is a scalar.
You cannot subtract the scalar

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
from a matrix.
It is not an operation.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000
To subtract matrices they have
to be the same size,

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
the same shape.
What is done is you make this a

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000
two-by-two matrix.
This is a two-by-two matrix

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:02.000
with lambdas down the main
diagonal and I elsewhere.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And the justification is that
lambda alpha is the same thing

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:11.000
as the lambda I times alpha
because I is an identity matrix.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Now, in fact,
jumping from here to here is

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:19.000
not something that would occur
to anybody.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:22.000
The way it should occur to you
to do this is you do this,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:27.000
you write that,
you realize it doesn't work,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
and then you say to yourself I
don't understand what these

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.000
matrices are all about.
I think I'd better write it all

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
out.
And then you would write it all

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000
out and you would write that
equation on the left-hand board

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
there.
Oh, now I see what it should

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:47.000
look like.
I should subtract lambda from

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
the main diagonal.
That is the way it will come

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000
out.
And then say,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:54.000
hey, the way to save lambda
from the main diagonal is put it

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:57.000
in an identity matrix.
That will do it for me.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:00.000
In other words,
there is a little detour that

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:03.000
goes from here to here.
And one of the ways I judge

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:07.000
books is by how well they
explain the passage from this to

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000
that.
If they don't explain it at all

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.000
and just write it down,
they have never talked to

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:17.000
students.
They have just written books.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Where did we get finally here?
The characteristic equation

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.000
from that, I had forgotten what
color.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
That is in salmon.
The characteristic equation,

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
then, is going to be the thing
which says that the determinant

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
of that is zero.
That is the circumstances under

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
which it is solvable.
In general, this is the way the

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
characteristic equation looks.
And its roots,

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:44.000
once again, are the
eigenvalues.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
And from then you calculate the
corresponding eigenvectors.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Okay.
Go home and practice.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000
In recitation you will practice
on both two-by-two and

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:56.000
three-by-three cases,
and we will talk more next

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000
time.

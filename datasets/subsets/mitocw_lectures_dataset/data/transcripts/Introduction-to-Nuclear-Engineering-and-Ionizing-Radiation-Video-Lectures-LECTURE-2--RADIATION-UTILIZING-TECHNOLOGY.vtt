00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:23.460
MICHAEL SHORT: I
wanted to give you guys

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.012
a survey of radiation
utilizing technology

00:00:26.012 --> 00:00:28.470
and tell you a little bit about
the way this department has

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.240
changed the way it teaches.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.780
It used to be in our department
and probably everywhere else

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.060
around the country
that first we teach you

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.618
the theory of how things go
down and understand them,

00:00:39.618 --> 00:00:41.160
and then we can
teach you the context

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.600
in which they're placed.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.948
This resulted in a rather boring
curriculum, in my opinion,

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:47.490
having been one of
the ones that went

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.940
through this actual curriculum.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.898
So for those who don't
know, I was an undergrad

00:00:50.898 --> 00:00:51.850
in this department.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.550
And while I learned a lot
of great things from folks,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.430
I also kept some mental notes
on what I would do differently,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.110
and now's the chance to do this.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.960
So instead, we've adopted
a context first theory

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.030
second approach, which
means we tell you

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.489
where we're going to show you
why should you pay attention

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.020
to the rest of the semester.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.350
Then we fill out the rest of
the theory and fill in the gaps

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.930
and then revisit the context
to show you what you've learned

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.770
and how you can understand it.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.310
That's why today is going
to be a rather light class.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.257
So don't take any notes, just
listen, enjoy, ask questions.

00:01:20.257 --> 00:01:22.590
And I'm going to show you
some of the applications where

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.500
we use radiation and
the principles of NSE

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.090
and technology today.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.650
And for recitation
today since we

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.762
haven't gone over any
technical material,

00:01:30.762 --> 00:01:32.220
we're going to be
heading to my lab

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.890
to demonstrate one of these
things, a sputter coder which

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.410
is a controlled system
for radiation damage

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.870
which applies one material
to the other via the process

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.980
of sputtering or actual nuclear
or ionic collisions that blast

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.230
material, in this case,
gold, onto whatever

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.730
you want to coat,
which in this case

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.073
is a pile of pocket change.

00:01:49.073 --> 00:01:50.990
So we're going to make
some gold change today.

00:01:53.285 --> 00:01:54.660
So the motivation
today is really

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.720
to get over two questions
is how can radiation

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.170
be used for benefit and what
is the physics behind how

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.430
it can be used?

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.880
I'll be using a zircaloy fuel
rod, the same kinds that you'd

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.740
see in a nuclear
reactor as the pointer

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.600
because I'm not a fan of lasers.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.620
And this is actually
incredibly light.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.380
I can hold it out at the
end, not much visible shaking

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.050
and I wanted you guys to see
and feel and try and bend

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.060
what zircaloy actually is like.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.300
That's a piece the same diameter
and dimensions and stuff

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.560
that you would see
in a nuclear reactor.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560
So give it a slight bend.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.700
If you try really
hard, you can bend it.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.590
But notice how light it is.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.260
Notice how strong it is.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.900
It's about midway in density
between stainless steel

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.200
and aluminum, but it's a hell
of a lot stronger than aluminum.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.900
It also has the added
benefit that it basically

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.370
doesn't absorb neutrons.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.010
The real reason we use
zircaloys, zirconium alloys

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.890
and reactors is that they
have very low interaction

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.737
probabilities or cross-sections.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:54.070
And for those who don't know
what those are, in a couple

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.690
of weeks we'll be defining
what a cross-section is.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.790
This stuff's pretty cool.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.980
Also what makes this
nuclear grade zircaloy

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.380
and not just
regular zirconium is

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.570
that there's no hafnium in it.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.870
Hafnium is chemically
very similar to zirconium,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.170
it also happens to be one of the
highest cross-section elements

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.370
that there is.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.050
So you hide the
stuff that you need

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.690
to be neutronically
transparent in reactors.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.240
It happens to be found in the
ground with the last thing

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.650
you'd want in your
fuel cladding.

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.640
In fact, you can use hafnium as
a control rod or control blade.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.000
So the difference in
chemistry and in cost

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.850
between nuclear zirconium
what you've got there,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.410
and regular zirconium
is the hafnium

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.680
has been taken out by some very
painful chemical separation.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.770
Usually you'd find
about 3% or 4% hafnium.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.110
So there's all sorts of
technologies that we use,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.450
the principles of nuclear
science and engineering.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.580
I'm just going to
say NSE from now on.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.070
You're all probably
pretty familiar with power

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.240
and maybe familiar with
some of these other ones.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.420
Like medical isotopes
are the backbone

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.240
of a lot of imaging
techniques to find and treat

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.650
different maladies.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.890
Space is basically a giant
maelstrom of radiation

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.145
so you can both use it and
have to shield from it.

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:05.520
We'll go over some
of the crazier

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.880
ways of shielding from space
radiation, actually today.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.740
Semiconductors.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.350
The way that the MIT
reactor made about 60%

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.600
of its operating
budget until recently

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.410
was by irradiating crystals of
silicon single, crystal bools

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.110
or ingots of silicon, to
make what's called an n type

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.580
semiconductor, via
the following reaction

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.630
if I can find an eraser.

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.350
I'm going to use the shorthand
that we talked about last time.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:43.370
Normally you would take
silicon and you add a neutron

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.620
and you end up
forming phosphorus.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.460
I've not memorized the masses
of the isotope, but in the end

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.920
this is actually a neutron
capture reaction, and then

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.350
a resulting decay,
which produces

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.750
phosphorus, which is what's
also known as an n type dopant.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.230
It's a sort of extra negative--

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.830
what is it? --a
negative charge type

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.170
dopant that changes
the conductivity

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.580
of the semiconductor.

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.280
There's lots of different
ways of doping semiconductors.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.840
One of the best
and most uniform is

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.610
to stick things in the reactor.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.190
So back when silicon
ingots were smaller,

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.143
like 4 or 6 inches
in diameter, there

00:05:18.143 --> 00:05:20.060
was a constant train of
these things traveling

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.950
through the reactor
getting irradiated

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.430
and being sold and then cut up
into wafers to make devices.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:28.520
And it used to be
students or Europe jobs

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.930
to load and unload those
things from the reactor.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.268
Now, it's not that dangerous.

00:05:32.268 --> 00:05:34.310
As long as you use the
right handling procedures,

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.670
like put them on a cart,
pull the cart at arm's length

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.010
and push like that,
your dose is very low.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.400
And that's because for a
given point source emitter,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.700
the dose you receive drops off
as 1 over r or the distance

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.270
squared, which means
that your arm's length,

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.930
let's say your arm
is about a meter,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.000
you can drop the
dose by quite a bit

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.400
compared to what's
called the contact dose.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.340
Well, this poor fool held
the silicon ingots up

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.460
to their chests like that.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.600
They were OK.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.450
They got about 10 months
of their yearly allowable

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:08.540
radiation dose that won't induce
any additional risk of cancer.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.710
But to ensure that they would
not exceed that allowable dose,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.080
they became the administrative
assistant for the reactor

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.160
for the next 10 months.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.170
So their job at the
reactor was to answer

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.380
the phone, which is not
a radioactive activity,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.140
including at the reactor.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.460
First nuclear power.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.340
The reason why I know a
number of you guys are here

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.250
is pretty simple.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.340
It's just a hot bucket of water.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.650
The way we make that
bucket of water hot

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:37.580
is by putting uranium or other
fuel into these rods assembling

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.730
a lot of them in a small
space where they then heat up

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.070
by producing nuclear
fission, capturing

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.470
the resultant kinetic energy
of the fission products

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.600
and neutrons and everything
else that comes out

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.540
and using it to either
heat up or boil water,

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.690
that's then just driven through
a heat exchanger and a turbine.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:57.290
So aside from
everything on this side,

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.620
it looks basically like any
other water cooled power plant.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.830
The difference is things get
toasty in a radioactive sense,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.370
but also pretty
well under control.

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.240
And what's inside a reactor--

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.900
if you say this is the diagram
of a typical Pressurized Water

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.440
Reactor or PWR where the
water is pressurized enough so

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.810
as to stop boiling
from occurring, keeping

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:22.700
the water liquid which has a
number of safety implications,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.167
you've got the core of
the reactor right here--

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:27.500
and these things right here
are called steam generators.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.600
It's nothing more than a heat
exchanger that generates steam.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.600
--and the steam generated in
here goes off somewhere else

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.120
and drives the turbine.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.950
If you look inside
this reactor you'll

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.090
notice a lot of different
fuel assemblies or fuel rods,

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:44.450
including things like control
rods or shut down rods,

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.940
rods made of neutron
absorbers like hafnium

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.970
that we talked about,
or gadolinium or boron

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.090
4 carbide or any other
material with a high capture

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.240
cross-section, meaning a high
probability for capturing

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.030
a neutron rather than
letting it go from one fuel

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:01.550
element to another to
produce more fission,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.380
to produce more heat.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.427
That's effectively
how a reactor works.

00:08:06.427 --> 00:08:08.260
So we went over a little
bit about the fuel.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.990
The fission and the
energetics is kind of cool.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.730
So let's say you start
off with uranium,

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:20.010
probably the
fissile isotope 235,

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:22.790
and you send in one neutron--

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.320
think it's 92.

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.940
Don't quote me on that though.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.730
--and instead of undergoing
some sort of a capture reaction

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:33.630
or something else, it can
split into what we call

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:37.220
different fission products.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.350
And plus, anywhere
between two or three

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.110
neutrons the usually
accepted number

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:47.090
is an average of about 2.44
neutrons plus gamma rays,

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:52.160
plus antineutrinos,
plus other energy

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.960
and some occasional other stuff.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.700
The main point here is
these fission products--

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.530
if let's say you had
a uranium nucleus

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.680
and it were to split in
half, fission products

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.940
go in other directions,
they carry with them

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.665
quite a lot of kinetic energy.

00:09:08.665 --> 00:09:11.290
And what we'll be doing a lot in
the second half of this course

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.070
is watching to see how do
these highly energetic nuclei

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:15.877
or atoms--

00:09:15.877 --> 00:09:17.710
when they slam into
other atoms, how quickly

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:18.970
do they lose energy?

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:20.800
How far do they tend to go?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.890
These fission products
tend to stop in the fuel.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.680
Their range is going to be
on the order of nanometers.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.020
I don't even think
it reaches microns.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.850
But the neutrons
however, as we saw

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.800
from looking at
Chadwick's paper,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.500
they can go pretty far,
usually on the order

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.710
of around 10 centimeters
in a reactor before they

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:39.610
go do something else.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.640
So it might make it
a few fuel rods over,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.720
and chances are get captured by
another uranium nucleus making

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.620
more fission, more neutrons,
and some other fun stuff

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.680
like gamma rays and neutrinos.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.690
Anyone not know
what a neutrino is?

00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:59.950
So a neutrino is a
very, very low mass

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.120
but not massless as was found
I think like last year; almost

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:05.800
speed of light particle
that's released

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.870
as part of radioactive decay.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:10.060
They basically don't
interact with matter,

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.010
but once in a while they do.

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.978
What that means is that
they travel straight

00:10:13.978 --> 00:10:14.770
through everything.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:16.930
It's been estimated that
trillions of neutrinos

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.480
from space are passing
through us per second

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.850
and on average you won't
get a single interaction

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:22.960
during a day.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.000
In fact, to detect
neutrinos they've

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.460
had to fill old hollowed
out salt mines with water

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.340
and fill them with photo
tubes in the hopes of catching

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.780
two or three a day.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.210
What that means is if
someone turns on a reactor

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.670
somewhere anywhere
in the world, it's

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:39.005
releasing tons and
tons of neutrinos

00:10:39.005 --> 00:10:40.630
and if all of a sudden
you start to see

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.640
two or three coming from
the same place, that's

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.990
a rare event.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:46.600
That's something with some
statistical significance.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.470
And there's been projects in
our department using neutrino

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.500
detectors to try and detect
where reactors are turning

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.030
on anywhere in the world.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:58.660
So we've been able to sense that
the MIT reactor is next door

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.827
from the building next door.

00:10:59.827 --> 00:11:01.827
I don't know how well
this is going to work when

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:03.430
you get to farther distances.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.040
But the physics is
pretty much there.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.660
It's an engineering problem
to figure out, well,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.020
how do you detect
enough neutrinos to get

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.210
a statistically
significant signal?

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.760
That, far as I know,
has not been solved.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:19.120
Hopefully, by this
time next year it will.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.910
There's also control rods--

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.680
rods filled with absorbers,
like I mentioned before.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.310
If you want to stop
this nuclear reaction,

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:30.420
you send in something like
hafnium or gadolinium or boron.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.960
So let's say, Boron-11,
like Chadwick knew,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.888
would be able to
capture a neutron.

00:11:36.888 --> 00:11:39.180
And then it would turn into--
what's the next one over?

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.300
Well, sorry.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.270
That's a one and a zero.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.800
That's a five.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.140
That should turn into carbon-12.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.420
And then you've
captured the neutron

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:50.730
instead of letting it
get into more uranium

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:52.465
and cause additional fissions.

00:11:52.465 --> 00:11:54.090
So when something's
going wrong, or you

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:56.250
want to control the power
level in the reactor,

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.360
you insert control rods.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.090
They soak up the
neutrons, and make

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:01.770
the reactor go subcritical.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:05.160
And we'll go over what all
these words mean in due time--

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.350
various points in the course.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.510
There's also coolant and
what's called moderation.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.030
Does anyone know what I mean
by moderation of neutrons?

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.012
Yeah?

00:12:14.012 --> 00:12:14.720
What do you mean?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.102
AUDIENCE: It thermalizes them.

00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:18.560
MICHAEL SHORT: It
thermalizes them.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.870
And in other words,
it slows them down.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.230
Because the probability
that each uranium nucleus

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:28.200
can capture a neutron depends
on the energy of the neutron.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.900
The cross sections
for interaction,

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.860
which we give the symbol sigma
for the microscopic or sort

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.000
of mass independent
cross section,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.240
they're functions of energy.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.970
They're extremely strong
functions of energy,

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:43.310
over the energy ranges
we're interested in.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:46.640
Because we're interested in an
extremely large energy range.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.985
These neutrons tend to be
born at around 1 to 10 MeV,

00:12:49.985 --> 00:12:51.770
or Megaelectron Volts.

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.980
And by the time they thermalize,
like you said, or reach roughly

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:57.950
room temperature, kinetic
energy is of about 2,200 meters

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:00.590
per second, they can be--

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:05.690
what is it-- a 40th or 0.025 eV,
fraction of an electron volt.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:09.620
So we're interested in nine
orders of magnitude of energy.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.960
And the cross
sections vary wildly

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.860
over these nine
orders of magnitude.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.970
And I'll show you what some of
these look like pretty soon.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.220
And in this case, in the
case of light water reactors,

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.190
like the PWR we saw, the
coolant and the moderator

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.560
are basically the same thing.

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.780
You guys remember how when
Chadwick put the paraffin

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:29.270
in front of the neutron
source, he started

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.310
to see more ionizations.

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.280
That's because the paraffin
is a great source of hydrogen.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.880
So is water.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.580
Water is an ideal
coolant because it

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.790
takes a lot of energy to heat
it up, and a lot to boil it.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.250
So you can store a lot of energy
with less of a temperature

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:44.360
difference in water.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.050
And it's full of hydrogen.
And kinematically, it's

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.950
easier for something
the size of a neutron

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.150
and the mass of a neutron
to slow a neutron down.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.040
Because a neutron
hitting a proton

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.880
can transfer up to all of
its energy ballistically.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.910
Then that proton won't move
very far because it's also

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.990
got charge on it.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.640
If a neutron hits
something heavier,

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.010
like stainless steel or
other stuff in the reactor,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:14.740
it cannot, by conservation
of energy and momentum,

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.300
transfer all of its energy.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.800
That fraction is
actually pretty small.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.712
So you'll see.

00:14:19.712 --> 00:14:21.670
We'll actually calculate
what that fraction is.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.430
But it drops off
pretty precipitously

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.860
as you start to get
heavier than hydrogen.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.530
And finally, there's
reflection and shielding.

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:32.080
We'll get into shielding
in terms of how much stuff

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.840
and how much matter does
it take to stop radiation

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.190
from getting through.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.200
In some cases, you
can stop it all.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.320
In some cases, like gammas,
you technically never can.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.260
You'll just get what's called
attenuation or continuous

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.940
removal of gamma rays.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.430
But chances are, you can't
remove every single photon

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.420
from getting out.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.028
It's only a matter of how much
do you need it to get down to.

00:14:53.028 --> 00:14:54.070
And there's a neat aside.

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:58.228
Who here has looked down into
a nuclear reactor before?

00:14:58.228 --> 00:14:58.770
Three of you.

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:58.970
Wow.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.470
Four.

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:00.300
OK.

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.385
What did you see?

00:15:02.385 --> 00:15:03.385
AUDIENCE: Not that much.

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:04.593
MICHAEL SHORT: Not that much.

00:15:04.593 --> 00:15:06.270
This is a particularly
powerful reactor

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.820
known as the Advanced
Test Reactor, or ATR,

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.545
at the Idaho
National Laboratory.

00:15:10.545 --> 00:15:12.420
You won't see any others
that look like this.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.270
One, because these
crazy-shaped fuel elements

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.980
are not that easy to make.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:19.290
This is a test or
a research reactor

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.460
where things get irradiated.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.740
It's about 125 megawatts.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:24.450
And the blue light
being produced

00:15:24.450 --> 00:15:27.450
is called Cherenkov radiation.

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.840
It's from electrons
and things moving,

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:33.390
or beta particles,
electrons, moving faster

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:35.682
than the speed of
light in water.

00:15:35.682 --> 00:15:37.890
Now, as you know, you can't
exceed the speed of light

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:39.240
in a vacuum.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.520
But things can move
through other media

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.640
faster than the speed of light
in that medium, effectively

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.400
producing optical
shock waves given off

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:50.250
as little blue cones of
light for each particle.

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.197
So when folks say, oh,
am I going to go green

00:15:52.197 --> 00:15:53.280
when I get near radiation?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.870
You can say, no,
you'll glow blue.

00:15:56.870 --> 00:16:00.130
They've just got the wrong
color on all the TV shows.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:01.520
And then onto fusion energy.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.640
Since most of us tend
to talk about fission

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.432
a lot of the time, but
how many of you here

00:16:05.432 --> 00:16:08.150
are interested in
going into fusion?

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.890
Usually, it's at
least half the class.

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:13.985
And so I figured this used to
be a fairly fission-centric

00:16:13.985 --> 00:16:15.360
teaching style in
the department.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.180
And I think fusion
deserves equal time.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.680
Because about an
equal number of you

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.930
want to go into fusion
to make it a reality.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:23.960
These reactors are laid
out fairly differently.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.660
What they'll be is a big,
hollow vacuum chamber

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.030
that's shaped like
a donut or a torus,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:33.020
and lots of magnets
to confine a plasma

00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:36.530
or sort of a charged mess of
separated ions and electrons

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:39.590
that whirls around in
millions of meters per second.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.130
Once in a while, these ions
and electrons, or especially

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.620
these nuclei, will
collide with each other

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.950
and undergo a fusion reaction,
or one of a few fusion

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.450
reactions that I've
written up here for you.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:54.770
So in this case, there's no
elements with a symbol d or t.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.770
We're just using those to
refer to deuterium or tritium

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:58.670
as a visual aid.

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.920
But you should know that
they're deuterium and tritium

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.560
from their atomic numbers.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.050
One, which means it's
an isotope of hydrogen.

00:17:06.050 --> 00:17:07.740
And their mass
numbers, two and three,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.200
which is not the mass
number for normal hydrogen.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.270
And in this case, when you
fuse deuterium and tritium,

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.150
you can produce helium
and another neutron.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.430
And so then those
neutrons can be

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.980
used to hit lithium,
which they'll usually

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.260
have in what's called a breeder
blanket around the outside,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.589
which releases more tritium.

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.740
So fusion reactors actually
can produce their own fuel.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.830
The trick is they're
radioactive gases, so containing

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.140
them can be kind of tricky.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.220
You also need a way to get
the helium out of the reactor.

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:42.020
But we have one of
these on campus.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.150
We have one of the only
three in the country.

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:45.470
It's called the Alcator C-Mod.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:49.030
Have any of you guys seen
a tour of this place yet?

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:49.870
Almost all of you.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.540
So for ever who hasn't,
do it this year.

00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:55.090
Because this may be the
last year of Alcator C-Mod's

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.120
operation.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.120
That's not to say there
won't be the next fusion

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.710
device on campus, but
there's one here right now.

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:03.140
And it might be a while
before the next one's built.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:06.100
So if you haven't seen it yet,
go and see it this semester,

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:08.440
definitely.

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:10.090
The reason why
fission and fusion

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.940
work from an
energetic standpoint,

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:16.240
is if we look at the
binding energy per nucleon--

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:19.510
remember, last time we
mentioned the binding energy

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:20.720
is the difference in energy.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.610
If you were to take, let's
say, a proton and a neutron

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:29.050
from infinitely far away,
and bring them together

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:31.910
to create a nucleus
of deuterium--

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.440
we'll call this D--

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.400
these two, the
energy of the proton

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.940
plus the energy of the neutron,
the rest mass energies, rather,

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:46.820
would be greater than the
energy of just deuterium.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.770
And that little bit
of mass that's changed

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:49.880
is converted into energy.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.250
And this is what's known
as the binding energy.

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.860
If we look at the binding
energy per nucleon

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.200
or per proton or
neutron, we can get

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.000
a relative ranking of how
tightly bound each nucleus is.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.550
So for the light
isotopes, smashing

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:08.140
them together should liberate
excess binding energy--

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.880
or sorry, excess energy--
because you'll gain

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.050
back some of that energy by the
conversion of mass to energy.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.720
Same thing over on this
side, just not as extreme

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.900
of a gradient.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:21.000
If you were to split
apart heavy nuclei,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.370
like uranium-235, you can
release a little bit of energy

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.420
in fission.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.400
And once you get
up here to iron,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.590
you can't go either
way, which is

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.200
why, if you think about the
biggest fusion reactors that

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.133
exist in the universe--
anyone know what they are?

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:36.800
AUDIENCE: Stars.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Stars, right.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.340
They tend to hit cores
of iron before they

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.920
either die out or
go all gravity crazy

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.140
and become black
holes of supernovas,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.310
or whatever you will.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.170
This is kind of
the energetic limit

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.300
for normal nuclear processes.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.800
Or if they become
a neutron star,

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.680
then things get beyond
the scope of this course.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.840
I won't be explaining
neutron stars.

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.718
There's a lot of medical
uses of radiation.

00:19:59.718 --> 00:20:02.010
I don't know if any of you
guys have seen these things.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.830
It's the only time I'll show
a tricky looking biology

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:07.740
diagram, because it's kind
of interesting to note.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.020
These are what's called
brachytherapy seeds,

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.440
little seeds of isotopes
that remit a certain type

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.650
and energy of radiation selected
for their applicability,

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:19.170
that can be implanted in the
body at the site of a tumor

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.380
to deliver localized
radiation treatment.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.240
You can either go in through
existing ports on the human,

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.660
and not having to drill
or cut a hole in someone,

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:30.358
or they can be implanted
laparoscopically or surgically.

00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:32.400
So this way, if you don't
want to subject someone

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.400
to a whole body radiation
dose or chemotherapy,

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.340
or if you want to use it in
conjunction with chemotherapy,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:41.370
you can implant a tiny little
seed of a radioactive material

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.040
in there to deliver a
certain dose to a tumor,

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.330
and then take it out.

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.250
And that way you
know very, very well

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.830
what the dose is going to
be, because you can measure

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:52.710
the activity or the number
of decays per second

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:54.570
of that brachytherapy seed.

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.830
And you know how it's
going to change over time.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.830
Because you know the
half-life of the particular

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.290
isotope that you've looked at.

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:03.180
There's also things
like imaging.

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.850
You can have someone
ingest an isotope

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:10.260
like technetium-99 metastable,
to highlight certain organs

00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.910
or things in the body
that you can then

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.788
image later by their decay
gamma rays or other phenomena.

00:21:15.788 --> 00:21:18.330
It's also one of those reasons
why when you go in an airport,

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:20.538
you have to tell them if
you've had a medical imaging

00:21:20.538 --> 00:21:21.540
procedure.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.910
Because a lot of these places
have radiation detectors.

00:21:23.910 --> 00:21:27.120
And if you are radioactive
and don't identify yourself,

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.070
you will quickly be
identified and taken

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.910
into the back room
to the probulator,

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.910
or whatever they're going
to do at the airports.

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:33.452
I don't know.

00:21:33.452 --> 00:21:36.540
I've never been searched I
don't plan on that happening.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.490
There's also X-ray
and proton therapy

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:43.020
sending in well-known, well
energy-characterized radiation

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.120
to fry tumors or other things.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:48.510
In the case of X-rays,
you're relying on what's

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:50.700
called exponential attenuation.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.520
If you look at the
distance into a material,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.060
and you look at the
intensity of the X-rays--

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:04.410
say, at x equals zero,
this is your X-ray source.

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:06.930
This is your incoming intensity.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.615
It falls off exponentially
with distance.

00:22:10.615 --> 00:22:12.240
You might then ask
yourself, all right,

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:16.290
if my tumor is this deep, and
I apply that radiation dose

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.842
to the tumor, what
about the rest?

00:22:19.842 --> 00:22:21.800
What about the part of
the body that the X-rays

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:25.670
have to travel through in
order to get to that site?

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:28.070
Anyone know how you would
deliver more X-rays to a tumor

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:31.190
than the surrounding tissue?

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:32.362
Anyone have any ideas?

00:22:32.362 --> 00:22:32.862
Yeah?

00:22:32.862 --> 00:22:34.410
AUDIENCE: Go from
different angles

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.362
so the rays intersect
on the tumor.

00:22:36.362 --> 00:22:37.320
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.570
Go from different
angles so the rays

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:41.490
would intersect on the tumor.

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.570
I'll have a better diagram,
but I'll draw one for now.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:49.900
Let's say, that's the
eyes and that's the tumor.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.200
You can wear this helmet
where X-rays can come in

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:55.970
from all different angles.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:58.480
And the X-ray emitter
would have to come in

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:01.630
from different angles, so that
as all the rays intersect,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:05.225
this part gets fried the
most, while keeping you

00:23:05.225 --> 00:23:07.600
from getting too much radiation
to the rest of your brain

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.890
and ceasing to function.

00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:11.110
There's also radio tracers.

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.670
I think I already covered those.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.540
So imaging, we already showed an
image of what this looks like.

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.545
The first X-ray
back in 1895 didn't

00:23:19.545 --> 00:23:20.920
have that good
resolution, but it

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.503
was kind of striking
in that you could

00:23:22.503 --> 00:23:25.300
see the difference in contrast
between bones and tissue.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.610
I should replace this
with the X-ray of my foot

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.220
that was my signing
bonus at MIT.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.200
My first day on
the job I went down

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.080
to clean one of the old
rooms in Northwest 13,

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.820
which is now where my labs are.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.530
And I moved a bunch
of boxes aside,

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:43.000
and a 200-pound steel plate,
jagged cut with plasma torch,

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.580
went down and smashed down
on the bones in my foot.

00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:49.400
And I had one of those temporary
feats of superhuman strength

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.525
and was able to lift it up.

00:23:50.525 --> 00:23:53.108
I went back to try to lift it
up and couldn't move it an inch.

00:23:53.108 --> 00:23:54.790
I don't know how I
got out of the plate.

00:23:54.790 --> 00:23:57.130
The next thing I remember,
I was crawling up the stairs

00:23:57.130 --> 00:23:58.750
to go to the hospital.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.580
But I did get an
X-ray, and they were

00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.380
able to sense that
the pain in my foot

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:03.850
was due to a hairline fracture.

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:06.730
It was like a fracture in the
bones that basically came back

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:07.700
together.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:10.900
But the improvement in
contrast resolution in X-rays

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:12.370
is what differentiates
the ability

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.920
to see a hairline fracture
from just the ability

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.420
to see that you contain bones.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.620
And the reason for
this, and we'll

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.960
be looking at a lot of
these curves in this course,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.110
is the differential absorption
or attenuation of X-rays,

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:28.990
or any photons of any energy
through different types

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:30.225
of matter.

00:24:30.225 --> 00:24:31.600
And so, for example,
here we have

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.930
the ICRU standardized
average soft tissue

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:37.960
attenuation, as well as bone.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.060
And you notice that
there's a few differences

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.750
in these curves.

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.747
So also, there's
some similarities.

00:24:43.747 --> 00:24:45.830
I'll note that these
actually have the same access

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:48.410
to the same units.

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:51.365
What do you guys notice that's
the same about these curves?

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:59.360
How about the value?

00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.820
They're basically the same--

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:05.090
mass averaged with very
little differences.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.930
If you look at where it hits
the y-axis, about 3 times 10

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:11.240
to the 3rd, 3 times
10 to the 3rd.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:15.380
The curves follow
basically the same shape.

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:16.730
What's the differences?

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:18.068
So Sean, what do you think?

00:25:18.068 --> 00:25:18.610
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:20.910
That little jagged
[INAUDIBLE] out there.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.070
MICHAEL SHORT: These
jagged edges right here.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.185
Anyone have any idea why?

00:25:25.185 --> 00:25:26.873
And these reasons
go back to what

00:25:26.873 --> 00:25:28.290
you learned in
high school in 8.02

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.540
in terms of atomic
transitions, not nuclear.

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.570
Anyone here remember the
k lines or the l lines?

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.930
Or what was it-- the--

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:40.928
which emission series
were they called--

00:25:40.928 --> 00:25:42.470
the different emission
lines that you

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.080
can get from emission
or absorption spectra?

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.530
It all has to do with
allowable electron transitions.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:53.000
And notice the units here are
in centimeters squared per gram.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.792
What's the main difference
between soft tissue and bone?

00:25:56.792 --> 00:25:58.740
AUDIENCE: Density.

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.770
MICHAEL SHORT: Say it
loud enough so I can hear.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:01.080
AUDIENCE: Density.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.038
MICHAEL SHORT: Density.

00:26:02.038 --> 00:26:05.890
Bone tends to be a fair bit
denser than soft tissue.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.070
So these are mass--

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:10.540
what is it-- mass
normalized curves.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.740
But the fact is, if you have a
bone that has a higher density,

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:16.530
then you're going to end
up with more absorption.

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:19.770
In addition, you can use some of
these features and differences

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.310
to your advantage.

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:25.830
Like, if you choose a
photon with energy here,

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.620
it might not be nearly as
absorbing in soft tissue

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:29.790
as it would in bone.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.890
So by selecting the
mass of the thing

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.960
you're trying to image
which you don't control,

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.750
and the energy of the photon
which you can control,

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.820
you can produce as
much possible contrast

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.570
as you can between
two different things.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:44.480
Is everyone clear on
how that could work?

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.110
Cool.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:47.450
We'll be going over why the
curves have these shapes,

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:52.140
especially these jagged
edges pretty soon.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:54.640
And like you said,
this is how you

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.750
irradiate a tumor with X-rays.

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.570
Because you can't quite
control the amount of dose

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.210
to any one part
unless you split it up

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:05.600
into a whole bunch
of different rays.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.250
Proton therapy is
quite different.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:08.780
It's a newer technology.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.050
And it relies on very
well-known and distinct ranges

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.270
of charged particles
to enter the body

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:16.550
with very little
damage, stop and do

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.520
their damage in the tumor, and
not come out the other side.

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:22.970
They just require significantly
more expensive hardware.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.430
There's one of these at Mass
General Hospital, or MGH,

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:26.590
down the road.

00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:30.170
It consists of a cyclotron or
a particle accelerator, which

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:34.065
injects and speeds up protons so
that they're moving very fast,

00:27:34.065 --> 00:27:35.690
then sends it in a
beam through a bunch

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:38.810
of bending magnets
and up to deliver

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.510
the protons to the patient.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:45.350
The way this works is you
start injecting the beam.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.480
And as it goes through
these two magnets,

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.460
or what's called dees,
every time it moves

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.560
through the magnet,
it's a charged particle

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.250
and a magnetic field.

00:27:53.250 --> 00:27:55.010
It has a fixed curvature.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.280
But every time it's accelerated
through this electric field

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.660
it speeds up, so the curvature
gets greater and greater

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.160
and greater.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.410
And it spins
outwards in a spiral

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.120
until they exit the beam.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.082
And by deciding how
long they get to spin,

00:28:07.082 --> 00:28:08.915
you get to choose the
energy of the protons.

00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:13.752
Why does proton therapy work?

00:28:13.752 --> 00:28:15.710
This has to do with a
difference in interaction

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:19.640
between charged particles and
photons, which have no charge.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:22.250
Charged particles
will lose their energy

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.950
in a very well-known way,
what's called the stopping power

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.670
formula, until they
actually stop in the matter

00:28:28.670 --> 00:28:30.290
that they are going through.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.960
Photons either scatter or
attenuate, or they don't.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.230
And you can't stop them all.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.310
So I want to run a quick Monte
Carlo simulation for you guys,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:43.610
and show you what protons
stopping in matter looks like.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.320
So this is a
program called SRIM,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.480
or the Stopping Range
of Ions and Matter.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.240
It uses the formulas that we'll
be deriving and developing

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.960
in this class to calculate
the trajectory of protons

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.370
in anything.

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:58.550
So let's say, you are
made basically of water.

00:28:58.550 --> 00:29:03.800
So let's say, you consist
of hydrogen and oxygen

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:05.870
in a stoichiometric
ratio of two to one.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.420
I think water approximates
humans pretty well.

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.300
So we'll find out what the
range of these actual protons

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.980
is in humans.

00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.570
So what we do know is that
it's a proton accelerator.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.580
And I know that
the MGH accelerator

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:28.300
has an energy of 250 MeV, or
250,000 kiloelectron volts.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.910
And finally, we decide
how thick is the person?

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:34.780
So how thick is a
person, typically?

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.140
How many-- what units do we get?

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:42.620
How many centimeters thick
is the average person?

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:44.728
AUDIENCE: Forward
or from the side?

00:29:44.728 --> 00:29:46.770
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's go
the shortest distance in,

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.570
so front to back.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.660
Maybe 10?

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:51.560
Right?

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.150
10 centimeters?

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:53.840
Not that much?

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.343
Can it get halfway through you?

00:29:55.343 --> 00:29:57.260
Only has to go halfway,
because you can always

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:58.540
lie in your stomach.

00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.040
All right.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.620
Let's go 10 centimeters.

00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:07.640
Most of the protons go
screaming right through you.

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.430
You notice they don't
actually stop in the person.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:14.920
So you don't tend to irradiate
people with 250 MeV protons

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:15.890
directly.

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.630
You'll actually slow
down their energy

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:21.290
to something a little more
reasonable, maybe 50 MeV.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:26.770
And then you can actually
watch each of these charged

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.260
particle tracks being computed.

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.520
As it hits, let's say,
imaginary nuclei or electrons,

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.010
the paths will be
slightly deflected.

00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:37.600
But what's really
striking is they

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.125
all tend to stop at
about the same place.

00:30:40.125 --> 00:30:42.250
That's the really cool
thing about charged particle

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:46.130
interactions, is if you know the
charge, you know the nucleus,

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.490
you know the energy, you
can calculate the range

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.530
to within a very narrow margin.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:52.120
And what this is
doing is just flying.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.490
Looks like it's
done 70 ions so far.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:59.070
And it will keep on flying them
until either you hit the end--

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.970
let's say, we set it
to do 100,000 atoms--

00:31:00.970 --> 00:31:04.537
or you just tell it to stop.

00:31:04.537 --> 00:31:06.370
Also, when you don't
have to draw the lines,

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.790
it goes way faster.

00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:10.570
So let's let it get
maybe 300 or 400 ions,

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:13.210
and we'll show you what the
average range of the protons

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:14.050
looks like.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:16.880
How far do they go
before they stop?

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.970
If we look at the
ion distribution

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.380
it's pretty striking.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.110
All of the protons, except
it looks like one of them,

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:29.790
stopped at a very fixed
depth of 41.9 millimeters

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:35.130
with very little straggle, maybe
0.6 millimeters on either side.

00:31:35.130 --> 00:31:36.690
So depending on
the depth of the--

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:41.190
you can even get a deep, very
shallow, very small tumor

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:42.750
if you get the
distance just right

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.460
and the proton
energy just right.

00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.410
This is why proton
therapy centers are

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:48.250
popping up all over the world.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:50.970
This is a much more
effective, though expensive,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:55.050
treatment for certain
types of tumors.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:57.270
At the same time, since
we're nuclear engineers,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.890
we may be concerned
with the amount

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:03.545
of radiation damage being
done to different materials.

00:32:03.545 --> 00:32:05.670
And so this is kind of a
measure of how much energy

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.370
the protons are losing
as they travel through.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:09.960
Notice, it's not zero.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:11.670
As soon as the protons
enter the person,

00:32:11.670 --> 00:32:14.070
they start to scatter
around, undergoing

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.600
some different interactions.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:19.200
But they mostly don't lose much
energy until they reach almost

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.545
their target depth.

00:32:20.545 --> 00:32:22.170
And what's called
the stopping power is

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:25.890
very low at high energies, very
high at low energies, which

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:29.280
means once they get slow
enough, they almost all

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.370
stop right there at what's
called the Bragg peak.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.200
And that's the basis
behind proton therapy.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.990
And you'll be able to understand
why every feature of this curve

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:39.660
looks the way it does by
the end of this course--

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.710
probably by the
end of this month.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:46.160
So let me stop that simulation
because we really could go

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.930
on forever, but we won't.

00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:52.900
Then the question is, what do
you do if the tumor is too big?

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.720
If the tumor is larger
than that straggling,

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:58.390
you actually have to sweep
the energy of the proton beam.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.370
So you can vary the
energy continuously

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.890
in what's called
intensity-modulated radiation

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.920
therapy, where you change
the energy of the proton,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.658
sweep it back and
forth across the tumor

00:33:07.658 --> 00:33:08.700
to cover the whole thing.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.550
So you can sweep out in 3D
space the size of whatever you

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:15.070
want to die, without
affecting the stuff that you

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.163
don't want to die.

00:33:18.163 --> 00:33:19.580
So in this case,
let's say, you'll

00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:22.490
apply protons of a certain
energy for some point,

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:24.710
and then another energy,
and then another energy.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:28.130
And you can maximize the
dose to a pretty flat level,

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.190
while minimizing the rest
of the dose to the patient.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:33.670
So even while changing
energies, the most dose

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:35.810
is done to the tumor,
and as little as possible

00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:37.227
is done to the
rest of the person.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:41.380
We already talked
about brachytherapy,

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:43.157
but we didn't say why it works.

00:33:43.157 --> 00:33:44.740
This is the first
major topic we'll be

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:46.240
talking about in this course.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.880
It relies on natural
radioactive decay.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:50.320
And for natural
radioactive decay,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:53.590
you need to understand
decay diagrams, which

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:56.620
are energy level diagrams
of which isotopes turn

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.500
into which others, by
which methods, and how

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.470
much energy they release
in each type of decay.

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:05.930
So for example, the
common one is iridium-192,

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:09.310
a pretty biocompatible isotope
because it's, well, it's

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:10.630
like a noble metal.

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:15.280
And iridium-192 can decay
by one of three pathways

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:20.330
and become platinum-192,
gaining a proton.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:22.887
Gaining a proton--
what has to happen

00:34:22.887 --> 00:34:23.929
for that to be conserved?

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:25.100
So let's think about this.

00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:37.949
Let's say we have platinum-192,
which decays naturally

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:41.820
into iridium-192.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:44.760
I can tell you, because we've
drawn the diagram to the right,

00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:47.469
it's going up one atomic number.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.920
So let's just say
that it had n protons,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:53.670
and it now has n plus 1.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.107
How do we balance
this nuclear reaction?

00:34:56.107 --> 00:34:56.940
What are we missing?

00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:00.836
Yep?

00:35:00.836 --> 00:35:02.297
AUDIENCE: [? Can the ?]
[? neutron ?] [? turn into ?]

00:35:02.297 --> 00:35:03.163
a [? proton? ?]

00:35:03.163 --> 00:35:04.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Can the neu--

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:04.830
OK.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:07.130
So there's a neutron
somewhere in this nucleus

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:08.583
that turns into a proton.

00:35:08.583 --> 00:35:10.250
What are the three--
what are the things

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.560
that we have to conserve
in any nuclear reaction?

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:15.750
Yep?

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.833
AUDIENCE: Just a question.

00:35:16.833 --> 00:35:18.775
Doesn't it go from
iridium to platinum,

00:35:18.775 --> 00:35:20.050
not platinum to iridium?

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:20.842
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:35:20.842 --> 00:35:21.870
Thank you.

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:23.157
I got that backwards.

00:35:23.157 --> 00:35:24.240
But the numbers are right.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.260
The symbols are wrong.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.300
Something else I'll
mention about this class.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.420
Please do stay on your toes to
correct silly things like that.

00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.430
I don't do scripts because
you didn't come here

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:37.200
to see me read off
a piece of paper.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.333
Everything's live.

00:35:38.333 --> 00:35:40.500
All the derivations are
going to be live because its

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.208
more interesting.

00:35:41.208 --> 00:35:42.792
It's certainly more
interesting for me

00:35:42.792 --> 00:35:44.510
to teach, so thank
you for catching that.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:46.802
And please do stay on your
toes if you something silly,

00:35:46.802 --> 00:35:49.200
especially if it's just not
the same as on the screen.

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.070
So like Luke said,
we made a proton,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.170
or a neutron turned
into a proton.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.090
What's not conserved
in this reaction?

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.385
Yep?

00:36:03.385 --> 00:36:03.740
AUDIENCE: Charge.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:04.657
MICHAEL SHORT: Charge.

00:36:04.657 --> 00:36:07.850
How do we balance that?

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:09.860
Well, let's add some
other particles.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.320
There's got to be some
sort of radioactive decay.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.120
So what are our
choices of particles?

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:17.620
Yep?

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:19.060
AUDIENCE: An electron.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:19.893
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:36:19.893 --> 00:36:20.710
An electron.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:24.790
Or more specifically, we'll
call it a beta particle.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.830
Just like a gamma
ray is a photon that

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.380
originates in the
nucleus, a beta particle

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:31.750
is an electron that
originates in a nucleus.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:35.020
You can't tell it's a beta
particle just by looking at it.

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.640
An electron is an electron.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.580
The only way you'd know
is either by its energy,

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.640
or by because they're another
source of electrons nearby.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:48.055
So in this case,
we get beta decay.

00:36:48.055 --> 00:36:49.180
This looks fairly balanced.

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.940
One thing that I'll
put in is beta decay

00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.790
is accompanied by
an antineutrino,

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.560
but I did not expect
anyone to know that.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.000
I just wanted to make sure
it's up there for completeness.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.860
So what we're relying
on is the movement

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:10.210
of these electrons, which are
high charge and low mass, which

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.920
means they're very low range.

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.500
Which means when you
implant a brachytherapy seed

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:17.470
into a person, the
irradiation volume

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.950
is only as large as the
energy of that beta particle

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:22.330
will allow.

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.760
The maximum energies
for these beta particles

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.520
are given by the differences
between the starting

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.450
and the ending energy.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.060
The way these diagrams
are constructed

00:37:31.060 --> 00:37:33.910
is your ending energy is
usually at an energy of zero,

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:37.090
which we refer to as the
ground state of that isotope.

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.450
And all of these are
relative energies

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.920
in MeV, or megaelectron volts.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.360
So for example, this
iridium-192 has a 40% chance

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.800
of decaying by beta
to platinum-192,

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.380
which means the electron
can have up to 1.4597 MeV.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:59.980
And if we know its energy,
we know its maximum range.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.710
So selecting the right
isotope and the right activity

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.870
for the right tumor
is quite important.

00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:06.550
Notice that there's
also other ways

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.410
in which this thing can decay.

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:11.710
It might release a beta
particle of a lower energy

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:16.510
and reach what's called an
excited state of platinum-192,

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:20.440
which can then decay by just
giving off this extra 612

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.248
keV of energy to
the ground state.

00:38:23.248 --> 00:38:24.790
So let's write that
nuclear reaction.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.920
Let's say we have
platinum-192, and I'll

00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:39.020
put a star to mention that it's
excited, becomes platinum-192.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.804
Where did the energy go?

00:38:40.804 --> 00:38:41.637
AUDIENCE: Gamma ray.

00:38:41.637 --> 00:38:42.512
MICHAEL SHORT: Gamma.

00:38:42.512 --> 00:38:43.832
So why do you say a gamma ray?

00:38:43.832 --> 00:38:46.620
AUDIENCE: Uh, because
that just seems to me

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.244
like the biggest source
of energy that's released

00:38:49.244 --> 00:38:51.197
in a reaction like this?

00:38:51.197 --> 00:38:53.030
MICHAEL SHORT: So you
said it's because it's

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:55.197
the biggest source of energy
that could be released?

00:38:55.197 --> 00:38:58.398
AUDIENCE: Well, it seems to
me, yeah, like, intuitively

00:38:58.398 --> 00:38:59.750
that would make sense.

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.500
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:01.465
What do you think?

00:39:01.465 --> 00:39:03.720
AUDIENCE: Isn't it a
thing when an electron

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.463
loses energy or drops an energy
level to release the proton?

00:39:07.463 --> 00:39:08.380
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:11.090
If an electron drops
down in energy levels,

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.520
you'll have released
an X-ray or a photon.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.690
But that's not a gamma ray.

00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:16.065
It's not coming
from the nucleus.

00:39:16.065 --> 00:39:16.681
Yep?

00:39:16.681 --> 00:39:17.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:17.598 --> 00:39:20.038
Doesn't it have to be a
gamma ray because of-- like,

00:39:20.038 --> 00:39:22.480
that's the only way it can
conserve mass [? momentum? ?]

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.438
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:39:23.438 --> 00:39:26.800
So the question with this is,
what do we have to conserve?

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.870
Mass momentum energy charge.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:32.350
If we have platinum-192
go into platinum-192,

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.960
the mass is pretty
much the same.

00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:35.460
Yep.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.020
Question, Luke?

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.510
AUDIENCE: What does it
mean to put platinum

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.635
in the excited [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:38.635 --> 00:39:42.412
MICHAEL SHORT: It means it's at
a higher energy nuclear state.

00:39:42.412 --> 00:39:44.620
It means that there is excess
energy in this nucleus.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.930
So the difference between
ground state or whatever

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:50.560
of iridium-192 and the
ground state of platinum-192

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.500
is 1.4597 MeV.

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.850
Notice I'm not rounding.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:56.380
Don't round.

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:59.110
And we can end up with a beta
particle that doesn't quite

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.780
release all that energy, leaving
some in the nucleus in what's

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.190
called an excited state.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.500
It's analogous to
if you have, let's

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:09.708
say, an atom of a, whatever
that happens to be.

00:40:09.708 --> 00:40:12.250
And since you started talking
about different electron energy

00:40:12.250 --> 00:40:16.210
levels, maybe this
atom is helium.

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:18.640
And it only has two electrons.

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:24.230
And one of them gained some
energy becoming excited up

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:25.760
to the next energy level.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.730
Same thing, but on
the nuclear level,

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:30.980
these excitations are
not in the eV range,

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.570
they're in the MeV range.

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:35.210
But you can think of it as a
precisely analogous process

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.290
for the time being.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.660
There are excited
nuclear energy levels,

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.600
and they can also decay
by photon emission--

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:46.680
in this case, gamma emission
because the masses are

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:47.850
basically the same.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:49.350
Remember that the
rest mass energies

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:52.110
might be slightly different,
but the charge is the same.

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:53.790
There's no real
change in momentum

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:56.280
because this is a nucleus
that started at rest.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:59.480
And this way the energy
can be conserved.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.693
Yeah, Sean?

00:41:00.693 --> 00:41:03.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in
different cases, if they're

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:06.550
excited, can they just go
through another decay process?

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.860
MICHAEL SHORT: Absolutely.

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:11.290
So there are multiple isomeric
transitions or gamma rays.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.840
So let's chart one of
the paths through here.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.010
There's a 14% chance that
iridium decays to this excited

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:19.740
state, and it can then
decay by gamma ray

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.340
to another excited state,
and then decay to ground.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.800
So there are lots of
different possible pathways.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.530
I've chosen a particularly
simple isotope

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:29.898
because it fits on the slide.

00:41:29.898 --> 00:41:31.440
In your homework,
you're going to get

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.190
to look at the decay
diagram for plutonium-239.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.470
There are not enough
pixels in this projector

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:39.660
to show the full
complexity of that.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:41.740
So you'll have to
zoom in a little bit.

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:43.770
But I'm not going to
ask you to do anything

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.930
with it except for
look at the three

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:50.730
most likely transitions out
of dozens, maybe scores,

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.080
who knows?

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:52.930
You guys will see.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:53.670
So that's a good question.

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:54.210
Yeah.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:57.072
It can decay from an excited
state, to an excited state,

00:41:57.072 --> 00:41:58.780
to an excited state,
to an excited state,

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.700
to an excited state and so on,
until it reaches the ground

00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.200
state.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:04.783
AUDIENCE: But does
it lose its energy,

00:42:04.783 --> 00:42:06.838
like, not by going
to ground state,

00:42:06.838 --> 00:42:10.902
but by decaying in some
more fission products?

00:42:10.902 --> 00:42:12.860
MICHAEL SHORT: It wouldn't
be fission products,

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:14.527
but everything else
you said is, yes, it

00:42:14.527 --> 00:42:17.480
can continue to lose energy
by continuously undergoing

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:19.130
radioactive decay.

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:22.220
And we're going to go some of
this when we explore the early

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:25.100
origins of the universe to say,
if you just started off with

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:27.890
a soup of protons
and other things,

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.170
you'd start to form all
the isotopes possible,

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:33.050
and the shortest half-life
ones would then decay--

00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:36.350
successive decays,
maybe multiple gammas

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:39.590
or multiple betas or multiple
alphas at the same time--

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.120
I'm sorry-- in
sequence, until it

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:44.360
reached something that was
stable, or stable enough

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.280
that it's still around now.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:49.550
For example, there's no
stable isotope of uranium.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:53.420
There's no isotope of
uranium that will not undergo

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:56.480
alpha or spontaneous fission.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.520
It's just that the
half-life is so long,

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.020
that there's still some left
since the universe began.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.577
There's still a fair bit left.

00:43:03.577 --> 00:43:05.410
But you guys are going
to actually calculate

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:08.440
as part of your homework
later in the course, how

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.620
much uranium-235 was there
when the earth was born?

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.060
And how much has
just disappeared

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:15.320
because of the passage of time?

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:20.320
So right now, it's
typically about 0.7% U-235

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.910
by isotopic composition.

00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:24.730
It was not the case
when the earth was born.

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:26.770
But you guys will be
able to figure that out.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.840
Yeah, so good question.

00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.300
And have a rant from me,
I guess, in response.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.610
I'll try and keep my
answers a little shorter.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.350
Oh, here's a crazy one--

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:39.240
not particularly crazy, though.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.570
So this is molybdenum
99 decaying

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:46.590
to technetium-99 metastable.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:51.060
There's lots of possible
decays, but the most likely one

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:52.080
is right here.

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.530
The state above the ground
state at about 140 keV,

00:43:55.530 --> 00:43:59.090
a fairly low-energy and
therefore more easy to detect

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.600
photon.

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.720
So if you notice, almost all
the other excited states,

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.670
with a couple
exceptions, decay down

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:10.830
to this 0.14 MeV excited
state, at which point

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:13.020
you get decays to
the ground state.

00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.760
Those also have a
rather long half-life.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:16.140
It's a few days.

00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.390
So you can make
moly-99 in a reactor,

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.570
transport it to a hospital,
feed it to someone,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.570
and use these 140
keV gamma rays,

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:26.220
because they come
from the nucleus,

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:30.740
to image whatever the
technetium will bond to.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:31.690
Yep, Carson?

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.070
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:35.278
MICHAEL SHORT: The M
stands for metastable.

00:44:35.278 --> 00:44:36.320
Now, where do you see it?

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:37.480
This one.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:37.980
Yep.

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:39.900
Because the direct decay--

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:44.280
you don't-- you never go from
molybdenum-99 to technetium-99

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.570
at the ground state.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:48.713
The M stands for metastable,
so it's an excited state.

00:44:48.713 --> 00:44:50.130
And metastable
tells you that it's

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.420
got a pretty long half-life.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.240
All of these other states
are excited states.

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:57.880
Metastable means it's
kind of, sort of, stable

00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:00.290
on, like, a human
time scale of things.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:02.610
It's not technically
stable, because stable

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:06.000
would mean infinite
half-life or close enough.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.590
But metastable means
long enough to be

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:10.440
detected or used, or
significantly longer

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.930
than the others.

00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.032
Any other questions
before I move on?

00:45:16.032 --> 00:45:18.430
Cool.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:22.070
So you can use these to image
where something is in the body.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:24.790
For example, you can
use this to highlight

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.460
certain organs,
highlight anything that

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.320
will absorb technetium.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.230
Or if you attach, let's say, the
technetium to a type of sugar

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:34.450
or something else that will
be uptaken by the body,

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.230
you can see where it goes.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.050
And you can use
gamma ray imagers

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:40.690
to make kind of heat
maps or radiation maps

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:43.120
of where the technetium's
going to find what

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:46.510
could be causing the problem.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.520
The problem is--
well, our main problem

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:51.700
is there are huge
moly-99 shortages.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.890
Right now the only
economically viable way

00:45:53.890 --> 00:45:56.567
to make molybdenum-99
is in reactors.

00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:58.900
And there's only a few of
these places in the world that

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.250
actually make them.

00:46:00.250 --> 00:46:04.000
And I don't see any on the US.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.830
We get ours from Canada.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:09.740
And these are slowly getting
closed down as we go.

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.200
So the question
is, with millions

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:13.680
of these diagnostic
procedures per year,

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.195
where is the moly-99
going to come from?

00:46:16.195 --> 00:46:18.070
That might be where some
of you guys come in.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.945
If you can use the
knowledge from this course

00:46:19.945 --> 00:46:22.450
to figure out an energetically
and economically feasible

00:46:22.450 --> 00:46:26.490
way to make more
moly-99, you're rich.

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:30.710
That's, you know,
life goal achieved.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:32.840
Space applications--
if we ever want

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:35.290
to get off this earth for a
significant amount of time,

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:37.040
we have to deal with
the fact that there's

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.740
no atmosphere in
space to shield us

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.530
from the high-energy protons
and other cosmic rays that would

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:45.380
otherwise, well, destroy life.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.690
So there's a lot of
interesting ideas,

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:50.000
and a lot of problems
with astronaut shielding.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.640
One of them is that the
protons are so heavy--

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.210
I'm sorry-- the protons are
so energetic that they're

00:46:56.210 --> 00:47:01.680
difficult to shield just
by mass attenuation.

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:04.480
And the trick here is,
well, different radiation

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:06.688
has different penetrating power.

00:47:06.688 --> 00:47:08.230
It depends on its
energy, but it also

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:10.420
depends a lot on its charge.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.170
For example, alpha particles can
be stopped by a sheet of paper.

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:17.357
These are the MeV
level helium nuclei.

00:47:17.357 --> 00:47:19.690
Like, if you hold an alpha
particle source in your hand,

00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:23.170
the dead skin on your hand stops
the alphas from getting in.

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.930
Remember that, because I'm going
to be asking you a question

00:47:25.930 --> 00:47:28.510
later on to see who your
friends are and who they aren't.

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:30.800
I don't know if anyone knows
what I'm talking about.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.980
But if you do,
don't give it away.

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:37.210
Beta particles or electrons have
low mass and half the charge

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:38.470
of an alpha particle.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:40.360
They can be able to
get through paper, even

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.990
through a little bit of plastic.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.080
But a small bit of
metal can stop them.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.060
Gamma rays go right through.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:48.070
And notice that they've
been drawn not quite

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:49.810
being stopped by
the concrete, which

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:51.550
is a great shielding material.

00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.010
Because like I said before,
you can exponentially

00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:55.720
attenuate gamma rays.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:48:00.240
You can't with all certainty
stop every single one.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.790
So then how do you stop these
high-energy charged particles

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.270
if the more energetic they
are, the more range they are?

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:08.980
Boost your
electromagnetic field.

00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:11.790
So it's actually been
proposed to have spaceships

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:15.360
with enormous magnetic fields
or electromagnetic fields

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.610
around them to deflect
the protons away

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.110
or around the ship.

00:48:19.110 --> 00:48:21.750
Because if you can't stop it
by putting matter in the way,

00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:23.292
rely on the fact
that they're charged

00:48:23.292 --> 00:48:26.540
particles, and will
curve around whatever

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:28.860
has got a high electric
field around it.

00:48:28.860 --> 00:48:30.240
So this is one
way of, let's say,

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.860
shielding deep space missions.

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.640
If you can't put more stuff in
there because stuff is heavy,

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.440
and launching stuff
into space is expensive,

00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.820
rely on electromagnetism.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.210
And there are also RTGs, or
Radio Thermal Generators,

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.460
or Radio Isotope
Thermoelectric Generators,

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.780
which are little balls of things
like plutonium or strontium

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.830
that give off so
many alpha particles.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.100
And the alpha particles
have very low range.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:57.160
They deposit their kinetic
energy as heat in the material,

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.500
and cause them to
glow on their own.

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:02.410
If you produce enough heat,
if something's glowing red,

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:06.340
you can use thermal electric
generators to capture that heat

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:09.140
and turn it directly
into electricity.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:12.130
This is how things like
Voyager and, let's see,

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:15.760
all the other space probes with
interesting names are powered.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:18.640
Once you're too far from the
sun for solar power to work,

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.070
you need something
that doesn't turn off.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:23.890
So you can use RTGs,
which have long

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:27.160
enough half-lives to produce
significant amounts of power

00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:30.010
for a long time, but
short enough half-lives so

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.870
that their activity
is pretty high.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:34.450
And they release a lot
of energy as radiation.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:36.940
And that radiation is
heavy charged particles

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.680
which you can capture as heat.

00:49:39.680 --> 00:49:42.370
So yeah, an actual little sphere
of plutonium that produces

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.260
100 watts just sitting there.

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.770
There is no way to turn it off.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:48.500
That's the end of the sentence.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:50.640
It's plutonium.

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.160
And finally, there's
nuclear rockets.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.040
If you think about using a
reactor for thrust instead

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:58.860
of electrical energy,
the design of the reactor

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.060
gets very different.

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.940
For example, you can start
to let things get a whole lot

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:06.150
hotter when there's no oxygen
in space to oxidize things.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:07.770
And your propellant
maybe would be

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:10.292
liquid hydrogen that
doesn't burn, but goes

00:50:10.292 --> 00:50:12.750
through the reactor and gets
accelerated, turned into a gas

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:14.588
with a high kinetic
energy, to fire out

00:50:14.588 --> 00:50:17.130
the back of the rocket nozzle
and provide the thrust that you

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:18.010
need.

00:50:18.010 --> 00:50:19.920
And so it's nuclear
rockets that would really

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.770
be the only feasible way without
bending space time, which

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:25.500
I don't think we've
really done yet, in order

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:26.970
to get to very distant stars.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:30.170
Like that planet they just found
orbiting Proxima Centauri--

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:31.200
four light years away.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.820
Pretty close, right?

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:33.780
No.

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.715
Not really.

00:50:34.715 --> 00:50:38.550
And if you think about how a
nuclear rocket mission would

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:42.630
work, well, it doesn't have
to have nearly as much thrust,

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.880
especially if you
start from orbit.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.690
Maybe use a chemical rocket
to launch yourself into orbit,

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.900
and then spend half your journey
accelerating very, very slowly.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:54.060
And then turn the
rocket around, spend

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:58.300
the other half of the journey
decelerating very, very slowly.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.530
So you need a long, constant
but low-level thrust

00:51:01.530 --> 00:51:04.470
for these long-live
nuclear missions.

00:51:04.470 --> 00:51:06.030
I'm going to stop
here because it's

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:07.740
five minutes before the hour.

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:10.050
We only have a few more of
these things to go through.

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:11.853
But what I will ask
is you guys hang tight

00:51:11.853 --> 00:51:13.770
for the next few minutes
while these guys take

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.850
the cameras apart.

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:16.320
We're going to go
to my lab and see

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.700
an application of nuclear
which, like I said,

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.800
is plasma sputter coating.

00:51:24.827 --> 00:51:25.660
All right, everyone.

00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.270
So welcome to my laboratory.

00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:29.765
This is the Mesoscale
Nuclear Materials group,

00:51:29.765 --> 00:51:31.140
where we make and
break materials

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:34.290
for nuclear technology,
usually not in that order.

00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:35.160
But whatever.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:36.570
We get it done somehow.

00:51:36.570 --> 00:51:39.038
And this is Reid Tanaka, one
of my graduate students, who

00:51:39.038 --> 00:51:40.830
has actually repaired
and going to show you

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.900
the physical principles
and operation

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.640
of a sputter coater,
which is nothing

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.250
more than a controlled
radiation damage machine.

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.380
And he'll be making
some interesting door

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.630
prizes for you guys.

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:53.980
REID TANAKA: Well, as
Professor Mike Short said,

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:56.020
this is Professor Mike Short's.

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:57.480
He calls it something else.

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:00.650
I call it the home--
the rehabilitative home

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:05.095
for old, orphaned equipment
and old graduates.

00:52:05.095 --> 00:52:05.595
All right.

00:52:05.595 --> 00:52:08.720
And so this is-- actually,
this piece of gear here,

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.790
I did a little
research on it, and I

00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:16.030
think it was built
about the same time

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:21.400
as I was entering
college 35 years ago.

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.570
So about 1978, maybe 1980.

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:27.015
That's how old this thing is.

00:52:27.015 --> 00:52:32.460
And now, so Professor Short
goes around, as all of us,

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.990
and we scrounge and we scab
and we put stuff together.

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:38.200
And you'll see that really
indeed, we do that a lot.

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.390
So this part, we
put together out

00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:43.390
of a bunch of pieces of parts.

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.250
If you look at it, and I'll
talk [? to it ?] a little bit.

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:48.760
But there's a procedure
that we've got [? rigged ?]

00:52:48.760 --> 00:52:51.485
[? output. ?] But we
don't know [INAUDIBLE],,

00:52:51.485 --> 00:52:53.110
so we just sort of
throw them together.

00:52:53.110 --> 00:52:55.910
So what you're going to see
is a little demonstration

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:57.460
of what a sputter coater is.

00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.305
You're going to see
a little [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:59.305 --> 00:53:00.270
AUDIENCE: Could you
scoot in here, so we can

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.770
[? hear your mic? ?]

00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:03.220
REID TANAKA: It's under vacuum
right now, vacuum pressure.

00:53:03.220 --> 00:53:04.260
This is our vacuum [? off. ?]

00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:04.970
AUDIENCE: Let me just--

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.553
here-- come right
here so you can see.

00:53:06.553 --> 00:53:09.760
REID TANAKA: [INAUDIBLE] Again,
there is another pressure

00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.210
indication, but
we don't actually

00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:15.400
trust that one [? too much. ?]
All right, without further ado,

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.442
I'm going to power it on.

00:53:16.442 --> 00:53:18.608
We're going to [INAUDIBLE]
[? center ?] [? a ?] high

00:53:18.608 --> 00:53:19.240
voltage.

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.500
It's argon in here.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:24.080
We've got argon supplies
in that bottle over there.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:32.330
And [INAUDIBLE] I just turn up
the high voltage power supply.

00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:33.170
Turning it up--

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:34.040
MICHAEL SHORT: Should
we get the lights, Reid?

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:34.950
REID TANAKA: Voltage.

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:35.450
Yeah.

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:36.710
We can kill the lights.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.900
MICHAEL SHORT: I'll go get them.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.370
I'll just get them right
over where you are.

00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:45.020
REID TANAKA: And if you
see through this glass jar,

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.997
it's going to be a
little bit of a glow.

00:53:46.997 --> 00:53:48.830
Some of you might be
able to see it already.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:55.150
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:56.025
Come a little closer.

00:53:56.025 --> 00:53:59.930
From where I am, you start to
see the glowing purple plasma.

00:53:59.930 --> 00:54:02.080
So that's the ionization
of the argon causing

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.640
it to electrostatically
accelerate

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.710
towards the gold target.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.510
And that's blasting
off gold items

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.820
that are then coating the
stuff that Reid's coating

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.500
that you'll see in a sec.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.210
But this is a
controlled application

00:54:13.210 --> 00:54:17.080
of ionization and radiation
damage using a couple

00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.812
of kilovolt argon ion--

00:54:19.812 --> 00:54:22.270
don't know if you call it a
beam, but at least in argon ion

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.770
plasma.

00:54:30.887 --> 00:54:32.470
So there's a few
other things to note.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.678
Remember how we talked about
charged particles having

00:54:34.678 --> 00:54:36.400
a certain range in matter?

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.410
Well, charged particles
in, let's say,

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:41.080
low-energy particles
in the kV range

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.090
do not have a very
high range even

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:46.990
in gases, which is why Reid
has this vacuum pump connected.

00:54:46.990 --> 00:54:49.090
Otherwise, the argon
wouldn't make it

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:51.220
to where it has
to do the damage.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.170
So when there's too
much gas in there--

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:54.245
shuts off.

00:54:54.245 --> 00:54:55.870
When there's not
enough argon in there,

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:57.850
there's no argon
to do the damage.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:01.090
So we're actually exciting
about two kV ions.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.980
And their range is
higher than the distance

00:55:02.980 --> 00:55:04.855
they have to travel, so
they actually make it

00:55:04.855 --> 00:55:06.166
where they're supposed to go.

00:55:06.166 --> 00:55:09.250
And this is a kind of
direct application of NSE,

00:55:09.250 --> 00:55:12.570
along with a fair bit of
high voltage electronics.

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:14.320
And that's pretty much
all there is to it.

00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:14.755
REID TANAKA: OK.

00:55:14.755 --> 00:55:17.344
So we have about two minutes if
you want to take a closer look

00:55:17.344 --> 00:55:18.040
and just [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:18.802
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:55:18.802 --> 00:55:19.586
REID TANAKA: It's not
going to hurt you.

00:55:19.586 --> 00:55:19.980
MICHAEL SHORT: No.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:20.772
Get right in there.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.970
Do you want to see--
if you look underneath,

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:29.370
you'll actually see
that blue glowing ring.

00:55:29.370 --> 00:55:32.580
That's actually a ring of gold
that's being hit by the plasma.

00:55:32.580 --> 00:55:35.250
And that's causing gold ions
to fire onto the target.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.235
REID TANAKA: You guys all took
chemistry at some point, right?

00:55:55.235 --> 00:55:57.658
Well, they tell you that
one of the great mysteries

00:55:57.658 --> 00:55:59.158
of the [? world ?]
[? as ?] [? we ?]

00:55:59.158 --> 00:56:01.116
[? know it's ?]
[? been solved-- ?] [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:01.116 --> 00:56:03.640
take something and
turn it into gold.

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:08.350
Well, you should know that
only the nukes can do that.

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:08.850
Right?

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.932
Really, you got to get away
from all the electrons and all

00:56:11.932 --> 00:56:13.890
that other chemistry
stuff, and only the nukes.

00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:17.000
So if you really want to
turn something to gold,

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.810
you got to join the
nuclear department.

00:56:19.810 --> 00:56:21.390
Just so you know that.

00:56:21.390 --> 00:56:22.190
Keep that in mind.

00:56:25.333 --> 00:56:27.000
MICHAEL SHORT: Has
everyone had a chance

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:27.960
to get a close-up look?

00:56:31.463 --> 00:56:33.880
REID TANAKA: And I think we
got about another minute or so

00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:35.080
to let it run.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.680
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:39.480
Anyone have any questions
about what you're seeing here?

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.400
AUDIENCE: Is it getting,
like, super hot in there, or--

00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:43.983
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
a good question.

00:56:43.983 --> 00:56:46.060
The temperature does
not go up that much.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:48.570
There's certainly kinetic energy
turned into thermal energy

00:56:48.570 --> 00:56:50.610
as the argon hits the
gold, and the gold

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:52.560
hits whatever you're
trying to coat.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.080
But the total amount of
energy, the density of that gas

00:56:55.080 --> 00:56:56.640
is extremely low.

00:56:56.640 --> 00:56:58.950
That's another reason
why in fusion reactors,

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:01.710
the plasma is up to like
millions or tens of millions

00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:02.820
of Kelvin.

00:57:02.820 --> 00:57:04.262
There's just not a lot of it.

00:57:04.262 --> 00:57:06.720
So if you look at the total
amount of stored thermal energy

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.300
in a fusion reactor,
it's quite low,

00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:11.523
even though the
temperature or the relation

00:57:11.523 --> 00:57:13.440
to the average kinetic
energy of the molecules

00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:14.580
is extremely high.

00:57:18.052 --> 00:57:19.050
So yeah.

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:19.650
Good question.

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:24.738
If you want, put your hand
up inside of the chamber.

00:57:24.738 --> 00:57:26.232
Is it warm?

00:57:26.232 --> 00:57:32.208
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:32.208 --> 00:57:33.607
AUDIENCE: It's not warm at all.

00:57:33.607 --> 00:57:34.690
MICHAEL SHORT: Not at all.

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:35.190
Yep.

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:47.292
AUDIENCE: The
plasma is the argon?

00:57:47.292 --> 00:57:50.126
And where's the
gold coming from?

00:57:50.126 --> 00:57:51.425
From in that [? ring ?]

00:57:51.425 --> 00:57:52.593
MICHAEL SHORT: There we go.

00:57:52.593 --> 00:57:53.420
REID TANAKA: [INAUDIBLE]
we'll show you.

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:53.570
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.810
We'll open it up and show you.

00:57:54.810 --> 00:57:55.650
So I'll get the lights on now.

00:57:55.650 --> 00:57:56.317
REID TANAKA: OK.

00:57:56.317 --> 00:57:57.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:06.468
AUDIENCE: Why isn't the
pressure [INAUDIBLE]??

00:58:06.468 --> 00:58:07.510
REID TANAKA: What's that?

00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:08.802
AUDIENCE: The pressure changed.

00:58:08.802 --> 00:58:09.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:14.550
REID TANAKA: Yeah.

00:58:14.550 --> 00:58:17.520
From the point that we-- when
you walked in and saw that?

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:18.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.270
REID TANAKA: OK.

00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:21.240
The first thing--
so this had a sort

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:24.910
of a static amount
of argon in it.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:29.040
And when I turned on the
voltage, the high voltage,

00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.510
that's to create the plasma.

00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:31.970
But then it has to get fed.

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:34.303
And so what I ended up doing
with this little knob here,

00:58:34.303 --> 00:58:36.790
I probably should explain that,
is I was feeding it argon.

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:40.025
That argon bottle from over here
it's going into this chamber.

00:58:40.025 --> 00:58:42.525
When you're feeding the argon
in, then the pressure came up.

00:58:42.525 --> 00:58:45.230
And if the pressure comes up
too high on this particular

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.780
instrument, then it has an
automatic cut-off [? when ?]

00:58:47.780 --> 00:58:51.390
the high voltage [? cuts out. ?]
Because otherwise, you know,

00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:54.240
one of the reasons why it works
is because we have so few atoms

00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.524
in there.

00:58:55.524 --> 00:58:56.508
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:56.508 --> 00:59:15.240
AUDIENCE: [? Good. ?]

00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.780
REID TANAKA: [INAUDIBLE] what
atmospheric pressure is in

00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:18.280
[? total? ?]

00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:19.280
AUDIENCE: 760.

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:20.780
REID TANAKA: 760.

00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:23.780
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:28.390
Maybe we [? actually ?] have
a little bit of a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:30.570
So this is that--

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:33.675
that's the gold ring.

00:59:33.675 --> 00:59:37.100
AUDIENCE: [? Neat. ?]

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:38.475
REID TANAKA: And
in the chamber--

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.660
MICHAEL SHORT: You can put the--
you can put the ring facing

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:43.770
down for stability if you want.

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:44.290
REID TANAKA: What's that?

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:45.748
MICHAEL SHORT: I
said, you can just

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:48.074
put the ring lying flat down
if you want for stability.

00:59:48.074 --> 00:59:50.534
Yeah.

00:59:50.534 --> 00:59:52.010
REID TANAKA: And
in the chamber--

00:59:55.454 --> 00:59:58.790
the purpose of having this,
actually, this machine,

00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:01.085
the main reason
that we use this for

01:00:01.085 --> 01:00:02.460
is if you have
something that you

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:06.770
want to put into a scanning
electron microscope, and--

01:00:10.492 --> 01:00:11.950
MICHAEL SHORT:
We're actually going

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.708
to use one of those
in class, so--

01:00:14.708 --> 01:00:16.110
yeah.

01:00:16.110 --> 01:00:19.450
REID TANAKA: You need to have
some kind of conductive coating

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:21.122
on it.

01:00:21.122 --> 01:00:23.080
So if you're looking at--
[? especially ?] like

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:27.370
[? biologic ?] [? stuff, ?] you
actually coat it with something

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.350
that's conductive.

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:34.480
So there you see, it has a gold
coat of about, I would guess,

01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.190
I think for as long
as we did it for,

01:00:36.190 --> 01:00:41.398
something on the level
of 200 [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:41.398 --> 01:00:42.928
It's a pretty thin coat.

01:00:42.928 --> 01:00:44.720
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
all you need, though.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.500
REID TANAKA: Right.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Remember,
after quiz number one,

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.770
we will be piloting--
well, two of you

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.230
guys we'll be piloting a
scanning electron microscope

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:52.358
down in the basement.

01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:54.650
And before we look at whatever
samples you want to see,

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:57.260
whether it's one of your
eyelashes, dust on the floor,

01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.070
or a bug you found
or something, we'll

01:00:59.070 --> 01:01:00.980
want to coat in gold,
so that the electrons

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:03.428
that we use for imaging
will have a place to go.

01:01:03.428 --> 01:01:05.720
We'll have a conductive path,
and they won't charge up,

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:06.470
ruining the image.

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:07.428
REID TANAKA: All right.

01:01:07.428 --> 01:01:08.277
I have a question.

01:01:08.277 --> 01:01:09.110
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah?

01:01:09.110 --> 01:01:12.020
REID TANAKA: Is anybody--
was anybody here born

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:14.140
this Millennium?

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.200
Anyone?

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.310
2000 or later?

01:01:17.310 --> 01:01:17.820
Nobody.

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:21.120
Anyone in 1999?

01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:23.194
Nobody in 1999?

01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:26.255
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:26.255 --> 01:01:28.110
How about '98?

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:29.130
You were born in '98?

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:30.330
MICHAEL SHORT: There we go.

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:31.920
REID TANAKA: All right.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:33.580
That would be--

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.970
[INAUDIBLE] brought my glasses.

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:39.980
I've got that 1998 dime here.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:43.390
It's now gold-coated.

01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:45.110
And you can have it.

01:01:45.110 --> 01:01:47.920
[INAUDIBLE] [? too ?]
[? bad. If ?] [? somebody ?]

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.738
[? wanted ?] [INAUDIBLE]
you got a quarter.

01:01:51.738 --> 01:01:54.280
You [? could lie ?] [? and ?]
[? say-- ?] But I guess you are

01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.410
the youngest [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:55.410 --> 01:01:55.950
Yeah.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.100
All right.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:02:00.210
So you win this.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:02.128
Now, it'll rub off.

01:02:02.128 --> 01:02:02.670
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:03.620
REID TANAKA: So
[INAUDIBLE] you--

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:04.110
AUDIENCE: [? I'll ?]
[? probably ?] keep it

01:02:04.110 --> 01:02:05.900
in a plastic bag.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:06.720
REID TANAKA: And--

01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.770
MICHAEL SHORT:
[? Gold ?] [? change. ?]

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:09.228
REID TANAKA: I
guess the other ones

01:02:09.228 --> 01:02:11.446
go to people that [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:17.180
Oh, no '97.

01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.090
How about a '96?

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:20.930
You're a '96?

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:21.760
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.260
AUDIENCE: [? There's ?]
[? three. ?]

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:23.790
REID TANAKA: What's that?

01:02:23.790 --> 01:02:24.710
AUDIENCE: There's three '96s,

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:25.980
REID TANAKA: Oh,
there's three '96s?

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:26.480
OK.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:28.898
You get the-- you
get the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:28.898 --> 01:02:41.282
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
over a year old.

01:02:41.282 --> 01:02:42.240
REID TANAKA: All right.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.815
Who wants the
nickel that's a '96?

01:02:43.815 --> 01:02:45.225
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:45.225 --> 01:02:47.100
REID TANAKA: You going
to arm wrestle for it?

01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:47.410
MICHAEL SHORT: There you go.

01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:47.980
Right in front of you, Reid.

01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:48.940
REID TANAKA: Well,
there's three of them.

01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:49.440
OK.

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:50.356
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

01:02:50.356 --> 01:02:51.398
REID TANAKA: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:51.398 --> 01:02:52.382
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:52.382 --> 01:02:54.215
REID TANAKA: And who
are the other two '96s?

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.840
You're going to
have to arm wrestle.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.010
One gets a quarter,
but one gets the dime.

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.160
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.590
Yep.

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:03.640
REID TANAKA: That's the
only fair way of doing

01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:03.910
[? it, I think. ?]

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.040
MICHAEL SHORT: That's not a
nuclear thing, but if it's fun.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.090
REID TANAKA: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:10.510
Here you go [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:12.416
REID TANAKA: And there is
the quarter [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:13.124
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:03:13.124 --> 01:03:14.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:14.590
MICHAEL SHORT: This one?

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.570
AUDIENCE: Yes. [? Because ?]
[? it ?] [? was ?] [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:17.810
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE]
actually [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:18.570
It's just--

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.690
AUDIENCE: It's
[? memorable ?] [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:20.690 --> 01:03:21.590
REID TANAKA: OK.

01:03:21.590 --> 01:03:22.090
Yeah?

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.070
AUDIENCE: So is that gold
deposited anywhere else

01:03:24.070 --> 01:03:24.700
in that chamber?

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.450
REID TANAKA: Yeah.

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:28.040
If you look-- actually, if you
look in the chamber, I mean,

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.130
this is all- this is all
[? from it ?] [? being ?]

01:03:30.130 --> 01:03:31.960
[? sputtered. ?] And
if you look around--

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:34.835
I can turn this a little.

01:03:34.835 --> 01:03:35.650
Look at the glass.

01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:39.060
It gets on the glass, too.

01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.920
So it actually gets--
it gets everywhere.

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:45.344
But it's mostly directed to that
area that you saw [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:50.015
I have another offer.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.582
Are you guys all nukes?

01:03:54.582 --> 01:03:56.540
You guys are all going
to be in the department?

01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:57.670
MICHAEL SHORT: All but one.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:58.000
REID TANAKA: Ah.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.090
AUDIENCE: [? Not me. ?]

01:03:59.090 --> 01:04:00.965
MICHAEL SHORT: But we
have a nuke enthusiast.

01:04:00.965 --> 01:04:02.850
So-- otherwise, wouldn't
be in this class.

01:04:02.850 --> 01:04:05.810
And anyone scared of nuclear
is probably not in this class.

01:04:05.810 --> 01:04:08.400
REID TANAKA: So obviously, it
was pretty easy for us to do.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.305
We have this machine here.

01:04:10.305 --> 01:04:12.180
If you're going to be
part of our department,

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.790
if you want to just come
in, we can make you a--

01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:18.295
we can make you a quarter, OK?

01:04:18.295 --> 01:04:19.670
I mean, I could
even supply them.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.032
I feel rich [? enough ?]
I can [INAUDIBLE],,

01:04:22.032 --> 01:04:24.240
because all this grad
student-- graduate school money

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.126
I'm getting.

01:04:25.126 --> 01:04:26.900
MICHAEL SHORT: Nice.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:29.132
REID TANAKA: But--
anything else?

01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:34.096
MICHAEL SHORT: Any questions
for Reid on what you just saw?

01:04:34.096 --> 01:04:36.050
The goal is to sort of
give you a real life,

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:38.360
you know, learn 22.01,
you'll understand

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:40.970
how these things work, and
how you can modify them,

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:42.580
create new stuff.

01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:44.002
That's the general idea.

01:04:44.002 --> 01:04:45.710
Same thing behind
looking at the electron

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:49.790
microscope for the focused ion
beam, EDX elemental analysis.

01:04:49.790 --> 01:04:51.770
I want to bring what
we're teaching you to life

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:53.433
as often as we can.

01:04:53.433 --> 01:04:55.100
Since we only got one
recitation a week,

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.810
we'll be doing it
about that much.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.478
Once in a while I may
schedule some extra stuff

01:04:59.478 --> 01:05:00.770
as long as folks are available.

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:02.210
But we're going
to try all we can

01:05:02.210 --> 01:05:04.543
to have days like this, where
you get to see what you're

01:05:04.543 --> 01:05:05.970
learning in real life.

01:05:05.970 --> 01:05:07.670
AUDIENCE: It was
called a sputter?

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:08.880
REID TANAKA: Sputter coater.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:09.780
AUDIENCE: Sputter coater.

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:10.970
REID TANAKA: Sputter coater.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:13.470
MICHAEL SHORT: It's because the
process of the argon hitting

01:05:13.470 --> 01:05:15.870
the gold is actually
known as sputtering,

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.490
which is the blasting
off of surface

01:05:17.490 --> 01:05:19.400
atoms by energetic particles.

01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.446
It's a controlled form
of radiation damage.

01:05:22.446 --> 01:05:24.820
AUDIENCE: What's that Swagelok?

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.774
MICHAEL SHORT: Swagelok.

01:05:26.774 --> 01:05:27.630
AUDIENCE: Swagelok.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:28.778
REID TANAKA: Yeah.

01:05:28.778 --> 01:05:31.668
AUDIENCE: So what's a Swagelok?

01:05:31.668 --> 01:05:32.460
REID TANAKA: Well--

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:34.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Do we
have any pieces here?

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:34.700
Let's see.

01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:35.966
REID TANAKA: [? We ?] [? have ?]
[? lots. ?] [INAUDIBLE] if you

01:05:35.966 --> 01:05:38.480
go back [? around ?] [INAUDIBLE]
tubing that you see back

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:38.980
in there.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.570
They're connected so
they don't [INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.350
[INAUDIBLE] [? piping ?]
[INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:43.350 --> 01:05:44.873
It's proprietary--

01:05:44.873 --> 01:05:46.290
MICHAEL SHORT:
They're all in use.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:47.360
REID TANAKA: --made by
the Swagelok companies

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.070
to [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.800
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, here we go.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.939
REID TANAKA: So I
don't know if Mike's

01:05:51.939 --> 01:05:53.154
going to take you around.

01:05:53.154 --> 01:05:54.821
AUDIENCE: [? Absolutely ?]
[INAUDIBLE]..

01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.460
MICHAEL SHORT: This
is Swagelok tubing.

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.620
It's got a two piece
ferrule, which [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.070
a metal-to-metal seal
for moving liquid or gas.

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.513
And it takes an
insanely high pressure.

01:06:07.513 --> 01:06:09.930
So actually, over in the next
room, we can look on our way

01:06:09.930 --> 01:06:12.300
out, we've built a
reactor simulator,

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.090
like an experimental
reactor that

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:17.970
replicates all the conditions
except for the radiation.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.550
We had to make it entirely
out of Swagelok tubing,

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:23.050
because this stuff can hold the
pressure and the temperature

01:06:23.050 --> 01:06:25.560
without deforming too much.

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:29.090
So when you want to make it
absolutely airtight seal,

01:06:29.090 --> 01:06:29.840
use things--

01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.517
Swagelok or things like it.

01:06:31.517 --> 01:06:32.850
AUDIENCE: Is it stainless steel?

01:06:32.850 --> 01:06:33.720
MICHAEL SHORT: This
is stainless steel.

01:06:33.720 --> 01:06:34.220
Yep.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.570
But they make it out of
titanium or other things, too.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:38.837
But stainless
steel works for us.

01:06:38.837 --> 01:06:39.754
AUDIENCE: That's cool.

01:06:39.754 --> 01:06:42.550
AUDIENCE: In a PWR, how
much pressure is there?

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:45.820
MICHAEL SHORT: In a PWR, there's
150 atmospheres of pressure.

01:06:45.820 --> 01:06:47.500
It's also 150
atmospheres of pressure

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.060
over in the room next door.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:49.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:49.935 --> 01:06:52.268
MICHAEL SHORT: Like I said,
it's all the same conditions

01:06:52.268 --> 01:06:53.912
as a reactor except
the radiation.

01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:55.870
The pressure is what
makes it really dangerous.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:57.076
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:57.076 --> 01:06:57.909
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

01:06:57.909 --> 01:07:00.635
We'll look through one of the
few bulletproof glass shields.

01:07:00.635 --> 01:07:02.260
Because if anything
blows on that loop,

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:05.200
it's like a proj--
it is a projectile.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.120
We've only had one explosion.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:08.890
There was no
temperature at the time,

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:11.290
but it sounded like
a shotgun blast

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:12.910
over the side of your shoulder.

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:14.150
It was loud.

01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:15.515
AUDIENCE: You in the room?

01:07:15.515 --> 01:07:17.140
MICHAEL SHORT: The
loop was right here,

01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:18.160
and we were right
in front of it.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:19.760
Then the loop jumped
up maybe an inch.

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.210
And we jumped up
about three feet.

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:23.950
We got scared.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:25.690
That was what happens
when you improperly

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:27.070
torque a high-pressure fitting.

01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:29.320
Because you've actually got
to tighten these nuts down

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.050
to not too low and not
too high of a torque,

01:07:32.050 --> 01:07:33.683
otherwise, they don't seal.

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:35.350
And usually, you only
find out that they

01:07:35.350 --> 01:07:36.850
don't seal when
they're approaching

01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.022
close to their rated thing.

01:07:38.022 --> 01:07:38.980
And you're like, great.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:39.897
It's at half pressure.

01:07:39.897 --> 01:07:40.720
It's OK.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:43.505
You reach 99%
pressure and kaboom.

01:07:43.505 --> 01:07:44.380
That's what happened.

01:07:48.529 --> 01:07:49.210
Cool.

01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:50.960
Thanks a lot, Reid,
for showing this to us

01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.540
and taking time out of your day.

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.540
REID TANAKA: No problem.

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.275
Anytime.

01:07:54.275 --> 01:07:56.025
MICHAEL SHORT: I hope
you guys enjoyed it.

01:07:56.025 --> 01:07:58.220
So no problems to work
through this week.

01:07:58.220 --> 01:08:01.672
That's going to change
starting Tuesday, next class.

01:08:01.672 --> 01:08:02.630
So have a good weekend.

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:06.200
And I'll see you guys all
on Tuesday in Room 24-115,

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:09.090
next to the room
where we were just in.

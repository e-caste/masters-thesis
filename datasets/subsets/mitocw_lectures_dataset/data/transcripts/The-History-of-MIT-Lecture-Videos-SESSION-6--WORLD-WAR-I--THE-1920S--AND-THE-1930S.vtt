00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.310
PROFESSOR: When did
you arrive at MIT?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.800
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: I was
a post-doc in 1980.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.180
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I just
remember that.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.080
PROFESSOR: So Ros is also a
historian of technology.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.270
But she practices the craft
a little different

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.340
than David and I do.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.170
She focuses on the cultural
side of things and is an

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.860
expert in literature and what
writers have said about

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.210
technological change
and has written a

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.580
lot about those subjects.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.110
But also, she served
as the dean of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.620
undergraduate education.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.500
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: And
student affairs.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.220
I did both jobs.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.060
PROFESSOR: I didn't know
if I had the title.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.085
There was one time when you
didn't have two deans.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:12.310
You didn't a dean for
residential life.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.010
You had them combined
in one office.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.940
And she got stuck with that
job, which is as you might

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.320
imagine, is a lot of work.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.820
And so Ross did that
for at least six--

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.420
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Five years.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.410
PROFESSOR: Five years.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.330
So that's been a big
item on her agenda.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.690
And now, she's back
in the department.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
And today, she's going to talk
about chemical engineering

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.370
basically, in the early
20th century.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.600
And this is extremely
interesting.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.110
She gave a lecture about
it last year.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.410
Because her grandfather
was Warren K. Lewis.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.610
If any of are familiar with the
"Lewis Report" of the late

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.340
1940s, that's the report that in
effect that established the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.320
School of Humanities and
Social Sciences.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.460
But here's a chemical engineer
who is a very much involved

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.250
and looking at all aspects of
life at MIT and coming up with

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.480
this report.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.340
And as they say, the
rest is history.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.070
So Ros has a long lineage here,
that your grandfather

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.990
goes back to the early
1900s, I would say.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.280
Didn't he get here--

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.665
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: He
was class of '05.

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:17.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.820
So she's going to talk
about this area.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.380
And she's brought some very
interesting materials I'm

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.540
anxious to look at.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.680
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: So I wanted
to do something new this time.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.380
And that's why in the
last hour, I went

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.790
though my Lewis box.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.800
Archives are just
boxes of stuff.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.890
This is from my attic.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.160
And the library's is just
not that different.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.680
And I pulled out some little
treasures, at least I think

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.750
they're treasures, that will
give you a flavor of what

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.590
archives are like and when
you're doing history, what you

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.380
learn from archives that you
don't learn online, can't

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.830
learn online.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.090
I may overstate that.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.200
I may take that back.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.750
But I'll stand by it for
a talking point.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.960
So I'm going to start with
giving you an overview of

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.270
intertwined biography of Warren
K. Lewis and of the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:18.770
world here in the Boston area,
Cambridge, and MIT

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.100
specifically, as they
intertwined.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.430
And in discussing afterwards, we
can talk about him, we can

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.395
talk about chemical
engineering.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.860
We can also talk about
deanly things.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.920
If you're interested in student
life history, I've

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.030
done a little boning up on that
for a documentary that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.890
was being shot last week
about the evolution of

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.650
student life at MIT.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.070
So I sort of refreshed my memory
about some points on

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.220
that topic.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.030
So we talk about anything
you want to talk about.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.330
But first of all, let me give
you some what my grandfather

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.000
used to say, you want to put
the fodder down where the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.170
calves can get at it.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.780
So I'm going to put
out some fodder.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.920
Fodder is food, so cow food.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.600
They say you've got
to put it down.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.020
So I'm putting it down.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.860
And we'll chew on this
together and then see

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.910
where it takes us.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.550
So this is this kind of
biographical history of

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.060
chemical engineering at MIT.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.320
I remember my grandfather
sitting in the living room

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.380
holding forth, as he was
wont to do, in Newton,

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.250
Massachusetts.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.070
This is where he lived with my
grandmother and mother and

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.430
three other siblings.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.490
He was a boarder in
the household

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:48.840
and married the daughter.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.700
And this is a little part
history right there.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.040
Most MIT students, there
weren't residences.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.100
So you boarded with families or
you were in a fraternity.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.250
So boarding was very common.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.390
Let me just me just mention
something about his family.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:07.990
You see his dates.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:23.300
His father was born in 1845,
in Laurel, Delaware.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.940
And his father, my grandfather's
grandfather, had

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.010
been born in the kind of,
well, mid to late 1700s.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.120
He had three wives.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.510
My grandfather's father
was the last child

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.880
of the third wife.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.303
So there's a huge gap in the
half-brothers, between Henry

00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:50.180
Clay Lewis, Henry Clay Lewis,
that's the name of my

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.800
grandfather's father, and the
first wife's, first child.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.790
Many of these children died.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.160
But this is just a part of
history, the fact that if I go

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.690
from my grandfather, to his
father, to his father, I'm

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:06.730
back to the Revolutionary War.

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.580
Because his grandfather had a
brother who died in a prison

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.590
ship, moored in the Hudson
River during the

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.950
Revolutionary War.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.450
So it's just amazing to me that
you just take a few steps

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:22.230
and you're back in
time, like that.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.270
This is Delaware.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:25.650
Delaware was a slave state.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.690
It was a slave-owning family.

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.500
Also an abolitionist family,
which is a strange

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.090
combination.

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.130
But it's one of those, it's a
nice idea, but not until I die

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.830
will I free my slaves, family.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.320
And that's what happened.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.320
But his father was one of the
two votes for Abraham Lincoln

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.360
in his county in Delaware
in 1860.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.455
And his father--

00:06:51.455 --> 00:06:53.350
God, these dates don't
seem right.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.330
Because if his father
is born in 18--

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.760
OK.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.890
It was his grandfather, his last
vote was for Abe Lincoln,

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:07.370
that's it, in Laurel,
Delaware.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.350
If you look at the history of
slavery in Laurel, what's

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.810
fascinating is that next door
was Maryland, where slaves

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.680
could be traded, but
not in Delaware,

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.530
after a certain date.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.440
You may know that.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.460
But in Delaware, you could
hold slaves, but you

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.000
couldn't sell them.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.430
So there's a huge kidnapping
ring, where people from

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.490
Maryland would go just over the
border to Laurel, kidnap

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.010
either free blacks or slaves,
take them back to Maryland,

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.720
where they could be sold
for a huge profit.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:39.270
Because at that time, they could
still be sold to other

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:40.900
parts of the United States.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.130
So Delaware, Laurel was the
site of the Patty Cannon

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:50.820
kidnapping ring, which is
a fascinating story.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.010
But it's not the story
I'm here to tell.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.830
But it does give context.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:57.160
This is a farm boy.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:02.090
Kenny was raised on the farm
in Laurel, Delaware.

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:07.090
Expecting to say on the farm,
and his life, he got hijacked

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.650
by the 20th century.

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:13.130
These are just some more
pictures holding forth.

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.100
That's a very familiar
pose, very familiar.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:17.320
PROFESSOR: You know it well.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.060
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:23.540
I mean as a granddaughter,
you knew this guy.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.300
Students were terrified of him
because he'd get you up here.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.690
And you'd start doing something
on the board.

00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.560
And you wouldn't know
what you were doing

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.170
and he would pounce.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.289
But as a granddaughter, it was
just a very affectionate

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:36.630
relationship.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.789
I was aware how much he
terrified other people.

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.460
But that was not my relationship
with him.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.420
That's the farmhouse, still
in a Laurel, Delaware.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.600
It used to be a bed and
breakfast not that long ago.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.610
I don't think it's in
business anymore.

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.110
That's my brother.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:55.070
That's more Warren K. Lewis,
Jr., my uncle, and my

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.300
grandfather.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.560
This is in 1952.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.940
He has just sold the farm.

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.570
Heart breaking, because it had
been in the family back to the

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.140
late 1700s.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:15.530
But a part of the farm was cut
through by a road, the dual,

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.420
they call it there,
a dual highway.

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.290
Route 14 cut through a corner of
the farm and he realized it

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:22.780
was never going to be a
working farm again.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.600
And the irony is of course that
part of the reason for

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.890
putting in that highway is that
DuPont had established

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.250
big factories in northern
Delaware.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.460
And there's more commuter
traffic from south to north.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:38.400
So chemical engineering,
in a sense,

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.820
destroyed the family farm.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.540
And I say there's
a sort of irony.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.240
There's quite a bit
of irony there.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:47.130
Not to mention the fact that the
whole automobile age was

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.280
in part made possible through
new methods of refining

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.480
petroleum, using catalytic
cracking, that my grandfather

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.020
directly worked on.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.330
This is not the best-- but this
is the Eastern Shore,

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.310
this peninsula.

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.280
The Chesapeake Bay is here.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.420
So Baltimore is up
around here.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.790
Washington is kind of off
the map, over here.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.140
And Philadelphia is
to the north.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.080
But this is the Eastern Shore.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:14.280
And it's Virginia down here.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.550
You can't see the map--

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:16.800
the split division.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:25.530
So last time I went, I go to
the airport in Baltimore, I

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:29.390
drive over the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge, I go down to roads,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.900
about right in the middle.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.950
And that takes me two hours.

00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:39.325
So you go from one end to the
other in a couple hours.

00:10:39.325 --> 00:10:41.280
With the dual, you
go fast, yeah.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.460
So there is a Maryland
over here.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.510
Oh, you can see the
dotted line, OK.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:46.700
So this is Maryland over here.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:50.680
This is where like Dick Cheney
lives now, in Easton.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:52.915
It's very high, upper crust.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.300
And this is Delaware,
which is much more

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.620
farming, much more rural.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.000
And then Virginia down here.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.010
It's pretty rustic.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:03.410
The Chincoteague ponies,
Chincoteague is one of these

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.140
islands off of here.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:10.045
So this is a garden spot in the
18th and 19th centuries.

00:11:10.045 --> 00:11:14.570
It is the truck garden area
for the Philadelphia and

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:20.380
Baltimore markets, raising
mainly corn, fruits,

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.930
vegetables, peaches, tomatoes,
live stock.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.210
It's mixed farming.

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.460
And I'll tell you some more
about that as we go on.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.230
But the reason I have this map--
this is from Bob Post--

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:38.510
the railroad comes to
Laurel in 1859.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:43.650
And that opens up the whole
area to commercial

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:44.940
farming much more.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.080
I mean it had always been
such, but even more.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:53.560
Now, my grandfather's
grandfather was a sea captain.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.940
Farming was his--

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:57.150
that's where the wife
and kids stayed.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:12:00.220
But he made his money in the
trade, starting from the

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.930
Chesapeake, doing a lot of
trade of the Caribbean.

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:09.490
So that's where his
money came from.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:14.660
I mean he was a large,
established farmer and the

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.710
state legislator.

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:20.400
So he was a politician.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.260
But he was a well-off person
for Delaware, but still

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.080
basically a sea captain
and a farmer.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.860
So the railroad comes.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.530
And this is sort of getting
ahead of the story.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:43.490
But my grandfather born in
1882, he goes through the

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:47.370
three-year high school
in Laurel, Delaware.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.130
And learns everything you learn
there, because there's

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.370
one teacher for all grades,
in one classroom.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.290
And his parents want him to
get a better education.

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:56.640
He's an only child.

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.590
He's obviously going to
inherit the farm.

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:03.550
So they want him to go to a
better high school than the

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.570
Laurel one.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:09.420
So his cousin, she's actually
a cousin I guess.

00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:13.700
He had an older female cousin
named Mary Witherby, who had

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.410
left Laurel to teach school,
like her father, and she was

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.200
teaching school at the Lasell
Female seminary, which still

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.260
exists around here.

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:23.540
Do any of you--

00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.290
you know what I'm
talking about.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, sure.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.430
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It's
now Lasell College.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.420
It used to be junior college,
now college.

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.100
Yeah, and it's in West Newton,
just a stone's

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.270
throw from your place.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.110
So my grandfather was sent up
by his parents to live in

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:40.190
Newton, go to high school.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.200
Newton High was famous even
then as a good school.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.770
He would board with
the family.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.180
But he had his cousin in town.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:49.280
And she would look after him
and make sure he didn't get

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.510
into too much trouble.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:56.300
This house is a block away
from where I live now.

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.380
I go there all the time.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.230
So that's still there, one of
the older houses in the

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.630
neighborhood.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.630
So this is where he boarded.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:13.130
Now, I happen to have his diary
from his first full

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.570
winter at Hunnewell
Avenue in Newton.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.460
And it starts January
10, 1898 and it

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.970
goes through the spring.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:30.000
So I'm a little mixed up about
the timing, because I believe

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.140
this is his second year I
believe at Newton High.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:39.000
His first year he came up, he
got an A in arithmetic, a D in

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.350
drawing, and F's in
everything else.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.650
So it was not a good high school
he was coming from.

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.200
And he really had to catch up.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:49.130
By this time, I think it's the
second year, he's got his feet

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:50.520
under him and he's
doing better.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:53.790
So he's boarding in
the winter of '98.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.030
And I just want to read a few
little details that will give

00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.010
you a sense of what life was
like, daily life was like for

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:02.250
him at that time.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.040
This is the Second Industrial
Revolution, is what we call it

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.660
from up here.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.100
But down here, this
is what it's like.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.310
After school, this is high
school, he says, this is

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:15.740
January 12, I went up to Lasell
and read Cicero with

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.432
cousin Mary.

00:15:17.432 --> 00:15:19.976
Who's Cicero?

00:15:19.976 --> 00:15:21.655
What does this tell you?

00:15:21.655 --> 00:15:23.830
You read Cicero in Latin.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:26.260
You start with doing Cicero.

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.770
You wind up with Cicero
and Virgil.

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.490
So he's reading his Latin
with his cousin.

00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:37.740
And then she gave me a supper
of canned chicken, cocoa,

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.400
bread, butter, crackers,
and peanut butter.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.040
I had a fine time.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.770
OK, canned chicken?

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.470
I mean I don't have
to rub this in.

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:47.360
You can figure this out.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:48.540
This is not off the farm.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.220
Canned chicken, cocoa, you know
we're dealing with the

00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:54.970
Caribbean at least, if that's
not the East Indies.

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.450
Bread, butter, all
right, crackers--

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.420
packaged food-- and
peanut butter.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.090
OK.

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:06.050
So he mentions that-- at home,
he got a letter from home.

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:08.810
And the letter from home says
four factories were going up

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:12.230
in Laurel and vicinity
for canning.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.300
He, my father--

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.840
this is my grandfather's father,
he is going to put out

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.090
10 acres of tomatoes.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:21.620
He has only four cows now.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.390
So there's a lot of agricultural
history there.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:30.470
There's a new canning factory,
more tomatoes, fewer cows.

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:35.310
So just to jump ahead, my
grandfather would say that he

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:40.580
paid for his MIT tuition when he
got to MIT, with tomatoes,

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.736
sold to a cannery at $4 a ton.

00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.260
PROFESSOR: Jesus, $4 a ton.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.430
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: $4 a ton.

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.710
Now, he had the bright
idea, during his

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.760
college years, of recycling.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.540
That is, using the tomato skins,
which are removed in

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.320
the canning process, or they
tried to remove them, using

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.340
those skins to feed to
the cows as fodder.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.390
And they tried it.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:04.200
The cows ate them.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.810
But then they gave pink milk.

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.660
So it didn't work.

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.880
OK, just a few more of
these from his diary.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.430
We're still back in
January 1898.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.170
Today, as I was walking home
from school, cousin Mary in

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:19.260
the electrics--

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.079
so what are the electrics?

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.640
PROFESSOR: Trolleys.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:22.935
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Trolleys.

00:17:22.935 --> 00:17:26.530
OK, the street car suburbs--

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:27.750
this is a little digression.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.875
But this is showing how the
electric trolley system was

00:17:32.875 --> 00:17:34.070
being extended at the time.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:38.080
This is the Sam Best Warner's
classic study.

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:42.570
And the trolley, which I
remember from my childhood,

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.340
near Hunewell Avenue, where he
lived, is just a block away.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.150
You can just walk.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:47.950
In fact, now it's
a bus system.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:49.700
But it's the same route.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.940
And you can get on where
we live and go to

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.840
Fenway Park in one stop.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.211
PROFESSOR: No wonder you live
in that neighborhood.

00:17:57.211 --> 00:17:59.460
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Of
course, you got it.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.650
Then we went into Boston.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.340
Cousin Mary in the electrics,
saw me, got out and walked

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:04.770
home with me.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.180
Then we went into Boston.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.050
Now, this would have been on the
train track, which is the

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.475
other side of the hill
that he's looking on.

00:18:10.475 --> 00:18:11.610
Went into Boston.

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:18.620
And she bought two tin basins,
a pie pan, a strainer, and a

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.270
dozen knives and forks.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.830
She carried it in a mug strainer
belonging to the

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:26.430
coffee pot, to fit the strainer
she brought to it.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.400
So she's buying a piece
for her coffee pot.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.912
She's buying all this
stuff, taking the

00:18:31.912 --> 00:18:33.610
electrics into Boston.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:35.810
So this tells you a lot
about technological

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:37.900
systems of the day.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.230
But I think my favorite
entry from this

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:49.860
diary, this is in February.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.450
He says, I went downtown.

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:52.500
This would be Newton Corner.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:56.920
I went downtown in the evening
and rode, R-O-D-E, underlined.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:02.060
I asked a man passing, for
a ride, and he consented.

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.220
It was the first time,
underlined, I've ridden,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.910
underlined, on or behind a horse
since last September,

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:12.740
and I a farmer's boy.

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:16.200
So there's cars, there's
trolleys, there's trains.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.860
But he wants to ride the horse,
because that's what

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.570
farmers; boys did.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:21.390
There's a lot.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.430
I could go on and on
about what you find

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.560
out from this diary.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.030
There's a lot of reading,
Cicero, Shakespeare.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.260
There's a lot of magazines.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.270
He's reading magazines a lot.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.260
He's going to church.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.330
There are church plays.

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.110
There are glee club performances
at Lasell.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:39.170
He goes into Boston for lectures
at the temple,

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.340
Fremont Temple.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:44.360
He goes to the Museum of Fine
Arts, still with us, discusses

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.670
modern illustrators who
are exhibited there.

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.770
Then cousin Mary gives
him some pictures.

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:53.920
But I mean it is an information

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:55.050
age, in its own way.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:20:00.670
It's just a different
kind of media.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.510
But he's very connected.

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.900
So, for example, on January
20, he says he goes into

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.940
Boston to hear a lecture
on imperialism

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.580
by Dr. Lyman Abbott.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:16.140
Now why in 1898, is he going to
a lecture on imperialism?

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:17.440
What's going on?

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.690
What's the news?

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:21.760
Anybody know?

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.110
AUDIENCE: Spanish-American
War.

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:24.270
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: OK?

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.730
Which--

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:26.220
PROFESSOR: He said it.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.400
ROSALIND WILLIAMS:
Spanish-American War, go to

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.870
the head of the class, yeah.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:31.130
And it's interesting.

00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:34.660
He says the lecture was a fine
one in favor of staying to

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.940
help them, the Filipinos in
this case, learn to govern

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.730
themselves.

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.670
And then he goes to another
lecture the next week, same

00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:44.950
topic, another speaker, who
also make good points.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.760
But cousin Mary said
some bad ones.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:50.080
He attacked, the second speaker,
Dr. Abbott, the first

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.060
speaker, saying he had made some
misstatements concerning

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.530
the arguments on Californian
annexation and made McKinley

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.910
out as having imperial power.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.300
So there's debate going on.

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.040
And then on February 7, we
received our first news

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.360
yesterday of the Battle
of Manila.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.800
Reports of dead and wounded,
the gunboats

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.360
did a fearful execution.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.850
Then there's Washington's
birthday soon after, the

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.850
church bells ring all day.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:19.330
And my grandfather writes, these
are signs to me that it

00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:21.600
is the anniversary of the
birth of the greatest

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.180
American, underlined,
ever borne.

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.470
OK, anyway.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:27.486
PROFESSOR: It wasn't
Abe Lincoln.

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:30.045
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Um, true.

00:21:30.045 --> 00:21:30.820
PROFESSOR: It was GW.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:31.734
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It was GW.

00:21:31.734 --> 00:21:32.191
How about that.

00:21:32.191 --> 00:21:32.648
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:32.648 --> 00:21:34.020
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:34.910
PROFESSOR: Well, her--

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.410
yeah, but her--

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:38.070
it would be your great
grandfather's--

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.840
whose name is Henry Clay.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.100
Now, Henry Clay--

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:42.860
ROSALIND WILLIAMS:
That's another--

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.540
yeah.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:47.470
PROFESSOR: But Henry Clay
was Abraham Lincoln's

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:49.910
great idol in a way.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:53.180
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: I mean the
story of this family and

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.710
slavery is just fascinating.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:57.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's very
interesting, very interesting.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:02.850
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Well, I just
showed you this paper of

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:05.470
my grandmother's, my
grandfather's wife, on the

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:08.150
Negro problem in 1921.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:11.475
Because my grandfather, he
wanted to go back to the farm

00:22:11.475 --> 00:22:15.570
and improve race relations by
starting that farm up again in

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:16.600
the right way.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.250
And that never happened.

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.230
But that was the idea.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.110
OK, instead what happens?

00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:24.180
In the spring, he asked two
teachers at Newton High what

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.400
they thought would be best for
him to do about college?

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.295
They will think it
over, he writes.

00:22:29.295 --> 00:22:33.600
But the former advised either
Amherst Agricultural--

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.160
what's that?

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.330
PROFESSOR: New Mass.

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:36.740
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's
the University of Amherst now,

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:39.780
the Ag School-- other Amherst
agriculture, or as even

00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:41.330
better, tech.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:44.520
One of them mentioned
Cornell, but tech.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.850
Here we are.

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:48.320
So he thinks about it.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.062
By the way, this is just a
picture of downtown Boston,

00:22:51.062 --> 00:22:54.010
when they take the
train in there.

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:58.950
I was there Friday, meeting
my son and his girlfriend.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.680
It's not--

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.280
they're not people
like I know.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.840
And I was saying to my son, oh
gee, my grandparent's would be

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.100
so distressed to see this.

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.700
And he said-- he has a place
in Fort Point, he said.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.750
But that's up and coming.

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:12.736
That needs to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:12.736 --> 00:23:15.950
And now, it's happening.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.620
But let me just mention, I mean
these are quick reminders

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:24.270
that the occupation of
engineering was growing very

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:27.040
quickly at the time.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.910
And that the people who went
into engineering--

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:35.210
my grandfather is very typical,
in being off the farm

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.755
and not particularly
well educated.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.200
This is the way for young men,
almost always young men, to

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.310
have a professional or
quasi-professional career,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.270
without having to consider
postgraduate study, like law

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.400
or divinity or medicine
required.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.030
So here's Boston Tech.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:00.890
You must have seen this picture

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:02.470
somewhat, in this class.

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:06.170
Here's Trinity Church
in Copley Square.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.770
This is Boston Tech?

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:08.860
PROFESSOR: It's Boston Tech.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.520
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.440
And I've seen other photos where
I can't really place it.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:16.920
So I would love to see somebody
do a sort of up to

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.500
date GPS showing exactly--

00:24:21.330 --> 00:24:23.100
AUDIENCE: So that's
still there.

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.690
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: That's
there, yeah.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:28.252
AUDIENCE: And then across the
street from that building is

00:24:28.252 --> 00:24:30.741
Brooks Brothers, on Berkeley
Street, across from

00:24:30.741 --> 00:24:30.970
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:32.586
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: This is all
one big building there.

00:24:32.586 --> 00:24:33.980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.690
PROFESSOR: There's actually a
plaque on the front of that

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:36.285
office building

00:24:36.285 --> 00:24:38.720
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: But there was
another building, not the

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.210
Rogers Building, but
another building,

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.430
like off to the side.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.244
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:24:43.244 --> 00:24:44.160
It would be in that direction.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.670
AUDIENCE: There's a
bunch of stuff.

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:49.993
Mark Jarzombek showed us a map,
and sort of to the right

00:24:49.993 --> 00:24:51.125
of where the photograph is.

00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:54.940
There's train tracks
and stuff there.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.930
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Now, the
steep steps, was that on this

00:24:57.930 --> 00:25:01.560
building, on the Rogers
Building, or the second one?

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.460
PROFESSOR: I think
it's right there.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.340
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Oh, there.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:05.050
PROFESSOR: Right there.

00:25:05.050 --> 00:25:05.670
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Oh, OK.

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:06.520
OK.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.930
Because again, my grandfather
had a story about a kind of a

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:13.630
riot involving Harvard and MIT
students and a fire and he was

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:14.720
on the witness stand.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.280
And it had to do
with the steps.

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:19.850
Some things don't change.

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:21.300
AUDIENCE: Mark talked
about the difference

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:21.450
between those two--

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.840
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: These
two buildings.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.180
AUDIENCE: --buildings.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.764
But they're separated by
a couple of decades.

00:25:25.764 --> 00:25:29.748
But closer is a custom-built
laboratory, where you can see

00:25:29.748 --> 00:25:31.242
the fumes of the vents coming
at the top there.

00:25:31.242 --> 00:25:32.736
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Oh, that
has happened here.

00:25:32.736 --> 00:25:34.230
That's fascinating.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:37.880
So in the subway spot at
Kimball, it says the second

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.036
building MIT build was
a gym, a gymnasium?

00:25:41.036 --> 00:25:42.720
Does anybody--

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.830
I just read it there the
other day, thinking

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:48.010
that's the first I knew.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:55.270
So Warren K. Lewis enters MIT
in 1901, planning to study

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:58.520
chemical engineer-- excuse me,
mechanical engineering, still

00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.680
the dominant engineering, kind
of the default mode.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:08.310
But he had a friend, this friend
that he was boarding

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:13.470
with in Newton, whose sister he
eventually married, urged

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.110
him to try chemical
engineering.

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:19.300
It seemed more interesting
and so on and so forth.

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.940
So as you know from your
reading, something like

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.350
industrial chemistry
had begun.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:31.480
Actually, it was 1888, I think
was the first offerings in

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.020
industrial chemistry.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:35.090
And by 1893, there was a lab.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:38.060
This is sort of like the
first start of chemical

00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.290
engineering at MIT.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.110
But then because of deaths and

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.400
departures, it sort of declined.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:47.480
But just when my grandfather's
was entering, actually in

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:49.980
1903, this is when Walker
comes back.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.110
And Noyes had been there
for a couple years.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.770
So it's sort of like a
false start early on.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:57.740
And then it kind of
restarted around

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.260
the turn of the century.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:04.710
And this is something that he
wrote many years later, that I

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:08.800
think captures the overall
feeling of the time.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.070
Lewis wrote, the stimulus of
these concepts, and he's

00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:15.650
referring to unit operations
and these related concepts,

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:18.610
the stimulus of these concepts
made work in chemical

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:21.730
engineering at the Institute
from 1902 to the outbreak of

00:27:21.730 --> 00:27:26.580
World War I an inspiration for
both staff and student, which

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.400
it is impossible to describe.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.960
So these are happening years.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.870
I mean the tension between
Noyes and Walker is a

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:37.120
productive tension.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:43.290
They had each other
to play off of.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:44.710
And they certainly did.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.830
By the way, you know
Walker, that's not

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.050
Walker, Memorial Walker.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.660
Walker Memorial is named after
Francis Amasa Walker, one of

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:53.950
the early presidents.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:54.780
Have I got it right?

00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:55.610
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:57.825
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: And we're
talking about William Walker.

00:28:00.704 --> 00:28:02.290
It's no relation.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.790
So it's important to
those straight.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.330
So you have these two very
strong personalities.

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:13.960
This is Noyes, trained in
Germany, a physical chemist.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:19.400
And really brought in serious
chemistry to the program,

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.710
beginning in 1902.

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:26.450
And then you have William H.
Walker, who had also been

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:30.280
educated in Germany, Penn State
and Gottingen, both.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.960
And was teaching analytical
chemistry, the partner of A.D.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.190
Little, which was originally
Little and Walker.

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.840
So he was entrusted with
Course 10 in 1903.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.570
And was entrusted with building
it up into a chemical

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:47.330
engineering curriculum.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:49.750
Now this, you can't read.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.650
But I will read to you, because
this is Walker's

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.440
statement written years later.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.930
This was after he
had left MIT.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.870
This is either from the late
'20s or early '30s--

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.840
well, he died in the '30s.

00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.210
So this is his statement of
what he was trying to do.

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.200
It's a fascinating statement.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.800
So I'm going to read you
what Walker wrote.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.940
What an industry needed was not
a man who had been taught

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:19.010
what the industry already knew,
but rather a man who was

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:20.880
trained to do what the
industry had not

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:23.080
been able to do.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.900
The ideal man for the industries
was one who had

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:28.420
been given a sound knowledge
of chemistry and physics.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.030
And then as a part of the
curriculum, had been given

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:34.560
systematic experience in the
application of this knowledge

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.980
to the solution of industrial
problems.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.800
That he should not be a
specialist, but a solver of

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:43.740
problems, any kind of problem
that industry might present.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.580
And then he goes on to say, this
idea met opposition, both

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.320
from established courses
of chemical

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.525
instruction and from industry.

00:29:50.525 --> 00:29:53.620
And the industry thought
it was too theoretical.

00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:57.200
But the scientists thought it
was too industry oriented.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.350
So Walker is on this very nice
edge between not trying to

00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:03.870
give into one or the other.

00:30:03.870 --> 00:30:05.380
And then he goes on and says--

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.790
this at the top of the second
paragraph, I love this--

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:09.560
to prove the soundness
of this idea, I

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.760
returned to MIT in 1903.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.810
And after a hot fight with
both the chemical and the

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:17.960
engineering faculties, I
reconstructed Course X as a

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.050
general educational course
without options.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.480
And without options, that turns
out to be important.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.560
So this is a feisty guy.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.990
And I'm sure that's one reason
he and my grandfather got

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.070
along very well.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:34.270
They were both feisty people,
very self assured.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.440
But my grandfather always would
say, it is Walker who

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:40.090
invented chemical engineering
in this country.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.310
He did not claim that
for himself at all.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:45.410
But again, my grandfather
studied.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.520
With Noyes.

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.750
You know, I was just reminding
you, this is particularly in

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.630
Servos's article.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:55.510
My grandfather studied with
Noyes, took P-Chem from him,

00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:02.290
and graduating in the
class of '05.

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:04.416
My grandfather's is this kind of
this grim-- he looks-- kind

00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:07.690
of a grim looking guy.

00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.700
And you'll see another
picture.

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.370
I'll pass it around.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:13.440
In the spring of his senior
year, he expected to go back

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:16.510
to the farm, as much as you and
I expect the Sun to come

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:17.190
up tomorrow.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:24.920
However, he got a job in the
lab, I think with Noyes.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:29.320
And then that led to somebody,
I don't know whether it was

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:32.350
Noyes or Walker, one of them
suggested that he apply for a

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.770
traveling fellowship which
was being offered.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:38.280
And it was $1,000 stipend, which
is that day and age was

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:40.140
a lot of money.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.330
A traveling fellowship,
he could go

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:44.070
anywhere for a doctorate.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.510
And so he really was
not interested.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:50.840
But one of them basically
appealed to his competitive

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.010
spirit and kind of said well, if
you don't get it, somebody

00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:54.880
else is going to get it.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.970
And $1,000 sounded very nice.

00:31:56.970 --> 00:32:02.545
He applied, got it and was on
his way to Breslau, in what is

00:32:02.545 --> 00:32:05.310
now Germany, it's kind of on the
Polish-German border, for

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:07.640
graduate school the next year.

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:12.715
Later, he found he was in fact
the only applicant that year.

00:32:12.715 --> 00:32:14.200
PROFESSOR: Well, it's
interesting.

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.170
Think about what the Harvard
class of 1905, where they

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:19.650
might have chosen to have
their picture taken.

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:19.955
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Aah.

00:32:19.955 --> 00:32:22.962
AUDIENCE: I'm sure it was
not in the laboratory.

00:32:22.962 --> 00:32:23.950
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:23.950 --> 00:32:28.938
I mean this is a good example,
where it tells you so much.

00:32:28.938 --> 00:32:30.930
It does.

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.072
Began with the names
and faces.

00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:34.458
AUDIENCE: Books piled up
in the front of them.

00:32:34.458 --> 00:32:35.382
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:37.700
So--

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.550
AUDIENCE: What's in the
books on the front?

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.390
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:42.390
Oh yeah, that's great.

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:52.200
So this is his dissertation in
German, from Breslau, three

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.910
years later.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:59.040
He wrote it in Florence, because
he thought Florence

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:01.040
was the most beautiful city in
the world, and why not write

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.070
your dissertation there?

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.870
I recommend that highly,
if any of you write

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.320
dissertations.

00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.680
But this is Germany.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.400
And just keep that in mind when
we get to World War II.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:12.314
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:33:12.314 --> 00:33:13.230
AUDIENCE: World War I.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:15.820
PROFESSOR: And he was
sufficiently literate in

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.000
German to be able to write
a dissertation.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:17.440
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:17.740
Yeah.

00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:20.730
Well, he never felt his
German was that great.

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:24.710
And in fact, back to Latin, a
story he tells us taking the

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:27.570
train to Italy, or maybe
back from Italy.

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:30.830
But in any case, he was seated
next to somebody-- maybe they

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.220
were like Polish or something.

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:34.040
But German didn't work.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.290
The other person didn't
know English.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.600
So they conversed in Latin.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.110
PROFESSOR: Is that right?

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:39.250
ROSALIND WILLIAMS:
You never know.

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:39.460
PROFESSOR: It's fascinating.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.970
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It
may come in handy.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.560
So then he comes back to--

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:47.810
well, he has a year working
at a tannery in

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.190
Manchester, New Hampshire.

00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:52.640
And as a result of that
experience, he always said

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.750
tanneries do not have
to pollute.

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:57.350
It's not necessary, if
you run them right.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:59.560
And they don't have to smell
either, that's the other thing

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.720
you associate was a tannery.

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:06.480
So he comes back.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:12.300
And you can see how chemical
engineering around 1910,

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:16.489
there's this kind of reversal
of who was majoring in what.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.840
And this is before the war.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:25.060
Because when World War I comes,
even before the US

00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:29.570
enters World War I, the Great
War, in 1917, there's a

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.330
tremendous demand for
military equipment.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:39.219
And chemical engineering is
connected with gas warfare,

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:42.909
which was used right near the
beginning of the war.

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:47.560
It was in the spring of 1915
that chlorine was first used

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:51.440
on the battlefield
as a poison gas.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:53.922
Chlorine is not the most
effective, by any means.

00:34:53.922 --> 00:34:55.679
It dissipates pretty quickly.

00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:59.880
But the surprise factor was such
that it really did work

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:01.310
in the initial use.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:05.650
And it had a tremendous
psychological effect in

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:10.340
scaring people on both sides.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.170
So Walker, William Walker, was
put in charge of the Edgewood

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:17.710
Arsenal, once the US
entered the war, to

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:19.780
manufacture toxic gases.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:24.790
And my grandfather was put
in charge of gas defense.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:27.160
So he worked on the masks.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.460
And there's all sorts of--

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.860
I mean this is very specialized
equipment.

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:36.240
And to try to design equipment
that made it possible to keep

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:39.770
fighting and yet would protect
the soldier from poison gas,

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.276
not just the soldier but--

00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:45.720
do I have some of the--
the animals too.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:49.030
In fact, there's a whole long
story about the horses being

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:51.520
affected by mustard gas,
which is a vesicant.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.620
And it's a much nastier gas.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.680
And it would affect
the animals too.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:58.730
So the one story that I need
to tell you about my

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:05.490
grandfather and gas defense,
this made such an

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:08.370
impression on me.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:09.935
We had this conversation
was I was a teenager.

00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:19.090
Let's see, he said there was not
a single Allied soldier--

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.423
am I taking too much?

00:36:20.423 --> 00:36:20.525
PROFESSOR: No, no.

00:36:20.525 --> 00:36:22.360
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It won't
take much longer.

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:27.570
There's not a single Allied
soldier is World War I who

00:36:27.570 --> 00:36:32.530
died from poison gas when they
had the gas mask and other

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.060
equipment on.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.960
And I grandpa, you must been so
proud because you designed

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:41.840
something that was fail-safe.

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.330
It worked every time.

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:48.020
And he said no, it means
I over designed.

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:54.140
And what he meant was the
cost of putting on a

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.360
mask is quite high.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.820
It's makes it hard to breathe.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:59.310
And it does encumber you.

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:04.020
So in designing the gas
mask, you have to make

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:07.110
it just on the edge.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:10.210
Because then, soldiers are more
likely to put it on in

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.660
the first place.

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.000
So by over designing it, it
meant that he was surmising

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.650
that more people had died
but not putting

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:17.890
on the mask at all.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.050
Because it was such
a pain to put on.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:25.910
And for an engineer to think
that way about human life, it

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:29.182
just really took me aback.

00:37:29.182 --> 00:37:33.850
And I thought, boy, that's
responsibility.

00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:38.230
After he died in 1975, you clean
out the house of the

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.370
person who has passed on.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:47.510
And down in the cellar, big
basement, in the furnace room

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:48.790
there are these shelves.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:53.340
And there were all these gas
masks lined up on the shelves.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:58.450
And it turned out at the end of
the war, the Allied troops

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:01.860
have given him a model of each
of the gas masks that had been

00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:03.760
used by the Allies in the war.

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.590
So he had this collection of
gas masks that were just

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.770
sitting down there.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:12.325
And I called the Smithsonian and
I called the MIT Museum,

00:38:12.325 --> 00:38:14.410
and I said I think this
is really interesting.

00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:16.705
But nobody took the gas masks.

00:38:16.705 --> 00:38:20.606
So they have thrown out,
because I tried.

00:38:20.606 --> 00:38:22.550
I tried.

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:24.206
AUDIENCE: You weren't tempted to
just mount them on wall in

00:38:24.206 --> 00:38:26.420
your living room?

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.180
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Well,
they're odd.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:31.090
Well, I mean we'd been looking
at pictures from Japan,

00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.170
testing children.

00:38:32.170 --> 00:38:36.380
And when you get in a haz
suit, it's really scary.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.710
It's just very curious,
period.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.343
So no, I was not inclined
to keep them around.

00:38:39.343 --> 00:38:41.510
I was just surprised somebody
didn't want them.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:45.570
Well, actually now
I can go back to

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.302
gas masks for a minute.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:54.950
You've read about the tension
between Noyes and Walker,

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.410
Walker finally leaving.

00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:59.410
My grandfather finally becoming
head of the chemical

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.300
engineering department in 1920,

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.630
known as Walker's protege.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:08.360
But also the real appreciation
for the science-based

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.060
engineering.

00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:12.920
And the more I read Servos's
article, the more I would love

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.670
to look at his headship of
Course 10 in that period.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.240
I think it's a really
interesting story.

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:20.750
I don't know it.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:24.176
But I'm almost sure
it's there.

00:39:24.176 --> 00:39:29.000
OK, he it comes back.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.810
Heads the department for 10
years, but that isn't what he

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:32.400
wants to do.

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.590
He's not an administrative
type.

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.030
He doesn't like it.

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.550
He loves teaching and he's
famous for his teaching.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:42.770
And that's where he really
made his mark.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.490
But he did a lot of consulting
for what was what was then

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:49.640
Standard Oil in New Jersey,
Esso, Exxon.

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.500
And one thing your articles
didn't mention I think is the

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.160
relationship between the
university and industry

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.930
through consulting
work and how that

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:02.880
fits into the picture.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.850
And he was a great believer in
the value of consulting.

00:40:05.850 --> 00:40:09.890
That's how you find out what's
happening in the world and it

00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:10.880
keeps you on your toes.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:12.820
And it's also useful
for industry.

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:19.330
So he, to his death, he got a
check every month from Exxon.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:22.170
I mean it wasn't a lot,
but it was a retainer.

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:23.540
And he died at what, 94.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:27.740
So they were very loyal
to him and vice versa.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:35.480
So this is a drawing of the
catalytic cracking process.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.405
Let's see, have you been to
the MIT Museum exhibit?

00:40:37.405 --> 00:40:38.120
You must have been.

00:40:38.120 --> 00:40:38.500
AUDIENCE: I have.

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.990
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: OK.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.985
And you go through
the whole thing.

00:40:40.985 --> 00:40:43.660
And just when you're going to
leave when to go out of the

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:50.820
exhibit in that back room, on
the left, is a picture of my

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.410
grandfather and a couple other
gentlemen at a refinery in

00:40:54.410 --> 00:41:00.080
Venezuela where catalytic
cracking has been put into

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.000
production in 1939.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.030
And there's a barrel
above there, an

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:06.070
empty barrel I trust.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.120
But anyway, just to
make the exhibit

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.090
about catalytic cracking.

00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:14.720
But the timing, 1939, means that
once the war broke out in

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:19.200
1940, the demand for aviation
fuel was huge.

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:22.740
I mean catalytic cracking began
as a way to get higher

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:24.365
octane for automobiles.

00:41:24.365 --> 00:41:27.440
And it was the automobile
race that instigated it.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.730
AUDIENCE: Does everybody know
what catalytic cracking is?

00:41:30.730 --> 00:41:34.130
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: So let me
give my brief, nontechnical--

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.670
actually this is very
interesting.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.330
He did the work in the basement
of Building 12.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:46.120
And you need some kind
of a catalytic agent

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.560
to promote the cracking.

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:54.690
It's usually a powder and its
mixed in with the petroleum to

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.730
get more higher octane fractions
or lighter weight

00:41:58.730 --> 00:42:01.440
fractions out of a certain
amount of petroleum.

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:04.420
So if you have the same amount
of petroleum and the cracking

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.430
works efficiently, you get more
usable high octane fuel

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.560
than you do without it.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.000
So you have this--

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.588
AUDIENCE: You take crude oil,
basically, and separating out

00:42:12.588 --> 00:42:13.381
all the parts.

00:42:13.381 --> 00:42:16.330
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It's part of
the distillation process.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:19.870
And a higher octane means you
can run engines faster and get

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:23.112
more power out of them, without
knocking and so forth.

00:42:23.112 --> 00:42:25.880
You know when you need higher
octane, if you fill up your

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:28.320
car and your car starts
knocking.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.000
That's a sign that things
are not going well.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.090
It's true in cars.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:32.410
It's true in airplanes.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:38.850
So they were trying to blow
the catalyst through the

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.170
petroleum stream.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.070
But as a pattern, it
kept settling out.

00:42:44.070 --> 00:42:47.340
It didn't stay mixed
in with the stream.

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.110
So after months and months of
work, on trying to get it to

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:53.640
hold into the stream, my
grandfather, who was famously

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:58.000
profane, said damn it,
let it settle out.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.060
And in other words, if you let
it settle out, then you get a

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:04.480
fluid bed at kind of the
bottom of the reactor.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:09.360
And it mixes the fumes, the
petroleum fumes with, or

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:13.165
gases, with the catalyst, better
than if you try to blow

00:43:13.165 --> 00:43:15.360
it along with the stream.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.320
So it's fluid-bed catalytic
cracking that he and his

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:25.330
students are known for and
brought a huge fortune to

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:28.300
Exxon, which is one of
the early adopters.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:31.050
What he never imagined
was that--

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:33.150
again, it comes on
line in 1939.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:38.030
Within a year, the tankers are
going to Venezuela to fill up

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:41.500
with a high octane aviation
fuel, going to the docks of

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.050
Liverpool, and pumping
the fuel into

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.080
the tanks of Spitfires.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.740
They don't even put it
in the holding tank.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.670
They put it right in the
tanks of the airplanes.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.830
And the Spitfires go
up to do battle in

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:56.760
the Battle of Britain.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:44:04.040
So it's a dramatic example of
what you do and then how

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:08.240
things happen to change the
implications of what you do,

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.290
that are entirely out
of your control.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:12.580
That of course is also
the story of

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.830
the Manhattan Project.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.060
When the Manhattan Project
got under way--

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.030
do I have any slides
about this?

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.540
Oh, this goes back, OK--

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:33.710
basically my grandfather is
asked to head up the series of

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:38.530
committees making
recommendations about the

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:42.950
extraction and refinement
of fissionable material.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.660
In other words, the chemical
engineering problems of the

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:52.590
atomic weapons, they require
high grade ore, high grade

00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:54.220
uranium or plutonium.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.220
And how do you get it?

00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.690
That's an engineering problem.

00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:58.450
That's a chemical engineering
problem.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:03.446
So if you go to the MIT archives
and ask for Warren K.

00:45:03.446 --> 00:45:07.376
Lewis material, a lot of it is
still classified from World

00:45:07.376 --> 00:45:10.460
War II, but there is a notebook
that he kept when he

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:13.760
was going around to, trying
to figure out--

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:16.100
I think this is 1941.

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:20.110
When was the chain reaction
started? '42, right, in Stagg

00:45:20.110 --> 00:45:21.070
Field, Chicago?

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:22.010
AUDIENCE: Chicago?

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.370
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Chicago.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:23.040
Was that earlier?

00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:23.540
AUDIENCE: Earlier.

00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:24.075
ROSALIND WILLIAMS:
It was earlier.

00:45:24.075 --> 00:45:26.340
AUDIENCE: Before the
war I think.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:27.820
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: In the
middle of this notebook,

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.420
appears that event.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:32.030
And he's going around to
DuPont, to Oak Ridge.

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:35.500
He's going out to Berkeley,
Lawrence Lab, talking to all

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:40.600
these people, trying to figure
out how to do the refining to

00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:44.400
get the material that they would
need for these weapons.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.650
And he served on a series
of committees.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:53.550
Was gone all during the war,
kind of overseeing the

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.790
construction and the development
of these vast

00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:00.872
facilities, especially at Oak
Ridge, also out in Hanford.

00:46:00.872 --> 00:46:04.560
AUDIENCE: If you look at the
Manhattan Project, which my

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.194
favorite statistics would be
the size of the US auto

00:46:07.194 --> 00:46:11.200
industry at the time, a huge
project, less that 10% of it

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.960
is concentrated at Los Alamos
or [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.468
Brilliant physicists are--

00:46:16.468 --> 00:46:19.610
and most of it were chemical
engineering plants in

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:24.362
Tennessee and in Washington
state, huge plants making the

00:46:24.362 --> 00:46:27.050
actual material.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:32.390
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: So he told
his wife, my grandmother, just

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:33.410
don't ask where I am.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:37.410
But if you need me in an
emergency, you call General

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:41.220
Groves in Washington, and gave
her the phone number.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.350
And again, I presume the
students have already heard

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.850
this, but my mother was
married in 1940 and

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.210
I was born in 1944.

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:51.570
So this was kind of
like the next

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:53.390
generation was coming along.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:56.807
And my mother tells me that
when she heard the Lowell

00:46:56.807 --> 00:46:59.620
Thomas announcement of the
bomb being dropped on

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:03.780
Hiroshima, on the radio, she
said now I know where pop's

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.490
been, all the war.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.380
And I'm a baby.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:15.650
And we're back to Japan
these days.

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:22.335
OK, I have to think he was
deeply troubled by his role in

00:47:22.335 --> 00:47:24.730
the Manhattan Project because
he didn't talk about it.

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:27.340
He talked a lot about World
War I and gas masks.

00:47:27.340 --> 00:47:30.360
But World War II, he just--

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.400
I mean I wish I had pressed
him more, but I didn't.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.850
My mother said that
after the war--

00:47:36.850 --> 00:47:40.630
for example, at those days if
you got a watch, a wrist

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:42.820
watch, and you wanted it to glow
in the dark, they put a

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.460
little radium on the dial just
to make it glow in the dark.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.320
And he would scrape it off.

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.980
He didn't want any of
that stuff near him.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.480
Anyway, so I'm surmising.

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:58.830
But he chaired the Lewis
committee, and you'll hear a

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:01.460
lot more about that, kept
teaching at MIT.

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:05.830
My husband had him as a kind
of senior thesis adviser in

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.000
the early 1960s.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.450
And there's a lot of letters
that he wrote about the role

00:48:14.450 --> 00:48:17.040
of the engineer and
civilization, the profession

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.360
of engineering.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.090
And this quote from
the Lewis Report I

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:23.700
think really captures--

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:26.285
I mean we don't know who
actually wrote it.

00:48:26.285 --> 00:48:28.640
Maybe it Morrison or somebody.

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.850
But he really believes that.

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:37.930
He said, if I could come back,
it would be as a social

00:48:37.930 --> 00:48:41.470
scientist, because that's where
the big problems are,

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:43.050
the really intractable ones.

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:45.790
I can see after World War II
why you would say that.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:49.280
So that's the--

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.680
yeah, the Spring Garden
farm again.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:52.910
OK, so back to the farm.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:49:01.610
So what I did in about 15
minutes before class was just

00:49:01.610 --> 00:49:03.240
go through my box of stuff.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.800
And I'm just going to
pass this around.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.850
Obviously, just collect
it back there, when it

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.920
gets back to you.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.240
The point is what you learn from
archives that you don't

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:17.300
learn from reading articles
or so forth.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.380
Monthly Report, Laurel City
Schools, Laurel, Delaware,

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.560
Report of Warren Lewis, 1895.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.740
This tells you sort of, not only
what his grades are, but

00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:27.350
what they're teaching.

00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:28.570
PROFESSOR: Is that the
original document?

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:29.740
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: That's
the document.

00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.200
Why do I have this stuff?

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.488
I have no idea.

00:49:33.488 --> 00:49:37.130
I gave a lot of it
to the archives.

00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:38.610
And they have copies of this.

00:49:38.610 --> 00:49:40.850
And I kept a few original
documents.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:42.060
There's a lot more.

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.840
I mean I am from a very
literate family.

00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.620
I don't know how
else to put it.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:50.080
Now Ross Basset told you about
going through MIT yearbooks

00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:52.863
and looking at where
people are from?

00:49:52.863 --> 00:49:54.760
PROFESSOR: A little bit.

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.230
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: This is my
grandfather on the left.

00:49:57.230 --> 00:50:03.320
So this is what Ross was looking
at, hometown and list.

00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:05.660
My grandfather's list
is very brief.

00:50:05.660 --> 00:50:09.430
But again, I just thought
you'd like to see.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:14.780
And Breslau, here are
photographs of Breslau, where

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:19.690
he studied, got his Ph.D.
I mean it got bombed to

00:50:19.690 --> 00:50:20.670
smithereens in the war.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:22.370
None of this is here anymore.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.870
But this is old Germany.

00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:29.730
PROFESSOR: Did you ever go back
to try to visit there?

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:33.330
ROSALIND WILLIAMS:
Not Breslau, no.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.100
I think it blew all
to smithereens.

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.360
PROFESSOR: Probably
nothing to see.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.040
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: And I had a
couple of bigger photos, that

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:40.800
are really beauties, that I
have framed it at home.

00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:42.255
And here's his dissertation.

00:50:42.255 --> 00:50:47.210
I'm not sure, my German
not being workable.

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:52.080
But it's signed Rosalind D.
Kenway, from Warren, July '05,

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.330
that's my grandmother.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:02.410
The Tech, special chemistry
and chemical engineering

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:05.030
issue, 1910.

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:08.720
So remember that chart showing
chemistry is going down and

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.650
chemical-- so this is published
at that time.

00:51:10.650 --> 00:51:15.070
I have no idea why I have
this, but I do.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.580
And it's so interesting.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.470
Few industries not founded
on chemistry, it says.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:25.880
Now, this is a Xerox.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:30.840
This is his father basically
selling off the stock of the

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.220
farm, public sale of
valuable cows.

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:37.830
And this is what his father
writes in 1917, back in

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:38.930
Laurel, Delaware.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:42.870
I have sailed life's storm-swept
sea for 74 years

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:44.880
and I am now nearing port.

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.430
I smell the land.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:49.430
It is wise that I should take
in-- and I can't read it.

00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:51.710
But it must be take
in the sails--

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.250
Therefore on--

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:55.790
He's going to sell
his milk cows.

00:51:55.790 --> 00:51:58.610
This is the start of the decline
of agriculture in the

00:51:58.610 --> 00:52:03.350
United States right here,
the family farm.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.760
This is the high school, now
Newton North, Newton high

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.360
school kind of review
magazine.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:14.490
This is 1918.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:17.730
A lot of young men are
going over to Europe.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:22.490
But it talks about a Newton
high school scientist.

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:25.320
Of the many capable men on the
defense side of chemical

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.450
warfare service, perhaps none
has contributed more practical

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:30.050
ideas that Dr. Lewis.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:33.510
This is his high school,
hall of fame, kind of.

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:34.760
This is page 10.

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:40.150
My kids went to the
same school.

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:41.306
PROFESSOR: Newton North?

00:52:41.306 --> 00:52:43.170
ROSALIND WILLIAMS:
Yeah, of course.

00:52:43.170 --> 00:52:44.465
OK, this is March 5, 1920.

00:52:44.465 --> 00:52:45.715
PROFESSOR: Of course.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:50.060
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: You
got to show spirit.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:51.660
PROFESSOR: Of course.

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:53.527
Boy if live in Newton,
there's a difference.

00:52:53.527 --> 00:52:53.880
I know that.

00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:54.050
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: A
different Newton.

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:56.410
It matters whether it's
north or south.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:53:02.170
OK, Debbie K. Lewis, required
Course 10, 1920.

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.770
His time here seems
very interesting.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:06.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:09.330 --> 00:53:10.420
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Well,
actually I won't pass this

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:11.810
around because he-- well,
maybe I will.

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:13.270
This is Spring Garden farm.

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.242
I showed you the photo
actually earlier.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:28.190
OK, here we have-- oh look,
August 5, 1946.

00:53:28.190 --> 00:53:29.830
Anybody know what happened
on August 5, 19--

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:34.441
you know what happened
on August 6, 1945?

00:53:34.441 --> 00:53:37.000
It's Hiroshima.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.880
A year minus a day later, James
R. Killian writes to Dr.

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.280
Compton, during the summer,
there have been a number of

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:48.550
discussions of the need to
promote here at the Institute,

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:51.380
more interest in the study of
educational objectives and

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:52.340
procedures.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:56.130
This calls for the Lewis
Commission essentially.

00:53:56.130 --> 00:54:00.000
And it's a letter saying
Lewis should head it.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.850
And here's some people who
should be on it, and here's

00:54:02.850 --> 00:54:04.400
the budget.

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.760
And then a second letter,
outlining in more detail what

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.662
the Lewis Commission would do.

00:54:10.662 --> 00:54:12.680
It follows shortly thereafter.

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:17.330
Then I just have a bunch of,
again my grandfather's

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:22.000
thoughts about the history
of chemical engineering;

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.530
engineering as a profession; my
favorite title, "The Place

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:28.790
of Engineering in Society and
Civilization." This is from

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:30.380
Tech Review.

00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:32.460
And I thought you would enjoy
this title, "Chemical

00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:40.220
Engineering, A New Science,"
a new science, 1953.

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:46.190
And so these are all published
in one form or another.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.270
But then there are letters.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:52.440
And there are quite a few
letters to me, to my mother,

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:56.330
to my father, when my father's
trying to figure out-- this is

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:59.960
1945 and my father notes that
at GE, so many younger

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:03.030
engineers are getting offers
from small companies and

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:04.830
should be thinking about this?

00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:06.930
And my grandfather writes
this long letter

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:08.150
back, in long hand.

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:14.060
In 1970, somebody has asked
him for conversations.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:16.560
He wants to discuss the
fundamental differences

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.060
between Greek philosophy and
modern science on the purely

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:23.570
intellectual level.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.620
And he wants me to come
up and help him write

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.650
something about this.

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:31.320
And this is very moving because
he says, I am getting

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:38.210
older and it's hard for people
to understand me.

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:41.616
You, however, have heard enough
of it over the years so

00:55:41.616 --> 00:55:43.540
you know at least
the direction in

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.860
which my mind is working.

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.170
PROFESSOR: Ah, interesting.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:47.380
High compliment.

00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:47.730
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah.

00:55:47.730 --> 00:55:49.275
It's a huge compliment.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:55.920
Anyway, if you don't get
the personality,

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.040
you're missing things.

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:59.400
Thanksgiving dinner.

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:06.830
Actually this would be 1963,
the fall of 1963.

00:56:06.830 --> 00:56:09.790
So what happened in
the fall of 1963?

00:56:09.790 --> 00:56:11.375
PROFESSOR: Oh, Kennedy.

00:56:11.375 --> 00:56:12.670
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It was
right after Kennedy's

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:14.110
assassination.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.250
And my grandfather
is saying grace.

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:18.890
I remember this like
yesterday.

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.900
He had his usual grace and he
gave thanks for the American

00:56:22.900 --> 00:56:25.880
family, because in such
difficult times like these,

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:28.320
that's the rock on which the
country is founded, the

00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.510
American family.

00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:34.580
This is my then boyfriend,
between me and my mother.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:35.920
PROFESSOR: It's not Gary.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:39.014
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:39.014 --> 00:56:42.226
Have you see the actual
Lewis Report?

00:56:42.226 --> 00:56:43.670
PROFESSOR: I have
never seen that.

00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:46.260
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It's nice,
nice binding job.

00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:50.740
And this is A Dollar to a
Doughnut, which are stories

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.010
about my grandfather's
teaching.

00:56:53.010 --> 00:56:55.680
And this is what the chemical
engineering department put

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.630
together for him when he retired
as a feitschrift,

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.960
because they felt the normal,
staid one was not appropriate

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.760
for such a character.

00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:06.450
PROFESSOR: What year
did he retire?

00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:07.940
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Well, this
is the official retirement.

00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.510
So this is like 1950 or so.

00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:12.600
But as I say, he's like Leo.

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:14.200
He just kept teaching.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.200
This is a CD.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:18.580
Just so you know, in the
archives they have-- this is

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:22.520
from tape, the original
tape, now on CD.

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.910
At the 50th anniversary of the
Department of Chemical

00:57:24.910 --> 00:57:29.330
Engineering, so in 1970,
he gave a talk about

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:32.930
reminiscences and the
fascinating history of

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:35.280
chemical engineering in the 19th
century, where he has a

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:41.710
whole theory about the time
lag between discovery and

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.020
implementation, both in
electrical and chemical

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:45.800
engineering.

00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:48.570
For example, the role of
batteries in running the

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:52.720
telegraph system, which I had
never thought about it as an

00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.100
incentive to chemical
engineering.

00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:57.550
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Oh,
very interesting.

00:57:57.550 --> 00:58:00.980
AUDIENCE: You know the great
mentors of the chemical

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.920
industry that got [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:04.410
PROFESSOR: No.

00:58:04.410 --> 00:58:05.880
AUDIENCE: Paper making.

00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:07.520
A lot of early involvement.

00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:10.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.468
to some degree, much less than
they were a national center of

00:58:13.468 --> 00:58:14.620
paper making.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.212
A lot of the early MIT chemical
engineers were with

00:58:17.212 --> 00:58:18.940
the paper industry.

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.350
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: I
didn't know that.

00:58:21.350 --> 00:58:23.030
And this last thing, and I
bring this along just in

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:24.060
serendipity.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:27.436
This is an obituary in 1975.

00:58:27.436 --> 00:58:29.730
He died on March 9.

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:31.495
This is the Tech Talk,
when we used to have

00:58:31.495 --> 00:58:34.020
a printed MIT newspaper.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.850
But what struck me
as I was picking

00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:36.540
it up, OK, an obituary.

00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:42.980
And then I look on the back of
the first page, "Response

00:58:42.980 --> 00:58:48.060
Awaited on Proposal to Train
Iranian Nuclear Engineers."

00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:53.660
And it just struck me, this
is why I love hard copy.

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.270
Because you' come across
things you don't

00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:56.190
plan to come across.

00:58:56.190 --> 00:59:00.540
And this is a reminder
of this is happening.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:04.820
And of course this had my
attention, but on the back we

00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:06.990
were being friendly with Iran.

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:09.110
The Shah was still around.

00:59:09.110 --> 00:59:09.930
OK.

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:12.330
So that's my show and tell.

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:13.580
Do you have any questions?

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:18.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:20.250
Thank you for bringing
all this stuff.

00:59:20.250 --> 00:59:22.550
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Well,
I just love stuff.

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:27.960
PROFESSOR: It reminds me that
I think historians have a

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.100
special feeling for
stuff like this.

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.780
But I remember when I was
working on my dissertation at

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:37.530
the National Archives, I was
writing about a topic that

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:40.060
dated back to the end
of the War of 1812.

00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:42.360
So it was a long time ago.

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:47.610
And I was getting materials out
of the archives that were

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:50.420
still bound in the original
red tape.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:52.120
And you'd pull those strings
apart and they would

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.370
disintegrate.

00:59:55.350 --> 00:59:58.380
I don't know, it's a weird
feeling thinking that I'm the

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:03.800
first one to look at the stuff
in over 200 years.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:07.310
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: It's kind
of creepy, but it's also

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:08.290
exhilarating.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:09.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it is.

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:11.800
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Exploration,
right.

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:15.690
PROFESSOR: And then we had a
colleague that Ros and I knew,

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.750
and I think you may have
known him too, David.

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:18.910
His name was Brooke Hindle.

01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:22.600
He was the former director of
the Museum of American History

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.690
at the Smithsonian.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:28.120
But he wrote an article one time
called "What is a Piece

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:31.840
of the True Cross Worth." Do
you remember that article,

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:35.070
about the importance of
artifacts in the study of

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.830
technology particularly?

01:00:37.830 --> 01:00:40.330
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: The story
is that they had four

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.570
children, two daughters,
two sons.

01:00:42.570 --> 01:00:49.280
The other daughter, besides my
mother, Mary, married a guy

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.140
named Cherry Emerson, who
went into plastics

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:54.390
after World War II.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:57.150
Plastics, and to quote Chambers,
made quite a bit of

01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:00.220
money in chemical engineering.

01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:02.630
And he studied with Doc
during the war.

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:07.940
So he gave the money to renovate
the library, naming

01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:12.780
it in honor of my grandmother,
Warren K Lewis' wife.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.780
And he always claimed
it was because she

01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.180
loved music so much.

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:20.345
And I must say I never
heard her listen

01:01:20.345 --> 01:01:22.320
or talk about music.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.830
So I think it was more
Cherry's love

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:26.110
of music, than her's.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:27.010
But that doesn't matter.

01:01:27.010 --> 01:01:30.770
I think it's a great library.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:35.610
And I think my grandmother would
particularly be happy

01:01:35.610 --> 01:01:37.780
that students can sleep
on the couches there.

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:40.420
She's a very gentle soul.

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:50.031
AUDIENCE: Does anybody here have
parents who went to MIT

01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:52.756
or other relatives?

01:01:52.756 --> 01:01:57.272
So one think you do see is,
any institution that lasts

01:01:57.272 --> 01:02:00.180
this long has this kind
of family connection.

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.429
Universities are sort of famous
for keeping track of

01:02:03.429 --> 01:02:04.679
that sort of thig.

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.170
And that's true among
faculty, as well.

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:17.560
And there's the genealogies
of our blood families.

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:20.110
And then we'll talk a bit about
this, but not to much

01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:20.950
explicitly yet.

01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:23.795
We'll talk about it in the
second half, the academic

01:02:23.795 --> 01:02:27.420
genealogies of so and so's
teacher was so and so's

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:28.534
student, was so and
so's student,

01:02:28.534 --> 01:02:29.564
was so and so's student.

01:02:29.564 --> 01:02:34.530
And then our colleague, Leo
Marx, who was my teacher, Who

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.910
said that, how does it go?

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:39.801
His adviser from Harvard in the
'40s-- it's only two steps

01:02:39.801 --> 01:02:42.687
back to Ralph Waldo Emerson.

01:02:42.687 --> 01:02:45.332
You can trace four academic
generations today from Leo

01:02:45.332 --> 01:02:47.016
Marx to Ralph Waldo Emerson.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:55.060
I'm sure there are people
here, some of the senior

01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.960
faculty who were students
of your grandfather's.

01:02:57.960 --> 01:02:59.320
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: If
I go to Chemical

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:00.810
Engineering, they just--

01:03:00.810 --> 01:03:02.060
oh, Warren K--

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:07.910
AUDIENCE: And that's a person
who started here in 1896.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:11.347
And more than 100 years later,
there are still that person's

01:03:11.347 --> 01:03:12.820
students around.

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:14.680
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: That's been
a great been pleasure of

01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:15.410
university life.

01:03:15.410 --> 01:03:16.245
It's a sense of continuity.

01:03:16.245 --> 01:03:17.950
I mean it would drive
me crazy too.

01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:27.870
PROFESSOR: Ros, your grandfather
was born in

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.920
Delaware and pretty
much raised there.

01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:35.500
He obviously was a
religious person.

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:36.750
What persuasion?

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:41.750
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: I think in
Delaware, he was Methodist.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:42.080
PROFESSOR: Methodist.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:42.910
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:45.560
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: And one of
the most fascinating books I

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:49.130
have is of an uncle of his who
was a Methodist circuit rider

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:54.800
in Delaware, in the 1850s,
setting up black churches.

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:55.490
They were separate,--

01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.690
PROFESSOR: Really.

01:03:55.690 --> 01:03:56.400
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: --but
setting them up.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.670
Oh, it's fascinating.

01:03:58.670 --> 01:04:02.810
And my grandfather then joined
the Congregational church up

01:04:02.810 --> 01:04:07.620
here, Elliott church
in Newton.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.650
Because Methodism up here is a
little different from what it

01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:12.100
was in the South.

01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:13.820
But you get the point.

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:14.650
It's a low church.

01:04:14.650 --> 01:04:15.900
It's not Episcopalian.

01:04:18.181 --> 01:04:22.560
And he taught Sunday school
every Sunday,

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.380
as long as he could.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:28.910
And his religious faith
meant a lot to him.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.820
He was not a fundamentalist,
at all.

01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:36.910
He said, I take the Bible
seriously, but not literally.

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:41.450
But I mean he knew his
Bible up one side

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.270
and down the other.

01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:45.890
And it was really fundamental
to him.

01:04:45.890 --> 01:04:52.075
In his old age, he became good
friends with John Crocker, who

01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:57.080
was the Episcopal chaplain
here at MIT.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.410
And they had a lot of talks.

01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:00.780
And I mean again, I think maybe
whether it was guilt

01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:08.640
about the Manhattan Project or
just trying to kind of talk

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:11.280
about matters of faith and
other matters too.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:18.490
So Crocker led his funeral
service, which I was glad that

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:19.330
he was able to do.

01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:22.110
So I think religion is one of
the great untapped kind of

01:05:22.110 --> 01:05:27.750
untapped, unappreciated sources
of motivation at MIT.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.470
And I don't think my
grandfather's unusual.

01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:33.480
And it's not necessarily any
particular religion.

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.950
But people from outside MIT are
always amazed to find how

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:42.150
strong the religious groups are
here and how many there

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:44.250
are and how active they are.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:48.410
It's not their vision of MIT,
but it's very true.

01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.820
OK.

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.410
ROSALIND WILLIAMS: Well,
thank you very much.

01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:57.630
PROFESSOR: Thank
you very much.

01:05:57.630 --> 01:06:03.060
PROFESSOR: OK, I want to just
talk today a little bit more

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.520
about the '30s, the
'20s and the '30s.

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:12.830
And again, kind of like Ros's
talk, use a specific case of a

01:06:12.830 --> 01:06:16.190
particular faculty member and
a particular machine to

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:20.890
illustrate some of the general
ideas about where MIT moved

01:06:20.890 --> 01:06:26.790
between about 1925 and 1935 and
why that's interesting.

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:31.850
And you of course know from the
readings, and the more you

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:34.340
look at this, everybody says it
and the more I read about

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.460
it, the more you really feel
like Karl Compton coming here

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:40.420
in 1930 was a major
turning point.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:44.310
There was this kind of
internal warfare.

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:49.140
What was the word that Lewis
used, hot fights about the

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.120
relation of science
and engineering.

01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:54.930
And the Corporation definitely
has an opinion about it.

01:06:54.930 --> 01:06:56.290
And one thing they do--

01:06:56.290 --> 01:06:58.150
they don't have a lot of control
over the faculty, but

01:06:58.150 --> 01:07:00.130
they do decide who
the president is.

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:02.510
And so they bring
in Karl Compton.

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.110
He's 42 years old--

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.100
and it probably sounds
old to you.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:10.030
It sounds young to me--

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.230
in 1930.

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:15.530
And one of the young people who
was already here was this

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:17.420
guy then Vannevar Bush, who
we've also heard about, and

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.110
we'll hear about a bunch more,
who was a young electrical

01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:22.740
engineering professor.

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:25.370
And he was building this
device called a

01:07:25.370 --> 01:07:26.920
differential analyzer.

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.080
And what I want to do today--
this is again, a sort of

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.150
prototype for what a paper topic
might be, is to look at

01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:39.160
this instrument and how this
instrument was handled and how

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:42.230
the instrument itself changed
as the goals of the

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:45.870
Institution changed, from the
'20s through the '30s.

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:48.690
So here's Bush and there's
the analyzer.

01:07:48.690 --> 01:07:54.960
And when we go to the MIT
Museum, one of the 150 objects

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.960
is that part of the
analyzer that's in

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:57.800
the wooden box there.

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.180
I'll tell you more about
what that is.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:01.405
But it's sitting right there
on the front of the floor.

01:08:01.405 --> 01:08:05.380
And when I was first doing this
research, I asked them if

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:07.260
they had a piece of it and
they didn't really know.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.620
And Debbie Douglas and I went
back in the storerooms and we

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:12.535
found that the original
integrator was there.

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:19.050
So if you go into the
1920s, Bush is here.

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:20.300
He's a young professor.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:22.670
He had gotten his Ph.D. here.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:24.569
And he was a student of
Kennelly, who I mentioned

01:08:24.569 --> 01:08:26.990
before, who was Edison's
assistant.

01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:31.720
And they were very much in the
kind of technology plan world

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:36.210
of MIT, solving problems for
big industrial partners.

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:39.100
And what is the problem that
the big industrial partners

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:39.670
are having?

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:43.040
Well, in the electrical world,
and you've got to remember

01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:45.060
electrical engineering for a--

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.500
how people here are Core 6,
in one way or another?

01:08:48.500 --> 01:08:49.859
OK, so about a third.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.590
Electrical engineering, for its
first 100 years, really

01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:56.250
was electrical, without a lot of
electronics or any of that

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:57.899
solid state physics
or certainly no

01:08:57.899 --> 01:08:58.779
computers and stuff.

01:08:58.779 --> 01:09:05.410
It was building big machines
to make big generators, and

01:09:05.410 --> 01:09:13.399
big generators, transmission
lines, large electric motors,

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.520
to drive factories and other
kinds of things.

01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:21.450
And anybody ever hear of the
IEEE, Institute of Electrical

01:09:21.450 --> 01:09:25.090
and Electronic Engineers?

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:26.600
This is a little
bit of trivia.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.359
But there was the AIEE,
American Institute of

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:30.240
Electrical Engineers.

01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:32.470
Those are the big electric
power people.

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:35.790
In fact, in German universities
they still divide

01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.779
the curriculum into big signals
and a little signals.

01:09:38.779 --> 01:09:41.819
And so big signals
was the AIEE.

01:09:41.819 --> 01:09:44.479
Little signals was the IRE,
Institute of Radio

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:47.710
Engineering, lots of little
tiny, little small signals.

01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:50.330
And in 1964, they merged
in the IEEE.

01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.470
It's to electrical and
electronic engineers.

01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:55.520
Even though it's probably one of
the two major professional

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.240
societies for computation, but
the word "computer" doesn't

01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:01.110
appear in the title at all.

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:03.970
And so, this is back in the
days of electric power.

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:09.710
And the problem with the
electric power industry is the

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:15.030
electric generators start out as
basically local phenomena.

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:17.840
A local entrepreneur will build
a generator, either a

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.000
hydro plant or steam powered,
in one way or

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.040
another, in a town.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:26.940
And they'll create lighting in
the town and maybe run some

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:28.650
motors in factories.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:31.990
And it's all centralized and
it was all nonuniform.

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:34.080
Every town had a different

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.010
voltage, a different frequency.

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:38.510
Some of them were running
on direct current versus

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:39.390
alternating current.

01:10:39.390 --> 01:10:43.520
These are all big battles they
were having at the time.

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:47.070
But over the course of the
teens and the '20s, those

01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:48.750
systems are becoming
standardized and they're

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.420
becoming connected into what
today we would call grids.

01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:53.590
So they have a big electric
power grid.

01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:57.410
And they're not quite
national yet, but

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:59.020
they're very much regional.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:03.040
And so in the '20s, General
Electric starts to build a big

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:10.170
grid that brings hydroelectric
power from in Canada and also

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:13.330
from Niagara Falls, through
very, very long transmission

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:16.130
lines, hundreds and hundreds
of miles, down into the New

01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:19.250
York City area, which is where
most of the population and

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.780
most of the energy
usage is from.

01:11:21.780 --> 01:11:24.660
And those lines begin
to have problems.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.420
And the problems are, if you've
got either a lightning

01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:31.740
strike at one part of the line,
you had a bad electrical

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:36.090
storm, or even if you had a
short circuit and part of the

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:41.180
grid tripped off and had just to
sort of save itself, you'd

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:43.300
get these transients
on the line.

01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:45.530
And the transients would
travel great distances.

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:49.570
They were just like big wave
power spikes on the line and

01:11:49.570 --> 01:11:51.250
create blackouts all
over the place.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:53.790
And there a couple of famous
blackouts that happened in the

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:55.850
early '20s that really
caused a big problem.

01:11:55.850 --> 01:12:02.040
So this was like a critical
issue about how do you figure

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:05.410
out, how do you model the
performance of these systems

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:06.990
under this kind of stress?

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:10.170
And General Electric, and this
has come up in the readings in

01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:12.820
places, had a very close
relationship with MIT.

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.840
There were a lot of young
engineers who would go there,

01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:17.985
what they called on-test,
to Schenectady.

01:12:17.985 --> 01:12:20.960
In fact, that's where
Ros's father worked.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.930
I don't if she mention that,
Doc Lewis's son went to

01:12:24.930 --> 01:12:27.750
Schenectady and worked
for General Electric.

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:30.660
And then they would come back
to MIT sometimes, to get a

01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.010
master's degree.

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:34.920
And they began looking at this
problem of how do you

01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.420
understand these systems.

01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.120
Now, Bush had done earlier work
in his career, which was

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.010
also based on this whole
idea of modeling.

01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:44.260
I may have mentioned
this before where--

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:47.010
how many of you have taken an
engineering class where you

01:12:47.010 --> 01:12:53.200
use a spring mass damper
system and model a RLC

01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:55.200
circuit with it?

01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:56.790
Ring a bell for anybody?

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.660
OK, maybe a few too
many times.

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.530
Or, there are other analogies,
different kinds

01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:03.510
of hydraulic analogies.

01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:06.170
Well, that whole idea basically
comes from the first

01:13:06.170 --> 01:13:08.470
book that Vannevar Bush wrote,
which is called Operational

01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:14.680
Circuit Analysis, where first
of all he applies a thing

01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:18.860
called Oliver Heaviside's
operational calculus.

01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:21.170
Anybody ever heard of the
Heaviside step function?

01:13:24.438 --> 01:13:29.360
And Heaviside was a sort of
somewhat outlandish English

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.580
engineer around the turn of the
century, who came up with

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.710
these ideas.

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:34.890
Mathematicians didn't like them
because they couldn't

01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:36.510
prove they were valid.

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.685
Heaviside just didn't care about
it at all because he

01:13:38.685 --> 01:13:40.390
could show that they
were useful.

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:43.760
And they told you a lot about
how transients go down lines.

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:46.390
And Bush really took the
Heaviside work and he put it

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:48.740
on a rigorous mathematical
foundation.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.840
And said among other things,
you can use these analogies

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:57.570
and you can model a second order
system in any of these

01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:00.120
different fields with
a set of equations.

01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:03.460
And that can be either RLC
circuit or a spring mass

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:07.080
damper or there are also
hydraulic versions of it, I'm

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.320
sure any number of other ones.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:13.300
And what that basic idea allows
you to do is to make

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.270
models of different
kinds of circuits.

01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:17.990
And so what they said
is here's this

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:19.060
electric power problem.

01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:23.120
Let's look at this problem and
let's build a model of it.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:27.300
And what this thing is, is
called a network analyzer.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.630
And this picture is probably
about 1927.

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:34.240
And all it is, is-- well, first
thing they make a model

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:38.630
of just the electric
power line between

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:41.100
Niagara Falls and Boston.

01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:47.770
So there might be a couple of
generators on the line in

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:50.670
Niagara Falls, then there's a
long transmission line, then

01:14:50.670 --> 01:14:57.080
there's a whole bunch of
different users, and maybe you

01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.280
make one circuit that's
50,000 times

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.780
smaller than the original.

01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.500
And you use that as a model.

01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:08.250
And anybody know what
the big problem

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.500
with that was actually?

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:16.720
The hardest thing about making
these small models was

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.880
measuring the output.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.250
If you go to the actual electric
power system and you

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:26.240
put a voltmeter on the line,
that voltmeter is going to

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.300
load the line by some amount.

01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.690
But it's negligible, it
really has no impact.

01:15:29.690 --> 01:15:32.130
If you make it 50,000 times
smaller, you've still got the

01:15:32.130 --> 01:15:33.280
same voltmeter.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.380
And you put it on the line and
it's the equivalent of like

01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.900
putting a whole factory
on the line.

01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:39.060
And it affects the performance
of it in ways

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:42.210
that it wouldn't otherwise.

01:15:42.210 --> 01:15:44.750
So it's one thing to
make this model.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.940
And they did that rather
successfully and it helped

01:15:46.940 --> 01:15:47.690
them describe.

01:15:47.690 --> 01:15:50.460
And they then reported the
results to GE, this is how the

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:52.420
thing would behave under
a lightning strike.

01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.080
And these are some strategies
you can take to make it a

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.630
little more robust.

01:15:56.630 --> 01:15:58.980
Well, once the word out about
that, all these different

01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:00.760
power companies came and
said, we would like you

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.340
to model our system.

01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.780
And so what did they do?

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:05.500
Did they constantly build
a new one for

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:06.670
everybody's power system?

01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:07.380
No.

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:08.690
They built a little set up.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:10.680
Actually, I don't even have to
draw it, because it's here.

01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:12.610
Where they said OK, we're going
to put a bunch of models

01:16:12.610 --> 01:16:15.580
of transmission lines and a
bunch of models of generators

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.190
and a bunch of models
of other things.

01:16:17.190 --> 01:16:18.930
And they're actually connected
together by

01:16:18.930 --> 01:16:20.770
telephone plug boards.

01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:25.130
And you bring your system here
and we'll plug it together in

01:16:25.130 --> 01:16:27.710
a certain way, much
like a telephone

01:16:27.710 --> 01:16:29.100
operator connects circuits.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:30.790
At that time, it was
done manually.

01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:32.870
And we'll create this thing.

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:37.130
And this thing, they actually
called it a network computer,

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:40.400
which is a nice word for it,
that comes up later in MIT

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.080
culture, about 50 years later.

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.420
And electric power companies
would come here.

01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:48.270
And students would write their
theses by designing this

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:53.560
system and describing it for
a particular power company.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.140
And saying here, I modeled
your circuit.

01:16:55.140 --> 01:16:57.520
And this thing actually
was around until the

01:16:57.520 --> 01:16:59.490
'50s, it turns out.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:02.000
We'll talk about it getting shut
down when Gordon Brown

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.120
shut it down.

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:07.640
But it was again this kind of
classic MIT in the 1920s,

01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.020
early '30s, model of close
relationships with industry,

01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:15.490
solving very particular
problems, almost in a literal

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:16.750
consulting role.

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:17.910
Tell us what your issue is?

01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:20.560
We'll model it and we'll help
you solve the problem.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:23.110
So we read a lot about that.

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:29.750
Then there was another approach,
which was to

01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:35.290
calculate the progress of these
transients directly.

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:37.250
And how did they do that?

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:43.240
Well, they could do it
analytically with algebra.

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.430
It was extremely difficult
because it was not easy to

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:46.250
write the equations.

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:48.430
But it was much easier
to build an analog

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.000
computer to model it.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:58.580
And it turned out, and you
probably recognize this, that

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:03.960
the integral of the product
of two functions

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.380
is a critical piece.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.850
Today, you find it in all kinds
of signals processing

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:10.500
and convolution algorithms.

01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:14.830
And they said we'll build
basically these machines that

01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:17.330
will model the key
function of it.

01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.930
And this is an early version
of it, which is also a

01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:22.590
specific machine modeled
to evaluate

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:23.660
the specific integral.

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:25.970
They called it a product
intergraph.

01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:27.530
And it didn't use equations
at all.

01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:30.030
It just took curves in
and drew curves out.

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:32.980
There you can see Bush.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.560
This is actually the output
device, which

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:37.250
is a watt/hour meter.

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:38.760
Why would they use
a watt/hour meter

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.170
from an electric utility?

01:18:45.290 --> 01:18:47.380
Because a watt/hour meter does
the same thing, right.

01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:50.150
It evaluates the integral of
the product of the current.

01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:51.910
And the voltage is the
amount of power that

01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:53.890
you get billed for.

01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:57.930
So they take this thing and
they just stick there.

01:18:57.930 --> 01:19:00.400
And then there's these kind of
funky mechanical linkages.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.210
And there's all these
people involved.

01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:03.980
And actually they have
big high-power

01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:06.110
resistors, so they use a--

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:07.520
anybody want to guess what
that thing hanging

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.450
up on the top is?

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:11.620
AUDIENCE: Radiator.

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:13.020
PROFESSOR: Close.

01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:13.460
AUDIENCE: Radiator.

01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:16.120
PROFESSOR: It's a
radiator, from?

01:19:16.120 --> 01:19:17.020
AUDIENCE: Model T.

01:19:17.020 --> 01:19:19.840
PROFESSOR: It's a radiator
from a Model T Ford, that

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:23.130
they're using to provide cooling
water to this machine,

01:19:23.130 --> 01:19:25.540
which evaluates this particular
integral for this

01:19:25.540 --> 01:19:27.510
particular electric
power problem.

01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:30.930
In fact, some of these
are Bush's students.

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:33.310
This one particularly is a guy
named Harold Hazen, who we

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:34.900
will talk about later.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.380
In fact, he's also the guy
sitting in the middle there,

01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:40.630
in that picture.

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:44.620
Here's another picture of it.

01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:48.320
You can see the watt/hour meter,
just taken right out of

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:53.080
an electric power measurement
facility.

01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.700
Again, you sort of work
with what you have.

01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:56.140
They were working with
electric companies.

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.180
They had these electrical
things, a whole bunch of

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.110
different motor and gears
and interconnections.

01:20:00.110 --> 01:20:03.770
And this was probably
in Building--

01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:05.050
somewhere in the main group.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:06.010
I'm forgetting exactly.

01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:10.210
Building 10, I believe
was this lab.

01:20:10.210 --> 01:20:12.460
I liked, you still have the
pencil sharpener there.

01:20:12.460 --> 01:20:14.585
This is probably the one part
of what was in the lab that

01:20:14.585 --> 01:20:16.590
you might still find in
a laboratory today.

01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:22.360
There's a picture
of Bush with it.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.670
You can see he looks
pretty young.

01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:31.710
And so there's the
first product

01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:33.490
intergraph, is this device.

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:37.530
And what it does is all those
little graph chart holders

01:20:37.530 --> 01:20:41.170
basically, move under these
three independent needles.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:47.680
And the operators just follow
the first two curves and then

01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.410
the output plots the integral
of those two curves.

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:53.700
So it's literally a graphical
user interface

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.320
for an analog computer.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.940
And then, they actually bring
it up to one more level of

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:00.690
complication.

01:21:00.690 --> 01:21:03.560
And there's a way that you can
make it solve a differential

01:21:03.560 --> 01:21:06.320
equation, as well as just
evaluating an integral.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.070
And so this thing is called the
second product intergraph,

01:21:09.070 --> 01:21:10.060
where it's the same
kind of thing.

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:14.340
There's two different pieces and
then you can sort of tie

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:16.420
the output back to the input.

01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:20.510
And this is about where things
stood when Karl Compton

01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.395
becomes president of MIT.

01:21:22.395 --> 01:21:25.390
And Compton basically says,
we're not going to do that

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:26.380
kind of stuff anymore.

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:28.410
It's too focused on
just one problem.

01:21:28.410 --> 01:21:30.060
It's too simple.

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:36.760
And Bush responds in a
very energetic way.

01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.840
And he builds this machine
about 1931.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.530
And this is called the
differential analyzer.

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:45.380
Anybody ever heard of
that term before?

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:51.280
And really it's kind of nothing
more than this, but

01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:53.640
made in a fully general
purpose way.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.250
Or like I mentioned before, they
did with the simulator,

01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:00.630
they first started building a
custom one and then they built

01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:01.790
a general one.

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:06.430
And what you see here is, these
guys here are called

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:07.140
integrators.

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:10.540
That's the core of
the problem.

01:22:10.540 --> 01:22:12.520
Again, it's primarily an
integral thing you're trying

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:13.900
to evaluate.

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.450
An integrator is nothing more
than, they call it a wheel and

01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:18.030
disk integrator.

01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:19.590
There's a disk that
spins around.

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:22.530
In a mechanical sense, that's
just a transmission, but a

01:22:22.530 --> 01:22:24.200
continuously variable one.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.520
Then there's a wheel that sits
on the transmission.

01:22:26.520 --> 01:22:32.830
And if the disk is spinning at
a fixed rate and the wheel

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:35.210
goes in and out, the number of
turns on the upper end of

01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:39.680
wheel is the integral of the
curve of the position of the

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.890
wheel that pulls it off.

01:22:40.890 --> 01:22:44.170
But it's a very simple idea
mechanically, very hard to do

01:22:44.170 --> 01:22:46.440
that in a way that
is mechanically

01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.230
robust and very accurate.

01:22:48.230 --> 01:22:51.550
And that's the piece--

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:53.910
actually it was so critical to
make it accurate, they covered

01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:55.350
these with those wooden boxes.

01:22:55.350 --> 01:23:01.360
That's the piece that's
in the MIT Museum.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.890
And then there's all these
other elements.

01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:05.140
I may have a picture of it.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:13.620
So there are all these
other elements.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.790
You can take these integrators
and then you have a

01:23:15.790 --> 01:23:19.790
multiplier, which is nothing but
a gear that connects one

01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:21.590
rod to another in a ratio.

01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:23.500
And you have these rods that
go through the middle.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:25.760
They're almost like the
bus on a computer.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:28.950
And you can connect these things
in all different ways

01:23:28.950 --> 01:23:31.880
to evaluate a particular
equation.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:34.810
In this case, this is just a
second order equation for a

01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:36.980
falling body problem.

01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:40.390
But you can mix and match this
thing and essentially program

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.860
it by rebuilding it around
these connecting rods.

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:47.690
And so, I'll show you a couple
of pictures of the--

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:48.940
oops.

01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:55.450
Here is another view
of the integrator.

01:23:55.450 --> 01:23:59.370
Here you can see the
disk and the little

01:23:59.370 --> 01:24:00.250
wheel that takes off.

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:02.200
It actually has a real
knife edge on it, to

01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.310
try to make it accurate.

01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:07.340
One of the real problems with
those integrators is that they

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:09.150
can't drive much of a load.

01:24:09.150 --> 01:24:11.820
If they slip at all, they
lose a lot of accuracy.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:13.870
So here they have put these
things called torque

01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:17.050
amplifiers, which are these very
clunky, exotic, kind of

01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:20.000
cached in like devices that
amplify the torque.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.220
And then they connect them in.

01:24:22.220 --> 01:24:26.640
And where you might have in an
electrical analog computer,

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.530
there's a voltage that gets
pushed around, in a mechanical

01:24:30.530 --> 01:24:34.330
analogue computer it's just the
rotation of these shafts

01:24:34.330 --> 01:24:37.070
that carry the data from
one place to another.

01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:43.060
And they do that by going into
this matrix of mechanical rods

01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:44.410
that you see over there
on the left.

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.450
And each time they wanted, they
could kind of reprogram

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:48.600
the whole thing.

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.710
And here's another shot.

01:24:50.710 --> 01:24:53.150
So here's a gear ratio that
would perform the

01:24:53.150 --> 01:24:54.400
multiplication.

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.070
You can see that this stuff is
beautifully machined, very

01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:59.092
interesting and carefully
done.

01:24:59.092 --> 01:24:59.494
Yeah?

01:24:59.494 --> 01:25:00.620
AUDIENCE: And they were doing
this in the electrical

01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:00.940
department.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:02.200
PROFESSOR: This is in electrical
engineering

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.050
department, right.

01:25:03.050 --> 01:25:04.421
AUDIENCE: It seems very much
like a mechanical project.

01:25:04.421 --> 01:25:05.655
PROFESSOR: It does seem like
a mechanical project.

01:25:05.655 --> 01:25:07.330
That's a very good point.

01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:11.820
And Bush actually said, he was
very clear, he said, I want my

01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:15.680
engineers to be able to design
mathematical equations the way

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.110
they design circuits.

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:20.310
And he tried to make a
circuit design-type

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:22.210
language, visual language--

01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:23.220
I redrew this picture.

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.710
But I redrew it from one
of their papers.

01:25:24.710 --> 01:25:28.180
It's the same terminology--

01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:31.410
that you could actually design
these equations and make these

01:25:31.410 --> 01:25:32.570
big kind of systems.

01:25:32.570 --> 01:25:35.360
And already you're beginning
to see a move toward

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.530
generality.

01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:40.670
So he says, this is not a device
to evaluate integrals

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:43.450
for studying transience in the
electric power industry.

01:25:43.450 --> 01:25:45.650
This is a research device
for a general

01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:47.480
purpose calculating machine.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.570
And it's interesting, he goes
to the Rockefeller--

01:25:49.570 --> 01:25:52.860
well, I'll cover that
in a minute.

01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:55.370
So already you're beginning to
see this guy beginning to

01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:58.960
think in a more general, kind
of fundamental terms, as

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.180
opposed to in these
specific terms.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:03.870
And this is within just a couple
of years of Compton

01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:06.550
coming here to MIT.

01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:09.160
Here's the output
of the device.

01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:12.280
You can see it's basically
creating a family of curves.

01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.350
And they were very into
the fact that they

01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:16.570
didn't need any algebra.

01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:18.320
They didn't need
any equations.

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:20.250
They said the world is
basically analog.

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:21.190
They didn't use that term.

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:23.170
And said, the world
is continuous.

01:26:23.170 --> 01:26:25.850
Our integrator is
continuous and

01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:28.530
produces continuous outputs.

01:26:28.530 --> 01:26:32.330
And again, you can
see this kind of

01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:33.660
graphical user interface.

01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.850
There's a little magnifying
glass there.

01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:38.700
And he's kind of following these
curves, which was a kind

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.800
of manual input.

01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:43.410
Bush is kind of looking over
the shoulder there.

01:26:43.410 --> 01:26:44.920
And they would evaluate
all these

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.170
different kinds of curves.

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:53.260
Here's another view, where
they're all connected by an

01:26:53.260 --> 01:26:54.930
electrical audio system.

01:26:54.930 --> 01:26:57.080
And there's one guy in the
center, telling everybody OK,

01:26:57.080 --> 01:26:58.610
follow your curves now.

01:26:58.610 --> 01:27:01.100
And here, he's not doing it
by hand so much anymore.

01:27:01.100 --> 01:27:03.790
He's turning a little crank
to trace all the curves.

01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:07.370
And you can begin to see by the
curves, they can do some

01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:08.470
pretty complicated things.

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:11.620
And there's a whole kind of
science of analog computing

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:15.420
that comes up in the '30s around
these machines, where

01:27:15.420 --> 01:27:17.730
they measure the number of
integrators the way you would

01:27:17.730 --> 01:27:21.120
measure the number of megahertz
of processor that

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.900
you have in your computer.

01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:25.920
Because the integrator was the
expensive thing that kind of

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.060
described what order equation
you could possibly model with

01:27:29.060 --> 01:27:30.000
these things.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:34.330
And people start to use them
to model electron orbits in

01:27:34.330 --> 01:27:35.420
atomic physics.

01:27:35.420 --> 01:27:38.190
They used them particularly
for ballistics.

01:27:38.190 --> 01:27:39.690
The Army gets really
interested.

01:27:39.690 --> 01:27:42.630
And they have to calculate
ballistic equations for all

01:27:42.630 --> 01:27:44.470
different kinds of
guns and shells.

01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:47.120
And this makes it a lot
more convenient.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.830
And so you begin to see the move
away from, even with the

01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:56.080
same research group, the same
people literally, from this

01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:58.840
kind of specific industry
oriented work toward more

01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:01.230
general work in what
they think of as a

01:28:01.230 --> 01:28:04.140
general purpose computing.

01:28:04.140 --> 01:28:07.760
This is kind of the most famous
picture of the device.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:10.200
And you can see there
three integrators

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:11.450
inside their glass cases.

01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:15.200
Those integrated became so
precise that you had to have

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.720
them covered, free of dust, and

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.300
really very well protected.

01:28:20.300 --> 01:28:22.580
And it turns out there was a
integrator that was developed

01:28:22.580 --> 01:28:25.190
secretly by the Navy for
controlling the big guns on

01:28:25.190 --> 01:28:27.500
battleships, that was better
than this one, that they

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.550
weren't really aware yet.

01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:34.590
And has nobody ever see
a tubal integrator?

01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:36.915
It's a whole other kind of
mechanism that you can use to

01:28:36.915 --> 01:28:38.910
do mechanical integration.

01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:42.250
So then this project spurs a
whole bunch of different other

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.830
kinds of projects.

01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:50.820
One is called the cinema
intergraph, where the idea is

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.460
instead of integrating with
these kind of problematic

01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.690
mechanical integrators, you
integrate using this exotic

01:28:56.690 --> 01:28:57.710
new technology.

01:28:57.710 --> 01:29:00.330
Anybody want to guess what
that is over on the left?

01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:02.440
It's a photo cell.

01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:07.720
And they would actually plot
the mathematical curves as

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:10.780
images on this 35
millimeter film.

01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:13.600
And then shine a light through
it and plot the area under the

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:18.460
curves by integrating the charge
that came through the

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:20.030
photo cell.

01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:23.730
And this is the guy
who made it.

01:29:23.730 --> 01:29:26.730
As he said, it was mostly
a machine for producing

01:29:26.730 --> 01:29:27.155
dissertations.

01:29:27.155 --> 01:29:30.100
It had essentially no
practical output.

01:29:30.100 --> 01:29:33.310
But it was important in that,
this guy is named Gordon

01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:37.550
Brown, who is a student of
Harold Hazen, and becomes the

01:29:37.550 --> 01:29:40.330
dean of engineering right
at the end of the

01:29:40.330 --> 01:29:41.480
Second World War.

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.090
And is the guy who closes down
all that old-fashioned

01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:45.030
electrical machinery.

01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:46.640
We read about him
a little bit.

01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.870
I think it was in the
[? Laquier ?]

01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:49.420
article.

01:29:49.420 --> 01:29:53.090
And kind of is the dean of
engineering when they kind of

01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:55.580
formalized a lot of things after
the Second World War.

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:00.490
And there's another picture
of the cinema intergraph.

01:30:00.490 --> 01:30:03.450
Also one of his advisers on
there was Norbert Wiener, who

01:30:03.450 --> 01:30:05.630
was also very closely related
to Bush's work.

01:30:05.630 --> 01:30:08.930
And a lot of his earlier ideas
of cybernetics also came out

01:30:08.930 --> 01:30:11.220
of this work.

01:30:11.220 --> 01:30:13.460
This is Harold Hazen again.

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.840
It's called an automatic
curve follower.

01:30:15.840 --> 01:30:19.260
And his idea is, gee, maybe I
could make these photo cells

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:22.230
just follow these curves
automatically.

01:30:22.230 --> 01:30:26.030
And today, you can go to the
Science Museum and buy a

01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:28.180
little robot kit with a
robot that follows a

01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.370
line across the floor.

01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:31.720
This is the first
one of those.

01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.300
But what's much more interesting
and important than

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:38.440
that about this, was that in
order to do this and order to

01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:41.120
make the differential analyzer
work, it's the amount of

01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:43.090
friction that builds up
in the mechanisms.

01:30:43.090 --> 01:30:46.260
And it gets to a point where you
basically just can't turn

01:30:46.260 --> 01:30:47.040
the crank anymore.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.190
And you start to lose
a lot of accuracy.

01:30:49.190 --> 01:30:50.870
You don't lose it
in the gears.

01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:52.500
Eventually you would, because
they would break.

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.090
But you lose it in all these
other systems, particularly

01:30:55.090 --> 01:30:55.930
the integrator.

01:30:55.930 --> 01:30:59.770
So what they do is they put what
they call followers or

01:30:59.770 --> 01:31:03.510
servomechanisms between the
stages, where they can kind of

01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:08.300
renew the signal and add
energy to the system.

01:31:08.300 --> 01:31:11.250
Because with a mechanical
system, if you don't have any

01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:13.590
energy, it's just going
to eventually--

01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:14.870
the energy is all dissipated.

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:18.510
But if you can carry the data
from one point to another and

01:31:18.510 --> 01:31:21.050
just add energy and make it
constantly stronger, you can

01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:22.700
build them as big as you want.

01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:25.830
And it's between that problem
and this problem that Hazen

01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:28.760
actually writes the first paper
ever on what he calls

01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:31.900
the theory of servomechanisms,
which you now what know as

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:33.040
feedback control theory.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.310
And anybody take a course on
that, or probably in every

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:38.890
engineering course you're taking
something in feedback

01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:40.260
control theory.

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:42.690
And he became interested in
these basic problems.

01:31:42.690 --> 01:31:46.210
Until that point, people had
governors on steam engines.

01:31:46.210 --> 01:31:48.520
They had different kinds of
regulators in this electric

01:31:48.520 --> 01:31:50.120
power network they
were working on.

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.030
But nobody had thought of, let's
write about the theory

01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:56.110
of how this feedback mechanism
works overall.

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:58.070
And there again, there's another
one of these, a little

01:31:58.070 --> 01:32:00.640
more detailed example of an
intellectual way that

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.410
Compton's move was not just
administrative, he didn't just

01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:05.090
say let's stop working
with industry

01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:06.210
and think about science.

01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:08.600
He actually influenced these
people in their labs very

01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.430
quickly, within a couple years,
to start thinking about

01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:13.930
fundamental problems as opposed
to just these kind of

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:14.990
immediate problems.

01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:17.623
Hazen also becomes dean of
engineering at MIT during the

01:32:17.623 --> 01:32:20.401
Second World War and head of
the electrical engineering

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:21.790
department.

01:32:21.790 --> 01:32:25.630
Here's his model of
servomechanisms.

01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:29.210
Also in that group, looking at
again this electric power

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:33.230
problem, and saw something
literally in the electrical

01:32:33.230 --> 01:32:36.700
power problem that was
bigger than simply

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:37.600
the immediate problem.

01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:39.070
Anybody want to get
who this is?

01:32:42.060 --> 01:32:43.345
Let me describe what
he's doing and

01:32:43.345 --> 01:32:44.190
maybe then you'll guess?

01:32:44.190 --> 01:32:46.670
So you can actually see in this
picture, he says, I'm

01:32:46.670 --> 01:32:47.870
going to look at these
generators.

01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:49.470
And the problem is when
they have these

01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:50.680
transients of these--

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.980
they fall out of step, so that
in an A/C system, everything

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:56.720
has to be running in
perfect synchrony.

01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.840
And if it's not running
synchronized, you get all

01:32:58.840 --> 01:32:59.630
kinds of issues.

01:32:59.630 --> 01:33:06.430
And he says, I'm going to tape
cardboard N and S. So that I'm

01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:09.570
going to tape them to each of
the poles on the generator and

01:33:09.570 --> 01:33:11.950
then let the generator
spin really fast.

01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:14.220
And then I'm going to shine a
light on it and I'm going to

01:33:14.220 --> 01:33:17.840
pulse the light at exactly
the same frequency as the

01:33:17.840 --> 01:33:19.830
generator is supposed
to be spinning.

01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:22.060
And that will freeze the
N and S in your eye

01:33:22.060 --> 01:33:23.240
when you look at it.

01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:25.720
And then if there's a phasing
problem, you'll see the N and

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.810
the S moving back and forth.

01:33:27.810 --> 01:33:29.195
Now, anybody want to
guess who this is?

01:33:29.195 --> 01:33:29.510
AUDIENCE: Edgerton.

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:30.580
PROFESSOR: This is
Edgerton, right?

01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:34.320
And this is the first
application he have of this

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.230
stroboscope.

01:33:35.230 --> 01:33:37.340
And very soon, he says hey,
you know what, this

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:38.900
stroboscope thing is
really interesting.

01:33:38.900 --> 01:33:40.950
I can make some innovations
there.

01:33:40.950 --> 01:33:42.610
Forget about electric
power stuff.

01:33:42.610 --> 01:33:46.620
I'm interested in high-speed
photography and generally

01:33:46.620 --> 01:33:49.300
high-speed electrical
discharge.

01:33:49.300 --> 01:33:51.020
AUDIENCE: It's like the first
timing light for a car.

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:51.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:33:51.390 --> 01:33:53.790
It's exactly the same as the
timing light for a car.

01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:55.560
Most of which are made
by EG&G, which

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:56.980
was Edgerton's company.

01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:01.410
And so there again, he gets
interested in a bunch of

01:34:01.410 --> 01:34:02.140
different things.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:06.700
But all of them have in common
this idea of like how even

01:34:06.700 --> 01:34:07.730
most of the flashes--

01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:10.190
you don't see it so much in your
digital camera, with the

01:34:10.190 --> 01:34:11.060
little teeny ones.

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:16.510
But if you ever have a big
flash, it fires and then you

01:34:16.510 --> 01:34:18.020
hear it charging up.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:19.000
And then it fires all again.

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.340
And Edgerton really became an
expert at very rapid discharge

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:28.080
of electrical energy.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.180
I work a lot at the Undersea
World, where Edgerton did a

01:34:30.180 --> 01:34:31.480
lot of work with sonar.

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:34.570
But the particular kind of sonar
he built was very much

01:34:34.570 --> 01:34:37.350
like the flash bulb, in
that it was a sonar

01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:39.070
that flashed the sound.

01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:42.690
It's called side-scan sonar,
rather than continuous wave

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:45.300
sonar, would just gave
it all the time.

01:34:45.300 --> 01:34:49.950
So for the plutonium bomb in
particular, the one during

01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:52.710
World War II, and I think they
still are spherical, and you

01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:54.730
had to implode this device.

01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:57.470
And a guy at Harvard,
Kistiakowsky, made these

01:34:57.470 --> 01:34:59.190
explosive lenses.

01:34:59.190 --> 01:35:01.970
And you had to trigger them
all around this sphere at

01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:03.830
exactly the same moment.

01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:06.530
Otherwise, you were going to get
a lopsided shock wave and

01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:08.590
you weren't going to implode
the thing perfectly.

01:35:08.590 --> 01:35:11.230
And it was Edgerton's company
that designed the triggering

01:35:11.230 --> 01:35:13.280
mechanisms for that
atomic bomb.

01:35:13.280 --> 01:35:16.080
They also did high-speed
photography of the actual

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:16.830
mushroom clouds.

01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:19.230
And it's amazing, sort of
frightening imagery that

01:35:19.230 --> 01:35:22.970
they've collected all through
the Cold War about that.

01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:25.090
And that was EG&G. It was
founded by Edgerton,

01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:27.240
Germeshausen, and Grier,
two of his colleagues.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.530
And the-- let's see,
what is it--

01:35:32.530 --> 01:35:36.570
Building 37 is the building
they gave.

01:35:36.570 --> 01:35:39.040
And there's a Grier room and
the Germeshausen room.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:43.140
And I forget which the
auditorium is called.

01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.970
But that work started here.

01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:47.520
And then Edgerton
developed that.

01:35:47.520 --> 01:35:51.305
And interestingly, one of the
students, a guy named Marty

01:35:51.305 --> 01:35:53.850
Klein, who is the sort of the
father of that side-scan

01:35:53.850 --> 01:35:54.970
sonar, is a good
friend of mine.

01:35:54.970 --> 01:35:57.880
And he always says, Edgerton
was a time domain man.

01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:59.760
He never thought in the
frequency domain.

01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:01.300
For those of you who are
EEs, you'll know

01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:02.340
what that refers to.

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:06.790
And that really came out this
legacy from Bush's lab of

01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:08.970
thinking about transience
on these lines.

01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:11.900
There's nothing to say about
electric power systems in the

01:36:11.900 --> 01:36:14.350
frequency domain, because
it's all 60 Hertz.

01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:17.080
It's all exactly the same
frequency, unlike radio which

01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:19.720
is all about frequency domain.

01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:20.950
He thought in the time domain.

01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:23.270
And everything about
the electronics--

01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:25.330
anybody work in the Edgerton
lab these days or

01:36:25.330 --> 01:36:27.540
take a class there?

01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:30.520
All that stuff is time domain
stuff, kind of epitomized by

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.770
the high-speed photography.

01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:39.370
Here's an image again of the
Army getting interested at the

01:36:39.370 --> 01:36:43.730
Aberdeen Proving Ground, down
in Maryland, which did a lot

01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:45.910
of the measurement
for ballistics.

01:36:45.910 --> 01:36:49.230
They bought five or six of these
or they hired people and

01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:51.280
they made their own
copies of them.

01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:53.520
Within a few years, during the
'30s, they were all over the

01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:56.615
place, not just in
electric power.

01:36:56.615 --> 01:36:58.320
Yeah?

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:00.330
AUDIENCE: When do you begin
to see military

01:37:00.330 --> 01:37:04.400
funding of this work?

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.190
Does it start with Bush's
differential?

01:37:06.190 --> 01:37:06.780
No, OK.

01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:07.950
PROFESSOR: Really not
until the war.

01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:11.980
So I'll come to the funding
issue in a second, because

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:13.030
it's pretty interesting.

01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:19.280
They also, with Bush's
consulting, built the control

01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.230
system for the Palomar
telescope, which at the time

01:37:23.230 --> 01:37:25.220
was the biggest telescope
ever built.

01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:27.370
It didn't even become
operational until after the

01:37:27.370 --> 01:37:28.470
Second World War.

01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:30.260
Anybody ever been there?

01:37:30.260 --> 01:37:33.130
It's in California, outside
of San Diego.

01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:37.030
And you have this enormous,
three-story high telescope.

01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:39.510
And you've got to point it
with great accuracy.

01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:42.260
And it actually had a lot of
similarities to the problems

01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:43.510
they were working on there.

01:37:48.060 --> 01:37:51.250
So there's also a funding
story here.

01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:53.890
Warren Weaver is also
mentioned in the--

01:37:53.890 --> 01:37:56.000
I'm forgetting if it was the
Servos or the [? Laquier ?]

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.190
article from the Rockefeller
Foundation.

01:37:58.190 --> 01:37:59.010
And they talk about it.

01:37:59.010 --> 01:37:59.540
It was [? Laquier. ?]

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:04.810
He said, as soon as Compton
came in, he went to the

01:38:04.810 --> 01:38:08.720
Rockefeller Foundation and said,
I need $175,000 for this

01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:10.040
new initiative.

01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:12.150
And if you guys back
me on this--

01:38:12.150 --> 01:38:14.870
at the time, there was no
National Science Foundation.

01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:17.950
There was no public money other
than from the military,

01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:20.210
available for research.

01:38:20.210 --> 01:38:23.690
But the Rockefeller Foundation
was basically the equivalent

01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:26.080
of the NSF today, a
private foundation

01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:27.260
handing out these checks.

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:29.880
And Bush went to Weaver.

01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:32.210
And he went to Weaver with
this early version of the

01:38:32.210 --> 01:38:33.950
differential analyzer.

01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:36.110
And it was about 1931.

01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:39.280
And Weaver says,
not interested.

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:45.070
That engineering stuff is best
handled by industrial funding.

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:46.960
We don't support anything
that looks

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.220
like engineering research.

01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:52.750
We only support fundamental
research.

01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:55.180
Why don't you go find an
electric power company or

01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.330
somebody to give it to you?

01:38:57.330 --> 01:39:02.280
Two years later, Bush goes back
to Weaver and says oh,

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.460
this is not a machine for
electric power research.

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:05.300
This is a machine for

01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:08.510
fundamental research in computing.

01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:10.520
And Weaver says, oh, well if
you're going to put it that

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:13.830
way, here's $100,000.

01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:16.030
At the depths of the Depression,
that a lot of

01:39:16.030 --> 01:39:19.405
money for a research program,
far beyond what anybody-- in

01:39:19.405 --> 01:39:22.170
fact, I think there's a
statistic in there that before

01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:25.350
the war, the entire federal
funding for all of MIT was

01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:27.060
only $40,000 a year.

01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:31.880
And they gave Bush, not just
$100,000, but about $250,000

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:35.710
in the middle of the '30s, to
build the next version, which

01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:37.340
became known as the Rockefeller

01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:39.510
differential analyzer.

01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:42.900
And here you see, it looks a
little bit more sophisticated.

01:39:42.900 --> 01:39:45.550
Instead of those earlier tables,
they called them input

01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:47.440
tables, here you have
a rotating drum.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.130
There's still a person required
to sit there and turn

01:39:50.130 --> 01:39:51.740
the handle.

01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:56.600
But the basic model was
a lot more electrical.

01:39:56.600 --> 01:39:59.420
And also interestingly, the
operators of these machines

01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:00.980
changed from men to women.

01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:02.970
So they're no longer graduate
students operating them.

01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:05.680
They're much more what they
called human computers at the

01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:07.040
time, operating them.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:08.670
But you can see there,
a similar idea.

01:40:08.670 --> 01:40:10.220
There are curves on this drum.

01:40:10.220 --> 01:40:14.335
The person looks at the curves
and is providing the input to

01:40:14.335 --> 01:40:18.950
the machine by matching the
pointer to the curve.

01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:21.130
And the way this machine
worked, is also really

01:40:21.130 --> 01:40:22.175
interesting.

01:40:22.175 --> 01:40:26.570
A lot like the other one, but
instead of that matrix of

01:40:26.570 --> 01:40:33.330
circular rods in the middle,
it's a crossbar switch.

01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:35.780
Anybody know what industry a
crossbar switch comes from?

01:40:38.881 --> 01:40:41.080
It's a telephone switch.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.860
And its electrical switch that
basically says, I got all

01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:45.940
these inputs across the top and
all these inputs across

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:46.690
the bottom.

01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:50.430
I can connect anyone to anyone,
in fact in this case

01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:52.280
using a punched paper tape.

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.460
And so they get the
prototype crossbar

01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:55.790
switch from Bell Labs.

01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:58.090
It was a pretty big revolution
in telephone

01:40:58.090 --> 01:40:59.400
switching at the time.

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:03.300
They had built this crossbar
and donated it to MIT.

01:41:03.300 --> 01:41:05.200
And what they did was they
said, we're just going to

01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.550
adapt each of these mechanical
elements-- in fact, the

01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:10.160
integrators were still
mechanical--

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.230
but we're going to give them
electrical outputs.

01:41:12.230 --> 01:41:14.900
Instead of the quantities
being represented by the

01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:17.050
rotation angle of the
rod, it's now

01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:18.650
represented by a voltage.

01:41:18.650 --> 01:41:21.690
We'll feed all the voltages
into the crossbar switch.

01:41:21.690 --> 01:41:25.710
And then you configure the
crossbar switch by reading a

01:41:25.710 --> 01:41:27.220
paper tape into it.

01:41:27.220 --> 01:41:32.070
And so you can basically model
any equation by some set of

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:35.470
switch closings on the crossbar
switch and you

01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:37.280
program those by a paper tape.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:40.730
And now, you're beginning to see
the beginning of digital

01:41:40.730 --> 01:41:43.400
switching coming into -- there
wasn't even a word for

01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:44.780
"digital" at the time--

01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:47.640
coming into this idea of
analogue computing.

01:41:47.640 --> 01:41:50.600
And so then the problem for the
programmer becomes, they

01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:53.590
have this continuous analog
equation across the top.

01:41:53.590 --> 01:42:01.520
I need to translate it into
these paper tapes.

01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.200
And that's kind of an
interesting problem, how do I

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.760
think about the transformation
from a set of equations into a

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:10.940
set of switch closures?

01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:15.080
And this young master student
looks at it and he says well,

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.925
I can actually make
this kind of--

01:42:16.925 --> 01:42:19.300
he calls it a relay algebra.

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:26.310
And I'm going to design a little
kind of mechanical

01:42:26.310 --> 01:42:29.200
notation that will allow me
to design these circuits.

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:32.520
And you know that totally
useless stuff that I studied

01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:34.940
in mathematics they called
Boolean algebra, from the 19th

01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:38.960
century, is actually kind
of useful here.

01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:42.410
And I'm going to call a closed
switch, a 1 and an open

01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:44.270
switch, a 0.

01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:47.030
And that allows you to
manipulate the whole thing

01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:49.060
mathematically.

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:50.970
Anybody know who this is?

01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:52.250
You maybe the name flash by.

01:42:52.250 --> 01:42:53.410
AUDIENCE: You mean
Claude Shannon?

01:42:53.410 --> 01:42:56.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's actually
Claude Shannon, writes his

01:42:56.190 --> 01:43:00.320
master's thesis on exactly
this problem.

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:02.760
And many people call this the
most significant master's

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.300
thesis ever written in
electrical engineering.

01:43:04.300 --> 01:43:07.900
The master's thesis basically
lays down the entire

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:11.850
groundwork for the design of
digital systems in 1936 and

01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:14.690
based on the problems that are
raised by designing this

01:43:14.690 --> 01:43:17.060
computational machine.

01:43:17.060 --> 01:43:19.850
And he immediately gets hired by
Bell Labs and starts to go

01:43:19.850 --> 01:43:22.380
work there and think about how
to design switching circuits.

01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:25.640
And the kind of counterpart at
Bell Labs right at that moment

01:43:25.640 --> 01:43:28.230
reads this thesis and says, I'm
going to call this kind of

01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:30.160
electronics digital.

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:33.080
And actually invents the word
"digital" to describe that

01:43:33.080 --> 01:43:33.950
kind of electronics.

01:43:33.950 --> 01:43:36.440
So here's a case of--

01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:38.620
again, 1936, Karl Compton
has only been

01:43:38.620 --> 01:43:40.360
at MIT for six years.

01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:43.000
But he's already pushed this
particular laboratory and this

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.690
particular set of students to
start thinking about their

01:43:45.690 --> 01:43:47.190
work in a different way.

01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:54.410
Much less specific to one
industry specific to solving

01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:57.720
particular applications, and
more generally thinking about

01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.500
the fundamentals, the
mathematics, with applications

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:04.110
to lots and lots
of other areas.

01:44:04.110 --> 01:44:07.920
So that's just one case there,
I thought I would show you.

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.950
And then, all those people are
also then people who get very

01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:13.090
involved in the early
digital computing.

01:44:13.090 --> 01:44:15.430
Once the war starts, basically
they all go to

01:44:15.430 --> 01:44:16.730
Washington with Bush.

01:44:16.730 --> 01:44:19.940
Some of them stay here and
get very involved.

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:23.290
But we'll cover that in the next
time we actually meet.

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:27.518
Questions, comments
about that?

01:44:27.518 --> 01:44:30.906
AUDIENCE: Is that the same
servomechanism laboratory that

01:44:30.906 --> 01:44:33.480
goes and creates
the Whirlwind?

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:33.860
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:36.010
The earlier question, it's
exactly that laboratory.

01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:38.120
So Gordon Brown starts
the Servomechanism

01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:42.680
Laboratory in 1940.

01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:45.680
He the first course ever
on feedback control

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:53.590
theory at MIT in 1939.

01:44:53.590 --> 01:44:54.730
And he writes this one paper.

01:44:54.730 --> 01:44:57.320
In fact, it's called "Transient
Analysis of

01:44:57.320 --> 01:45:00.820
Servomechanisms." So it still
carries that transient idea

01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:02.980
from the early electric
power work.

01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:08.000
And Warren Weaver shows up in
his lab and says, guess what?

01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.060
I work for the government now.

01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:09.600
I don't work for the

01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:12.260
Rockefeller Foundation anymore.

01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.050
That paper that you just wrote,
that you're about to

01:45:14.050 --> 01:45:15.540
publish, it's classified.

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:17.260
You're not allowed to
publish it anymore.

01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:22.200
And here's $500,000
to start your lab.

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.810
And Brown sort of takes it in.

01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:28.010
And if it happens for an
historian, very valuable that

01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:29.480
they classified that paper.

01:45:29.480 --> 01:45:32.720
Because then, anyone who
got a copy of it,

01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.330
had to sign it out.

01:45:34.330 --> 01:45:36.800
So he writes this fundamental
paper.

01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:40.460
And then you can actually trace
week by week, out in the

01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:44.060
community, who's reading the
paper and see how they are

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:45.020
changing their work.

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.210
And they begin to have this
idea, again if you look at

01:45:48.210 --> 01:45:51.550
feedback control, there's
governors on steam engines.

01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:54.160
There's regulators
on arc lights.

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:57.110
There's automatic pilots
in airplanes.

01:45:57.110 --> 01:45:59.770
And is even feedback amplifiers
in electrical

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:00.500
engineering.

01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:02.810
But there's nobody who says,
hey, you know what, all that

01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:04.550
stuff is really the same.

01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:07.890
And now, we take for granted
as that's what you study in

01:46:07.890 --> 01:46:08.400
control theory.

01:46:08.400 --> 01:46:10.120
You don't study any one
of those areas.

01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.020
You study the basic
phenomenon.

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:15.415
And that was the beginning
of what Brown was doing.

01:46:15.415 --> 01:46:18.360
And it was really a coincidence
that right about

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:21.330
that moment, it goes underground
and it stays

01:46:21.330 --> 01:46:22.990
underground for the whole war.

01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:25.090
And that's really where when
Norbert Wiener comes out in

01:46:25.090 --> 01:46:28.040
1948, and says, cybernetics,
feedback control, it's all

01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:31.920
about this, he was just saying
something that had been secret

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:35.120
for eight years already
at that point.

01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.030
But one of the things that got
me interested in this research

01:46:38.030 --> 01:46:42.040
was, why was MIT's first digital
computer made by the

01:46:42.040 --> 01:46:43.340
Servomechanisms Lab?

01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:45.810
Because you don't necessarily
associate those two

01:46:45.810 --> 01:46:46.920
things in your mind.

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:50.670
A servo, you think of as an
analog, mechanical thing and a

01:46:50.670 --> 01:46:52.750
digital computer as this
funny electronic thing.

01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:56.430
But during the war, it sort of--
it actually happens after

01:46:56.430 --> 01:46:58.050
the war, but right
after the war.

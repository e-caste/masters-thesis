00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.000
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.375
I think things have been
getting pretty derivy lately,

00:00:26.375 --> 00:00:28.750
so I wanted to shift gears to
something a little bit more

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.070
practical.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.310
So I started alluding to this
hypothetical radiation source

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.697
I might have right
here, and things

00:00:35.697 --> 00:00:37.780
like if you have a source
of known activity, which

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.000
we calculated
yesterday, and you have

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.210
a detector of
unknown efficiency,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.940
how do you know what
the efficiency is?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.220
How do you know what, let's say,
your dose distance relationship

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.903
is?

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:50.570
And how do you calculate
all this stuff?

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.130
So let's take the general
situation that we're

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.090
starting to work out.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.210
Let's say we have a
Geiger counter right here.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.150
That's our GM tube.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.870
And we have a
point source that's

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.905
emitting things
in all directions.

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:12.530
Let's go with the
stuff from yesterday.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's say it's a
cobalt 60 source.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.210
It's now 0.52 microcurie.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.810
The question is, how many counts
do you expect in this detector

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.030
when it's a certain
distance away?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.460
So I've actually laser-cut out
a little Geiger counter jig

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.480
from a previous class.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.370
And you guys can
all do this too.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.890
Who here has been
to the IDC before?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.430
A couple.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.805
The international
design center--

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:41.430
so they've got a laser cutter
that you can sign up to use,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.020
which is where I did this.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.770
And it's set to just
take a Geiger counter

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.620
and put your sources
at some fixed distance

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.410
away so you can discover
the dose distance

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.060
relationship with things.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.250
Speaking of, does anybody
know what the relationship

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.545
is between dose and distance or
measured activity and distance?

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:02.830
Yeah, Luke.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] r cubed.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Close.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.190
It's, let's say, the
measured activity

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:15.000
would be proportional
to 1 over r squared.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.170
Who knows where this comes from?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.500
I'll move the source a bit
away to lessen the beeping.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.820
Yeah.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.860
AUDIENCE: Well, the flux
of particles coming out

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.508
is just [INAUDIBLE] over the
surface area of [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:34.890
and the [INAUDIBLE]
is 4 pi r squared.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.240
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, exactly.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.720
If you were to draw
a hypothetical sphere

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.170
around the source right
here, then you've got,

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.750
let's say, a detector
that's roughly rectangular

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.220
with a fixed area.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.850
Let's say it's got a half
length L and a half width

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.340
W. Then the area--

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.730
I'm sorry, let's just
say length L, width W--

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.900
would be just L times
W. And actually,

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.130
what Chris mentioned as
the solid angle subtended

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.230
by this detector right here--

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.340
in other words, at a
certain distance r away,

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.273
how much of this sphere--

00:03:13.273 --> 00:03:15.690
how much does the area of this
sphere-- does this detector

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.797
take up?

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:18.630
In other words, how
many of these gamma rays

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.360
are going to go in a different
direction than the detector,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.450
versus how many we'll
actually enter the detector?

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.640
And a simple formula
for the solid angle

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.400
is just the surface
area of whatever

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.490
you've got over r squared.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.610
It's a pretty good approximation
to the solid angle of something

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.278
for very long distances,
and it's probably the one

00:03:40.278 --> 00:03:41.570
that you'll see in the reading.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.290
But I wanted to show you the
actual formula, in this case,

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.970
for a rectangle--

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.750
solid angle comparison.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:49.970
Good, that's up there.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.400
So let's say on the
x-axis, right here,

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.940
this would be distance
from the source

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.405
to the detector in meters.

00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:03.780
And I've said that we've got
some sort of a detector that

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.540
is 2.5 by 10 meters in size.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.550
That's an enormous detector.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.620
Let's actually switch it
to the units right here.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.480
So this is roughly
10 centimeters long.

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.910
So let's change
our length to 0.1.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.150
And what do you think the
width of this Geiger counter

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.792
is in meters?

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.085
AUDIENCE: A centimeter

00:04:26.085 --> 00:04:28.410
MICHAEL SHORT: A centimeter.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.325
0.01.

00:04:31.325 --> 00:04:33.700
We're going to have to change
our axes so we can actually

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.330
see the graph.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.620
So instead of looking all the
way out to 15 meters away,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.870
let's look one meter
away, maybe less.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.736
This whole thing is
probably 50 centimeters.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.140
And we'll take a look there.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.260
And what we notice is
that except for extremely

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.980
short distances, this
approximate formula

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.420
for the solid angle--
or in other words,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.820
if I were to draw a sphere
around the source that's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.823
the radius of the distance
between the source

00:05:03.823 --> 00:05:05.240
and the detector,
how much of that

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.060
sphere's area does
the detector take up?

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:11.330
This approximate
formula-- the blue curve--

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.760
is a pretty good
approximation of the red curve

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.970
until you get really, really
close to 5 centimeters

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.180
away, or about this
distance right here.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.860
Does anyone know why this
formula would break down?

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.980
What happens as r goes to 0?

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.330
What happens to our solid
angle or our approximation

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.800
for our solid angle?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.106
AUDIENCE: Goes to Infinity

00:05:38.106 --> 00:05:41.000
MICHAEL SHORT: It goes
to infinity, right?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.820
Can a detector actually
take up infinity area

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.950
on, well, anything?

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:47.900
Never mind that unit sphere.

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.140
Not quite.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:52.250
If you were to take this
detector and bring the radius

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.730
down to 0 so that the
source and the detector,

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.130
if not counting for the
thickness of the plastic,

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.295
were right upside each other, if
that solid angle went to, well,

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:04.295
infinity , then the count
should go to infinity,

00:06:04.295 --> 00:06:07.590
and it does not compute.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.770
Does anyone know how many--

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:13.760
first of all, who here has
heard of solid angle before?

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.878
So a little more
than half of you.

00:06:16.878 --> 00:06:17.795
That's getting clicky.

00:06:17.795 --> 00:06:19.880
I'm going to turn that off.

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.320
Solid angle is kind of the
analog to regular old angle,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.090
except in 3D.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.880
So instead of looking
at things in radians,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.630
this has the unit of
what's called steradians--

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:44.220
steradians-- with a full sphere
taking up 4pi steradians.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.290
Interestingly
enough, 4pi is also

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.757
the surface area of a unit
sphere with radius of 1.

00:06:49.757 --> 00:06:51.090
So that's where this comes from.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:54.660
If something were to completely
cover a unit sphere--

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.042
like, if you were to, let's say,
encase a light source in tin

00:06:58.042 --> 00:07:01.470
foil completely, and say,
how much of that solid angle

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.640
does the tin foil encase?

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.580
It would be 4pi
steradians, regardless

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.310
of the size of the sphere or how
much tin foil you had to use.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.840
So this pretty simple formula
isn't the best approximation

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.340
for it.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:16.432
And I'm not going to go
through the derivation,

00:07:16.432 --> 00:07:17.890
because like I
said, today is going

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.120
to be a more practical nature.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.730
There is a more complex
and rigorous formula

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.670
for the solid
angle of something,

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:28.550
let's say, in this case,
a rectangle of length L

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:33.080
and with W, from a certain
distance r, or, in this case,

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.530
on our graph, x away
from the sphere.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.115
And you can actually see
that red curve right there.

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:39.740
Once you get to a
few centimeters away,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.650
it's pretty close.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.340
Anyone want to guess what the
maximum value of the red curve

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.600
is?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.940
If I take this source
and slam it right up next

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:57.000
to the detector,
how much of sphere

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.902
is the detector subtending?

00:07:59.902 --> 00:08:00.800
AUDIENCE: 2pi

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.960
MICHAEL SHORT: 2pi--
half the sphere.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.240
Because let's say this
whole side of the source

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.390
is completely obscured by the
detector and this whole side

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.310
is free to move.

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:13.990
And if you look really closely,
yep, at 0, the correct formula

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.130
does give you 2pi steradians.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.970
Which is to say that half the
gamma rays leaving the source

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.010
would enter the detector.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.860
I didn't say anything
about get counted yet.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:26.130
That's where the detector
efficiency comes in.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.570
And that's something we're
going to be measuring today,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:32.140
which is why I have my
big bag of burnt bananas.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.710
These are the ashes of roughly
50 pounds of bananas charred

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:39.490
to a crisp at about 250
Fahrenheit for 12 hours in most

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.549
of the dorms and a couple
of the frat houses.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.040
So last year, I had the
students, everyone, take home

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.018
about 50 pounds of
bananas or 50 bananas--

00:08:47.018 --> 00:08:47.810
I forget which one.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.450
It was a lot.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.890
And we did some
distributed labor.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.890
So everybody peeled the
bananas, put them in the oven,

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.530
baked them, separated
off the tin foil,

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.480
baked off as much water
and sugar as possible

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.882
to concentrate the
potassium 40 in the banana.

00:09:01.882 --> 00:09:03.340
So there's a reason
I've been using

00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.700
potassium 40 as a lot of
examples in this class,

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.560
because you're full of it.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.690
That's pretty much the
short answer of it.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:11.740
If you eat bananas--

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.510
which, I think most
of you guys do--

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:16.060
you're intaking a fair bit of
radioactive potassium, which

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:18.880
is a positron
emitter, and also it

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.800
does electron capture
and all that fun stuff.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.650
So today, what we're
going to be doing

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:28.050
is calculating the
activity of one banana.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.360
But that's kind of a very
difficult thing to do.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.150
So anyone know how radioactive
one banana actually

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.490
is in any units at all?

00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:42.250
Whatever it is, it's very,
very, very, very little.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.070
One banana contains a
minuscule but measurable amount

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:46.630
of radioactivity.

00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:48.970
And one of the ways to
boost your confidence

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:50.470
on any sort of
radiation measurement

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:54.360
is to boost your signal strength
or to boost your counting time.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.190
And because I don't want to
count for the next seven years,

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:00.700
we've concentrated the ashes
of 50 pounds of bananas in here

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.980
to boost your signal
strength, which

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.290
is going to boost
your count rate, which

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.830
is the intro I want to give
to statistics certainty

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.560
and counting.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.070
So let's take one of
the homework problems

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.163
as a motivating example.

00:10:17.163 --> 00:10:19.330
You guys, did anyone notice
the extra credit problem

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.170
on the homework?

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.462
Let's start talking about
how we'd go about that.

00:10:24.462 --> 00:10:26.170
That should motivate
the rest of the day.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.660
So I'll pull up that
problem set, number 4--

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.730
which, by the way, is due
Thursday, not Tuesday,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.950
because we have no
class on Tuesday.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.170
That was a surprise
to me, but whatever.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:45.700
I'll still be here.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.995
We don't get holidays--

00:10:46.995 --> 00:10:47.650
just you guys.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.770
So bonus question-- go do this.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.412
So we all know that smoking is
a major source of radioactivity.

00:10:58.412 --> 00:10:59.870
And if you think
about it, it's not

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:02.540
just the smoke that contains
those radiation particles,

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.160
it's got to be the
cigarettes, cigars,

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.180
and other smokables themselves.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.140
And so I was thinking, there's
no better concentrated source

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.095
of smoking radioactivity
than a smoke shop.

00:11:11.095 --> 00:11:13.220
There's one out at [INAUDIBLE]
at the end of the T.

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.440
There's probably some
closer to campus.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.840
But I know there's a whole
bunch that are T accessible.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.150
And so I was thinking it'd
be neat for us to find out,

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:23.710
how radioactive is it
to work in a smoke shop?

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:26.030
Because there's all these
radon decay-- oh, yeah?

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:26.780
You actually know.

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.030
AUDIENCE: You know you have to
be 21 to go into a smoke shop?

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.322
MICHAEL SHORT: Are you serious?

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:32.005
But you have to be 18 to smoke.

00:11:32.005 --> 00:11:32.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:34.025
It's a Cambridge, Boston law.

00:11:34.025 --> 00:11:35.150
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.310
We may have to leave
the city for this one.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.960
What about Somerville?

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.602
I think--

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:43.310
AUDIENCE: It's still--
you're not allowed

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.310
to go into there either.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:45.910
It's all of Massachusetts now.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:46.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Wow.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.790
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.395
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you can buy them.

00:11:50.395 --> 00:11:51.480
It's still late-stage.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.170
It's like town-to-town.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.850
Most of the Boston area is 21.

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:56.878
But once you leave Boston--

00:11:56.878 --> 00:11:57.920
MICHAEL SHORT: It varies.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:58.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:11:58.490
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.490
I don't think it is where
I'm-- from Swampscott,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.597
I don't think it's 21.

00:12:02.597 --> 00:12:04.430
But that's kind of up
on the commuter rails.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.900
You don't want to
go to Swampscott.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:08.000
At any rate, I would
think that, OK,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.790
it's probably a fairly
radioactive place to work.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.100
But the question is, how
long would you actually have

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.560
to bring a detector
in and count in order

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.130
to be sure that there's any
sort of measurable difference?

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:22.880
And so, without deriving all
of this stuff about binomial,

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.100
Poisson, and normal
statistics, I'll say,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:26.810
that's in the reading for today.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.790
I want to show you
some practical uses

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.800
and applications of this stuff.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.410
Let's say you were
to measure some count

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.580
rate in some experiment.

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:39.660
And we'll put this in
units of counts per minute,

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:43.040
which would be the number of
counts divided by the counting

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:43.670
time.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.750
That's about as
simple as it gets.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.950
From Poisson
statistics, you can say

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:54.940
that the standard deviation
of that count rate

00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:00.280
is actually just the square
root of the count rate divided

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.430
by time.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:04.390
And that's kind of the
simple thing right here.

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.430
But usually, in these
sorts of experiments,

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.740
if you want to know how
much more radioactive is

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.530
one place than another, you
have to take a background count.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:15.490
So if I wanted to know how much
activity that source was giving

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.100
off, there is lots of
background radiation

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.290
that we'll be going
over in about a month.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.320
I would have to sit
here for quite a while

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.110
and wait for the slow clicks
of whatever background

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:28.370
radiation is in the room--

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.365
there we go-- to get enough
of a count right going on.

00:13:32.365 --> 00:13:35.368
As you can imagine, the
slower the count rate,

00:13:35.368 --> 00:13:37.660
the less certain you can be
that the number that you're

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.770
measuring is actually accurate.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.370
So the idea here is that
this standard deviation

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.270
is a measure of confidence that
your value is actually right.

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.920
So the two things that
you could do to decrease

00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.810
this standard deviation--

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.440
you could increase
your counting time.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:58.510
Why is there a C on top?

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.020
That doesn't look right.

00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:01.260
It actually is OK.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.480
Yeah.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.190
Yeah, there we go.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.310
So by counting for
longer you can decrease

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.620
your standard deviation.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.330
This is going to take forever.

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:12.400
It actually takes
about 67 minutes,

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.290
because we've already
done this calculation,

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:18.273
to get a 95% confidence
on 5% uncertainty

00:14:18.273 --> 00:14:19.690
for this sort of
background count.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:22.540
I mean, how many counts
we have so far, like, 12?

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.000
14?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.590
Yeah, not very many.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:29.230
Then you've got to be able
to subtract that count

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:33.010
rate from whatever your
source actually is.

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.080
And the way that you
actually measure this

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.000
is pretty straightforward.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.830
The way that you do
error subtraction

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.653
is not as straightforward.

00:14:41.653 --> 00:14:43.570
So let's say we're going
to separate these two

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.870
experiments into a
background experiment, which

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:50.610
we're actually going
to do in an hour.

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:52.318
When we want to count
these banana ashes,

00:14:52.318 --> 00:14:54.600
we're going to have
to count radiation

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.060
coming from the detector
itself, which will account

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.780
for cosmic rays, contamination
in the detector, whatever else

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:03.120
might have been spilled in
there from previous samples.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:08.860
And we're also going to take
some sort of gross count

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:15.440
rate, which will be our
background plus the net count

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.060
rate of our actual source.

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.360
And that's what we're going for.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.245
So the net count
rate is pretty easy.

00:15:22.245 --> 00:15:25.070
It's just the gross count
rate minus the background--

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:27.720
let's keep the
symbols the same--

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.860
count rate.

00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:34.220
Does anyone know how to
quantify the uncertainty

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.510
of this net count rate?

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:38.670
Do you just add the two?

00:15:48.285 --> 00:15:50.410
Well, in this case, we have
to account for the fact

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.800
that radiation
emission from anything

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.020
is a truly random process.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.530
So it's actually random.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:00.370
There is no correlation between
when one particle leaves

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.470
and the next particles
going to leave.

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:04.840
And because it's a
truly random process,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:08.290
these errors in the background
rate and the gross rate

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.317
could add together or could
subtract from each other.

00:16:11.317 --> 00:16:13.150
In other words, one
might be a little higher

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:15.692
than it should be, one might be
a little lower than it should

00:16:15.692 --> 00:16:16.300
be.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:23.740
If you just add together
the two standard deviations,

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:25.870
you actually always
get an overestimate

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:30.180
of the true error,
because you're not

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:32.820
accounting for the fact that
these two experiments may have

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:34.867
partially canceling errors.

00:16:34.867 --> 00:16:37.200
So in this case, that would
be your worst case scenario,

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.390
which is not your
most likely scenario.

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:42.700
What you actually want is to
do what's called uncertainty

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.960
in quadrature,
where you actually

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.700
add up the sum of the square
roots of those errors.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.890
It kind of looks like the
magnitude of a vector,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:53.640
doesn't it?

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.193
It kind of looks exactly like
the magnitude of a vector.

00:16:56.193 --> 00:16:58.110
So in this way, you're
accounting for the fact

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.660
that more error
in each experiment

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.930
does increase the error
on whatever net experiment

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:06.390
you're doing, but not linearly.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:09.390
Because sometimes you have
partially canceling errors.

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.450
And with enough statistics,
if you count for long enough

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.450
or you count enough counts, then
these things, on average, are

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:20.025
going to add in quadrature,
which will come out to--

00:17:20.025 --> 00:17:24.160
and I want to make sure we don't
have any typos, so I'll just

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.020
keep the notes with me--

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:30.280
so you'd need the background
count over the background time

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.295
squared, plus those.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.613
There we go.

00:17:37.613 --> 00:17:39.280
And so, now, I'd like
to pose a question

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:44.860
to you, the same one that's
here in the problem set--

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.020
how long do you have to
count in the smoke shop

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.200
to be 95% percent sure?

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.227
So let's say your count
rate's 5% uncertain.

00:17:52.227 --> 00:17:54.310
And we're going to spend
the rest of today's class

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:58.340
taking apart that statement and
getting at what it should be.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.320
So again, what we
want to say is,

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:07.440
how do you know that we're
95% confident of our count

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:12.540
rate plus or minus 5% error?

00:18:15.550 --> 00:18:17.637
That's the main
question for today.

00:18:17.637 --> 00:18:18.970
Does anyone know how we'd start?

00:18:23.237 --> 00:18:24.570
Anyone get to the reading today?

00:18:27.234 --> 00:18:28.650
I see some smiles.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:29.788
OK.

00:18:29.788 --> 00:18:31.080
We'll start from scratch, then.

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:46.110
All right, So who here has
heard of a normal distribution

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.160
before?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.210
A lot of you guys.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:49.080
Great.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.490
The idea here is that with
enough counting statistics,

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.270
this very rare event binomial
distribution approaches

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.900
a normal distribution, where
you can say if you measure

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.540
a certain count rate-- let's say
this would be your mean count

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.040
rate--

00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:14.450
to limits of plus
or minus 1 sigma

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:22.680
or one standard deviation,
1 sigma gives you about 68%

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:30.160
confidence in your result.
Yeah, I spelled it right.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:33.370
The reason for that is that if
you go plus or minus 1 sigma

00:19:33.370 --> 00:19:37.810
away from your true
average right here,

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:42.880
you've filled in 68% of the area
under this normal distribution.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:52.040
Similarly, if you go plus
2 sigma or minus 2 sigma,

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.400
it's around 95% confident.

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.223
3 sigma is getting
towards 99 point--

00:20:00.223 --> 00:20:01.390
what was the number, again--

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:03.840
I think it's 6.

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:08.130
Maybe it's more like 98.5%.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:10.590
And then so on, and
so on, and so on.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:13.495
There's actually societies
called 6 sigma societies.

00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:15.120
And the way that they
get their name is

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.220
we're so confident of
things we can predict them

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.730
to 6 sigma, which is some
99 point a large number

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.970
of nines percentage of the area
under a normal distribution.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:27.750
So if I ask you,
how long do you have

00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:31.590
to count to be 95%
confident in your result,

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.500
you have to give an answer
that will relate two

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.890
times this standard deviation.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:39.650
And now we know the formula for
standard deviation of this net

00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:41.600
counting experiment.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.570
So we can formulate
our equation thusly--

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:49.040
let's say in order to be 95%
confident, in other words, 2

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:55.920
sigma, that our counting rate is
within 5% of the actual value,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.130
in other words, plus
or minus 5% error,

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:02.710
we put our error
percentage here,

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:04.930
and our true net
count rate there.

00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:10.210
So this part right here
tells us the 95% confidence.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:15.520
This part right here
is our 5% error.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.190
And that part right
there is our count rate.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.370
So then we can substitute in
our expression for sigma--

00:21:25.370 --> 00:21:27.950
our uncertainty in quadrature--
and find out things like,

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:30.710
well, it depends on what the
information we're given is.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:32.870
Let's say before you
go to the smoke shop,

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:36.590
you take your Geiger counter,
and for an extremely long time

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.170
you count the background
counts somewhere.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:46.160
So let's say in this problem
the known quantities--

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.500
we know our
background count rate,

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.480
because you can do that
at your leisure at home.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:56.550
And when I did this, it came out
to about 25 counts per minute.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:01.530
And known is the
background counting time.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:05.190
And when I did this, to
get within 95% confidence

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.475
of 5% error, I had to
do this for 67 minutes.

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.150
And now, all that's
left is we want

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:22.740
to relate our net count rate
and our gross counting time,

00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.620
or our gross count rate and
our gross counting time,

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:28.240
because it's the same thing.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.860
So this is actually
how you decide

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.320
how long you have to
sit in the smoke shop

00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.730
to count in order to
satisfy what we asked for--

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:41.840
95% confidence that your
count rate is 5% error.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.950
So let's start
substituting this out.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.960
That's not mine, so we
can get rid of that.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.880
So we'll take that expression
and substitute in everything

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.050
we can.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:11.030
So 0.05 C n equals 2 sigma.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:14.760
And there's our
sigma expression,

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.140
which I'll rewrite right here.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:24.860
So we have see C b
over t b squared plus C

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:28.790
g over t g squared.

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:32.380
What's next?

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.942
How do we relate t g and C g?

00:23:45.195 --> 00:23:47.070
Well, let's start with
the easy stuff, right?

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.007
What can we cancel, or
square, or whatever?

00:23:49.007 --> 00:23:50.090
Just somebody yell it out.

00:23:53.938 --> 00:23:57.418
AUDIENCE: Do we have
numbers for these counts?

00:23:57.418 --> 00:23:58.210
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:03.508
So we have numbers for C b
and t b, but not C g and t g.

00:24:03.508 --> 00:24:05.050
We have not yet
answered the question

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.510
when you go into the smoke
shop and talk to the owner,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.770
and he says, fine,
you're going to sit here

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.030
with the radiation detector.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:13.060
How long do you have to be
here, looking all weird?

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:15.520
You want to have an answer.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.200
And so if you get some
initial estimate of C g,

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.170
you can tell him this is my
approximate t g, at which point

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.212
he or she will say
yes or no, depending

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:25.170
on how they're feeling.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.130
So why don't we just
start, divide by 2, right?

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.084
Divide by 2.

00:24:36.084 --> 00:24:39.720
0.025.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.830
We can square both sides.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:43.860
And there's a C n there.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:51.556
Square both sides, and
we end up with 0.000625 C

00:24:51.556 --> 00:25:01.030
n squared equals C b
over t b squared plus C

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:04.640
g over t g squared.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.530
There's lots of
ways to go about it.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.740
I want to make sure I
do the efficient one.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.980
Oh, I'm sorry those
aren't squared.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:22.100
Because our standard deviations
had the square root in them.

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:22.867
There we go.

00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:23.700
That's more like it.

00:25:26.370 --> 00:25:28.912
What's next?

00:25:28.912 --> 00:25:30.120
We've got too many variables.

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:30.620
Yeah?

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.233
AUDIENCE: I think there's still
a square value [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:35.900
MICHAEL SHORT: Isn't
there still a what?

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.400
AUDIENCE: Isn't
there a square value

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.698
still under the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:39.698 --> 00:25:41.240
MICHAEL SHORT:
Because, in this case,

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.680
the standard deviation is
the square root of the count

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.900
rate over the time.

00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.310
So the standard
deviation squared

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.860
is just count rate
overtime time.

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.930
Was there an earlier
expression we have to correct?

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:55.572
Yep.

00:25:55.572 --> 00:25:56.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:59.790
That's where it came from.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.210
That's right.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:03.140
That's not.

00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:05.390
Because that's right.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.690
There we go.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:07.190
Good.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.820
Good, tracing out that.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.320
OK.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:15.032
Now that everything is
corrected here, what's next?

00:26:15.032 --> 00:26:16.240
We've got too many variables.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:17.770
Yeah?

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the standard deviation

00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:24.090
have units of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Not
quite, because there's

00:26:26.610 --> 00:26:27.670
a count rate in here.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.250
So the units of
standard deviation,

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:32.940
if this is square root
of count rate over time,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.110
which is the same as number of
counts times time over time,

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.766
right?

00:26:37.766 --> 00:26:38.600
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:45.787
Because again, a count
rate is a number over--

00:26:45.787 --> 00:26:46.370
where'd it go.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:47.980
AUDIENCE: Number
over time squared.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:48.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.610
Number over time squared.

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.665
That doesn't sound right though.

00:26:52.665 --> 00:26:53.165
Let's see.

00:26:59.877 --> 00:27:00.460
Hold on a sec.

00:27:04.082 --> 00:27:05.540
Although the standard
deviation has

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.750
got to have the same units
as the count rate itself,

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:10.740
because they're additive, right?

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.190
Because they usually express
some count rate plus or minus

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.217
either sigma or 2
sigma, so they've

00:27:15.217 --> 00:27:16.550
got to have the same count rate.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.560
So standard deviations are
expressed in counts per minute

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.700
if your counts are expressed
in counts per minute.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.400
OK, cool.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.650
So we've got too many
variables, but it's

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.290
easy to get rid of one of
them, either C n or C g.

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:30.040
Do you a question?

00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.325
AUDIENCE: No, I was just
going to say [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:32.325 --> 00:27:33.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Great.

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.825
So you were going to
say the same thing

00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:36.100
that I was going to do.

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:37.480
Cool.

00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:43.890
So we'll take out our C n, and
we'll stick in a C g minus C b.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:52.980
And we're trying to isolate t
g as a function of C g or vice

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:53.970
versa.

00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:55.560
There's a lot of C
g's and not a lot

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:59.480
of t g's, so let's just
keep the t g on its own.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:07.050
So we'll have 0.000625
C g minus C b squared.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:11.650
Then I'm going to subtract C
b over t b from both sides.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:25.820
Minus C b over t b
equals C g over t g.

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.810
And do I have to go through the
rest the math with you guys?

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.640
I think, at this point, we've
got it pretty much solved.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:36.200
We divide everything
by C g, flip it over,

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.700
and you end up
with-- actually, I've

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.130
already written out
the expression, which

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:41.360
I want to show you guys here.

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:47.620
Back to smoke shop
counting time.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.110
So I want to show you
some of the implications

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.760
of this expression.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:56.140
That number right there is
just a more exact part-- a bit

00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.370
of 2 Sigma.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:29:02.890
Instead of 0.05, we had
something much, much closer.

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:06.350
So what I want us to look
at is this graph right here.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.490
We've got a nice relation
now between the count

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.200
rate and counts per minute--

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.440
and it was the gross count
rate and the required counting

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.580
time to get to that
5% uncertainty.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.330
Well, there's a couple
of interesting bits

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.762
about this equation.

00:29:20.762 --> 00:29:22.470
What are some of the
features you notice?

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:27.470
Yeah.

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.478
AUDIENCE: The count rate is
extremely low for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:32.478 --> 00:29:33.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.160
If the count rate
is extremely low,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.260
it's going to take an
infinite amount of time.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:39.700
You're absolutely
right on some level.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.880
So if we have that
expression right

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:44.730
there-- so let me just
actually get it all the way out

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:45.773
so we can see.

00:29:45.773 --> 00:29:47.190
Because I want to
show you some of

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:49.260
the math-related
implications for this.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:53.160
So if we had our counting time--

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.890
what do we have--

00:29:54.890 --> 00:30:12.610
C g over 0.025 C g minus C b
squared, minus C b over t b,

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.880
at what point is this
equation undefined?

00:30:23.768 --> 00:30:24.400
Yeah, Sean.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.233
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
question [INAUDIBLE],,

00:30:26.233 --> 00:30:29.690
using the second one
after the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:31.670
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.170
So like Sean said,
for the condition

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:38.870
where 0.025 C g
minus C b-- let's

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:45.140
just call it C net squared
minus equals C b over t b,

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.260
this equation is
actually undefined.

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.500
Which means that if
your C b and t b-- let's

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:58.790
say if the uncertainty from
your background counting rate

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.620
experiment is such
that you can never

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.410
get the total
uncertainty down to let's

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:07.130
say 5% error with
95% confidence,

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.250
you can't actually
run that experiment.

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:13.400
Because these uncertainties
are added in quadrature,

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.010
if you're trying to reduce
sigma down to a value

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:20.120
below that already,
how can you do that?

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:23.903
You can't have a negative
standard deviation, right?

00:31:23.903 --> 00:31:25.570
So what this actually
means is that when

00:31:25.570 --> 00:31:28.570
you're designing this
experiment, even if you count

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.330
for 67 minutes at 25
counts per minute,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.510
like we can now out in
the air, that might not

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.480
be enough to discern the
activity of the smoke

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:38.980
shop, or the source,
or whatever you

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.850
happen to be looking at to 95%
confidence within 5% error.

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.850
And so let's actually
look at that on the graph.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:53.520
If we keep on scrolling up just
by adding stuff to the y-axis,

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:56.280
eventually we see that
it gets all straight.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.740
And right here, at about
49 counts a minute,

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.380
suspiciously close to
the background counts,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.800
you'll never actually be able
to get within this confidence

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.275
and error interval.

00:32:09.275 --> 00:32:10.650
So there's always
some trade-offs

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.200
you can make in your experiment.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.510
Let's see-- there it is.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:19.270
So sometimes, do
you necessarily have

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:23.940
to be 95% confident
of your result?

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.770
Depends on what you're doing.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:30.430
Or do you necessarily have
to get within 5% error?

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.940
That's probably the one you
can start to sacrifice first.

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:36.220
So usually, you want to
be confident of whatever

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.500
result you're saying and
be confident that you're

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.680
giving acceptable bounds.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.980
So you can remain at 95%
confidence, which means--

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.310
where did part go--

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:56.920
which means keep your 2 Sigma,
but you can then increase

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.360
your allowable percent error.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.180
So if you can't get
within 5% error--

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.820
and I believe the homework
doesn't actually say that

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.510
for a reason--

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:08.820
yeah, we don't tell
what error to choose.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.070
But we do say try to
get a 95% confidence.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.350
So then the question is,
for a reasonable counting

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:18.990
time, to what error can you
get within 95% confidence?

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:21.930
The more error you allow,
the shorter time you

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:23.135
have to count for.

00:33:23.135 --> 00:33:25.260
And I want to show you
graphically how some of that

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.830
stuff interplay with each other.

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.370
Let's say you were to
increase your counting time,

00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:33.690
which we can do
here with a slider.

00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:36.140
So for the same
background counting rate,

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:37.700
if you increase
the counting time,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.645
what happens to the uncertainty
on your background experiment?

00:33:41.645 --> 00:33:44.365
Does it go up, down, or nothing?

00:33:44.365 --> 00:33:45.670
AUDIENCE: It goes down.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:46.310
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
going to go down.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.810
Yeah.

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:49.240
Count for longer-- the
uncertainty goes down.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:53.050
I'm going to have to change
the bounds here to something

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:55.510
more reasonable.

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.360
So we were at 67 minutes.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:03.620
And now, notice, as you
increase your counting time,

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:06.920
even though you haven't
changed the counting rate,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.840
it then takes less
time to distinguish

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.100
whatever your source is.

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:14.447
So let's count for less
time in the background,

00:34:14.447 --> 00:34:16.489
you have to count for more
time in the experiment

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.520
until it just kind of explodes.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:21.110
Count for more time
in the background,

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:23.152
you have to count for less
time in the experiment

00:34:23.152 --> 00:34:25.850
in order to get to the
uncertainty and confidence you

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:27.110
want to get to.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:29.090
So if you doubled your
background count time

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:35.810
from 67 minutes to
134, then you can

00:34:35.810 --> 00:34:39.742
measure count rates as low as
42 counts per minute gross.

00:34:39.742 --> 00:34:42.409
So when you start going into the
smoke shop, you can, let's say,

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.280
count for a few minutes and
get some very crude estimate

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.085
of the counting
rate and then decide

00:34:48.085 --> 00:34:50.210
how long you have to let
your background accumulate

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.000
so you can distinguish the
activity in the smoke shop

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.801
to within some confidence
and some error.

00:34:56.801 --> 00:34:57.564
Yes.

00:34:57.564 --> 00:35:00.147
AUDIENCE: So does the background
in the case of the smoke shop

00:35:00.147 --> 00:35:03.015
just the area right
outside of it?

00:35:03.015 --> 00:35:05.410
Instead of the inside?

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.540
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
definitely location dependent.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.452
So we will get into
background counts and sources

00:35:10.452 --> 00:35:12.160
of background radiation
in about a month.

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.810
But to give you a
quick flash-forward,

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.675
it depends on your elevation to
say how much of the atmosphere

00:35:16.675 --> 00:35:18.640
is protecting you
from cosmic rays.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.230
It definitely
depends on location.

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:22.522
So in New Hampshire, the
background count's quite a bit

00:35:22.522 --> 00:35:24.880
higher, because there's a
lot of granite deposits,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.460
and granite can be upwards of
52 parts per million radium.

00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:32.140
Conway granite in
particular, named

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.390
after Conway, New Hampshire,
is pretty rich in radium ore.

00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:36.640
Oh, is that where you're from?

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.182
AUDIENCE: No.

00:35:37.182 --> 00:35:38.230
My last name is Conway.

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:39.290
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, there you go.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.800
OK.

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:40.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.385
Yeah.

00:35:41.385 --> 00:35:42.010
It's also neat.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:45.850
You can use background counts
as a radiation altimeter.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.700
One of my graduate students
actually built a Geiger counter

00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.890
interface to an Arduino,
where you could actually

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:52.900
tell what the height
you were flying at

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:56.140
is by the amount of
background radiation increase.

00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:59.178
So certainly it's going to
depend where you are, right?

00:35:59.178 --> 00:36:01.220
But you want to make sure
that you're in an area,

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:03.400
to answer Sean's question,
representative of where

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.780
the smoke shop is.

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.322
So you can't go
into the reactor,

00:36:06.322 --> 00:36:07.780
and drop this in
the core, and say,

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.130
I'm doing a background count.

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.560
That's not a valid experiment.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.980
So yeah, you'd want to be,
I don't know, same block.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.930
That would be a pretty good.

00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:18.970
And then go in there
and see, can you

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:21.100
measure any sort
of increase, get

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.100
a crude estimate of your C g--

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.380
your gross count rate.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.380
Use this formula right here to
estimate how much time you'd

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:30.760
have to wait.

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:35.140
So for example, let's shrink
our y-axis down a little

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.515
and be more optimistic
than we probably should.

00:36:38.515 --> 00:36:40.390
Let's say you go in
there and you get a count

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.830
rate of 100 counts per minute.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.610
That would do that
would surprise me.

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.880
You'd only have to count
for an extra 28 minutes

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:55.210
to nail that net count rate
with 95% confidence to 5% error.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.960
Let's say now, what
happens if we increase

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.830
the allowable percent error?

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:03.110
So let's say 10% error
would be acceptable.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:07.748
We just take that
number and double it.

00:37:07.748 --> 00:37:09.290
Then, all of a
sudden, you don't have

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:12.930
to count for nearly as long.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:17.270
So again at 5% error,
which means a 0.25 here,

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.950
at 100 counts per
minute, you'd have

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:22.460
to count for about 30 minutes.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.880
If you're willing
to accept 10% error,

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:32.113
it goes down to seven
minutes and 18 seconds.

00:37:32.113 --> 00:37:33.780
So do you guys see
the general interplay

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:37.290
between confidence, percent
error, counting time,

00:37:37.290 --> 00:37:39.990
and counting rate?

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.070
Who here is built an NSE
Geiger counter before?

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:43.570
Awesome.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.000
So this is definitely a
try-it-at-home kids kind

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:46.990
of thing.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:49.480
If you want to find out
is something radioactive,

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:52.150
this is what you can actually
use to answer the question,

00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:56.590
is it discernibly radioactive
to within some limit of error

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.462
or limit of confidence?

00:37:59.462 --> 00:38:01.920
That's what we're going to be
doing here with a much, much,

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.250
much more sensitive detector.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:08.750
So the only thing missing
from our complete picture

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.480
of going from the activity of
a source, which we've shown you

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.510
how to count, to dealing with
the solid angle, which is just

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.660
a simple formula, to
dealing with statistics

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:21.380
and uncertainty, is now the
efficiency of this detector.

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:23.960
Out of the number of
radiation quanta or whatever

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.290
that enter the detector,
how many interact,

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.877
and how many leave
out the other side?

00:38:29.877 --> 00:38:32.210
That's we're going to be
spending most of the next month

00:38:32.210 --> 00:38:36.470
on when we do ion, photon,
electron, and neutron

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.510
interactions with matter.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.060
So we'll find out-- what's the
probability per unit length

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.730
that each one undergoes
an interaction, what kind

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.540
of interactions do they
undergo, and then we'll

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:48.830
complete this actual picture.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:52.550
So you can take a source of,
let's say, unknown activity,

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.880
put it a known distance
away from a known detector

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.220
with a known
efficiency, and back out

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.670
what the activity of that
source is with accuracy.

00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:04.160
That's what you're going to
start doing on this homework

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.630
as well for the banana lab.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.750
The only thing you don't
know is the activity

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:10.260
of this bag of bananas.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.260
But we're going to give
you all the information,

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.180
like the efficiency
of the detector

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.747
and the geometry
of the detector,

00:39:15.747 --> 00:39:17.330
and you're going to
be able to measure

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.150
the number of
potassium 40 counts

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.320
that the detector picks up.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.870
So by taking-- let's see
where we have some space left.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:30.170
We had a little bit here.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:35.030
So by taking that
number of counts

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.010
and dividing by, let's
say, the efficiency

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.230
of the detector, where
that efficiency is

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:45.170
going to range from 0 to 1,
probably much closer to 0,

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:50.720
and also dividing by, let's
say, your solid angle over 4

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.960
pi to account for how many
of the emitted potassium

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:57.740
40 gamma rays actually
get into the detector

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:05.658
and dividing by 2 gamma
rays per disintegration--

00:40:05.658 --> 00:40:07.290
I think that's what
we had last time.

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:09.620
Or was that cobalt 60?

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:10.760
Yeah.

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.900
We've been using cobalt
60 as an example.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:16.200
So remember, we had two gamma
rays emitted per cobalt 60

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.200
disintegration on average.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:23.830
Then you can get to the
actual activity of the source.

00:40:23.830 --> 00:40:27.100
Once you know the activity
of this bag of bananas,

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.470
you can then divide by either
the mass of one banana,

00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:31.140
or the number of
bananas, or whatever

00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.140
to get the final answer.

00:40:35.185 --> 00:40:37.560
That's what we're going to
spend the rest of today doing.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.333
So since it's getting
on five out of five of,

00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:42.750
do you guys have any questions
about what we covered today

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:43.958
or what we're about to go do?

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.360
AUDIENCE: You said
that for solid angle

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.840
you wouldn't do this.

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.650
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.720
AUDIENCE: So for
solid angle, it's

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:00.140
[INAUDIBLE] to the surface
area over y squared.

00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:03.510
And in this situation,
does solid angle over 4 pi

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:08.968
mean that you can only have a
maximum of half of the sphere?

00:41:08.968 --> 00:41:10.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Not necessarily.

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:12.010
Let's say you were to
encase your detector

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.910
in an infinite medium
of radiation material.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:16.900
Then you could subtend 4 pi.

00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:19.800
So the idea here is that if
you captured every single gamma

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.660
ray, your solid
angle would be 4 pi.

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:27.030
So if your solid angle
is 4 pi, then that

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:32.490
would equal-ish the area
over r squared of your thing.

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.520
But this is actually not
that good of an approximation

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:39.270
when you put a source very,
very up close to a detector.

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:41.760
So there are actual formulas
for solid angle, where

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.850
the real formula
for a solid angle,

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.550
you actually end up
having to do a surface

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:53.460
integral of the sine,
which accounts for the fact

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:55.770
that the object that you
have might be, let's say,

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.310
tilted towards or away
from the detector,

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:05.843
times some differential d phi
d theta of this unit sphere.

00:42:05.843 --> 00:42:07.260
So you'll have to
integrate to say

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:13.740
how many of these little d
phi d thetas are actually

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.840
subtended by your detector.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:17.940
And the value of that
actual surface integral

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.430
gives you the real solid angle.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:22.405
That's the super
simple one if you just

00:42:22.405 --> 00:42:24.030
know the area of
something and you know

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.580
that you're kind of far away.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.820
But again, whenever possible,
use the exact formula.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:34.010
So any other questions?

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.795
Yeah, Sean.

00:42:34.795 --> 00:42:36.420
AUDIENCE: You said
that that expression

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:41.870
is a true statement
[INAUDIBLE] per second, right?

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:43.970
MICHAEL SHORT: The two
gammas per cobalt 60?

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:44.470
This one?

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:45.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.928
MICHAEL SHORT: That
accounts for the fact

00:42:46.928 --> 00:42:51.287
that if you remember the
decay diagram for cobalt 60,

00:42:51.287 --> 00:42:52.120
how does that decay?

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:55.570
By beta emission.

00:42:55.570 --> 00:42:57.850
It goes to one
energy level, and it

00:42:57.850 --> 00:43:04.990
tends to go down by two
gamma decays to nickel 60.

00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:06.610
So each time it
gives off a gamma ray

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.230
to one level and a gamma
ray to another level.

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:12.010
So in this case, one
becquerel of cobalt 60

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.860
would give off two
gamma rays per second.

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.000
So if you're measuring a number
of counts, and each count,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.340
one gamma ray was
responsible, you

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:23.260
have to then divide
by the number of gamma

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.900
rays per disintegration
on average in order

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.856
to get the actual
activity of that source.

00:43:28.856 --> 00:43:32.050
Because remember, activity is
measured in disintegrations,

00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:36.070
not in number of
gamma rays emitted.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:37.940
That's the difference here.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.880
Dose-- you'd actually care about
how many gamma rays you absorb.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.690
But activity is how many atoms
are disintegrating per second.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:47.360
Yeah.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:51.700
AUDIENCE: What units of
cobalt 60 [INAUDIBLE]??

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.385
MICHAEL SHORT: The
units of cobalt 60?

00:43:53.385 --> 00:43:54.890
AUDIENCE: It's just two gamma--

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:58.040
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, this would
be, like, atoms of cobalt 60.

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:00.350
And those gamma rays
would be gammas per atom.

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.690
So in this case, it's like two
gamma rays per atom of cobalt

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:16.760
60 disintegrating, or better
yet, per disintegration.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.750
So you've got to know
what material you're

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:24.120
looking at in order
to know how many gamma

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.870
or how many betas or
more that you're going

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:28.486
to get per disintegration.

00:44:33.593 --> 00:44:35.760
Who here has heard of this
uncertainty in quadrature

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.006
before?

00:44:38.006 --> 00:44:39.190
There's a couple folks.

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.240
OK.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:40.740
Yeah.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:43.673
The idea here is that, again,
if you just add the errors up,

00:44:43.673 --> 00:44:45.340
you're probably
overestimating the error

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:46.465
and selling yourself short.

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:49.860
Cool.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.700
In that case, if there's no
questions, let's go do this.

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.380
So follow me to
the counting lab.

00:45:01.902 --> 00:45:02.610
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.110
So this is my counting lab.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:08.100
These are three high-purity
germanium detectors.

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:10.225
Have you explained high-purity
germanium detectors?

00:45:10.225 --> 00:45:11.010
MICHAEL SHORT: No, we haven't.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:11.890
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:13.900
Have you explained
any detectors?

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:14.750
MICHAEL SHORT: Just
the Geiger counter

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.190
we were playing
around with today.

00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.898
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

00:45:16.898 --> 00:45:18.490
Well, here.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:25.460
Down in here there's a little
high-purity germanium crystal

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:29.000
with a couple thousand
volts across it.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.860
When a gamma ray
goes into it, it

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.370
makes some electron hole pairs.

00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:36.230
Nod when I say
electron hole pairs.

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:38.460
OK, good.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.050
And basically, you get more
electron hole pairs the more

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:44.270
energy of the gamma you have.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:47.540
So you collect the
current from that,

00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:51.470
and you get a little
pulse of current,

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.090
and the height of
the pulse tells you

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.800
how many hole pairs
you had, and then

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.850
back it up to what the
energy or your gamma was.

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.460
That works fine if you collect
all of the gamma energy.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.740
You don't always quite do that.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:05.920
Anyway, so that's how--

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.060
You all can scooch up.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.830
There's not a whole
lot to see in there.

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:10.926
MICHAEL SHORT:
It's worth a look.

00:46:10.926 --> 00:46:11.926
If you've never seen it.

00:46:11.926 --> 00:46:13.280
MICHAEL AMES: It's worth a look.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.810
You can't really
see the crystal.

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:18.710
There's just an aluminum
cylinder in there.

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:21.760
The black part is just
a carbon fiber window,

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:26.660
because you don't want to
cut off the low energy gamma.

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.448
So it's got a really thin
carbon fiber window on it.

00:46:29.448 --> 00:46:31.490
MICHAEL SHORT: What's with
the hundreds of pounds

00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:32.960
of copper around the side?

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.040
MICHAEL AMES: What's with
the hundreds of pounds

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:34.970
of copper on the side?

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.310
There's not hundreds of
pounds of copper on the side.

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:38.630
These guys are lead.

00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:40.070
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah-hah!

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.000
MICHAEL AMES: Which
does two things--

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.920
it shields the detectors from
the activity out here, from you

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.890
guys, from the activities
coming out of here--

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:54.530
because sometimes I'm counting
very low activity samples--

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:56.240
and it also, if I'm
counting something

00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.260
that has a lot of activity, it
shields us from that activity.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.230
So it kind of goes both ways.

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:08.540
The reason there's copper is
if you get a high energy gamma

00:47:08.540 --> 00:47:12.710
ray into some lead,
it makes x-rays.

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:15.215
And it makes a
very nice 75 keV--

00:47:15.215 --> 00:47:16.830
do you guys know keV?

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:17.330
Good.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.410
MICHAEL SHORT:
We've done x-rays.

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.327
MICHAEL AMES: Awesome.

00:47:19.327 --> 00:47:22.400
So it's a really,
really nice 75 keV

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.820
x-ray that interferes with
trying to count things

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.710
around 75 keV, because you're
getting all these x-rays coming

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:29.210
out of lead.

00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:31.160
So you line it
with copper, which

00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:36.740
makes a lower energy x-ray and
filters out the lead x-rays.

00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:41.810
So anyway, so this is I've
got two germanium detectors.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:44.840
That ones also germanium,
but it's a well detector.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.840
So it's got a little
one-centimeter hole

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.850
in so you can stick a sample
right in the germanium.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:56.540
They're hooked up through
a little electronic box

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.880
and go into the computer
over there that does

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:00.870
all the peak height analysis.

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:02.570
Oh, yeah, liquid
nitrogen [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:05.000
Thanks for pointing.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.930
Yeah, you cool the electronics
and everything down

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:11.252
so it cuts out
the thermal noise.

00:48:11.252 --> 00:48:13.460
Because you're looking for
really tiny little signals

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.050
here, so you cool
everything down.

00:48:16.050 --> 00:48:19.010
And that way, it's
not too noisy.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.830
These guys are OK warming up.

00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:23.660
It doesn't destroy the detector.

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.750
The old detectors you had
to keep cold all the time.

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:31.940
And if they warmed up, then
they were just paperweights.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.560
So this is just
the counting lab.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:36.620
I've got an actual sample
counting in here right now.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:38.780
We'll take a look at the
spectrum in a minute.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:40.670
Your bananas are
going to go here.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:49.860
And let's see if we
can smash it down.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:50.360
Yeah.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.400
Because it would be nice
if I can close the lid.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:56.360
Oops.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.527
MICHAEL SHORT: Well, almost.

00:48:57.527 --> 00:48:58.402
MICHAEL AMES: Almost.

00:48:58.402 --> 00:48:59.480
Well, smash this down.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.360
Here, one you guys do this.

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:02.580
Here, you.

00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:04.970
Smash that down until
it fits in there.

00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:06.715
Although, don't break the bag.

00:49:06.715 --> 00:49:07.670
Oh!

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:08.762
OK, we'll get another bag.

00:49:08.762 --> 00:49:09.970
AUDIENCE: Oh, did I break it?

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:10.887
MICHAEL AMES: It's OK.

00:49:10.887 --> 00:49:13.050
It's just banana ash.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.780
We'll find another bag.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.230
It's OK.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.500
You know, I'm all
about making mistakes.

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:24.780
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, yeah, yeah,
just be a little more gentle.

00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:29.250
We'll throw some duct tape
on it, and it'll be fine.

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:33.990
So you're looking for potassium
40 in your bananas, correct?

00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:37.260
Where else do you think
we got potassium 40?

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:40.667
Or do you think there's any
other potassium 40 in the room?

00:49:40.667 --> 00:49:41.507
AUDIENCE: In us.

00:49:41.507 --> 00:49:42.590
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, right.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:47.640
So when you do the banana
count, we frequently

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.900
take a spectrum on this
with the lid closed,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.520
and we always see potassium 40.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.440
There's potassium 40 everywhere.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:58.500
So after we get the
count of the bananas,

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.150
we'll take a background count.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.040
You'll want to subtract
the two signals.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.150
MICHAEL SHORT: We just
did 15 minutes ago.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:05.960
MICHAEL AMES: You're
so ahead of me.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.348
OK, I think that's all--

00:50:08.348 --> 00:50:09.390
Is this going to fit now?

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:10.384
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:10.384 --> 00:50:11.092
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:17.000
Close enough.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.350
I've got this thing--

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.030
I've got a whole bunch
of little spacers

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.760
if I'm counting
something that's hot.

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.610
And by hot, I mean
radioactive hot.

00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.290
I'll space it out
a little further.

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:31.995
AUDIENCE: Need a
little more smashing?

00:50:31.995 --> 00:50:33.245
MICHAEL AMES: No, that's fine.

00:50:33.245 --> 00:50:35.050
We just got to close the lid.

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:40.190
And if I've got something
that's very radioactive,

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:43.280
I'll just space it out
away from the detector.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.770
If you've got something
that's really hot,

00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:47.780
it just kind of swamps
out the electronics.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.480
MICHAEL SHORT: We did just go
for a solid angle too, today.

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.605
MICHAEL AMES: There you go.

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:56.210
Is there anything else
I want to say in here?

00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:58.570
No, let's move this way.

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:04.060
This is the spectrum
I'm collecting on MIT 1.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:07.780
Right now, I don't know--
how long has that been going?

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:11.080
Half a day-- less than that.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:14.620
Anyway, so this is
a sample of quartz

00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:17.770
that was irradiated
next to the reactor.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.755
You guys are going to do
shorts in like a month--

00:51:20.755 --> 00:51:21.880
did you bring your samples?

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.190
MICHAEL SHORT:
We're getting them.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.160
MICHAEL AMES: OK, good.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.638
Anyway, this is a
sample of quartz

00:51:25.638 --> 00:51:27.930
that was irradiated in the
same spot you guys are going

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:30.850
to do your irradiation,
sort of in the graphite

00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:33.580
region of the reactor.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:37.090
The reason we're running
it is the people who

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:41.470
are looking at this quartz
want to run it for 80 hours,

00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:43.840
and we'd like to know if
there are any impurities in it

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.030
that'll cause grief--

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.800
meaning a lot of activity
when it comes out.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.320
So we run it for a short period.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:52.780
I think this ran six hours.

00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:55.450
And it's just a
little tiny piece.

00:51:55.450 --> 00:51:58.620
And so I can look at the gamma
spectrum coming out of this.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:02.980
So you can see, there's a
whole mess of peaks in here.

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.845
This one-- you see that?

00:52:05.845 --> 00:52:07.720
You see that lovely,
little peak right there?

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:08.320
Can you all see that?

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:08.820
Nod.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:09.670
Yeah, OK.

00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:10.900
So that's the full spectrum.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:11.567
That's the peak.

00:52:11.567 --> 00:52:14.950
That's a tungsten 187 peak.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:19.627
So I did put up one little
thing right behind you.

00:52:19.627 --> 00:52:21.460
Have you all seen the
chart of the nuclides?

00:52:21.460 --> 00:52:22.098
This thing?

00:52:22.098 --> 00:52:23.140
MICHAEL SHORT: Every day.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:23.890
MICHAEL AMES: Every day!

00:52:23.890 --> 00:52:24.390
Good.

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.040
I've got one of
these on every wall

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:30.370
in every lab in office and
a little handbook Yeah.

00:52:30.370 --> 00:52:36.428
So the tungsten 186
activates into tungsten 187.

00:52:36.428 --> 00:52:38.470
So if you've looked at
the chart of the nuclides,

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:41.410
you can tell that there's
all the sort of parameters

00:52:41.410 --> 00:52:45.790
you would need to calculate
how much activation

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:50.660
you'd get based on neutron
flux, and time, and cross.

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:56.170
The 28.43, that's the
abundance of that isotope.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.590
You can see the sigma
gamma 38, that's

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:04.010
the cross section
for thermal neutrons.

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:08.500
And so that's how likely
you'll get from 186 to 187.

00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:10.090
187, that's the half-life--

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:12.130
23.9 hours.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:13.800
So with all of that--

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.690
oh, and underneath
the 23.9, you've

00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:19.090
got what the gammas are--

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.867
685, 479.

00:53:21.867 --> 00:53:23.200
it's got a whole mess of gammas.

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:25.570
So that's a bunch of the
gammas in here for that.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:31.390
So you could, knowing
how big that peak is,

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:34.510
what the efficiency of the
detector is for collecting that

00:53:34.510 --> 00:53:39.190
peak in that geometry, the
half-life, the cross set--

00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:41.500
that whole mess of parameters--

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:45.560
back-calculate how much
tungsten is in the sample.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:48.070
So that's kind of
how NAA works, which

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:49.420
I assume you've explained.

00:53:49.420 --> 00:53:50.080
MICHAEL SHORT: We have.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:50.410
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:51.490
MICHAEL SHORT:
Actually, the whole idea

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:53.282
behind doing those
short NAA activations is

00:53:53.282 --> 00:53:54.657
these guys are
going to calculate

00:53:54.657 --> 00:53:55.690
what's in their samples.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:56.815
MICHAEL AMES: There you go.

00:53:56.815 --> 00:53:58.450
MICHAEL SHORT: Once
we get the date.

00:53:58.450 --> 00:54:00.490
MICHAEL AMES: But
that's not how I do NAA.

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:01.840
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE] We're
doing a simplified version.

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.350
MICHAEL AMES: Right, right.

00:54:02.350 --> 00:54:02.860
No, no, no.

00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:04.527
So there's two things
that you could do.

00:54:04.527 --> 00:54:06.400
One of the things
you could do is

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.470
you take all those
nuclear parameters

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.110
and you calculate it just
from the peak height.

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:15.130
The other way that
everybody who does NAA--

00:54:15.130 --> 00:54:17.020
almost everybody who does NAA--

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:18.790
is you run a standard material.

00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:21.460
Any of you guys chemists
at any point in your life?

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:23.800
You all took some
chemistry at some point?

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.370
OK.

00:54:24.370 --> 00:54:28.180
So you've run a standard,
which means a material

00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:31.660
that how much tungsten is in
it or how much a whole mess

00:54:31.660 --> 00:54:33.220
of other things are.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.150
So I run a bunch of
different standards.

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:38.320
So along with this
piece of quartz,

00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:43.660
I ran a standard, irradiated
it at the same time.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:46.570
I'll count the quartz and
then I'll count the standard.

00:54:46.570 --> 00:54:48.670
And by comparing
the peak heights

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:50.830
and doing all the decay
corrections and the weight

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:53.350
corrections, then I
calculate how much

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:55.310
tungsten is in my sample.

00:54:55.310 --> 00:54:59.560
So I don't actually use the
cross sections, or the flux,

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:04.630
or any of that other stuff-- all
of those parameters disappear.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:08.530
Notably, the detector efficiency
disappears out of the equation,

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:11.500
because that's the
parameter that you usually

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.290
have the funniest idea about.

00:55:14.290 --> 00:55:16.240
And so you reduce
the uncertainty

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:20.620
in your concentration by doing
this sort of comparative method

00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.710
with a standard.

00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.430
That all make sense?

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.930
OK.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:28.030
So when we run shorts,
I guess, in a month,

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:30.760
we'll take whatever
your samples are.

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.710
I've had feedback
about, oh, God,

00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:35.320
you don't want to run
that many samples.

00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.320
But we'll figure out how
many samples we'll run.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.778
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
one per person.

00:55:38.778 --> 00:55:39.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:40.770
MICHAEL AMES: That's
a lot of shorts.

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:41.620
MICHAEL SHORT: In pairs, right?

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:42.500
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah.

00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:47.050
So I'll show you how
the shorts get run.

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:51.760
So when we run your shorts,
we'll run your samples

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:54.220
and we'll run
standards, and then

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:55.840
you can do the
comparative method.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.418
Or, if you feel like it,
you can do the other method,

00:55:58.418 --> 00:55:59.585
depending on what exercise--

00:55:59.585 --> 00:56:00.590
MICHAEL SHORT: The other method.

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:02.540
MICHAEL AMES: You're going
to do the other method.

00:56:02.540 --> 00:56:04.170
You don't want to do
the standard method?

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:05.378
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, no, no no.

00:56:05.378 --> 00:56:07.850
We're drilling comprehension,
not [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:09.822
MICHAEL AMES: Not practical?

00:56:09.822 --> 00:56:10.322
Oh.

00:56:10.322 --> 00:56:12.863
MICHAEL SHORT: What happens
if the computer break down?

00:56:12.863 --> 00:56:14.780
MICHAEL AMES: Well, if
the computer goes down,

00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:16.320
you can't get any data anyway.

00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:17.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:20.370
MICHAEL AMES: I can do the
comparative one on an envelope.

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:24.260
Anyway-- well, we'll run
standards or not, depending

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:27.560
on how you guys are feeling.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:28.380
So that's that.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:28.880
Oh, right.

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.640
Let's count your bananas.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.140
So this is detector 2.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:37.480
We did an energy
calibration earlier today.

00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:41.180
So actually, I've got a couple
of little button sources.

00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:42.740
Have you seen the
button sources?

00:56:42.740 --> 00:56:43.310
Yeah.

00:56:43.310 --> 00:56:47.780
So that's just a couple of
cobalt 60 lines and a cesium

00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:50.270
137 line down in here.

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:51.770
And I know where
those energies are,

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:54.440
so that just gets used to
calibrate the detectors.

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.270
MICHAEL SHORT: We were playing
around one of those cobalt 60

00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:57.260
buttons today in class.

00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:57.830
MICHAEL AMES: There you go.

00:56:57.830 --> 00:56:59.420
MICHAEL SHORT: We mentioned the
two gammas per disintegration,

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:00.590
and there they are.

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:01.798
MICHAEL AMES: There they are.

00:57:01.798 --> 00:57:04.280
They're kind of small there
because my buttons are probably

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.120
30 years old.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.868
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, I
got some fresh ones.

00:57:06.868 --> 00:57:07.660
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah.

00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.550
So anyway, we cleared that out.

00:57:10.550 --> 00:57:13.130
And we just hit Start.

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:17.240
And we're not going to
see anything a while.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:18.060
Where are we?

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.490
Oh here.

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:27.080
14-- anyway, your banana
peak will end up out in here.

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:29.940
So it'll take a while.

00:57:29.940 --> 00:57:33.990
We're going to let this
count until Tuesday.

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:35.380
Because, why not?

00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.380
And I don't feel like
coming in over the weekend

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.880
and turning it off.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.580
So yeah.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:45.390
So this is just picking up
all the gammas coming out

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:47.623
of the bananas, and
everything else that

00:57:47.623 --> 00:57:49.290
happens to get through
the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:53.780
and all the contamination
on the inside of that.

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:54.840
And we just let it count.

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:58.020
And then you guys can
calculate how much

00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:02.160
potassium 40 is in your ashes.

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.652
You'll need to do the
background subtraction.

00:58:05.652 --> 00:58:06.360
I will give you--

00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.410
MICHAEL SHORT: Do you
have background spectra?

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:08.520
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah.

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.150
We collect background
spectra once a month or so.

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.040
So I'll give you a
background spectra.

00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:18.330
I will provide the efficiency
for this geometry, which

00:58:18.330 --> 00:58:23.730
is pretty poorly
defined, because I've

00:58:23.730 --> 00:58:25.080
got a program that'll do that.

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.450
And I can't give
you the program,

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:30.840
and it's a pain in the
neck to run anyway.

00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:34.020
If we've got a really
well-defined geometry that's

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:38.310
not a big bag, usually I try to
count sort of point sources--

00:58:38.310 --> 00:58:41.190
so I've got an efficiency
standard that I

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:44.550
can use that I know what
the disintegrations in that

00:58:44.550 --> 00:58:46.290
are at a lot of
energies, and I use

00:58:46.290 --> 00:58:48.870
that to do an efficiency
calibration, usually.

00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:53.070
But I don't have an efficiency
standard that's that big.

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:56.280
It's just a point source.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:58.680
And I think that's
the practical NAA.

00:58:58.680 --> 00:59:01.945
From this end, did
that all makes sense?

00:59:01.945 --> 00:59:03.570
I want you guys to
nod, not him to nod.

00:59:03.570 --> 00:59:03.990
Yeah.

00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.610
MICHAEL SHORT: Do you guys
have any questions for Mike

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:05.795
on what you've just heard?

00:59:05.795 --> 00:59:08.170
Well-timed, because we were
just talking about this stuff

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:08.890
all week.

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:09.890
MICHAEL AMES: Good deal.

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:15.600
For neutron activation, that's
kind of a real common part

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:16.220
of the chart.

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:19.350
So there's the manganese,
iron, cobalt, nickel.

00:59:19.350 --> 00:59:21.630
One of the things--

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:25.260
what you'd like, usually
when you're doing NAA,

00:59:25.260 --> 00:59:29.157
is you want a nice
thermal neutron spectrum.

00:59:29.157 --> 00:59:30.990
You know what thermal
neutron spectra means?

00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:34.170
Real slow neutrons.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:38.100
And they'll just give you
sort of an n gamma reaction.

00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:41.970
So on that chart,
iron 58 to iron 59,

00:59:41.970 --> 00:59:46.860
that's a nice n gamma reaction.

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:50.490
And that's the one I
use to analyze for iron.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:52.050
If you're near the
reactor, you're

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:55.830
also getting some
fast neutrons, which

00:59:55.830 --> 00:59:58.810
can give you an n p reaction.

00:59:58.810 --> 01:00:01.320
So if you're looking
on the chart there,

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.680
cobalt 59, if you
get an n p reaction,

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.690
will also make the iron 59.

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:10.895
And that's a pain in the neck,
because if you've got iron,

01:00:10.895 --> 01:00:13.020
you've always got a little
cobalt floating around--

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.760
you maybe need to
do a correction.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.580
So in practical terms,
when you're running NAA,

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:22.530
you really want to avoid having
all these fast reactions.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.000
There's usually an
energy threshold

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.594
for the fast reactions,
like 1 meV or so.

01:00:27.594 --> 01:00:29.802
MICHAEL SHORT: Sound familiar
from the cube equation?

01:00:29.802 --> 01:00:30.760
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, OK.

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:31.560
Right.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.895
The place where we do the
irradiations is very thermal.

01:00:34.895 --> 01:00:37.380
It's got a very
low, fast spectrum.

01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:40.290
So I don't usually have
to worry about that.

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:41.790
There's a couple
of times I actually

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:44.370
use the fast n p reaction.

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:47.790
If I want to measure nickel,
you can see nickel 58,

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:51.600
an n p reaction
will get cobalt 58.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:56.100
And since there's
not a good reaction n

01:00:56.100 --> 01:01:01.350
gamma from cobalt 57, cobalt
57 isn't around usually.

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:05.310
So that's how I measure
nickel, using n p reaction.

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:08.040
And I need to put the
rabbits into where I've

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.870
got a fast flux in the reactor.

01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:13.080
Which, well, they've got a
couple of spots for that.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.760
I try not to have
to measure nickel,

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.010
because it's pain in the neck.

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.760
But sometimes people
want to know nickel.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.750
And we talked a
little about what

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:24.428
we've run in here
for types of samples.

01:01:24.428 --> 01:01:26.220
MICHAEL SHORT: Well,
why don't you tell us?

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.480
MICHAEL AMES: OK, OK.

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:34.350
So back 15, 20, 25
years ago, we did

01:01:34.350 --> 01:01:38.820
a ton of environmental
samples in this lab.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:42.910
We had a whole three grad
students, myself included,

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:49.440
who did atmospheric particulate
matter, rain water, snow,

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.570
we even did some fog
collection, which

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:57.850
is kind of fun, ice cores, which
are old particulate deposition.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.360
And it was all for trace
elements in those kind

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.580
of environmental samples--

01:02:02.580 --> 01:02:05.460
also lake sediments.

01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:09.510
Other analytical methods
have gotten a lot better,

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:11.460
and so they've kind
of caught up to NAA,

01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:13.800
and you don't need a
reactor to run those.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:15.930
So the environmental
side of this

01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:17.580
has kind of quieted down a lot.

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:20.890
But it's still useful
for a bunch of things.

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:24.240
And so I do some work here now.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.370
I also work in the NCORE group.

01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:30.850
So that's a lot of my time,
rather than just this lab.

01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:38.590
Practical things-- let's go take
a look at a couple other labs.

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:39.580
You're not on wheels?

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.190
You don't have a steady cam?

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.630
MICHAEL SHORT: I got a question.

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.880
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.570
You've got a question.

01:02:43.570 --> 01:02:43.900
MICHAEL SHORT: What's the
weirdest thing you've ever

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.700
been asked to count?

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.880
MICHAEL AMES: The weirdest
thing I've been asked to count?

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:51.040
That's already activated, or?

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.290
MICHAEL SHORT: At all.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:54.160
MICHAEL AMES: OK.

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:59.140
I don't know-- brain tissue.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:05.200
Fish samples that we actually
did the fresh fish samples.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.680
And you want to kind
of homogenize those.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.290
And we had this kind
of titanium blender--

01:03:11.290 --> 01:03:12.880
you remember the Bass-O-Matic?

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.420
We had this titanium blender
that we dropped the fish in,

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:18.940
and you completely
homogenized the fish,

01:03:18.940 --> 01:03:21.040
and then you took a
little sample of it,

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.135
and freeze dried it, and
then analyzed it for mercury.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.987
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:26.987 --> 01:03:28.070
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, right.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:31.810
Because, I mean guys saw, the
rabbits are only this big,

01:03:31.810 --> 01:03:34.480
and the samples I want
are only that big.

01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:38.210
And so to get a
representative fish,

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:41.320
you want to kind of
make a fish smoothie

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.500
and then take a
sample out of that.

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.530
We did have a guy who
came to me and was

01:03:47.530 --> 01:03:51.610
promising we were going to
do this giant study using

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:56.710
fingernails and toenails
for nutritional analysis.

01:03:56.710 --> 01:04:01.570
He was working with a group
that looks at zinc deficiencies,

01:04:01.570 --> 01:04:04.510
and fingernails and
toenails will give you

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.250
a good record of
how much zinc you've

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:09.100
had over the last
week, or month,

01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:12.400
or whatever-- depend
where you cut the nails.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:15.310
And so I was going to
get a couple of hundred

01:04:15.310 --> 01:04:19.420
African children's toenails.

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.350
That didn't happen.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:23.410
But I did analyze
my own toenails.

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:25.340
Well, if you went
to somebody who

01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:28.960
was a little suspicious of
you, asking for toenails

01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:32.530
is a lot easier than
asking for a blood sample.

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:37.510
Because people would give up
toenails-- it's not a big deal.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.700
Have you ever seen the
movie or read the book

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:43.190
Civil Action, about the
superfund site in Woburn.

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:46.540
It was a big old superfund
site, and Woburn had arsenic

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.990
and chromium contamination.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.090
There used to be a lab--

01:04:52.090 --> 01:04:54.820
I forget which building it was
in-- that did a ton of research

01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:55.690
there.

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:58.960
One of the things we
did in this lab was we

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:05.020
collected baby hair samples
from people's scrapbooks.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:10.660
So we had baby hair
going back 50-60 years--

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:14.340
dated, because everybody
knew how old their kid was--

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:18.580
and we analyzed the hair samples
for arsenic and chromium,

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.910
and then we plotted
out where they were,

01:05:21.910 --> 01:05:24.290
when the sample was taken,
and how close they were

01:05:24.290 --> 01:05:27.220
to some contaminated wells.

01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:30.370
And because we did a
fairly short of radiation,

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.380
after a while the
activities died down

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.910
and we gave the samples back.

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:39.040
And we found that it didn't
correlate with the well

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.010
water or the time when
the contamination was

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:45.340
the worst, which made
people happy in retrospect,

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:48.100
that the contamination
from that area

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.830
didn't get into the well water.

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:54.040
That was in the mid-90s or so.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.870
Anyway, that was
one of my samples.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:58.870
And the hair is a pain
in the neck to work with.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:01.510
So I hope none of you
give me hair samples.

01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:03.150
I won't run them.

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:08.430
So let's go down
the hall, this way.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:10.246
You all got to follow.

01:06:10.246 --> 01:06:14.960
And so this is
just a fine powder.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.470
And it's fly ash from a
coal-fired power plant.

01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:23.210
Fly ash means the ash that goes
up the smokestack, as opposed

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:25.820
to bottom ash which
is what falls down.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:31.730
And so, they collect a whole
hundreds of kilograms of fly

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:35.990
ash, just homogenize it,
sieve it, send it out

01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:39.510
to a lot of labs to analyze--

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.870
NIST is really good at this--

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:42.920
take all the data.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:48.710
And so this ash is characterized
for about 20 elements or so.

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:51.400
So when I run my
samples, if I were

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.540
to run your samples
with standards,

01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:58.100
I'd run a little bit of
this, 5, 6, 7 milligrams.

01:06:58.100 --> 01:07:01.250
And I know what the
concentrations are in this.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:04.220
And so that's how I do
the comparative method.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:06.155
And so I got this.

01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:07.280
And they all look the same.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.540
And this is some soil from
Montana next to a mine,

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:15.350
so it's nicely contaminated
with some metals.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:20.040
This is my IAEA mercury
and hair standard.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.650
But again, it's just
a little powder.

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:24.440
And this is kind of what
everybody uses for standards.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.487
And you just kind of have
a whole collection of them.

01:07:27.487 --> 01:07:29.570
And depending on what
elements you're looking for,

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:34.130
you try to mix and
match them so you

01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:35.600
cover what you
want without having

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.652
to run five or six of them.

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:42.400
This is my hot lab,
or one of my hot labs.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.600
You guys, last week,
or whatever it was,

01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:46.640
I came by-- so
this is the rabbit.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.080
Those you who
weren't there, these

01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:51.980
are called rabbits because
it's the little thing that runs

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:53.870
through the pneumatic tube.

01:07:53.870 --> 01:07:56.220
You guys are doing
[INAUDIBLE] later today?

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:56.720
Yeah.

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.428
When you're sitting
at the control panel,

01:07:58.428 --> 01:08:00.350
there's a button, I
think it's to the left,

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:02.450
and it says insert rabbit.

01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:05.780
And that's what this
is referring to.

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.670
For longer radiations
there's a spot

01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:11.090
in the basement in the reactor
where they can get these,

01:08:11.090 --> 01:08:14.660
and they send them into
the irradiation location.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:16.399
For short
irradiations, like what

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:18.149
you guys are going to
be doing in a month,

01:08:18.149 --> 01:08:20.810
I send them in from here.

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:24.700
That's OK-- I just don't
want to bump into that thing.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.970
So this is one end of
the pneumatic system.

01:08:26.970 --> 01:08:30.670
And so I can put a couple
of samples in here.

01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:34.430
I stick it in that little tube
there, call the control room

01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:37.100
and say, OK, turn
a bunch of knobs,

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.580
and switches, and whatnot.

01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:42.470
And it goes schwoonk,
and in about 15 seconds

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:44.359
it's next to the
reactor to the core

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.060
of the reactor in the graphite.

01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.410
I usually run shorts.

01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:51.800
I'll usually irradiate
for about 10 minutes.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:55.109
We usually let the sample sit in
the reactor for a little while.

01:08:55.109 --> 01:08:58.189
So the very short half-life
stuff decays away,

01:08:58.189 --> 01:09:00.050
and then it comes back out here.

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:02.029
And the thing just kind
of shoots out there

01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:04.990
and bounces into here.

01:09:04.990 --> 01:09:08.569
And then pop open the
rabbit, and in that hood,

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:10.220
pull the samples out.

01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:14.430
I usually try to
repackage the samples.

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.399
So this is partly why I
asked for stuff that's

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:19.939
one or two good solid pieces.

01:09:19.939 --> 01:09:23.450
Because then I can take it out
of whatever it was irradiated,

01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:27.170
put it in a clean bag
or vial, and that way we

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:31.655
don't have to do a blank
subtraction for the sample.

01:09:31.655 --> 01:09:33.960
Does that make sense?

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:36.620
Because, otherwise, if
I take a little vial,

01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.750
irradiate it, and
then count it, I'll

01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:43.279
also have whatever elements
are in the vial on the thing.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:47.270
For when I'm running standards--
and this is when if we're not

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.540
running standards you don't
have to worry about this--

01:09:49.540 --> 01:09:53.420
that powdered standard stuff,
I never get that out of a bag.

01:09:53.420 --> 01:09:55.160
Because you'd never
get all of it out,

01:09:55.160 --> 01:09:58.880
and I'd have contamination
everywhere if I started cutting

01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.990
open those bags.

01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:03.350
So I do have to do a bag
correction for those.

01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:05.480
So when I do when
an irradiation,

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.145
I always irradiate
a few empty bags,

01:10:08.145 --> 01:10:09.770
and then you do a
correction for those.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:13.040
Because the bags have got
aluminum, and antimony,

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.650
and a bunch of things in them.

01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:17.510
And so then I take
a couple of samples,

01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:19.460
I throw them in a lead pig--

01:10:19.460 --> 01:10:21.770
so I've got a whole bunch
of these floating around--

01:10:21.770 --> 01:10:25.380
and I run it down the hall,
and throw it on a detector,

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.210
and we count it.

01:10:26.210 --> 01:10:30.260
When we're doing shorts,
I'll irradiate two samples

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:32.402
at a time, because I
have two detectors.

01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:33.860
When I used to have
four detectors,

01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:35.480
I ran for samples at a time.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:40.370
So you irradiate it,
repackage it, count it.

01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:43.880
While those pair of
samples are counting,

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.730
you come down here, you
irradiate the next two,

01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:50.090
so that you're
just kind of always

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:53.150
irradiating and counting.

01:10:53.150 --> 01:10:56.390
I usually do a 10-minute
irradiation for shorts.

01:10:56.390 --> 01:11:00.740
I'll do a fairly quick
count-- five minutes-- right

01:11:00.740 --> 01:11:02.690
after I get the
sample down there,

01:11:02.690 --> 01:11:06.050
and that's looking for
stuff with half-lifes

01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:07.640
under 10 minutes.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.370
The shortest half-life I
look for is for aluminum.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:12.317
It's 2 and 1/4 minutes.

01:11:12.317 --> 01:11:14.400
But things usually have a
lot of aluminum in them,

01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:18.410
so I see aluminum pretty well.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:20.030
For shorts, I'll
count all the way up

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:25.340
to about sodium, which is
almost 15 hour half-life.

01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:28.040
Longer stuff, I'll do a
longer irradiation to count.

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.200
There's a little overlap
on my shorts and longs.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.300
That helps me do QA on things.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.268
And if I run two standards,
I'll check the concentrations

01:11:36.268 --> 01:11:37.560
from one standard to the other.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.360
That's another little QA thing.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.902
What else we got?

01:11:42.902 --> 01:11:43.910
MICHAEL SHORT: What
question do you guys have?

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:44.305
MICHAEL AMES: Questions.

01:11:44.305 --> 01:11:46.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Now that
you know how this done.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:47.660
MICHAEL AMES: It's
pretty straightforward.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:48.464
MICHAEL SHORT:
What sort of things

01:11:48.464 --> 01:11:49.797
are you going to be bringing in?

01:11:49.797 --> 01:11:51.357
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah,
what do we got?

01:11:51.357 --> 01:11:55.062
AUDIENCE: Probably middle
Bronze age pottery shirts.

01:11:55.062 --> 01:11:55.770
MICHAEL AMES: Oh.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:56.590
Yeah, yeah.

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:57.380
OK.

01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.930
There is a lot of
archeology that NAA

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:04.100
got used for that a lot.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:06.620
I don't think we
ever did it here.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:10.530
Fred Frey, who's a professor,
retired now, from EAPs--

01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:12.350
Earth, Atmospheric,
and Planetary--

01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:14.390
he did a lot of
geological samples.

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:18.920
And I forget where it was that
they did all the archeology.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.540
One of the things
NAA is really good

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.930
for is rare earth
elements, which

01:12:23.930 --> 01:12:27.350
are hard to measure
by other methods.

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:29.480
I can get very low
limits on that.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:34.040
And by picking out various
rare earths and the ratios,

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.821
it can help identify where
things are from in the world.

01:12:36.821 --> 01:12:37.654
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

01:12:37.654 --> 01:12:39.720
AUDIENCE: Can I use
a bird as a sample?

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.200
MICHAEL AMES: If you give me
a little, tiny piece of it.

01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:42.742
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:12:42.742 --> 01:12:44.075
MICHAEL AMES: I mean, you know--

01:12:44.075 --> 01:12:44.960
I

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.585
AUDIENCE: Like, how
small [INAUDIBLE]??

01:12:46.585 --> 01:12:48.377
MICHAEL AMES: Well,
see, that's the rabbit.

01:12:48.377 --> 01:12:50.038
So it's definitely
got to fit in there.

01:12:50.038 --> 01:12:50.580
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:52.710
MICHAEL AMES: The
thing I really like--

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:54.150
excuse me, where's my vials?

01:12:57.330 --> 01:12:59.760
I used to have some
smaller ones up here.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:04.350
But that should definitely
fit in one of those.

01:13:04.350 --> 01:13:05.437
Like, see that guy.

01:13:05.437 --> 01:13:06.473
AUDIENCE: OK

01:13:06.473 --> 01:13:07.890
MICHAEL AMES: My
usual description

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:10.410
of what size sample
I like is if it's

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:13.830
a piece that you would pick
up with a pair of tweezers.

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:16.140
So not too small to pick up--

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.340
to be able to find.

01:13:17.340 --> 01:13:19.875
So no powders.

01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:21.750
And you could maybe get
it with your fingers.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:26.130
But 20 milligrams, 50
milligrams, 100 milligrams

01:13:26.130 --> 01:13:28.520
is just in the right ballpark.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.020
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:33.520
MICHAEL SHORT: What else are
you guys thinking of bringing?

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:35.830
MICHAEL AMES: Doesn't matter.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:39.070
We'll look at what
comes in, and--

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:40.930
yeah, I might veto
some things or not.

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:42.460
But we'll see.

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:43.442
We'll see what we got.

01:13:43.442 --> 01:13:44.858
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

01:13:44.858 --> 01:13:47.155
AUDIENCE: What are
those little bricks for?

01:13:47.155 --> 01:13:49.030
MICHAEL AMES: Well, we
got bricks everywhere.

01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:52.660
So when I get the
sample out of there,

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:54.640
I do the repackaging in here.

01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:57.700
And so this is just
shielding between the samples

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.400
I'm working on and myself.

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:01.960
I don't have my
dosimeter on now,

01:14:01.960 --> 01:14:05.350
but I usually have got the
symmetry and a ring badge.

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:07.120
And then it kind
of comes over here,

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:09.610
and this is where
the heat sealer is.

01:14:09.610 --> 01:14:12.950
So I can heat seal it here, and
then I'll have a pig over here.

01:14:12.950 --> 01:14:14.950
MICHAEL SHORT: They're
just painted lead bricks?

01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:16.390
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah, these
are just painted lead bricks.

01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:19.130
And you know, these have
been here longer than I have.

01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:22.210
And sometimes things
just are somewhere,

01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.350
and you never move them.

01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:26.140
These, I think, are
older than me too.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:30.580
This lab has been doing NAA
since the '70s, I think.

01:14:33.744 --> 01:14:34.715
Anybody else?

01:14:34.715 --> 01:14:36.090
AUDIENCE: Is there
a single brick

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:38.940
that I could just hold
to see how heavy it is?

01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:40.560
MICHAEL AMES: The
full size bricks--

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:43.770
like, that size, 2 inches,
by 4 inches, by 8 inches,

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:46.380
weighs about 25 pounds.

01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.230
There's usually a bunch
of them floating around.

01:14:49.230 --> 01:14:52.530
Here, you want this game?

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:55.627
That one's not quite full size.

01:14:55.627 --> 01:14:56.210
AUDIENCE: Wow.

01:14:56.210 --> 01:14:57.390
That's pretty heavy.

01:14:57.390 --> 01:14:58.030
MICHAEL AMES: They're heavy.

01:14:58.030 --> 01:14:58.712
They're lead.

01:14:58.712 --> 01:14:59.920
Anybody else want to toss it?

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.855
No, OK.

01:15:00.855 --> 01:15:04.740
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.840
When people ask me--

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.220
because I work in the
reactor, as well-- they say,

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.012
is there anything
dangerous in the reactor?

01:15:11.012 --> 01:15:14.900
The dangerous thing is dropping
lead bricks on your feet.

01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.770
So I've got steel toast.

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:19.855
If I miss the toe, I'd
probably break my--

01:15:19.855 --> 01:15:21.620
I don't want to think about it.

01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:24.150
And they move much bigger
things in the reactor.

01:15:24.150 --> 01:15:25.740
Have you toured the reactor yet?

01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:27.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
MICHAEL AMES: So there's
that giant crane there,

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.713
and they move five-ton
pieces a shielding.

01:15:31.713 --> 01:15:33.630
And that's the other
dangerous thing in there,

01:15:33.630 --> 01:15:35.400
dropping really big things.

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.140
We've never dropped
anything that big.

01:15:39.663 --> 01:15:42.080
I think somebody dropped a
steel plate on their foot once.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.626
That was about the worst of it.

01:15:43.626 --> 01:15:45.530
[LAUGHTER]

01:15:45.530 --> 01:15:48.292
You know, like, four-foot,
half-inch steel-- boom.

01:15:48.292 --> 01:15:50.250
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
what happened to my foot.

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.042
MICHAEL AMES: Yeah.

01:15:51.042 --> 01:15:51.990
OK, good.

01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:53.790
And people trip and
fall off ladders.

01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:55.800
And it's the usual
industrial accidents.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.347
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
cut off your toe.

01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:00.180
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:01.310
AUDIENCE: Well, my
toes are still here.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.540
MICHAEL AMES: Good.

01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.060
Yeah.

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.850
I mean, I've broken
a few, but not here.

01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:05.850
MICHAEL SHORT: So, cool.

01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:06.680
Thanks a ton, Mike.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.490
MICHAEL AMES: Sure.

01:16:07.490 --> 01:16:09.500
And I'll see you guys
in a month or something

01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.860
and have fun
running the reactor.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.230
FRANK WARMSLEY: Well,
good day, folks.

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:18.830
You guys are here to do an
experiment on the reactor.

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:20.220
It's in two parts.

01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:22.305
The first part is
raising reactor power.

01:16:25.630 --> 01:16:28.620
The first is raising
reactor power

01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:32.950
using a low worth absorber
called a regulating rod.

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:35.490
And then the second part will
be lowering reactor power

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.410
using a high worth absorber.

01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:40.620
And the high worth absorber,
things will moved much faster.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.680
And we don't want
to run into a chance

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.760
if you accidentally
going too high,

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.050
so that's why we use a low
worth absorber on the way up

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:51.900
and a high worth
absorber on the way down.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.970
And I just want to
show you the controls.

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:56.160
With me today is Tim.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.260
To actually do
this experiment, we

01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.900
need two licensed
people in here,

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:03.510
one at least has a
senior reactor operator.

01:17:03.510 --> 01:17:05.370
Both Tim and I are
both senior licenses,

01:17:05.370 --> 01:17:07.050
so we have that covered.

01:17:07.050 --> 01:17:09.240
The only way you can actually
do these manipulations

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:11.870
are if you're in my
training program--

01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:14.340
I'm the training supervisor
for the facility--

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:18.360
or you're in a program that
needs you to actually operate

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.770
the reactor.

01:17:19.770 --> 01:17:24.540
And the program you guys
are in fits that definition.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.840
So I just want to show you some
of the controls of the reactor.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:30.630
First, we have our
shim blade controller.

01:17:30.630 --> 01:17:36.600
This basically moves one of
six shim blades at a time.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.790
The one that's selected
has a slide on it.

01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:41.940
And we can change which one's
selected with the shim blade

01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.730
selector switch.

01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:46.710
This switch here is
a regulating rod.

01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:50.750
This one will allow you to move
the regulating rod up and down.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:52.440
Our blades our fixed
speed, meaning they

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:58.800
can only move at the exact
same rate at all times.

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.890
Moving the shim blade
in an upward direction

01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.920
or the regulating rod
in upwards direction,

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:07.680
take an underhand
grip and pull up

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:11.100
or twist upwards until it stops.

01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.890
Moving it just a little
bit doesn't move anything.

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:16.440
You have to move all
the way until it stops,

01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:20.310
and then the absorber will
move in the outward direction.

01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:23.220
If you want the blade
to stop just release it.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:25.950
It's spring-loaded and will go
back to the neutral position

01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:27.360
and stop moving.

01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.030
If you want to drive something
in the inward position,

01:18:30.030 --> 01:18:33.480
take an overhand grip
and twist downwards,

01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:35.220
and that will drive
the absorber in.

01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.990
Once again, let go.

01:18:36.990 --> 01:18:40.800
It'll snap back up and stop
the motion of the blade

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.890
or the regulating rod.

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:46.770
The experiment we're doing is
basically change reactor power

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.810
by half a megawatt.

01:18:48.810 --> 01:18:51.930
And we're currently
at 500 kilowatts

01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:55.530
we're going bring the
reactor up to 1 megawatt

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:59.770
and then bring it back
down to 500 kilowatts.

01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:03.030
So before we can do this, you
have to log into our log book

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.790
as a trainee on console.

01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:08.310
We'll show you the proper
way to make the entries.

01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:12.180
As you make those entries,
you'll go ahead and then

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:15.840
do the actual movement itself.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:20.040
Sp the first one is going to
be using a regular rod to move

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.870
the reactor power up.

01:19:21.870 --> 01:19:23.520
What's the reactor power?

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:25.860
We have about nine
different instruments

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:28.410
that tell us what the reactor
power is at all times.

01:19:28.410 --> 01:19:30.660
But the ones we're going to
be paying attention to are

01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:32.730
channel seven 7 and channel 9.

01:19:32.730 --> 01:19:35.490
These two channels are what
we used to basically tell us

01:19:35.490 --> 01:19:36.960
what the wrecked power is.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:41.580
Channel 7 is what we control
our automatic control at.

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.620
If you watch the
regulating rod, you'll

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:46.890
see it move up and
down on its own.

01:19:46.890 --> 01:19:49.710
That's because
it's changing power

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:52.540
based on what it sees
channel 7 is doing.

01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.650
So if channel 7 sees that the
power level's going too low,

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:58.290
it'll cause the regulating
rod to drive outwards

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:00.000
to increase the
amount of neutrons

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.760
making the reactor power go up.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.760
Channel 9 is a
linear power channel,

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.240
and it basically tells us
what the power level is based

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:11.640
on a chart that we create.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.760
So it's not showing you
megawatts, or kilowatts,

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:17.670
or anything like that, it's
showing you a current coming

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:18.390
from a chamber.

01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:20.220
And that current
is then converted

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:23.350
into megawatts and so forth.

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:28.620
So right now, we're at 500
kilowatts, 8.5 microamps,

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.190
on this channel.

01:20:30.190 --> 01:20:33.945
And that's 8.5 microamps
equals 550 kilowatts.

01:20:33.945 --> 01:20:35.820
You're going to be
bringing a record up to 1.

01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:42.030
Megawatt and since it's linear,
it'll be double that-- so 17.1.

01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:44.700
Now, you want to be careful
when you raise reactor power.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:46.740
So when you start to
add power to the reactor

01:20:46.740 --> 01:20:51.300
by raising a regulating rod, you
don't want to keep raising it

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.700
until you reach your
value, because you

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.410
have to actually stop the
power increase as well.

01:20:56.410 --> 01:20:59.010
So we have two rules
that we have to follow--

01:20:59.010 --> 01:21:03.210
one, at the power level
we're at, we have period--

01:21:03.210 --> 01:21:04.710
the reactor period.

01:21:04.710 --> 01:21:06.210
The reactor period
is amount of time

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:08.010
it takes reactor
power to increase.

01:21:08.010 --> 01:21:09.600
At the power level
we're at, we're

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:13.500
not allowed to go shorter
than a 100-second period.

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:16.770
So here is one of
three periods meters--

01:21:16.770 --> 01:21:21.000
one here, one here, which
is selectable between two

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.078
different meters.

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.870
So as you're pulling
up the regulating rod,

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.400
one of the things
you have to watch

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.520
is to make sure that the reactor
period doesn't go shorter

01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.080
than a 100-second period.

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.390
If it does, you have
to stop pulling blades.

01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:35.220
The other thing we
have to watch for

01:21:35.220 --> 01:21:38.970
is to make sure that the
power level, channel 9,

01:21:38.970 --> 01:21:41.070
doesn't exceed where
you're going to.

01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:43.110
Not only not exceed,
but we also want

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:46.740
to make sure that you can
actually control the reactor.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.870
It's called
feasibility of control.

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:51.420
And what that means is
when you get to about 80%

01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:52.962
of the power level
you're going to--

01:21:52.962 --> 01:21:54.420
since we're going
up to 1 megawatt,

01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:56.340
that's about 800 kilowatts--

01:21:56.340 --> 01:22:00.000
you want to be able to drive
the absorber in and hold

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.050
the absorber in.

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:03.600
You'll drive the
regulating rod inwards.

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.430
And watch that
channel nine value.

01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:09.480
It'll slow until it actually
starts to go down again.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.592
Once it reaches that value
and you see it going down,

01:22:12.592 --> 01:22:14.550
you now know that you
could control the reactor

01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:16.750
and keep it from going away--

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:19.080
rack power increasing
continuously.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:21.120
So what we're going
to do is have you

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.240
when you reach 80% of the
power level you're going to,

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.570
which happens to
be 800 kilowatts,

01:22:27.570 --> 01:22:30.540
you're going to start increasing
or lengthening the period

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:34.500
by driving the absorber
back in the regulating rod.

01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:36.900
And you'll keep holding it
in until you see the number

01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:40.275
not only stop increasing, but
actually go down a little bit.

01:22:40.275 --> 01:22:42.150
As soon as you see it
going down a little bit

01:22:42.150 --> 01:22:44.315
and go of the
regulating rod, You

01:22:44.315 --> 01:22:45.940
haven't stopped the
power at this time,

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:50.390
you've just decreased
how fast it's going up.

01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:52.160
And then the power
level will sill go up,

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:55.410
but a much slower rate
than it was before.

01:22:55.410 --> 01:22:58.740
And once it reaches the power
level you want to stop at,

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.700
the 1 megawatt, keep driving
the regulating rod in

01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.160
to hold it at that power level.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.080
Once you're at that
power level, you're

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.900
going to make an entry
in a log book that

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:10.580
basically says you
made it to the power

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:12.680
level you're going to.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.560
And then we'll go down in power.

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.660
So once again, you make
an entry in a log book

01:23:17.660 --> 01:23:21.140
that says I'm going to lower
ranked power to 500 kilowatts,

01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:23.350
and then this time
we'll use a shim blade.

01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:26.030
The shim blade is worth a lot
more than a regulating rod--

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:30.470
about 10 times the
regulating rod, so things

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:32.053
will happen much faster.

01:23:32.053 --> 01:23:33.470
So you'll be able
to drive this in

01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:36.920
and reactor power will change
much faster than before.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:39.410
Same thing-- as you get closer
to the power level you start

01:23:39.410 --> 01:23:41.930
at, the 500 kilowatts,
you don't want

01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:43.670
to undershoot and go too low.

01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:48.500
So right around 600 kilowatts
or so, start driving or shim

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:50.847
blade out to slow down
how quickly the power

01:23:50.847 --> 01:23:51.680
level is going down.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:57.710
And once you get back to the
place where you started it,

01:23:57.710 --> 01:24:00.650
we'll use a regulating
rod to fine tune it

01:24:00.650 --> 01:24:03.210
to keep the reactor power
where would want it to be.

01:24:03.210 --> 01:24:05.370
There'll be another
logbook entry,

01:24:05.370 --> 01:24:07.627
and your time on the
console will be completed.

01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:14.383
So with us today we actually
have two MIT students

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.050
who are actually in
my training program,

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:22.112
and they've actually done a lot
of these manipulations already.

01:24:22.112 --> 01:24:23.070
AUDIENCE: Ladies first.

01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.520
FRANK WARMSLEY: Sarah.

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.030
Let's go.

01:24:24.030 --> 01:24:24.947
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:24:24.947 --> 01:24:29.030
It's been so long
since I've done one.

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:31.450
FRANK WARMSLEY: I'll take that.

01:24:31.450 --> 01:24:35.020
So, normally, we sit and watch.

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.840
If, at any time, you don't feel
comfortable doing something,

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.940
let us know.

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.778
We'll ask you just to take
your hands off the console,

01:24:42.778 --> 01:24:44.320
and we'll take care
of doing whatever

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.110
is necessary to keep
the reactor safe.

01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:51.970
But be aware, we're
a factor of 10

01:24:51.970 --> 01:24:55.078
lower than where we would
automatically scram at so.

01:24:55.078 --> 01:24:56.620
So it would be very
difficult for you

01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:58.037
to get to someplace
where it would

01:24:58.037 --> 01:25:00.595
cause a problem without
us being able to stop it.

01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:08.920
I don't know if you want
to move or anything,

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:16.060
but the supervisor normally
sits kind of right in your way

01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:20.756
so that they can keep
eye on what's happening.

01:25:20.756 --> 01:25:23.182
AUDIENCE: Are we doing doing
any announcing for these?

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:29.130
FRANK WARMSLEY: You can go
ahead and make the announcement

01:25:29.130 --> 01:25:32.138
that we're starting
power manipulations,

01:25:32.138 --> 01:25:34.680
and then the last person will
make an announcement that we're

01:25:34.680 --> 01:25:36.898
done with power manipulations.

01:25:44.157 --> 01:25:45.865
AUDIENCE: Commencing
power manipulations.

01:25:45.865 --> 01:25:47.842
Commencing power manipulations.

01:25:54.770 --> 01:25:57.350
FRANK WARMSLEY: Right now,
the reactor is on autocontrol.

01:25:57.350 --> 01:25:58.820
And when we do
these manipulations,

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:02.290
the reactor operator is
going to take manual control.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:04.400
That'll cause an
alarm to come in.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.050
And this will only happen
for the first time.

01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:09.590
So one of the things she's
going to do after she

01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:10.833
makes her logbook entry--

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:12.250
AUDIENCE: Are we
filling this out?

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.167
FRANK WARMSLEY: No, we'll
do that at the end--

01:26:14.167 --> 01:26:16.760
is she'll take manual
control of the reactor,

01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.490
an alarm will come in on
console, and she'll answer it.

01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:21.698
And that should be the only
time you hear this alarm,

01:26:21.698 --> 01:26:23.780
because we'll leave
it on manual control

01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:28.332
until the final participant
has done their manipulations.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:31.769
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:26:31.769 --> 01:26:34.905
I hope to get to 1 megawatt
at 17.11 [INAUDIBLE]..

01:26:34.905 --> 01:26:35.697
FRANK WARMSLEY: OK.

01:26:40.116 --> 01:26:43.553
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:46.499 --> 01:26:51.876
[ELECTRONIC SOUND]

01:26:51.876 --> 01:26:53.459
FRANK WARMSLEY: Now,
she's pulling out

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:57.530
the red rod all the way.

01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:00.270
You see the red rod
number going up.

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:02.910
The period is getting shorter.

01:27:02.910 --> 01:27:04.560
It's no longer at infinity.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.780
It's getting closer
to 100 second.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:10.314
And channel 7 and channel
9 are increasing in value.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:23.120
Another way you can see
it is we have a display

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.260
on the front the operator.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:28.140
Those three
displays, two of them

01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:31.530
are just for evaluation only.

01:27:31.530 --> 01:27:34.950
We don't actually use those
to control the reactor.

01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:37.650
They're based on a system
that hasn't been approved yet.

01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:40.570
But we're testing them to
see how well they work.

01:27:40.570 --> 01:27:43.890
So you can see that the
power level on the far left

01:27:43.890 --> 01:27:45.498
is going up.

01:27:45.498 --> 01:27:47.790
The middle one is showing
what the actual power level--

01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:49.340
we started at 500 kilowatts.

01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.320
It's already up to 630
kilowatts and increasing.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.300
And the period that
was at infinity

01:27:54.300 --> 01:27:55.916
is now around 160 seconds.

01:28:11.852 --> 01:28:16.620
So she's watching, and she sees
the 800 kilowatt value here

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:20.350
on channel 7 or channel
9, and she's started

01:28:20.350 --> 01:28:22.320
to driving the regulating ride.

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:27.990
So she's slowing down how quick
the power increases going.

01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:31.170
And you see the
period lengthening.

01:28:31.170 --> 01:28:34.530
It's no longer at
150-160 seconds.

01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:37.440
It's going closer
to infinity again.

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.450
So she's proving that she
could stop the reactor

01:28:39.450 --> 01:28:42.860
power if she continued driving
in this regulating rod.

01:28:55.235 --> 01:28:56.918
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
back on auto?

01:28:56.918 --> 01:28:57.710
FRANK WARMSLEY: No.

01:29:06.867 --> 01:29:09.095
She's closing in
on the 1 megawatt.

01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:24.370
One of the things the note
is that when she started,

01:29:24.370 --> 01:29:27.610
the [INAUDIBLE] was
around 0300, 0310,

01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:29.710
and she's almost
right back to there.

01:29:29.710 --> 01:29:33.430
When you raise reactor power,
you basically open up a valve

01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:34.472
and let more neutrons in.

01:29:34.472 --> 01:29:36.597
And when you get to the
place where you want to be,

01:29:36.597 --> 01:29:38.350
you basically close
that valve again.

01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:43.100
So you basically add reactivity
and then stop that reactivity

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:46.330
addition by bringing the
absorbers back to about

01:29:46.330 --> 01:29:48.860
where they started from.

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:52.270
AUDIENCE: We're at 17.1

01:29:52.270 --> 01:29:53.770
FRANK WARMSLEY:
We're at 1 megawatt?

01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:54.935
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:29:54.935 --> 01:29:57.185
FRANK WARMSLEY: Go ahead and
make your log book entry.

01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:03.430
So once again, she
has experience.

01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:05.880
She's been doing startups
and power manipulations

01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:06.820
for a while.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:08.590
When the rest of
you sit down here,

01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:10.700
we'll guide you through those--

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:14.560
the log book entries that
she's making and so forth.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.045
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE].

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:41.285
FRANK WARMSLEY: 30.6.

01:30:41.285 --> 01:30:41.785
OK.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.220
AUDIENCE: Should [INAUDIBLE]?

01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:50.240
FRANK WARMSLEY: Yep.

01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:59.170
So one of the things that could
change the reactor is xenon.

01:30:59.170 --> 01:31:03.250
It's a poison that builds into
the reactor while we operate.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:05.260
Poison in that it
absorbs neutrons

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:06.820
not leading to fission.

01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:10.600
And it has two
ways of being made

01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:13.480
and two ways of
having it removed.

01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:18.040
One is direct from fission
and the other is decay.

01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:19.420
That's the way it's produced.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:25.290
The way it goes away is
basically absorbing a neutron

01:31:25.290 --> 01:31:27.550
and decaying to another isotope.

01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:31.032
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] half a
megawatt at 8.56 microamps.

01:31:31.032 --> 01:31:31.824
FRANK WARMSLEY: OK.

01:31:31.824 --> 01:31:33.260
AUDIENCE: Use the
same shim blade?

01:31:33.260 --> 01:31:36.390
FRANK WARMSLEY:
Yep, use blade 6.

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:40.380
And what happens is when
we lower reactor power,

01:31:40.380 --> 01:31:45.240
the way we remove most of
the xenon from burn up,

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:53.280
basically the neutrons being
absorbed by the fission

01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.300
process.

01:31:54.300 --> 01:32:00.300
The fact that we don't have the
reactor at a very high power

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:02.850
means that the amount
of xenon in the core

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.260
isn't being removed.

01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:06.830
So we actually start--

01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:09.510
the power would actually
want to go down on it's own.

01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:12.180
So you would have to
do a lot of re-shims.

01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:15.570
And for a while, that's a very
large amount of reactivity

01:32:15.570 --> 01:32:17.901
that has to be compensated for.

01:32:17.901 --> 01:32:19.710
For this experiment,
though, we actually

01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:22.470
shut down the reactor
yesterday and we started up

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.350
early this morning.

01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:27.480
So it's not a big
factor as it normally

01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:31.055
would be after doing one of
these lowering reactor power.

01:32:31.055 --> 01:32:33.180
AUDIENCE: Do you want to
have her do a re-shim now?

01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:35.376
Or do you want me to?

01:32:35.376 --> 01:32:36.168
FRANK WARMSLEY: No.

01:32:36.168 --> 01:32:39.156
I think we'll be able to get
at least one more person.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:47.190
So once again, she's
lowering reactor power.

01:32:47.190 --> 01:32:50.970
You can see on the period meter,
she's at a negative period,

01:32:50.970 --> 01:32:53.220
and the reactor
power is decreasing.

01:32:53.220 --> 01:32:55.000
She's almost at 500 kilowatts.

01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.890
She's driving the absorber
out again to slow down

01:32:58.890 --> 01:33:00.936
how quickly the power
level is going down.

01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:05.420
And when she's
done, the shim blade

01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:09.350
will end up about at the
same point where it started,

01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:13.014
the 13.42 inches out of
the bottom of the core.

01:33:27.924 --> 01:33:30.409
AUDIENCE: It might not make
it all the way back up to

01:33:30.409 --> 01:33:31.403
[INAUDIBLE].

01:33:31.403 --> 01:33:33.888
FRANK WARMSLEY: It'll be close.

01:33:33.888 --> 01:33:36.373
Compensate with the
reg rod if you need to.

01:33:56.750 --> 01:34:07.720
30.8.

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:08.690
OK.

01:34:08.690 --> 01:34:11.740
And that's the end
of the exercise.

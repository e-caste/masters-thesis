CHRISTINE BREINER: Welcome
back to recitation.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.540
I want us to work a little more
on finding anti-derivatives.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.380
In particular, in
this video we want

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.090
to find an anti-derivative of a
trigonometric function, a power

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.500
of the tangent function.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.300
So I would like you to
find an anti-derivative

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.840
of tangent theta
quantity to the fourth.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.430
And the hint I will
give you is that you're

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.780
going to need some fairly
familiar, hopefully, by now,

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.457
trigonometric identities
to get this to work.

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:38.290
And then you will need
some other strategies

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.921
that you've also
been developing.

00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.420
So I'll give you a while to
work on it and then I'll be back

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.711
and I'll show you how I did it.

00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.490
OK.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.450
Welcome back.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.330
We want to, again,
we want to find

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.870
an anti-derivative for tangent
theta quantity to the fourth.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.470
And I mentioned that
what we're going

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.986
to need is a particular
trigonometric-- well,

00:01:02.986 --> 00:01:04.610
I didn't say particular,
sorry-- but we

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.600
will need some trigonometric
identities to make this work.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.680
And the one in particular
I'll be exploiting

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.310
is a certain one, which
I'll write down here,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.450
which is, 1 plus
tangent squared theta is

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.507
equal to secant squared theta.

00:01:18.507 --> 00:01:20.340
We've seen that, I
think, a fair amount now,

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.560
but just to remind
ourselves, it is important,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.420
and this is the one
we're going to use.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.440
So let me show you how this
works, how this identity will

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.010
be very useful in here.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.770
And the idea is
that we can break up

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.180
this tangent to the fourth theta
into two, the product of two

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.720
tangent squared thetas.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.490
So I can rewrite this
integral above as the integral

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.380
of tangent squared theta times
another tangent squared theta.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.810
But instead of that, I'm
going to use this identity.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.920
So I'm going to
write it as secant

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.810
squared theta minus 1 d theta.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.870
So just let me make sure
everybody follows what I did.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.100
I had tangent to the fourth
theta as my initial integral,

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.690
so then I wrote it as tangent
squared times tangent squared.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.990
And this is actually
equal to tangent squared.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.250
You notice I just
subtracted 1 from both sides

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.712
of the starred identity.

00:02:11.712 --> 00:02:13.170
So that's my other
tangent squared.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.807
So these two integrals
are actually equal.

00:02:15.807 --> 00:02:17.890
So I haven't changed
anything fundamentally at all

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.021
in the problem.

00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:19.520
All right.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.300
Now let's look at
what we get here.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.820
We get, if I distribute
this, I get integral of tan

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:29.303
squared theta secant
squared theta d

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:36.380
theta minus the integral of
tan squared theta d theta.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.080
Now, you should start
to see that maybe

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.900
even powers of tangent
theta are nice to deal with.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.634
Because this kind of
stuff is going to happen,

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:49.710
this is going to happen every
time with, you know, n minus 2,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.470
the power n minus 2, here,
for any n I have up here.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.947
And the reason the
even is-- actually,

00:02:55.947 --> 00:02:57.780
I guess the even doesn't
even really matter.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.370
I could just have any n and this
would be n minus 2 down here.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.040
This is an easy
integral to deal with.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.370
Why is that?

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.122
Because what's the derivative
of the tangent function?

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:09.955
It's secant squared.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.080
Right?

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.530
So this is actually a
straight up u-substitution, or

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.080
substitution type problem.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.890
So this, I can finish
and I will later,

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.140
but this will be substitution.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.980
So I'll finish that
in a little bit.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.720
But what about this?

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.520
Now I have tan
squared theta d theta.

00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:31.238
That's, you know,
we don't have any,

00:03:31.238 --> 00:03:32.970
we don't have a secant here.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.450
We don't have
secant squared here,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.991
which would make it obviously
nice-- that's what we had here.

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:39.074
So we need to do
something else with this.

00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:40.490
Well, what I'm
going to do is, I'm

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.320
again going to use the
trigonometric identity.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.700
I'm going to replace this
tangent squared theta

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.760
by secant squared theta minus 1.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.430
Let's think about,
why is that good?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, that's good
because what I end up

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.150
with is, if I have secant
squared theta minus 1--

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.990
is what this will
equal-- secant squared

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.694
theta is easy to integrate.

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:03.610
Because it's the derivative
of a trig function

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.860
we know-- it's the
derivative of tangent.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.640
And 1, I think, is pretty
easy to integrate, too.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.960
So we have two functions we
can integrate very easily.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:15.240
So I'm going to bring this
back up on the next line,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.890
I'm going to do the
replacement here,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.717
and then we'll
finish the problem.

00:04:19.717 --> 00:04:20.800
So let me write this down.

00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:28.650
OK.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.330
Now I'm going to do my
replacement and minus

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.249
the quantity the integral secant
squared theta minus 1 d theta.

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.040
Let's make sure I didn't
make any mistakes.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.140
So I had tan squared theta
secant squared theta d theta.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.110
That looks good.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.229
And then I'm
subtracting tan squared

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.270
theta, the integral of
tan squared theta d theta.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.980
And that's that.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.490
So I'm OK.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.490
So this one, again,
I mentioned that this

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.300
is going to be a substitution.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.130
If you need to write
it out explicitly,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.250
this is u equals
tan theta, so du

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.474
is equal to secant
squared theta d theta.

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:08.015
So this is the
integral of u squared.

00:05:08.015 --> 00:05:09.760
Right?

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.614
If I substitute in
I get u squared du.

00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:13.030
So it's the integral
of u squared,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.460
which is u cubed over 3.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.880
So that first part is going
to be tan cubed theta over 3.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.654
That's my first term.

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:24.320
That's a straight up
substitution pretty

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.440
similar to what you've seen.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.960
Now I have two
things to integrate.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.010
I have to integrate
secant squared theta,

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.600
and I have to integrate the 1.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.506
Well, derivative of
tangent is secant squared.

00:05:35.506 --> 00:05:36.880
So the integral
of secant squared

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.506
theta is just tangent theta.

00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:40.880
So I have to
subtract, so there's

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.110
a minus sign, a tangent theta.

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.130
And then I have a minus, minus,
so when I integrate 1 d theta,

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.740
I'm going to get a plus theta.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.260
And then, obviously,
because it's

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.710
a family of possible
solutions, I

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.170
can add a constant
there, plus c.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:00.760
So again, where did
these come from?

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.300
This first one was
a u-substitution

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.300
on the first integral.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.310
And then over here I
have another integral

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.200
with two terms inside.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.385
The first one is
just the, I just

00:06:12.385 --> 00:06:13.760
need to integrate
secant squared.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.370
I get tangent theta.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.562
The second one, I just
need to integrate the 1,

00:06:17.562 --> 00:06:19.020
and so I have a
negative, negative.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.160
That makes it a positive theta.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.287
And then I have to
add my constant.

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.120
So let's come back and
just remind ourselves

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.828
where we started.

00:06:25.828 --> 00:06:27.360
We started with
this trig function

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.620
that was a power of tangent.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.870
And what we ultimately
did is we took

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.120
two of the powers of tangent,
we made a substitution

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.570
with the appropriate
trigonometric identity

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:40.820
to make this an easier
problem to solve.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.650
And actually--
yeah-- if you take

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.710
two of the powers of tangent
away and replace them by this,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.334
then you're always going to end
up with something of this form,

00:06:48.334 --> 00:06:49.997
tangent to the
power 2 less times

00:06:49.997 --> 00:06:52.080
secant squared theta d
theta, which you can always

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.810
handle by a u-substitution.

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.802
And you're going to end
up with an integral--

00:06:55.802 --> 00:06:57.760
now here's where it gets
a little tough-- here,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.220
you wouldn't have
tangent squared.

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.500
I think I might have said
that incorrectly earlier.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.230
If this was any power, here, you
wouldn't have tangent squared.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.840
You would have had whatever--
if this was power n,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.990
this would be power
n minus 2, so this

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.205
would be power n minus 2.

00:07:12.205 --> 00:07:13.550
Right?

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.250
So if this was power 8,
when we do the substitution,

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:20.770
this'll be power 6, so
this would be power 6,

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.460
so this would be power 6.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.080
So you'd have to do
the process again.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.290
This should remind you of the
reduction formulas you've seen.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.585
So it's good of it's even,
because if this is power 6,

00:07:30.585 --> 00:07:32.210
you do the problem
again and you end up

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.057
with, the second
term has a power 4.

00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:36.390
You do the problem again, the
second term has a power 2,

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.060
and, oh, we know how
to deal with those.

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.580
So we like it when
it's an even power.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.419
So that's kind of how these
even powers of tangent,

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:46.210
you can take, you can
find anti-derivatives

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.929
of the even powers of
tangent by this strategy

00:07:48.929 --> 00:07:50.970
that winds up, you could
actually get a reduction

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.655
formula out of this.

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:55.030
But I think that's where I
should stop with this problem,

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.960
and I hope you enjoyed it.

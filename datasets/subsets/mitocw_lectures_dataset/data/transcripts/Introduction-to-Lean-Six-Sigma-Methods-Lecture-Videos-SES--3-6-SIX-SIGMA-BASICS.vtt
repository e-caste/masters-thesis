00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.450
PROFESSOR: OK, so we're going
to talk about Six Sigma.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.490
Now, if you've seen,
the course is heavily

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.690
weighted towards Lean with
a little bit of Six Sigma.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.770
And we think that's the
appropriate place to start.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.130
But we need to get you
started on Six Sigma.

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.640
And so learning
objectives here are

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.420
that Six Sigma is a valuable
approach for improving process

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.730
quality.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.460
OK?

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.067
And we'll try to explain a
little bit more about that.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:58.900
We're going to have you
be able to interpret

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.850
a basic statistical
process control chart.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.170
That's what the active
learning experiment's about.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.510
We're going to talk about the
difference between process

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.820
control limits and
specified control limits.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.670
And you'll be able to describe
what a capable process is.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.900
OK, so Six Sigma is a strategy
to improve process quality

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.720
by identifying and
eliminating defects,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.750
and defects in the broadest
possible sense, not just

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.660
defects in the size of
a hole being drilled,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.630
but defect in something that you
want to deliver your customers,

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.440
not what they want.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.170
That's a defect.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.480
OK?

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.860
It's a very
data-driven approach.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.240
So if you've seen
Lean-- in fact,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.448
one of the comments we got
back on the feedback sheet

00:01:39.448 --> 00:01:41.490
is it's kind of a lot
of touchy-feely stuff

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.660
you're covering.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.600
And Lean is, in some ways,
a lot of touchy-feely stuff,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.700
because of the
importance of people.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.920
Six Sigma, if you
read the literature

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.110
on Six Sigma, at least
the literature I've read,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.050
people are never mentioned.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.290
It's about a
problem-solving process.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.410
And that's important, but
it has its limitations.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.530
And the important thing
is to know when to use it

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.440
and how it fits in with a
more holistic Lean approach.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.930
And it's a very structured
implementation approach

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.160
with certified experts.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.452
You probably have heard of
black belts and green belts,

00:02:14.452 --> 00:02:15.580
and things like that, OK.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.490
So Six Sigma has this
hierarchy of experts.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.880
And that's really not
the mindset of Lean.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.840
The mindset of Lean is the
experts, the coach, not

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.460
the person who knows the most.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.877
It's the person who gets the
most out of the people there.

00:02:29.877 --> 00:02:31.600
So there's some big
cultural differences

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.477
between Six Sigma and Lean.

00:02:33.477 --> 00:02:35.560
But they've come together,
and the important thing

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.950
is to try to understand that.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.883
Now, where does the
word sigma come from?

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:42.550
Well, this is a pretty
analytical group,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.840
so you probably all know this.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.008
But a normal distribution,
something like what you just

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:49.300
saw with the M&M's-- although
that wasn't quite normal,

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.520
but it was somewhat
close to that--

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.930
is defined by the standard
deviation, which is sigma.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.590
And in this chart-- so this
is one standard deviation

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.410
from the mean, two standard
deviations, and three.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.395
And Six Sigma would be
six standard deviations.

00:03:05.395 --> 00:03:06.520
And just keep this in mind.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.500
We're going to deal with some
Three Sigma in a little bit,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.125
coming up here.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:12.620
Three Sigma is
99.73% of the area

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.250
under a normal distribution,
would be within a Three Sigma

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.750
band.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.810
OK.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.150
An important part of
Six Sigma is defects.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.500
Because the goal of Six Sigma is
to reduce the number of defects

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.620
per million opportunities.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.980
And a defect is defined as any
process output that does not

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.390
meet the customer
specifications,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.560
as I mentioned earlier,
in a very broad sense.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.343
OK?

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:38.760
And so you've got
two things here.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.100
You've got opportunities
and defects.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.080
So you want to
reduce the defects,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.360
but you also, in
many ways, you want

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.130
to reduce the number of
opportunities to have defects.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.940
OK, so reducing the
number of hand-offs--

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.990
Sue mentioned the baton.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.910
Hand-offs between
people are always

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.590
a potential source of mistakes
or errors or misunderstandings.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.020
Just think about how many
miscommunications have you

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.660
had with your boyfriend
or girlfriend or parents

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.400
or best friends.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.340
So hand-offs of any
kind are something

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.718
that you want to minimize.

00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:19.260
I just read some
literature I'm going

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.870
to share this with you, since
we're in the aviation field--

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.270
I'm in the aviation field.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.370
The data from last year's
commercial air transport travel

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:35.600
in the US was there was 0.02
fatalities for every million

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.010
boardings, 0.02.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.330
I think that's a nine sigma.

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.060
Yeah, OK.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.220
So that gives you kind of
a benchmark of something

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.970
being really good.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.800
But how good is good?

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.095
Some people say, you
know, 99% is good.

00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:54.785
I mean, If my car
starts 99% of the time,

00:04:54.785 --> 00:04:56.160
and it's an old
car, that's good.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.930
But that's three
days out of the year,

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.190
I'm not going to get
out of my garage,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.190
and I'm going to miss
getting to my appointment.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.000
OK, that's not so good.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.130
So 99% you might think is good.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.090
But that's 20,000 lost
article of mail per hour;

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.160
unsafe drinking water
for 15 minutes a day;

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.980
in this audience, 5,000
incorrect surgical operations

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.820
per week; two short
or long landings

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.690
at a major airport each
day; 200,000 wrong drug

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.160
prescriptions a year.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.640
That's not really
very good, 99%.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.200
This is much better, Six Sigma.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.180
This is what you're looking for.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.710
OK?

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.010
1.7 incorrect operations per
week-- even that's too much.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.830
But boy, that's a lot
better than 5,000.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.860
If you're one of
those 1.7 people,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.540
you don't care what sigma it is.

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.380
You just got--

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:47.793
Same here.

00:05:47.793 --> 00:05:49.210
And as I mentioned,
airline travel

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.720
is nine sigma for safety.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.560
OK, so a basic tool
in Six Sigma is

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.940
called the statistical
process control chart.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:00.580
So a chart shows--
so it's a sequence.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.190
This is a time chart.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.940
And we're going to
build one just shortly.

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.607
It's time, and this
is some measurement.

00:06:05.607 --> 00:06:08.800
And this shows how stable
it is, how much it's

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.780
tending to be around
the center of the chart.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.260
It's a very common chart.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:16.360
And in both fields, if you go
into a production facility,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:20.170
an engineering, production
facility, now the operator

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.830
will be showing you
their control chart.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.190
I couldn't believe, when I first
went in and saw the machinist

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.270
proudly or the machine operators
showing me their control chart.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.150
I see control charts
all through health care.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.885
So let's make a control chart.

00:06:37.885 --> 00:06:39.760
OK, so we're going to
do a little experiment,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.412
a little thing here.

00:06:42.412 --> 00:06:44.620
We're going to put it in
the framework of a pharmacy.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.177
For those of you who are not in
the framework of health care,

00:06:47.177 --> 00:06:48.760
you could think of
another application

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.230
where you're getting something.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.190
But our pharmacy here dispenses
a medicine called a White Bean

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:56.380
Medicine.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.350
And we get it in bulk from
two different suppliers.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.900
This is our brand
name supplier, Goya.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.690
And it appears to
come from Spain.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.190
It's a little hard to tell what
the original source is here.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.245
But at the end of it,
there's some Spanish,

00:07:11.245 --> 00:07:13.450
and so I presume it
comes from Spain.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.460
And this is our
generic supplier,

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.893
[? Shaw's. ?] So we get
these two suppliers.

00:07:19.893 --> 00:07:22.060
And if you read the back
of the [? Shaw's-- ?] well,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.477
you can read the back of the
label, if you need to, later.

00:07:24.477 --> 00:07:27.520
So our pharmacy gets it
and puts it in these bins.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.760
And then they've decided to
measure dosages by volume.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.050
Now, usually a
dosage is by weight.

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.200
OK?

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:39.437
But it's much easier just
to scoop this up and fill it

00:07:39.437 --> 00:07:41.770
than to scoop it up and fill
it and weigh it, and so on.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.600
So we're doing it by volume.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.830
And what we want to do is to
track our pharmacy dispensary,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.270
to be sure that we're
getting consistent weight.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.490
And so our pharmacy--

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:59.720
this is not a critical
medicine, but it's widely

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.970
used in our facility.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:03.360
So we dispense a
lot of it each day.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.970
And so what we've
done in our pharmacy

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.990
is our pharmacy is going to take
three samples of this medicine

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:11.238
each day and weigh it.

00:08:11.238 --> 00:08:13.280
And the next day, it will
take three more samples

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.820
and weigh it.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.190
And we're going to build this
chart to see what it's like.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.990
And the pharmacy has
been very cooperative.

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.970
They've given us 20 samples,
that are already on your table.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.000
OK?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.750
And then I'm going to
tell you what to do.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.107
We're going to enter this data.

00:08:26.107 --> 00:08:27.440
So we've got a three-cup sample.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.380
We're going to enter data
into control charts-- one

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.350
for the average weight and one
for the range of the weight

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.270
of the three cups.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:36.860
And we're going to
use it for 20 days

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.326
to establish our
process capability.

00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:40.909
So we're going to
measure for 20 days,

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.284
and then that's
going to tell us,

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:43.490
do we have a stable process?

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:46.078
And we can monitor after that.

00:08:46.078 --> 00:08:47.620
And so that's what
we're going to do.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.130
So our first phase is now each
of you are going to weigh this.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.080
You each have four days.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:57.560
In the center of your
table, you have 12 cups.

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.950
And the cups, there are
three cups for each day.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.230
It says right on
there, this is day 16.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:05.120
There are three day 16 cups.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.870
And you have a sheet.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.810
And your sheet
says, here's day 16.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:13.320
So you measure cup A, B, C.
You compute the average--

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.600
we can get some calculators,
if you need it--

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.860
the max and the min
and then the range,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.320
which is the max minus the min.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.290
And then you bring that
up here to data central.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:24.720
And we'll record it.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.550
And you have a scale.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.900
And you want to use grams.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:31.780
This is in pounds and kilograms.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.840
You want to use the kilograms
scale to get it in grams.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.280
And don't use this now.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.738
But when we're all finished,
we'll dump the beans in there.

00:09:38.738 --> 00:09:40.720
But don't do it
now, because we may

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.160
need to go back and do
some second measurements.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.380
OK, so please now start at your
tables measuring these samples,

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.480
filling out the chart,
and bringing it up here.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.956
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:07.420
STUDENT: 98.

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:08.462
STUDENT: Oh, my goodness.

00:10:12.088 --> 00:10:12.880
STUDENT: Excellent.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.087
Very [? well done. ?]

00:10:15.087 --> 00:10:15.670
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.400
So we have all the data.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:24.660
And my helper over here
is going to enter it day

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.690
by day, so it unfolds like
you would see a normal control

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.940
chart, if you're
watching it day by day.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.400
So he's now on day five.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:37.080
Now, what we have-- this
is the mean average.

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.330
This is the average,
and this is the range.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.890
And this is the
mean of the average,

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:42.640
and this is the
mean of the range.

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.530
OK?

00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:46.590
And then what we have
here are these red lines

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.060
are the Three Sigma lines.

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.240
Remember, on a
normal distribution,

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.860
I said Three Sigma.

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:57.600
So the way these control charts
work is you get this data.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.080
And it's been established
that the processes--

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.630
you look at a three
sigma deviation.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.390
And as long as you're within
that three sigma deviation,

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.510
your process is under control.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.840
OK, that's just sort
of what's evolved.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.390
And of course,
these red lines will

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:18.940
change as he enters
the data, because he's

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:21.210
getting more and more samples.

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:23.840
So this is like watching
the election returns

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:24.680
on election eve.

PROFESSOR: OK.

STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.372

we're up to day 10.

00:11:34.372 --> 00:11:37.180
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.430
PROFESSOR: OK, and what's
going on in the background--

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:40.960
one of our colleagues
at Cal Poly

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.260
put this spreadsheet together.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:46.660
So this shows the [? app, ?]
the mean, what's called x bar.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.030
This is x bar,
and this is r bar.

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:54.130
X is the average,
and r is the range.

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.650
And then we've got the upper
and lower control limits.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.050
These are called upper control
limits and lower control

00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.695
limits.

00:11:59.695 --> 00:12:02.260
We've got the upper and lower
control limits for the average

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.040
and for the range.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.240
And usually, the way this
field works is 20 samples

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.940
is considered a
good enough baseline

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.950
to establish the
process capability.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.890
So oh.

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:19.350
STUDENT: Oh-oh.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:20.495
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:22.248

double-checking the data.

00:12:22.248 --> 00:12:23.790
PROFESSOR: Can you
double-check that?

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:24.730
STUDENT: Yeah, I'm
double-checking.

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:26.210
[INAUDIBLE] what's on the sheet?

00:12:26.210 --> 00:12:27.460
We may have to go [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.168
PROFESSOR: OK, well,
let's finish it off.

00:12:29.168 --> 00:12:30.030
Let's keep going.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.580
STUDENT: OK, so that's
it for 20 data points.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.640
PROFESSOR: OK, so something's
obviously funny with day 15.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.796

funny data, what do you do?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.950

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:45.755
OK, so let's go
take a look at 15.

00:12:45.755 --> 00:12:46.630
What's going on here?

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.300

weigh it again?

STUDENT: It's cup C.

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.368
PROFESSOR: It doesn't
look quite full, does it?

00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:58.160
Why don't you put some
more beans in there.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.611
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.398
Just fill it up kind of
like the rest of these.

00:13:07.398 --> 00:13:11.206
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.330
PROFESSOR: What's now?

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.800
STUDENT: 73.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:19.240
PROFESSOR: OK, so
now, on day 15,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.190
something happened
in the pharmacy.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.070
And all three cops are
shy by 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch,

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.370
something like that.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.703
So what we would probably do is
go back to the pharmacy records

00:13:30.703 --> 00:13:31.620
and see what happened.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.078
And we might find
out, for example,

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.280
that some employee
had been ill that day,

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:36.720
and they'd hired a temp.

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.360
Or a fill-in wasn't
cross-trained properly,

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.150
and they thought this was
a full cup, a full dosage.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:43.530
So we can eliminate.

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:45.000
Let's delete that point.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.540
We know that that point is no
good, because for certain--

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:49.170
we can see it.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:50.520
We can verify it's no good.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.520
So--

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.270

if I [? blank it? ?]

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.230

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.980
STUDENT: Going to zero?

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.235
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.320
STUDENT: Is it
going to go to zero?

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:56.870
PROFESSOR: No, that's fine.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.050
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.830
PROFESSOR: No, no, that's fine.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:58.770
It's fine.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:13:59.540
Yeah.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:00.200
Thank you, sir.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:00.830
STUDENT: All right.

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:01.550
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.780
OK, so now we've got our
process capability established.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.500
We've got 20 days
minus the 1 bogus day.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.340
And our upper and lower
control limits are--

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.540
we know now, for our
process, it's 75 and 69.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:19.630
And we got them for the range.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.110
OK?

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.660
So good.

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:22.160
Thank you.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.307
So that's how we would
build a control chart.

00:14:25.307 --> 00:14:27.390
So now we're going to do
a little bit more slides.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.220
And then we're
going to come back

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.762
to see how we use
this control chart.

00:14:29.762 --> 00:14:34.310
So I'm going to change now
from the basic control-charting

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.600
to a little bit about the basic
Six Sigma method, called DMAIC.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.790
And DMAIC is another
Deming cycle.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.000
It's like plan, do, study, act,
except it's slightly different.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.980
It's called Define, Measure,
Analyze, Improve, and Control.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.600
And so DMAIC is the
easy thing to remember.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:57.600
So if you're doing a
Six Sigma intervention,

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.643
like in our pharmacy,
we would have to define,

00:15:00.643 --> 00:15:01.560
who are the customers?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.893
And what are their requirements?

00:15:02.893 --> 00:15:05.460
So in the case of the
pharmacy, the customers

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.740
would be whoever has
ordered the medicine,

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:10.705
and they have some requirements.

00:15:10.705 --> 00:15:13.080
And then we want to know what
the key characteristics are

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.163
important to the customer.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:15.540
Well, the customer
for medication

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.520
is really interested in weight.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.670
They don't care too
much what it looks like.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.470
They really don't
care how it's packed

00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:24.610
in the cup, things like that.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:26.340
But they're really
interested in weight.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.620
And of course,
we're using volume,

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:30.570
because it's a little
quicker, but they're

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:31.445
interested in weight.

00:15:31.445 --> 00:15:33.580
So OK, then you measure.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:37.260
So once we know the key
characteristics, then

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:40.290
what are the key input and
output characteristics?

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:42.490
And you want to verify
the measurement system.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.460
So here are output
characteristics,

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.930
is the weight of the cup.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.490
That's what we're measuring.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.245
Later on, we might
get more sophisticated

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:51.120
and measure the input
characteristics.

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:55.352
Like, we might weigh
these two samples,

00:15:55.352 --> 00:15:56.310
or something like that.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:57.685
But right now,
we're just focused

00:15:57.685 --> 00:15:59.250
on the output characteristics.

00:15:59.250 --> 00:16:00.990
And we collect the
data and establish

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.130
the baseline performance.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.540
That's what we've done.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.730
OK, and then we've
done that so far.

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.120
Then we're going to
look at the raw data.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.770
We convert the raw
data information

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.570
and get insights
into the process.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.820
Well, we already found
out we had something

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:18.130
wrong with poor Molly.

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.780
On day 15, she got the flu.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:23.410
And we had a good temp, but
we didn't train the temp.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:26.630
So we've learned now that
training is important

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:29.570
so we don't dispense
the wrong medication.

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.450
OK, so we've improved.

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:34.360
We've developed a solution.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.040
And now we want to put our
process under process control.

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.580
I [? mean, ?] under
process control,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.060
we're going to now
monitor day by day

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.650
the medication dispensing and
see if it stays within control.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:49.000
That's DMAIC.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.050
So here's a simple example.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.400
You have a process.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.390
So you have a defined process
with an input and an output.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:03.000
You measure the
weight with a scale.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.310
You analyze the data
with the control chart.

00:17:08.368 --> 00:17:09.910
Then you want to
improve the process.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.869
We just talked about
training is one improvement.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:17.720
And then you put it
under process control.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.160
So that's the basic
Six Sigma cycle.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.643
This is one area where I said,
in Lean, when you came out

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:25.060
of this course,
you could probably

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.465
pick up any book in Lean,
and you could go for it.

00:17:27.465 --> 00:17:29.590
If you pick up Six Sigma
books, they do a deep dive

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.030
into a lot of math.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:34.130
So it's a lot of
statistical mathematics.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.510
So you may need more than
what we've taught you,

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:41.080
because we're not
focusing on math.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.920
OK.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.780
It's easy to see in a process
control application like this.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.250
It may get more complicated
if you're looking at something

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.260
that's not quite so visual.

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.780
But anyway, that's
the way it is.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:56.590
OK, now there are certain kind
of variation in the process.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.220
And actually, our control chart
was a good example of that.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.710
There's what's called
Common Cause Variation.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:05.260
And this is just the
sort of randomness

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:11.380
in the system, the things
that affect all the samples.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.792
And then you have
Special Cause Variation.

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:15.250
And we just had an
example of that.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:19.320
Common Cause was the
different variations of 19

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.050
of the 20 days.

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.780
And then we had one case which
was a Special Cause Variation.

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.430
We sort of went out of bounds.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:27.670
In that, we could go in, and we
could intervene fairly quickly

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:28.600
and correct.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.795
To get our Comma
Cause Variation down,

00:18:30.795 --> 00:18:32.920
we're going to have to do
something different here.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.650
We're going to have to be much
more careful about how we fill

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.330
the cups, and stuff like that.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.430
We might have to have
more careful procedures.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.250
But the Special
Cause Variation, we

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.720
want to drive out of the system.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.640
And the control
charts give you a way

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.630
to quickly see the
differences between these two.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:50.210
So let's look at an example.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.990
This is actual data
for patient falls.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.290
I've forgotten the facility.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.660
Anyway, the reference is just
off the back of the bottom

00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:58.950
of the screen here.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:00.990
But this is patient falls.

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:06.340
And we've heard sue mention this
morning how patient falls are--

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.270
you had it on a slide.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.610
It was something about there
being a source of waste,

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.545
or something.

00:19:11.545 --> 00:19:14.170
STUDENT: [? Patient ?] falls are
considered [? to have ?] never

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:15.070
have been something [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.610
PROFESSOR: [? They've ?]
never [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:15.610 --> 00:19:17.590
Great-- never [? met, ?] OK.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:22.450
And here we've got, in this
facility, this is by month.

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:27.510
And we got an average of about
six patient falls a month.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.590
And they've been charting it.

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:32.020
And we have an upper
control limit of about eight

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:34.380
and a lower control
limit of about four.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:36.860
Now, how many patient
falls would you want?

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.840
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.507
PROFESSOR: None.

00:19:38.507 --> 00:19:42.220
OK, that's a
customer-specified limit.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.980
There's a difference
between your process limit.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:46.840
This is your as is process.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.250
In this case, your
process is not

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.163
very capable in the
eyes of the customer.

00:19:51.163 --> 00:19:53.330
So we're going to get into
this towards the back end

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:55.580
of the module about the
difference between the process

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.610
capability, the upper
and lower control limits,

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:00.720
and the upper and
lower specified limits.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.840
So I just introduce
it here as a teaser

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.910
so you don't fall asleep.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:10.240
OK, so now, in this facility,
they tracked it for 20 days.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.550
And then they kept tracking it.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.530
And then something
starts going kind of bad

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:17.255
here towards the end of
the around 28th month.

00:20:17.255 --> 00:20:19.130
We've got something
that's kind of getting up

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.910
to the control limits.

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:21.368
And then we've got
something that's

00:20:21.368 --> 00:20:23.130
going outside the
control limits.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.080
And this is when the red
flags start saying, OK, we're

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.380
outside the normal bounds
we consider acceptable.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.720
We better go investigate
what's happening here.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:37.500
And that's what we did
with our pharmacy thing.

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:41.560
So now what we're going to
do is continue our exercise.

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.950
And the first thing I'd like
you to do is take the cups.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.840
And there's a
white tray in here.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.020
And dump all the beans
that you have into there.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:52.710
And just nest the
cups back together.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:56.685
And then the pharmacy's going to
bring you a new batch of cups.

00:20:56.685 --> 00:21:00.600
So let's get these
out of the way first.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.870
OK, so while we're
getting some help here,

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:07.050
what's going to happen is, each
of the stations on their easel

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:11.380
has a chart for the
average and the range.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:17.970
And what I want you to do is
to come put a scale on this

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:19.440
where you're going to put the--

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.090
OK, the upper control
limits, we don't

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:24.840
have to be accurate to the
second decimal place here.

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.900
It's about 75.4 and 69.5.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.670
So we want to do
something like this.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.580
First of all,
let's get the mean.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.790
I'll just do one, and I'll let
the other tables do theirs.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:40.480
So this is 72.5.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.070
That's the mean.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:48.370
And then the upper control
limit is about 75.4.

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.720
So we'll just put that here.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:05.380
And the lower control
limit is 69.5.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.440
OK, so you're going to
want to finish that.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.990
This is for the average,
and this is for the range.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.880
And I'll let each
team finish their own.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.640
And you can come up here and
get the data if you need to.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.540
And then--

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.900
PROFESSOR: So we want
to draw the control

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:20.860
limits on our chart.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:22.360
That's now fixed.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.340
That's our process capability.

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.990
And now we're going
to start moderating it

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.030
for days 21, 22, 23, 24, but
you're each going to do it.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:33.250
You're going to
do 21, 22, 23, 24.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:34.840
You're going to
do 21, 22, 23, 24.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.630
OK?

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:40.020
And you're going to measure
three samples each day

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.810
and plot the data on
your control charts.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:46.980
So whatever the data is
for the average on day 21,

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.180
you put here in the range.

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.920
On day 21, you put here.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:50.698
OK?

00:22:50.698 --> 00:22:51.990
And you're going to look at it.

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.073
And you're going to see
whether your process stays

00:22:54.073 --> 00:22:57.960
under control or whether it--

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.900
is it doing this, or is
it doing that, or that,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:01.770
or something else?

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:05.190
And if it starts
going out of control,

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:07.570
once you've decided
it's out of control--

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.093
you may have to
watch a little bit--

00:23:09.093 --> 00:23:10.635
then it's time to
stop to investigate

00:23:10.635 --> 00:23:11.858
in what the root cause is.

00:23:11.858 --> 00:23:13.650
Just like we did here,
we went to the table

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:16.350
and found out the root
cause was it wasn't filled.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.870
But we want you to do
this in a structured way.

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:20.868
OK?

00:23:20.868 --> 00:23:22.410
The tendency you're
all going to have

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:25.110
is to say that I know
what the root cause is.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.852
Somebody didn't fill it.

00:23:26.852 --> 00:23:27.810
But maybe or maybe not.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:30.660
So we're going to ask you to use
a fishbone diagram that Analisa

00:23:30.660 --> 00:23:31.950
just told you about.

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.720
And that's on the second page.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.390
And start thinking
about all the reasons

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.840
that the behavior you're
observing might be happening.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.448
For instance, could
it be that Aubrey,

00:23:43.448 --> 00:23:45.990
who was thinking about something
else, didn't weigh it right?

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:50.970
Maybe it's a measurement thing,
so that would be a personnel.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:56.330
Or maybe you got a
crummy weighing scale.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.280
That's a machine.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.470
So start filling out
all the things you can.

00:23:59.470 --> 00:24:01.510
And then, when you
get those filled out,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.730
then start looking at
them systematically.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.420
Which one do you
think is most likely?

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.340
OK?

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:08.090
So it's a detective operation.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:10.900
So now you're going to actually
do a root cause analysis.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900
OK?

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.940
OK.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:15.160
Does anybody have any
questions about-- yeah?

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.600
STUDENT: So the
upper and lower limit

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.810
and the average that we're
using are from our first sample?

00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:22.810
PROFESSOR: We've established
our baseline, yeah.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.393
So that's not going to
change [? anymore. ?]

00:24:24.393 --> 00:24:24.846
STUDENT: Do we all
use the same one?

00:24:24.846 --> 00:24:26.450
PROFESSOR: You all
use the same one.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.290
Would it help if I write
down those numbers?

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.040
STUDENT: Yes, especially
there on the left

STUDENT: Why are
they [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:20.858 --> 00:26:22.130
STUDENT: Oh.

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:23.360
Look at that.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.220
PROFESSOR: OK, so
going around the room,

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:31.040
we had a range of a root cause
analysis things, ranging from--

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.808
this table just said, we
think this is the cause.

00:26:33.808 --> 00:26:35.600
And they tested it,
and that was the cause.

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.440
So they just jumped
right to a conclusion.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.950
We had a very structured
process over here.

00:26:39.950 --> 00:26:41.853
But this is a way
to make it visible.

00:26:41.853 --> 00:26:44.270
If you go into a facility
that's under statistical process

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.520
control, the employees
are trained on this.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.700
And they're trained to recognize
this kind of deviation.

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:52.680
And then they do
something about it.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.580
OK, here's a chart for resident
falls in a long-term care

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.370
facility, control chart.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.260
And here's their 20 days.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.890
And this was their control.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.530
Now, in this case,
they were intervening

00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:09.160
to try to reduce patient falls.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.030
So this is not now
just doing nothing.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:13.710
They're doing a bunch
of interventions.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:15.600
And these are different
interventions.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.240
Actually, what
they did here was--

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.740
it's not on the
chart, but what they

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:21.480
did was they just
simply identified

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.550
the patients in this
long-term care facility who

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:25.320
were susceptible to falling.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.370
And they put stickers on their
wheelchairs or their walkers

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:31.410
in their room and
on their charts.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.110
And they picked stickers
that were so interesting,

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.910
that the residents
who weren't in danger

00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:38.520
wanted the stickers, too.

00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:41.080
But just being conscious of--

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.780
those were at-- the at-risk
patients started to drop it.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:47.070
And you can see their
interventions lowered the mean

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:49.860
and lowered the control
limits and lowered them again.

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.990
And this was a process
improvement study

00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.900
that I actually heard
at the last IHI meeting.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:57.640
OK, so now our last topic--

00:27:57.640 --> 00:27:59.790
this is Process Capability.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.220
Process Capability is defined
as the ability of a process

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.720
to meet the customer
expectations.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.402
And what we have here is we
know what the capability is,

00:28:07.402 --> 00:28:09.360
but we don't know whether
it meets the customer

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.170
expectations.

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.060
And to get the customer
expectations on there,

00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.850
we have to find
out what they want.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.200
HUGH MCMANUS: The
customer-determined limit,

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.575
the spec limits, are essentially
what the customer wants.

00:28:18.575 --> 00:28:20.310
The upper and lower
values between which

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:23.790
a process must be controlled--
that's what the customer wants.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:27.390
The bounds in which we choose
to control the process,

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.340
or which we try to
control the process,

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.430
are the upper and lower
control limits of the process.

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.720
So how do we measure, given
those two definitions,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:39.010
the process capability?

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.160
One way to do it is to
think about the process.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.700
And again, this is
an approximation.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:46.110
But it's a pretty good one,
under a lot of circumstances.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.910
The process is having a
normally distributed behavior.

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:51.090
So if we collect
some data, we can

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:55.950
assume a normal distribution,
do some statistics using

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:58.740
our statistical
tools, and decide

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.650
how good or bad the process is.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:05.130
And if we have a normally
distributed process,

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:07.560
its behavior is going
to be characterized

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:10.120
by its standard
deviation, sigma.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.792
And if we draw our spec
limits around that normal

00:29:12.792 --> 00:29:14.625
distribution-- here is
our lower spec limit,

00:29:14.625 --> 00:29:16.950
and here's our
upper spec limit--

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:25.170
we can define a quantity
CP, the process capability,

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:29.250
which is essentially this
distance here, the upper limit

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.090
less this lower spec limit--

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.450
so that the range
which is acceptable

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:37.000
divided by the Six
Sigma of the process.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.470
And if we have, say, a CP
of 2, that's a very tight.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:48.630
Basically, the spec limits are
twice Six Sigma of the process.

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:51.060
Then it's a very
tight distribution

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.770
inside the spec limits.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:55.860
And the chance of something bad
happening are very, very small,

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.170
the chance of going out.

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:00.395
So a CP of 2 is a
very good process.

00:30:00.395 --> 00:30:01.020
That, in fact--

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:03.398
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] Six
Sigma is [INAUDIBLE]----

00:30:03.398 --> 00:30:04.440
HUGH MCMANUS: Six Sigma--

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.580
STUDENT: --standard
deviations [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.747
HUGH MCMANUS: That's right--
six standard deviations

00:30:07.747 --> 00:30:09.990
on either side of
the mean, right.

00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:13.260
So a CP of 2 would be
a Six Sigma process.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:15.563
In that sense, it would
be a very good one.

00:30:15.563 --> 00:30:16.980
And just graphically,
you can just

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:19.740
see there's basically no tail
sticking out of the bad zone.

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.560
CP of 1 means you've got
three sigma on each side.

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:28.050
Three sigma, you've got 97 point
whatever percent of the process

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.500
falling in that range.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.770
So the chance of something
falling outside the range

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:33.090
is quite small.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.020
But it's not 0.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.670
We can see a little
bit of ink here

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.500
outside of the acceptable range.

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.860
And once we get below 1,
it starts getting ugly.

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:43.920
We really don't want to
even talk about that--

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.280
so from a statistical process
control point of view.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:51.420
Another issue which
one can ignore

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:54.690
is the fact that we
may not be centered.

00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:59.760
And we can actually redefine
our process capability

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.600
using a metric called CPK,
which takes into a fact

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.270
that we may drift off mean.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.440
And it's defined this way.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.380
It's basically the distance to
the closer boundary from where

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:15.540
we are divided by three sigma.

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.190
And it's whichever
one of those is worse.

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:22.980
And those same curves
shifted over 1 and 1/2 sigma

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.080
look a lot less pretty.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.120
Our former Six Sigma process
now has a CPK at 1.5.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.873
But it's still OK.

00:31:31.873 --> 00:31:33.540
There's a tiny, tiny--
there's a couple,

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:36.150
like two pixels worth of
ink sticking out there.

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.620
The chance of a defect is
still very, very small.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:46.110
But our formally
OK-looking CP of 1 process

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.290
now has quite a
bad-looking tail.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:53.090
And our process that
was bad is now horrible,

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:55.113
our relatively
uncontrolled process.

00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:57.530
So that's a different way of
measuring process capability,

00:31:57.530 --> 00:32:00.740
which takes into account the
fact that the mean may not

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.390
be on the center.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:08.450
What we do with these two
measures is different.

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:10.730
Here we have a archery example.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:17.090
This is a classic statistically
characterize-able process.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:19.220
We have shots that
are both widely

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.650
dispersed and off-center.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.630
So how would we
characterize that?

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:26.640
It's basically low on
both metrics, right?

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:31.490
It's widely dispersed,
and it's off-center.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.340
Here's another archer.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.407
It has a tight distribution,
but it's way off-center.

00:32:39.407 --> 00:32:40.900
STUDENT: So CP is high.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.610
HUGH MCMANUS: So CP is
high, and CPK is low.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:44.170
That's right.

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:46.868
So that's the difference
between those metrics.

00:32:46.868 --> 00:32:48.160
On this metric, it looks great.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.140
On that metric, it does not.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.300
And this, of course,
is what we want.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:56.680
If you're an archer or
any other person who

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.790
needs to control their
process, what do you do first?

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.770
Yeah, I'm cheating a
little bit on this one.

00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:06.440
I do archery sometimes,
not very much.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.630
But you have to do
this first, actually.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.820
You have to get your
process repeatable,

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:12.920
even if the meat is way off.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.290
Because if you're
correcting every time,

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.150
then it just goes
all over the place.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:23.200
But if you just go, OK,
same thing every time, OK.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:25.630
Five times in a row, I've
hit up and to the right.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.740
Now I'm going to adjust.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:34.060
So often, you concentrate on
knocking your CP down first,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.580
to understand your process,
to see where the mean is.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.350
Because you can't
really measure the mean

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:41.200
in a situation like-- you can
statistically, but it's hard.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.480
OK, enough of that.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.860
This actually-- remember
we said we would--

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:52.530
I'd tell you where the
definition of Six Sigma

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:53.190
comes from.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:57.810
Interestingly, it
comes from a process

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.270
with a mean shift
of 1 and 1/2, which

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:04.660
would give you three defects
per million opportunities.

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:06.630
So if you have a
very good process,

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.790
but you still don't control
your mean to more than 1

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:17.880
and 1/2 sigma, you still have
a very low defects per million.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.949
That's where that
idea comes from.

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:21.540
Those are some of
the concepts that we

00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:25.260
use to get processes under
control and keep them there.

00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:31.560
And Six Sigma, as
an overall method,

00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.030
is very useful for taking
variation down, especially

00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:40.800
in critical applications like
large-scale manufacturing

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.190
or health care, where you want
your defects to be very low,

00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:45.832
your variation to be very low.

00:34:45.832 --> 00:34:47.790
We've talked to you about
control charts, which

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:49.610
is a great place to start.

00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.469
It's not the end.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:53.730
And we've glossed over
all the statistical tools

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:55.739
you need to really
understand the numbers.

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:59.550
But the visual is very
powerful in and of itself.

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.140
Even if you don't
do the statistics,

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.590
having the visual evidence
of what your process can do

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:06.435
and whether it's deviating
is very powerful.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.830
And once we understand
what our process can do,

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:18.420
we can compare that to what the
customer wants and understand

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.030
the capabilities of our process
and whether they're acceptable

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:22.640
or not.

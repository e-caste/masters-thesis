MARK HARVEY: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.500
My name's Mark Harvey.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.780
And I'd like to welcome
you to this concert.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.690
And this is the first of a
whole series of concerts.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.380
I hope you have
the program there,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.280
The Art of the
Improvisor series.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.750
We have many fine
groups coming up,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.525
including one led by Phil
Scarff in about 2 1/2 weeks,

00:00:38.525 --> 00:00:41.560
over at the wall auditorium
up that way a little bit,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.810
and then two more
wonderful groups.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.810
This is a concert series in
conjunction with a class that's

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.550
going on this semester
called musical improvisation.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.870
So we thought that it would
be an interesting idea

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.020
to have a concert
series and also

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.420
invite the people from
the artistic groups

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.210
to come into the
class and present

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.249
their particular approach
with the students.

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:06.790
And I see a lot of
the students here,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.956
so thank you for coming out.

00:01:07.956 --> 00:01:10.297
This is great.

00:01:10.297 --> 00:01:11.880
And all you other
folks, we appreciate

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.280
you coming out on a cold night.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.090
It always seems to be a
cold night when we do this,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.790
but we're very happy to do it.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.280
This is called FiLmprov, which
means film and improvisation.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.610
And we're going to
start with improvisation

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.260
with our musical group,
for a musical set.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.580
We'll just have a brief
pause, and then we're

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.350
going to have the films of Kate
Manson with us, now transformed

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.500
into a pit orchestra.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.600
So you'll see us in
two different guises.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.180
So we hope it's not too much
of a shock to see that change.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.760
So here we go.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.830
We're going to play something.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.580

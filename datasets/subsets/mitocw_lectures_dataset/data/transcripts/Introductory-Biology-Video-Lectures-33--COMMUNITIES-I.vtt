00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So, today we're going to continue
with our series of lectures to come

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to a conclusion from the section on
population and community ecology.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
At last time, or three lectures ago,
we were talking about the regulation

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of population growth.
And this time,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we're going to move into,
just wanted to make sure the boards

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.000
are in order, community ecology.
And as I said of the first lecture,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
this is one of the most difficult
branches of the ecological sciences

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to really describe because an
ecological community is a bit of an

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:11.000
abstract concept.
And one definition is that it's a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:23.000
collection of species that are
linked together by their

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:39.000
feeding relationships.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
OK, so it's sort of like the
ecosystem without the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
biogeochemistry in a sense.
So really what we're looking at

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
here is the interaction between
species in a localized area with

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
respect to how they influence each
other's fitness, in a sense.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And these interrelationships between
these species govern all of the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
things that we talked about in the
first half of my lectures set.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's these interactions that shape
the biogeochemistry of those systems.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So, this is the structure of the
system and the biogeochemistry is

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the function of the system.
And it's also these interactions.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, they affect the flow of energy,
which we talked about.  They affect

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the cycling of elements.
They affect the evolution,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the very evolution of species within
the community.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And these communities self assemble.
In other words, if you start with

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
an empty plot of bare land,
we talked about this.  Remember the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
example of the glacier retreating
and showing the succession of

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
species as the glacier retreated?
We started with a bare rock, and

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.000
you'll start getting lichen
growing on the rock.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And then that lichen will create a
little bit of soil,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
allowing plants to come in,
and that the plants increase

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
productivity.  Some of them bring
nitrogen and, allowing shrubs and

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
trees and everything.
And that's the self-assembly of the

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
community.  Once you have plant
there, you can have insects there.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Once you have insects there, you
have birds there.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It self assembles.
And one of the questions that

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
ecologists ask is, how deterministic
is that?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I mean, we know there are some
random components to it,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and we know that there are some
things that will happen because we

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
see it happen over,
and over, and over.  So the big

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.000
question is what must happen?
What could happen?  And what might

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
not ever happen?
That's really one of the challenges

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of ecologists is to understand those
assembly rules

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
of community if there are any.
Now, we're not going to really get

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
into that.  We are just going to
start looking at the real

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
fundamentals of community [SOUND
OFF/THEN ON] which is,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
what are the possible interactions
between species that shape

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:07.000
evolution?  OK.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Species interactions: so,
when we talk about species

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
interactions and how they structure
communities, we have to first define

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.000
some terms.  One is
Darwinian fitness.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And the fitness of an individual is

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:59.000
the relative ability of an
individual in a population to

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:16.000
survive and reproduce.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So, it's all relative,
OK, within a population.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And we're going to define also,
we'll be talking about adaptations,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and I know you know what this is,
but let's just make sure that we are

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
all operating with the
same assumption.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And an adaptation,
which is something that affects the

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:05.000
fitness, is a heritable trait that
increases the fitness of an

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:20.000
individual with respect to other
individuals in that population.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So, these are just some operating
assumptions so that when we talk

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
about species interactions,
there are several possibilities.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:37.000
If we have organism one and organism
two, we can have,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and we ask how does the presence of
organism two and the presence of

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.000
organism one affect the fitness of
the two organisms?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And if the fitness of both
organisms is increased by being in

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
the presence of the other,
that's called mutualism.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Being together increases the fitness
of both relative to when they're

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000
alone.  If being together decreases
the fitness of both,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that's called competition.
And if you have the situation,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
what we recall that?
It could be parasitism,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
yeah, parasitism.  What else?
Was the ultimate form of reduced

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
fitness?  Predation,
yeah, being dead is the ultimate

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:00.000
reduced fitness.  So, parasitism
and predation.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And then there are some other sort
of rather vague interactions where

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000
when you put two individuals
together, the fitness of one is not

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000
influenced but the fitness of the
other is either influenced

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
positively or negatively,
and we're not going to talk about

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
those.  But this one's called
commencalism.  And this one's

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
called amensalism.
And obviously there are gradients.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Actually, an example of
commencalism is something that we've

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.000
talked about.  Can anybody think
about what that is when we talked

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000
about food webs?
It's kind of a stretch,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:04.000
but detritivory.
An organism eating detritus,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
in a sense, is commencalism because
it doesn't affect the fitness of the

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
dead individual because it's already
dead.  So, that gets to not having

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that much meaning.
So anyway, these we are not going

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to spend time on,
but they are forms of interaction

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that do exist.
And there are gradients between

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
these.  Obviously, it's not
all black and white.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So, we're going to start by talking
about competition.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And just to remind you,
competition comes in two forms.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:12.000
There is intraspecific competition,
which means within a species, OK?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And that's not what we're going to
be talking about today,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but we've already talked about this
without explicitly,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
remember our logistic equation
and the density dependent feedback

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:40.000
mechanisms in that population that
caused the population to deviate

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000
from exponential growth was due to
intraspecific competition:

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
individuals within a species
competing with each other for

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
resources.  We are going to talking
about now is more interspecific --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:20.000
-- which is competition

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:31.000
between species, OK?
So, I want to show you some slides

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that are just from your textbook,
but just to get you in the mood for

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
competition.  So,
it comes in all different forms,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and I don't care whether you know
the names of these.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It doesn't matter.  This is just to
give you an idea of the different

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
types of competition that we see in
nature.  This is what's called

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
consumptive competition,
and this is just showing the roots

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
of the trees competing for nutrients
in the soil.  Preemptive competition

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
shows these are barnacles.
We're going to talk a little bit

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
more about that later,
just totally taking over the

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
substrate.  So no other organism
could possibly settle there.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Overgrowth competition in plants
where this plant would be shading,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
so other plants that require a lot
of light could not grow underneath.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Chemical competition also occurs
where one plant will actually

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
excrete certain chemicals that
create these corridors of no growth

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
around them so other plants can't
get near to compete

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
for the nutrients.
The classic form of competition,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000
say, in birds and a lot of higher
organisms is competition for

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
territory.  So these are displays so
that an individual can keep a

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
certain territory,
and therefore make that food

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
available to itself,
therefore increasing its fitness

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
because it's able to
feed its young.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And then this is sort of the classic,
really tooth and claw competition

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:19.000
where encounter competition where
all these species are competing over

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
this zebra carcass,
hyena, vultures, etc.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
OK, now before we can talk more and
more in detail about competition,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
we need to define the ecological
niche.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And this is an interesting concept
in ecology that has been around for

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
quite some time,
and it kind of went out of

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
popularity for a while.
And I was gratified to see that

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
it's made it back into the
introductory biology textbooks

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
because I think it's a very
profound concept.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
In this particular competition,
the fundamental ecological niche

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
comes from G. Evelyn Hutchinson,
who is one of the founders of modern

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
ecology.  He defined as the
fundamental niche of an organism as

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
an N-dimensional hypervolume,
every point on which a species can

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000
survive and reproduce indefinitely
in the absence of other

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
species, OK?
So, this is an abstract concept,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
because those species are rarely in
the absence of other species,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000
except maybe in a test tube.  But it
defines the, and also we can't even

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
think about N-dimensions,
right?  We're able to think about,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
we can envision three dimensions.
But what he's talking about here,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
is every single dimension in the
environment that would have any

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
effect on the fitness
of an organism.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So here, just to wrap our brains
around this, we're looking at three

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
dimensions.  Our organisms here is a
ladybug, and this would be food size.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
These guys eat little aphids and
things.  I don't know if you've ever

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
used them under house plants,
but it's a good way to keep aphids

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
off your house plants if you want to
introduce ladybugs to your dorm room,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
which maybe you don't.
But there's a certain range of size,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
food size, that they can eat.
And so, that's three dimensions.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
There are undoubtedly many other
dimensions that we don't even know

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000
about, elements that they require,
etc.  So, this would be everywhere,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
in this space is a space where this
organism could survive and reproduce

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
indefinitely.  And the reason this
concept lost favor is its something

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
you could never ever measure this
because we can't know

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000
the N-dimensions.
Well, you can never say you can't

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
know anything,
but it's very difficult to say you

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
could know all the dimensions that
influence the fitness of an organism.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
But it's still a very important
concept for thinking about it.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And the niche is not a physical
place, OK?  The niche of an organism

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
is not a physical place.
In an N-dimensional hypervolume.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
It's an abstract concept.  So this
is the fundamental niche,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and here's another closely related
species whose niche has some overlap

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
with this one,
but has different ranges for

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
temperature, humidity,
and food size.  And when you have

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
overlapping niches is when you have
the possibility,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
the potential, for competition.
And two things can happen.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
If they overlap a lot,
than those two species cannot

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
coexist in the same environment.
One will outcompete the other, and

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
it will move on to some other place
where it doesn't have a strong

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
competitor.  But if they overlap a
little, you can actually have

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
competitive coexistence.
And we're going to talk about the

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
results of these degrees of niche
overlap as we go on in the lecture.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
So, if the species can makes it
realized, so this is its fundamental

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
niche, this one's fundamental niche,
and what happens if it can make its

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
realized niche small enough so that
there's no niche overlap,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
then you can have coexistence of
those two species,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:53.000
or very little niche overlap in the
same environment.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So that's the difference between
the fundamental and the

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
realized niche.
I think this is from your textbook.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
This is just one dimension, seed
sized, for, say,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:16.000
a bird eating seeds of this size
range.  We'll be talking about birds

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
a lot in this.
And here's partial niche overlap,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
species to where they eat some seeds
of the same size,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000
but by and large the mode is
different.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
You can have species coexisting.
Partial niche overlap can lead to

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
competitive coexistence.
And here's the complete overlap in

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000
just this one dimension,
which would lead to competitive

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:57.000
exclusion.  But obviously it matters
what's happening on all the

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.000
dimensions.  This is just an
oversimplification, to

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:11.000
give you the idea.
OK, so before we go to that,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:23.000
I want to talk about the classic
experiment that led to this,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:35.000
they're going to put this screen up.
Screen, screen, screen, screen.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Can you see, or do I need to turn

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
the lights on?
Thank you.  I'm sorry,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
I always ask my questions that way,
where there's no possible answer.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
There were some classic competition
experiments that's carried out by

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Gause way back in 1934 --
-- that I'm just going to use to

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:38.000
illustrate the concept of
competitive exclusion,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
because these were done with very
simple protozoa in a test tube,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
paramecia, and actually this was
back in the days when they were

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000
developing these theories for
population growth.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And these organisms were growing
according to the logistic equation.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
So here we are with,
and this is the classic experiment

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000
actually in your textbook that they
talk about in the context of the

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000
ecological niche.
So this is Paramecia caudatum.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000
These names aren't important.
Don't worry about it,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
but we have to call them something.
P. aurelia, which, when grown alone

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
in a test tube grow according to the
logistic equation,

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
they grow up and then they level off
at a certain level.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:46.000
And what Gause did is that he wanted
to see, look at this phenomenon of

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:55.000
competition and he grew them
together, and he found that,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:04.000
actually that no matter what
combination he put in,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:13.000
aurelia would always win out in
competitive exclusion.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:23.000
And he learned through a series of

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
experiments, we don't have time to
go into the details,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
but this would always occur if you
made two species compete in a very

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
simple environment.
In the test tube where he was

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
feeding these guys exactly the same
food, some form of bacteria,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
in a test tube this one would always
outcompete the other,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
and there would be competitive
exclusion.  If he made the

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
environment more complex,
where there were layers in it,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
or there was sediment in the bottom
of the test tube,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
that allowed more niche dimensions.
There were conditions under which

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
the competitive coexistence would be
allowed.  And he actually developed

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
a set of equations to describe his
competition that I'm going to write

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
for you.  We're not going to use
them; we're not going to analyze

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.000
them in detail,
but I'm just going to show them to

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
you so that you have an appreciation
for how population ecologists and

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
community ecologists start to think
about these systems.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
So, he said we can model this
interaction using our logistic

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:50.000
equation.  So he said dN/dt would be
the growth rate of,

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
let's call, the top one,
one.  It doesn't matter what you

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:04.000
call which.  The dN/dt equals r1,
N1.  Now here's our logistic, K1

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
minus N1 over K.
But he said I'm going to modify this

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000
equation so that the actual growth
of the organism is reduced to some

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:25.000
amount that's proportional to the
number of the other organisms that

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000
are there.  So, he called
that alpha-N2.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:41.000
OK, so some amount that's
proportional to amount the other

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:50.000
species that's here.
And then, he said dN2/DT is equal

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:00.000
to r2, N2, K2 minus N2 minus beta-N1
over, this should be K1, over K2.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
So, the growth rate of species to in
the presence of species one is

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
reduced by some amount that's
proportional to the abundance of

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
species one.  And these,
the values of these, these are

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
called competition coefficients.
You can actually do experiments and

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:26.000
put values on these,
and they are a measure of how strong

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
a competitor each of these species
are with respect to

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
the other one.
So, you're not going to have to deal

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000
with these, but I just wanted you to
see them, and see how population

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
ecologists began to model these
systems.  And so,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
it's the relative values of these
relative to the carrying capacities

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000
that will ultimately determine
whether species will coexist or not

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
when they are competing.
OK, so that's more of a theoretical

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
analysis.  Now let's look at the
real world.  Competitive exclusion,

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:12.000
that is, the exclusion of one
species from an environment because

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
of strong competition in another,
is very difficult to study, because

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
if it's not there,
you don't know it was excluded,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
right?  I mean, you don't go to some
place and say I don't see

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
the species here.
It must have been eliminated by

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:36.000
competitive exclusion.
It might never have been there.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
So, the way we learn about this
phenomenon is either through

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
inadvertent experiments,
and that is the introduction of

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
species to new environments and then
see what happens,

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.000
or actual intentional ecological
experiments.  So,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
we're going to talk about both of
those.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And the first one --

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:26.000
-- we'll talk about invasions --

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
-- and competitive exclusion.
And one of the classic examples of

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:41.000
this is the zebra mussel.
I don't know what happened.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Oh, there it is.  I didn't realize
this was animated.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:57.000
That's why there was nothing there.
So, the zebra mussel is a tiny

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:05.000
mussel that was introduced to the
United States back in,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I guess, 1988.
And up here, introduced into the

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Great Lakes by ships just being
attached to ships,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
or it's possible it might have been
the larvae in ships' ballasts.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Ships go into port, they take on
water into their ballasts to

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
stabilize, and then they go to
another port and let it out.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
And they're filled with larvae and
species.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000
So, the entire world oceans are now
filled with introduced species from

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000
ships ballasts.
So here's 1988.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:51.000
The zebra mussel is there.
1990: here.  92: here.  94,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
90 whatever, oh, 2001.  It spread
amazingly fast.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And it is this tiny little mussel
that seems to thrive everywhere:

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:10.000
clogs, all kinds of pipes,
settles on top of other native

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
shellfish and kills them,
and has led to extensive competitive

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
exclusion of native shellfish in a
number of ecosystems.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Some of the effects of these: in
some ecosystems they cleared

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
up the water.
They are able to filter just an

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
amazing amount of water when they're
feeding.  So they actually have

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
increased the clarity of the water
in many ecosystems,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
filtering out plankton,
which allows the light to penetrate

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
deeper in those systems,
allowing aquatic plants to grow from

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
the bottom.  So the introduction of
this one species can completely

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
change the structure of
the entire ecosystem.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
I just heard a lecture.
I was just visiting the Institute

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
for Ecosystem Studies which is out
in Millbrook, NY.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
By the way, if any of you are
looking for summer internships and

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:17.000
are interested in ecology,
they have a fabulous summer

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
internship program.
I've had several students go there

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
that have had great experiences.
But there's somebody there studying

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
the zebra mussel invasion
in the Hudson River.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
And he showed this incredibly
depressing graph of over the last

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
ten years of the native mussels in
that river going down to basically

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
extinction.  And then,
this is the weird thing about

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
ecosystems, just last year it
started to turn around.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
And they haven't done anything to
eradicate the zebra mussels,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
but the native mussels are starting
to have a comeback.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000
And nobody knows why,
and nobody knows whether it's a real

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
comeback because it could come back
for a couple of years.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:10.000
So, it's really interesting how
unpredictable these complex systems

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
are.  But these mussels can cause
millions and millions of dollars of

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000
damage.  And I also learned on that
trip that ecologists are trying to

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:30.000
get in place policies that if an
industry for whatever reasons wants

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
to intentionally introduce,
Here's an example of an application

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
of fundamental ecological knowledge.
The reason people study the ecology

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
of invasive species,
understanding this competitive

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
exclusion and all that,
is that you want to use that

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000
understanding to be able to predict,
if you introduce a new species to a

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
new habitat, whether it will be
invasive or not,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
there are some species you can
introduce and they will fit right in

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
and not exclude every
other species.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And so, what they're trying to put
in place is insurance that a company

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
would have to buy that was either
intentionally introducing a species,

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
or whatever practice that they were
doing was likely to introduce a

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000
species, and the cost of that
insurance would be a function of the

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
probability of that species actually
causing competitive exclusion.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And this is something that people
are trying to put into place in to

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
the economic system basically.
So, it puts a new meaning to

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000
limited liability company,
LLC.  So, you have to insure your

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
liability, which I think would go a
long way to reduce some of these

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000
ecological crises.
OK, so that's an inadvertent

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
experiment.  Now there are many,
many examples of this.  There's

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
books written on invasive species.
And if I can get this thing to work,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
I'll show you some clips of invasive
species, snakes.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And the biggest impact is on
islands because islands have been

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
isolated ecosystems for so long that
if you introduce a species,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
you have dramatic changes.  In
Australia, a big example was a

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
prickly pear cactus which was
introduced many years ago to create

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
living fences for livestock.
They completely took over not all of

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:46.000
the grasslands,
but a lot of the grasslands and turn

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
them into thickets.
OK, so invasive species are

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:57.000
inadvertent ecological experiments.
Let's talk about intentional

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
experiments.  And this is also very
classic textbook experiment that was

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000
one of the first ecological
experiments to be done.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And it was done with barnacles.
This was Joseph Connell was a

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
professor at the University of
California, Santa Barbara.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Barnacles have a larval stage that
floats around in the plankton,

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
and then they settle on rocks.  So
this was a classic barnacle

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
ecosystem in Scotland,
actually, in which the upper inner

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
tidal there is a species
called Chthamalus.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
And then the lower was dominated by
a species of mussel called Balanus.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
So, he asked the question, is this
distribution where the two are

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
exclusive of one another,
is it due to competition between

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
them, or is it just that this one
tolerates desiccation longer than

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
this one?  The inner tidal zone,
the tide goes up and down, so this

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:03.000
one's going to be exposed to dryness
a lot longer.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So, how do you answer that question?
Well, you do an experiment and so

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
what he did was he took rocks from
the upper, inner tidal that had the

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Chthamalus on them,
and he moved them to the lower one.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And he let the Balanus, the species
that dominates down here colonize on

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
those rocks.  But then he divided
them in half, and removed the

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Balanus from half of the rock.
And then he monitored the

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
survivorship of the Chthamalus.
And remember the survivorship

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
curves that we talked about when we
created those life tables,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
he actually measured survivorship
curves on these.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
If you go to the original paper,
you see LX is a function of time.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
So that's a tool that we use,
to ask the question, is the

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
survivorship of Chthamalus increased
in the absence of Balanus?

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
And this is all from your textbook,
showing that the percent of

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
mortality, when a competitor is
present is much higher than the

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
competitor is absent.
So, he's able to show directly that

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
there was competition between the
two.  And in fact,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
this was that kind of aggressive
kind of competition where one just

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
plucks the other one off the rock.
I mean it's direct: you're on my

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
rock; get out of here,
and it pops it off.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
He also was able to show that
tolerance to desiccation is also a

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000
factor in this system.
It's not like it's totally

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
competition.  But competition was
playing a role,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
and so I've summarized that in this
slide using our terminology.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
He was able to show that the
fundamental niche of Chthamalus,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:05.000
in other words --
-- the region in the inner tidal,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:15.000
where the larvae could actually
settle and live in the absence of

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:25.000
competitors was much broader than
the realized niche.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:36.000
All right, so let's get this over.
This is from your textbook.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:50.000
And we're going to just use,
I'm going to use an example of that.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:39:04.000
So, competition can also lead to
character displacement --

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:18.000
-- which in turn can lead to actual

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:27.000
competitive coexistence.
And an example of this, we're going

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:37.000
to talk about Darwin's finches in
the Galapagos Islands.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:46.000
And one of the ways that ecologists
actually measure,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:56.000
that's a bird, in case you didn't
notice it.  And this

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:04.000
is beak depth.
The shape and size of a beak tells

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
you what kinds of seeds a bird can
eat, and so they measured beak depth

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000
as a niche dimension,
basically, because it tells you what

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:26.000
size seeds the bird can eat.
And a study was done; we're going

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.000
to make the islands here.
What is going to call them A,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.000
B, C, D; these are islands.
And there are two species of finches,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000
which we are just going to call F.
Well, they're fuliginosa.  Again,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000
the name's not important,
and the other one is called fortis.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:05.000
So, we'll just call them,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:12.000
on islands that have both of them,
and there are some islands that have

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:18.000
only one.  So,
what was done is they measure the

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:25.000
beak depth of the different finches
on the islands where they were found

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:32.000
together versus islands where they
were found alone in the

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Galapagos Islands.
And what they found,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and this has been shown for many,
many different studies.  You look at

00:41:48.000 --> 00:42:07.000
the beak depth distribution.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:23.000
This is percent in size class.
And this is island C, D, and A,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:34.000
and B.
And they found that when the species

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:42.000
were on islands where they lived
alone, they had almost complete

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
niche, oh this is beak depth.
They had exactly the same size beak

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:57.000
distributions.
In other words,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.000
they were feeding on the same food.
And on the islands where they were

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:13.000
together, A and B,
I'm just making sure this actually

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:21.000
holds together,
they found what is called character

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:29.000
displacement, and that is that the
birds that had longer beaks and

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:37.000
smaller beaks,
were preferentially selected for

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:45.000
such that reducing the amount
of niche overlap.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:44:03.000
So, and this leads to competitive
coexistence.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
OK, and that's what we're looking at
here.  This is from your textbooks.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:12.000
This is from African seed crackers
showing that birds with smaller

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
bills consume soft seeds more
efficiently.  Birds with larger

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
bills crack hard seeds,
and you can see that the width of

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000
the bill here is different.

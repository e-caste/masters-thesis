00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.380
PROFESSOR: Today what
we've been doing,

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.820
we've been looking
at how there's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.430
a lot of different
representations for CT systems.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.900
They look almost the same
as a lot of representations

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.900
for DT systems.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.390
And today I want
to go one more step

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.970
and show how there's actually
a bunch of relationships

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.280
between them.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.790
That's when things
become very powerful.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.710
And so I want to
do that by thinking

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.550
about a very simple example,
thinking about a CT system

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.450
and how you would convert
that CT system into a DT

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.640
representation.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.980
This is a problem we've worked
on before, the leaky tank

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.479
system.

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.660
We've already seen a gazillion
representations for it.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.990
We can think about the leaky
tank system as a differential

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.130
equation.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.830
We derive that in Lecture One.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.220
We can think of it as a
block diagram, Lecture One.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.840
We can think about
it as a functional.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.310
That was about two lectures ago.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.540
As a system function, that
was Laplace transforms,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.280
that was about a week ago.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.130
We can think about
an impulse response

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.530
because the fundamental
signal in CT,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.580
the thing that plays the same
role as the unit sample in DT,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.190
is the unit impulse.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.240
So we can think about
the impulse response.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.740
And there's a variety
of connections

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.000
between all of those.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.320
What I want to do today is
compare the step response

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.260
of the leaky tank
system to the step

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.930
response of a DT approximation
to the tank system.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.480
To get started then, I want to
figure out the step response

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.790
of the leaky tank system.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.372
For you, you should think about
this as practice for the exam.

00:02:00.372 --> 00:02:02.205
You should be able to
do this in 30 seconds.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.567
So start.

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:08.150
Compare your answers
to your neighbor.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:11.090
Figure out what is
the step response

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.220
for the leaky tank system.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.140
No.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.640
No.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.120
OK, this question is too simple
so we're going to blast ahead.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.530
What's the answer?

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.527
What's the step response
for the leaky tank system?

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:08.610
Everybody raise your hand.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.290
Let me see how many numbers.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.490
OK, it's not quite as high a
fraction as I would have liked.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.579
Take another 15 seconds.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:19.120
Or better yet, talk
to your neighbor.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.619
Explain your answer
to your neighbor

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:22.648
and let your neighbor
tell you why you're wrong.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.970
OK, re-vote.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.589
So what's the step response
of the leaky tank system?

Better.

OK, almost 100%.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.050
Not quite.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.770
Another question.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.480
How many ways can you find the
step response of the leaky tank

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.290
system?

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.930
One represents more than one.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.390
I'm not going to have a
representation for 0, right.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.830
More than one, more than
two, more than three,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:40.970
more than four, more than five.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.303
How many ways can you find that?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.600
Don't just stare at
me with blank looks.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.200
OK, what's a good
way to find the step

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.994
response of this system?

00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:00.410
You can shout,
that way I won't be

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.118
able to identify where
you're coming from

00:05:02.118 --> 00:05:04.470
and I won't be able
to point to you.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.340
But you have to be quick because
if I see your mouth move then

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.180
I'll know which one you are.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.980
So when I look at it this way
you shout over here, right.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.030
There's simple ways
to do this, right.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.470
What's a good way to find the
step response of the leaky tank

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.970
system?

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.345
AUDIENCE: You have the transfer
function [? magnetized ?]

00:05:22.345 --> 00:05:25.340
with one bias then we
have the [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.190
PROFESSOR: That's a
relatively advanced way

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.000
and it's completely correct.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.280
Could somebody tell me
an even simpler way.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.135
Yes?

00:05:32.135 --> 00:05:34.597
AUDIENCE: What's the behavior
as t goes to infinity.

00:05:34.597 --> 00:05:35.180
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.790
What is it?

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.350
Let's do something easier.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.862
What's the input?

00:05:41.862 --> 00:05:44.130
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.580
PROFESSOR: Well, it's
a unit step, right.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.780
So the input is some
unit step thing right.

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.560
So my input, if I think
about some input r0 of t,

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.870
the input is something
that looks like that.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.940
So if I look at,
like you suggested,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.160
if I look at what's
going to happen for t

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.532
goes to infinity,
what's going to happen?

00:06:03.532 --> 00:06:07.380
AUDIENCE: Eventually the
rate at which we're going out

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.747
is going to be the same as
the rate that's going it.

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.650
PROFESSOR: So
based on that, do I

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.456
like this one, this one, this
one, this one, or that one?

00:06:18.456 --> 00:06:21.242
AUDIENCE: So, it knocks
out one and three.

00:06:21.242 --> 00:06:22.700
PROFESSOR: Knocks
out one and three

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.200
because we're not
expecting it to go

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.090
to zero because the
input didn't go to zero.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:27.590
Good.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.050
OK, so it's maybe
this, or this, or that.

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.250
What's a good method?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.248
What's a good method?

00:06:38.248 --> 00:06:39.206
Yes?

00:06:39.206 --> 00:06:40.706
AUDIENCE: So the
thing that confused

00:06:40.706 --> 00:06:43.758
me is that in the original
problem on the problem set

00:06:43.758 --> 00:06:46.200
we had it was a
second order system,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.560
but this one's a first order.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.851
PROFESSOR: This is first order.

00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:50.990
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
then you know that it's

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.105
going to look like something's
that's first order.

00:06:53.105 --> 00:06:55.480
PROFESSOR: Still looks like
something that's first order.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.197
That's good.

00:06:57.197 --> 00:06:59.280
I asked the question here
and I flicked back here,

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.680
that was a clue.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.430
How many ways can you think
of to do this problem?

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.330
Five ways.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.736
OK.

00:07:10.736 --> 00:07:13.360
You could think about solving it
by looking at the differential

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.124
equation.

00:07:14.124 --> 00:07:15.790
How about how many
of you could do that?

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:22.050
OK, how many of you took 1803?

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.880
Ah, good, good.

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.960
So all of you could do
it by doing the lower

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:26.820
left-hand corner, right?

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.300
OK, you could all
do it that way.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.430
You could all do it with
block diagrams, right.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.889
We thought about how you put
a signal into a block diagram

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:37.680
and you can chase it
around its end, right.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.690
You could do it that way.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.830
So there's at least five ways.

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.682
Just as rehearsal, I'm
sharing two ways here

00:07:45.682 --> 00:07:47.640
that don't quite fall
there, so my answer would

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.530
have been at least seven ways
that I can do this problem.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.280
Because I'm going to
show you two new ones

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.320
that don't appear directly.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:59.180
One way is to think about
the differential equation,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:03.170
solving for t less than zero
and t greater than zero.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.545
Paste the solutions together.

00:08:07.065 --> 00:08:09.200
With me so far?

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.970
So solve it for t less
than 0, the answer

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.305
is 0 because there was no input.

00:08:12.305 --> 00:08:14.000
It started at rest.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.340
Solve it for t bigger than 0.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.560
That means the input is 1.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.720
So you can get some answer
for t bigger than 0.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:27.770
Paste the two solutions together
by using step functions.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.235
Put the total answer back into
the differential equation.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.809
That total answer
better have the property

00:08:35.809 --> 00:08:39.890
that it solves the differential
equation for all time.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.390
OK.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:41.210
Nod your head yes.

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:44.340
It will make me feel like
I'm doing a fantastic job.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.500
The only trick there
is thinking about how

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.750
do you do things like
differentiating unit step

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.560
function.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.310
But the derivative of
a unit step function

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.557
is delta function.

00:08:56.557 --> 00:08:58.140
The derivative of
one of these things,

00:08:58.140 --> 00:08:59.973
which looks like a
product of something that

00:08:59.973 --> 00:09:02.670
exists for all time and
something that turns on at 0,

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:03.900
it's just a product rule.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.070
Derivative of the
first times the second,

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.110
plus second times the
derivative of the first.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.590
Except I said the
same thing twice.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.150
OK.

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.040
And so if you do
that, you end up

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.850
finding out that to match
the delta functions and the u

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.170
functions, it places additional
constraints on the constants

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.550
and the answer looks like this.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.119
OK, everybody sort of
sees what I'm saying?

00:09:29.119 --> 00:09:30.660
Here's a different
way you can do it.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.660
You could think systems.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.160
So on the chart I told you what
the unit's impulse response

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:39.660
was.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.550
It's 1 over tau u to the
minus t over tau u of t.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.170
So you could use that to
figure out the response.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.180
If I know that delta
goes into a system,

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:57.900
it gives me the unit
impulse response h of t.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.170
And the question then is,
find the unit step response.

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:02.370
Well, there's an easy way
to find the unit step.

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.455
That's just the integral
of the unit impulse.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.970
So apparently, the unit
step response of this thing

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.920
is the same as the
unit impulse response

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.005
of this combined system.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:19.720
But we know from our
analysis of systems

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.630
that you're allowed
to commute things.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.130
So that means I can
flip this order.

00:10:26.697 --> 00:10:28.280
Which means then
that all I need to do

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.580
is integrate the impulse
response of this thing, which

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.050
I knew by assumption.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.550
So if I integrate
the impulse response,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.550
I get the step response.

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.230
That's another way of doing it.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.760
I could do it by
Laplace transforms,

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.560
I could do it a
gazillion ways, right.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.880
Easy.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.660
You should go home and make
sure you can do all of those.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:49.370
OK, so the answer
then was number two.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:50.267
It's this thing.

00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:52.100
It's the first order
response, like we said.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.920
It has to go to a particular
final value, which

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.480
is equal to the final
value of the input.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.370
There's a variety of ways
that you could get that.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:06.080
OK, the point of today then
is to take that unit sample

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.110
response and figure out
ways to approximate it.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.750
What I want to do
is think about how

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.180
I would make a discrete
representation for the CT

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.970
system, the leaky tank system.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.200
You've done this in homework.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.020
This was homework one.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.050
I'm trying to do is get some
new perspective by thinking

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:29.960
about all those representations
that we have on the answer

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.830
that you already
derived in homework one.

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:39.140
So if I wanted to represent this
system, the leaky tank system,

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:40.610
by a difference
equation, one way

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:41.985
to get the difference
equation is

00:11:41.985 --> 00:11:45.780
to make an approximation
to the derivative based

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:48.050
on differences.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.270
The easiest way to
do that is something

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:53.890
that we will call the
forward Euler method.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.060
In the forward Euler
method, what we do is

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.860
we think about all
the functions of time.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.780
Say we have an x
function of time

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:03.466
and a y function of time,
the input and the output.

00:12:03.466 --> 00:12:05.840
I've got the continuous version
and the discrete version,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.342
that's the sub c and the sub d.

00:12:09.342 --> 00:12:10.800
The way I could
make an association

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.840
between discrete and continuous
is by sampling the signals.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.560
So I could say that
if I knew x sub

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.160
c of t, that's going to
be some squirrely function

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.860
but I don't know the answer,
I don't know what that is.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.910
But whatever it is, I will
say that the discrete version

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:32.850
at time n is the same as the
continuous version at time n

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.160
times t. t is a
sampling interval.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.370
And the discrete version of
this y function, this output

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.170
function, at time
m plus 1t is the m

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:49.160
plus 1 sample of the
discretized output signal.

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.202
Then the trick to solving
the differential equation--

00:12:53.202 --> 00:12:54.910
remember the differential
equation looked

00:12:54.910 --> 00:13:03.260
like tau y dot of t is
x of t minus y of t.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:07.600
I need to have a way of
thinking about this y dot thing.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.270
A way of thinking
about the y dot thing

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.670
would be the slope of
the line that connects

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:14.400
this sample to the next sample.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:17.970
We call it forward
Euler because at time n

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:24.770
we approximate the derivative
at time n by looking forward.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:31.010
So we approximate the derivative
of y continuous at time nt

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:36.650
by looking forward, yd of n
plus 1 minus yd of n over t.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:40.160
Then all we need to do
is make that substitution

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.480
into the differential
equation and it turns it

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.950
into a difference equation.

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:50.180
So if I make the
substitution that y dot is

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:52.740
given by this kind
of an expression,

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.970
substitute into this expression.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:58.790
I get a difference equation
that is in some sense

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:03.260
equivalent to the original
differential equation.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.790
I can solve that
difference equation

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:08.460
and I get that bottom
difference relationship.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.910
That's what you did
in homework one.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.920
If you were to plot that answer,
here's what you would get.

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:21.840
The blue curve
represents the solution

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:27.360
to the leaky tank problem,
the continuous problem.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:31.890
1 minus e to the minus t
over tau, quantity u of t.

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.810
So that's the blue line.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:35.790
If you select the
sampling interval

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.310
to be small compared to tau--

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.370
tau was the time constant
for the CT system--

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.830
if you select the sampling
interval to be small,

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.440
0.1, the samples
that you calculate

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.150
fall right on top of the line.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.650
Great.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:52.630
That's what we
would want, right.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.680
We're trying to make
a DT approximation.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.240
If our approximation worked the
solution to the DT equations

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.910
should be the same,
in some sense,

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.110
as the solution to
the CT equations.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.340
But if you change
capital T, you get

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.320
something that
looks decreasingly

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:15.750
like the continuous
version if you make T step

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.080
bigger and bigger per time.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.640
T is a sampling interval.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.130
If I started with a
small sampling interval,

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.720
I got a good approximation.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.930
By the time I get the
sampling interval up to 2T,

00:15:27.930 --> 00:15:30.540
this solution to the DT
problem looks nothing

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.020
like the solution
to the CT problem.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.410
OK, that's a general problem
in a numerical method.

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.210
So what we're
really talking about

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.700
is analysis of
numerical methods.

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.680
What went wrong?

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.701
Why is it that the approximation
worked well and didn't

00:15:48.701 --> 00:15:49.200
work well?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.970
I mean, it's intuitively
clear that that's

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.110
what you should
have done but we'd

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:53.776
like to be a little
more formal and we'd

00:15:53.776 --> 00:15:55.440
like to be a little
more quantitative.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.835
What was it that went wrong?

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:01.410
So to get some
insight let's figure

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.422
out the pole for the DT system.

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:05.130
Where's the pole?

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.320
OK, where's the pole?

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.810
Where is the pole
of the DT system?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:08.730
Not a large voter
turnout, but 100%

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.400
among those who turned out.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.950
So the answer is number two.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:16.410
It's pretty simple to see
how that would be the answer

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:20.119
if you start with the
difference equation.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:24.339
It's very simple to
write as e transform.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:29.680
This evaluate y at m plus 1
is the reverse of a delay,

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.270
it's an advance.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.950
Delay is multiplied by
z minus 1, so advance

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.140
is multiplied by z.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.230
So you can take the z transform
of the difference equation

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:44.115
to derive the z transform
of the system function.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:51.960
And then clearly
there a pole here at z

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.220
equals 1 minus T over tau.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.990
So the answer was number two.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:01.640
And it gives us a way to
think about why the difference

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.120
solution didn't work well.

00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:10.272
What we can see is that
even though you remember--

00:18:10.272 --> 00:18:11.730
what was the pole
of the CT system?

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.220
What's was the pole
of the CT system?

00:18:27.932 --> 00:18:29.890
How do you think about
the pole of a CT system?

00:18:35.291 --> 00:18:37.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:38.580
PROFESSOR: Close.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.520
What's the pole
of the CT system?

00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.200
PROFESSOR: Minus 1 over tau.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.770
So we would do the same sort of
thing, but now with a Laplace

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:49.790
transform, right.

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.290
So we would say
that we could write

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.980
Laplace transform of this.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:19:01.700
This would be s
tau y is x minus y.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:06.560
And the pole that we
get in the s plane it's

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:12.300
going to be 1 over 1
minus, minus 1 over tau.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:16.760
Despite the fact that
the pole in the s plane

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.860
was the same for
all the simulations,

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:22.800
the simulations, the discrete
versions, look different.

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.000
And that's because the pole for
the DT system is not the same.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.590
The pole for the DT system
depended both on tau,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.280
as did the pole
for the CT system.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:42.290
But the DT system the pole
depended also on capital T.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:44.900
So we said that the pole,
you remember the solution

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:51.530
to the last problem, the pole
was at 1 minus T over tau.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.405
So if T over tau is
0.1, the pole is at 0.9.

00:19:56.405 --> 00:20:00.920
If T over tau is
0.3, the pole is 0.7.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.426
If the pole is at 2, it's
1 minus 2 is minus 1.

00:20:06.426 --> 00:20:12.850
So the pole for the DT system
depends on both T and tau.

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:16.730
And it's given formally
by this relationship.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:23.930
The equivalent pole in the DT
system is 1 minus T over tau.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:29.090
So the pole in the CT
system was minus 1 over tau.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.710
The pole in the DT system moved.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:40.180
The amazing thing is
that the correspondence

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:44.290
between where the pole
in the CT system was

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.665
and where the pole
in the DT system is,

00:20:47.665 --> 00:20:51.760
is completely determined by
the forward Euler method.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.335
It has nothing to do with
the particular problem.

00:20:57.868 --> 00:21:00.760
OK.

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.790
We just figured out the
map between the pole

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.430
in the s domain and the
pole in the z domain

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:08.530
for a particular problem
for the leaky tank.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:14.080
It turns out that that same map
holds for every differential

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.666
equation.

00:21:16.666 --> 00:21:18.040
So what I want to
think about now

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.560
is how you would prove
such a statement.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:27.600
So, think about regardless
of the CT system

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.780
that we're thinking
about, I can always

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:39.480
write it in block diagram
form with adders, integrators,

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.580
and gains.

00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:45.300
So for the leaky tank
system that was easy.

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.060
My system looked like--

00:21:48.060 --> 00:21:54.955
I had 1 over tau, integrate add.

00:21:58.252 --> 00:22:02.055
So my system for the leaky
tank system looked like that.

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.320
So the point is that
there there's an A there.

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:13.210
The Euler forward
relationship is telling me

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:18.580
how I can figure out a DT
representation for the A

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.420
function.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.910
So let's think about what A is.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:29.440
A is a thing that in
CT, if the output of A

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.270
is y, what's the input to A?

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.809
AUDIENCE: The derivative.

00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:38.100
PROFESSOR: It's the derivative.

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.840
So the input we would
want to call y dot.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:46.990
So I might say that's x.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.560
So if the input is x, which is y
dot, I put it through and A box

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.950
and it comes out y.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:57.460
So what's the Euler
forward rule saying?

00:22:57.460 --> 00:22:59.680
So the Euler forward
rule says that if I

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:04.180
want to compute x of n,
the n sample of this thing,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.350
I should do y dot.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:09.340
But y dot, I'm doing Euler
forward I should look ahead.

00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.890
So I should compute y dot
as y of n plus 1 minus y

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:17.015
of n, divide by t.

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.660
OK.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.330
Now if I want to make a
DT equivalent system what

00:23:27.330 --> 00:23:31.170
I'd like to have is some kind
of a box that I could put x of n

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.005
in and get y of n out.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:43.770
If I had such a box then I could
replace every A in my CT block

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:49.312
diagram with this new box
that depends only on delays.

00:23:49.312 --> 00:23:51.270
So let's think about what
would be in that box.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.780
If I wanted to make
w of n out of x of n

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:57.962
according to this
rule, what would I do?

00:23:57.962 --> 00:24:04.530
Well, let see, y of n
plus 1 should be y of n

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:06.240
added to T x of n.

00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:14.880
So if I want to
compute y of n plus 1.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:17.470
Oh dear, what's y of n plus 1.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:22.130
How do I generate-- my
output I want to be y of n.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:25.460
Where's y of n plus 1?

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:29.623
If I knew y of n, how I
compute y of n plus 1?

00:24:29.623 --> 00:24:31.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.640
PROFESSOR: It would be back one.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:41.860
So if I had an R here, what
would be the name of this guy?

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:45.100
This would be y of
n plus 1, right?

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:49.870
Delays have the property
that their output is minus 1.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:52.730
I need a signal that's plus 1.

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:55.790
So I need the reverse
of a delay, which

00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:02.240
I can implement by having this y
signal being generated by an R.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.570
Then this equation says that in
order to compute y of n plus 1,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:10.400
this thing, what I need
to do is add this to that.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:17.060
So I need to add this to that.

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.570
OK.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.900
The Euler forward
rule says, if I

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.150
want to make a
discrete approximation

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.080
to the relationship between y
at the output and its derivative

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:34.720
at the input, I should
make one of those boxes.

00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.220
OK.

00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.570
I have a rule now.

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:42.120
Regardless of my CT system,
I'll take every integrator

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:45.930
and stick one of those in it.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:50.277
And what I'll have is a DT
approximation to my CT system

00:25:50.277 --> 00:25:52.360
that's everywhere based
on the Euler forward rule.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.440
Is that clear?

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.230
So now I have a rule for
converting an arbitrary CT

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:00.720
system into an
equivalent DT system.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.560
Equivalent in the
sense of Euler forward.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.140
And I know that that
transformation will hold.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.770
But it's even better than that.

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.440
Because I can now say something
about the relationship

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:18.140
between the position of
the pole in the CT system

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.600
and the position of the
pole in the DT system.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:26.570
Because I know this
original system, the A,

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:28.760
I'm going to think of
A as being 1 over 2.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.660
That's the Laplace
transformation.

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.710
And I want that
to be equivalent,

00:26:37.710 --> 00:26:42.720
according to this map, to
some transformation in z.

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.130
So I can look at
this thing and I

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.830
can see well, that
system function,

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:49.830
if I represent that whole
block by a system function,

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.310
the system transformation
it looks like that.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:00.900
But R, that's the
same as 1 over z.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:09.700
But that's the same
as T over z minus 1.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:15.280
Apparently, there's a
relationship between s and z.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:23.950
In fact, z minus 1 is
sT. z is 1 plus sT.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:29.500
Regardless of what CT
system I started with,

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.320
if I use the Euler forward
relationship to make

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.960
an approximation
of the integrator

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.705
the resulting transformation
will always have that property.

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.880
That's exactly what
we saw over here.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:48.790
So we think about the A's in
the original system being mapped

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:53.910
to something that's a little bit
more complicated, showed here.

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:57.860
But it's a DT representation.

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.020
And that DT
representation always

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:04.160
has this property, that
wherever the poles were in s

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.450
I can find where the poles
were in z by taking z

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:17.370
equals 1 plus sT.

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:21.420
That's how we get the dependence
on T. If the original pole was

00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:25.180
like over here at
minus 1 over tau,

00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.460
we just put s equals
minus 1 over tau,

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.200
and we get precisely
this relationship

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.490
that we got before.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:36.220
The 1 plus sT, which
is what I found here,

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.460
is the same as the
1 minus T over tau

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:43.870
that we found for the particular
example of the leaky tank.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:44.572
Yes?

00:28:44.572 --> 00:28:46.018
AUDIENCE: I think you
mentioned this earlier,

00:28:46.018 --> 00:28:47.809
but this is purely
because of the mechanics

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:49.260
of the forward Euler method?

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:51.160
PROFESSOR: Because
of forward Euler.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.620
This is only true if I decide
that all of my integrators

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.670
are approximated using
the forward Euler rule.

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.790
It's absolutely true.

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:05.180
OK.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:08.660
And that's a very interesting
result. What it says

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.260
is that if I think about how
were the poles distributed

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.650
in the s plane, I
just used that rule

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:20.360
to figure out how they'll be
distributed in the z plane.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.070
The rule says take the s plane
pole, scale it by capital T,

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:26.590
and then shift the answer by 1.

00:29:29.852 --> 00:29:31.250
Well, that's pretty interesting.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:34.580
Because that means
that there are s's

00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:39.680
over here that when
I go through that map

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.180
end up outside the unit circle.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.590
That's exactly what I found.

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.320
That transformation
has the property

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.640
that it can map a stable
CT system, a perfectly

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.560
well-behaved CT system,
into an oscillatory or even

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.470
a growing divergent DT system.

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:04.340
And you can see that
simply because of the map

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.500
between z and s.

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:15.590
Had s been some
number over here,

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:20.360
the unit impulse
response of the CT system

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:22.360
would have been
completely well-behaved,

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.280
e to the minus sT. But the
response to the DT equivalent

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:30.590
would be badly behaved
because it would have

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.960
mapped outside the unit circle.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.570
OK?

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.320
And as you motivated,
the that's only true

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.840
because I did Euler forward.

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:48.270
I can do precisely the same
analysis for backward Euler.

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.730
Instead of approximating
derivatives

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:53.340
by looking forward in
time like I did before,

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:55.320
I could instead look
backward in time.

00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:01.500
If I look backward in time
it looks almost the same.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.670
Now I say the
derivative at the time n

00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:08.310
cap T is n minus n minus 1.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:10.470
Look backwards.

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:13.680
Seems like a trivial difference.

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.010
But in fact the answer comes
out completely different.

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:38.270
If I look backwards
in time instead,

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:41.540
what I can think about
now is replacing every one

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.950
of these A operators again.

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:46.910
So I think about A. A was
this thing that y came out of

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:49.730
and y dot must have
gone into, which was x.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.870
And now I'm using
Euler backward instead.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:03.810
So now I want x of n should
look backwards in time.

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:14.060
So I want y of n minus y
of n minus 1 divided by T.

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:19.910
So what this says is that
I want to take y of n

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:28.460
should be y of n minus 1,
added to T times x of n.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:32.110
So that's a system that
if I started with x of n

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.690
and I wanted to
generate y of n, it's

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.350
almost the same
as the other one.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.700
Except now it says, when I
want to construct y of n,

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.740
start with a delayed
version of y.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.390
How do I get a
delayed version of y?

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:48.480
Delay it.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:54.580
So I take y and I
delay it like that.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:02.320
What comes out here
is y of n minus 1.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:11.710
And then y of n is y of n minus
1, added to T times x of n.

00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:14.590
So it's like that.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:19.000
It's almost the same, but
the math is different.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.530
So now I'm replacing my
A's, which are always 1

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:29.860
over s, with a system that looks
like T going forward divided

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.620
by 1 minus R in the bottom.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.110
So that's T over
1 minus 1 over z.

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:43.460
So that's zT over z minus 1.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.115
So that means that z
minus 1 now is sTz.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:57.190
Cross multiplying 1
minus sT on z is 1.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.610
So z is 1 over 1 minus sT.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.800
I got something that looks
completely different.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.650
This is backward Euler.

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:07.150
This is forward Euler.

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.270
So the answer for
forward Euler over here

00:34:10.270 --> 00:34:16.060
is 1 plus sT. The answer for
backward Euler is 1 over 1

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:21.429
minus sT. Everybody with me?

00:34:21.429 --> 00:34:26.469
So now when I think about
where do the poles land,

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:30.159
if I make the backwards
Euler approximation

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:35.920
they fall on this relationship
instead of the previous.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.440
And the interesting thing
about that relationship

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:44.600
is that if you
think about the way

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:51.300
this works every point in
the left half plane of s,

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:57.030
according to this map, ends
up inside a little circle

00:34:57.030 --> 00:35:00.060
in the z domain.

00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:06.106
The entire left half
plane maps into the circle

00:35:06.106 --> 00:35:07.230
that's shaded in the right.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.360
If you just make a picture.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:13.770
If you just plug in s equals
1, where does s happen?

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:16.650
Plug in s equals minus
1, where's the new z?

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:20.370
Plug in s equals 1 over
T, where's the new z?

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:23.430
All of the values in the
left half plane for s

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:29.080
map inside a small
circle in the z plane.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:35.310
Which means that if the original
system had a pole anywhere

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:36.870
in the left half plane--

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.790
remember left half
planes, left-sided.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.670
We're thinking that those
are the kinds of systems

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:48.640
whose unit impulse
responses converge toward 0.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:53.410
If you had a system that had
poles in the left half plane

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.840
and you do the backwards
Euler transformation,

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:58.690
you're guaranteed to
get a system that has

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:02.780
poles inside the unit circle.

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:07.680
In fact, they're in a smaller
circle than the unit circle.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.230
OK.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.960
Everybody sort of know
what I'm talking about?

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.740
So this is the idea
of thinking about,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.970
not relationships among
DT representations,

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:22.270
or representations
among CT systems,

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:25.570
but relations between CT and DT.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:30.820
It's because we can cast each
of those kinds of systems

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.830
into a polynomial
representation that we

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:37.480
can make a correspondence
between the CT system

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.910
and the DT approximation.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:42.490
I'll talk about just
one more, and that's

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:48.080
the trapezoid rule, which is
what you did in homework two.

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.300
You may remember
homework two, right.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.970
Since it was due,
like, yesterday.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.640
So the last problem
in homework two

00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.340
had to do with finding a
numerical approximation

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.220
to the mass and springs system.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.830
And you remember, we
did three of them.

00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:07.060
Those three were actually
forward Euler, backward Euler,

00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:09.610
and trapezoidal rule.

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:12.730
Trapezoidal rule
says, OK, I didn't

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:17.050
like this idea of
looking forward,

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:19.780
that seems anti-symmetric.

00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:22.630
What's special about
forwards or backwards?

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:25.840
That's also treating
backwards special.

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:28.240
I want to treat it
symmetric in time.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.760
That's what the center
difference approximation did.

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.087
The center difference
approximation in homework two

00:37:33.087 --> 00:37:34.420
was based on a trapezoidal rule.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:37.000
The trapezoidal
rule says, OK, let

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.395
me approximate my DT output.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.070
Let me think about a sequence of
samples in a DT output, y to n.

00:37:48.070 --> 00:37:50.980
Let me force the
differential equation

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.845
to be true at every
point between samples.

00:37:58.690 --> 00:38:01.180
In the forward Euler
and the backward,

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.740
we force the
differential equation

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:05.740
to be true at integers n.

00:38:05.740 --> 00:38:08.140
That made us compute
derivatives by looking

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.070
forward or backwards.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:11.680
In a trapezoidal rule we force
the differential equation

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.570
to be true between samples.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:19.210
Then we say, OK, the
signal yc should be

00:38:19.210 --> 00:38:22.270
the average of those samples.

00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:24.790
And the derivative
should be the difference

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:29.989
of the two samples divided
by T. So they're centered.

00:38:29.989 --> 00:38:30.780
Everybody see that?

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.230
So we're going to force
the differential equation

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.650
to be true at points between
the samples of the difference

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:39.160
equation.

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:42.020
And that's going to give me a
different kind of relationship

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.840
that looks strikingly
the same as these kinds

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.600
of relationships.

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:57.460
OK, so now I'm going to say
that I would like to have

00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:03.110
A, which maps y, y dot is x.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:08.710
Except now what I'm going
to want to say is that x--

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:13.330
which I will represent
as the average

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.378
of the nth and nth minus 1--

00:39:20.362 --> 00:39:25.160
should be constrained to be
the derivative of this guy,

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:30.705
which I will do by looking at
the corresponding values of y.

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:36.830
OK?

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:39.470
So that gives me a different
way of doing the approximation.

00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:51.590
I get y of n should be y of n
minus 1, plus T over 2, x of n

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.068
plus x of n minus 1.

00:39:57.056 --> 00:39:59.840
Just a different rule for how
to do the derivative, that's

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.280
all I've done.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.590
But it gives me a
different kind of a system.

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:07.910
Now I want to have x of n
go into something that I

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:09.800
will make my new A boxes.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.530
To compute y of n I should
have a delayed version.

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:16.310
Well, that's easy.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:17.165
I make one of those.

00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:25.370
And y of n should be the
sum of the delayed version.

00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:30.710
And T over 2 times a
delayed version of x.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:31.900
So I have to do this.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:40.290
So now I have the sum of x
and a delayed version of x.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.015
And I put that through T over 2.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:48.030
So here is my new
discrete approximation

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.711
to the accumulator.

00:40:51.711 --> 00:40:53.460
And I do just the same
thing I did before.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:41:00.280
I say, what's the
relationship between s and z?

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:16.810
So my A, which is
the same as 1 over s,

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:24.450
now becomes that block diagram,
which looks like T over 2.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:27.390
Looks like r plus 1.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:30.640
Let's see, 1 plus R.
Lets do it the other way.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:38.620
So T over 2, 1
plus R, 1 minus 2.

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:42.400
So T over 2 from here, 1
plus R from here, 1 over 1

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:43.375
minus R from there.

00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:50.020
Which I can convert into
z and I'll get T over 2,

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:52.850
z plus 1 over z minus 1.

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.030
I don't think I made
any mistakes yet.

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:05.230
So then I get z plus 1--

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.423
z minus 1.

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.180
Bring that over there,
bring that over there.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:16.191
sT over 2, z plus 1.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:21.410
Now bring the z's over here.

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:31.290
1 minus sT over 2 operate on
z to give me 1 plus sT over 2.

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:38.990
So z is 1 plus sT over 2,
over 1 minus sT over 2.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:44.540
So that's my new transformation
based on the trapezoidal rule,

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:45.590
which is showed here.

00:42:45.590 --> 00:42:47.460
Hopefully they match.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:53.180
So z maps to 1 plus sT over 2
divided by 1 minus sT over 2.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:55.610
And the interesting thing
about that transformation

00:42:55.610 --> 00:43:00.140
is that it map the entire
left half plane of s

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.550
precisely into the unit circle.

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:07.770
That was the reason that
the trapezoidal rule

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:10.680
worked so much better
on the problems

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:14.190
you tried in homework two.

00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:18.750
So if the pole starts
out being real so

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:22.990
that it's someplace in the
s plane on this red arrow.

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.120
Euler forward gave us
a pole in the z plane

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:31.045
that could be, if T is big
enough, outside the unit

00:43:31.045 --> 00:43:31.545
circle.

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:37.120
In the Euler backwards
method, it always

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.850
lands someplace in
the unit circle.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:45.430
In the trapezoidal rule it lands
someplace in the unit circle.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:48.460
But in the mass spring
problem and the poles

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:52.120
were on the
imaginary axis, which

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.900
means that in the
Euler forward method,

00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:58.640
the poles went outside
the unit circle.

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:01.180
That's the reason the solution
to the mass spring problem

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:01.680
diverged.

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.920
In the Euler backward
method, the poles

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:12.110
that were on the j omega
axis mapped to the perimeter

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:13.710
of this inside circle.

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.980
That's why they converged,
even though the mass spring

00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:21.210
system should have isolated
forever in the solution

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:23.100
that you did with
Euler backwards.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.500
It converged, and that's
because the method maps

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:32.290
poles on the j omega axis
inside the unit circle.

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:34.960
That's not what we want.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.690
What we want for the mass
spring system is to map

00:44:37.690 --> 00:44:42.010
the j omega poles directly
onto the unit circle

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.920
so that pure
oscillations over here

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.540
correspond to pure
oscillations over there.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.840
And that's exactly what
the trapezoidal rules does.

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:54.516
OK, so the point then--

00:44:54.516 --> 00:44:56.640
and this was the solution
to that homework problem.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.560
So the point is
that not only are we

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:04.390
interested in figuring
out relationships

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:08.020
among the different
representations for CT systems

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:11.590
and among the different
representations for DT systems,

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.960
there's a lot of insight
that you can get especially

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:16.960
into things like
numerical approximations

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.990
by thinking about how the
relationships in one domain

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:22.140
map to the other.

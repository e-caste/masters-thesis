00:00:23.456 --> 00:00:24.580
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: All right.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.830
So let's start with a quick
introduction my name is

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.080
Gabriel, Gabriel Sanchez.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.720
I am a lecturer and
research associate

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.200
in the transit lab at MIT.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.870
We're over at Building 1.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.660
My office is in room 1235.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.490
And that's where
office hours are

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.000
going to be every Tuesday
at 11:00 or by appointment.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.140
Send me an email--

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.150
can you hear me at the back?

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.000
Yeah?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.583
If you want, you can
send me an email.

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.084
And we can arrange
for office hours

00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:52.250
if you have any questions
about homework or anything

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.330
about lecture.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.920
So speaking of
OpenCourseWare, you

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.910
should have all
seen some notices up

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.880
as you came into the room.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.520
We're going to be recording
the class this semester.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.129
So that we can share
it with the world.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.710
So I think you're all
good-looking people.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:16.550
But if you are anxious or
nervous about being recorded,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.890
there a back burner
over there won't be--

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.690
it'll be a blind
spot in the cameras.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.519
Any recording of your faces
will be completely incidental.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:25.560
That's not our intention.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.940
It's not to record you.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.470
The camera is pointing at me.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.580
And we're going to
look at the slides.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.560
If I move over to the
sideboard and you are a,

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.670
then you'll be recorded.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.742
So please don't let
that intimidate you.

00:01:40.742 --> 00:01:42.700
Participate as much as
possible and make people

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.560
feel that they're in
the classroom with you.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.110
So we're welcoming
people for years

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.855
to come to this class,
people in the future.

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:51.980
Let's look at the syllabus.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.540
This class meets Tuesdays
and Thursdays at 4:00.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.120
You're here.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.550
You found the room, 2131.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.120
The final exam date and
time will be announced.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.199
I usually have the final
exam in the same room

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.990
as we have lecture.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.020
So if it's available,
we'll have it here.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.330
The time and date is pending.

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.460
Office hours, as I said
earlier, are on Tuesdays

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.679
at 11:00 or by appointment.

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:19.720
You can send me an email.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.562
You have my email up at the top.

00:02:22.562 --> 00:02:24.270
You probably read the
course description.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.380
So I'll skip that.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.240
And we'll get into
that when we start

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.150
talking about introduction
for today's class.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.600
We'll have five problem sets.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.700
And they will carry a weight of
65% of the grade split evenly.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.630
A fifth of that
65% is going to be

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.820
for each of these assignments
if that makes sense.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.400
And then 35% of the total cost
grade will be the final exam.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.650
There's just one final exam.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.691
There won't be a partial.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.500
And regarding attendance,
I'm not grading attendance.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.570
But I do consider it,
especially if you're

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.350
in the fence at the
end of the class.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.510
I'll be more generous
pushing you up

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.110
if you have
participated actively.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.070
Now, let's look at the course
schedule on the second page.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.380
In this class, we
have 26 lectures.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.630
They're numbered
on the left column.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.390
And they are divided
into four themes.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.630
The first three lectures
are introductory.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.780
So it's a theme of introduction
to public transportation

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.860
systems.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.380
Lectures 4 through 12 are on
data analysis and modeling.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.900
So you'll see that we cover
data analysis techniques

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.880
and different models--

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.640
cost modeling and
ridership forecasting.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.580
Lectures 13 through 15 are on
service planning and operations

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.080
planning.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.030
That's when we get
into scheduling

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.890
and you really
understand what it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.000
takes to plan transit service
and what drives costs.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.400
And then after that,
all the remaining topics

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.330
are on the more general
theme of strategy, policy,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.200
and other advanced topics.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.070
So that's to round out what
you know by that point.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.740
If we have changes to the
schedule such as a snow day,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.530
we will publish that on Stellar.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.420
OK, on the back, we have
a little description

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.269
of what OpenCourseWare is.

00:04:22.269 --> 00:04:24.560
I think most of you should
know what OpenCourseWare is.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.500
It's an online system
to share classes at MIT

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.070
with the rest of the world.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.280
And so we're
recording as I said.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.540
And the spot on the
back is the blind spot

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.150
if you want to avoid being
recorded incidentally.

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.619
Normally, no matter where you
sit, you won't be recorded.

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:42.410
Maybe you're the back
of your head might be

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.120
but not your face.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.820
In terms of readings, we
have a few relevant books.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.010
Some of them are reports.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.740
And they are posted on Stellar.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.100
Please raise your hand if
you don't know about Stellar

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.810
or not familiar
with the Stellar.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.150
We have one, OK.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.520
Are you from-- you're
not from MIT, right?

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.400
OK, so send me an email so
that I can give you access

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.030
to the site.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.310
It's a website where we
share all the materials

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.670
and homeworks and such things.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.390
So some of these books such
as The Transit Capacity

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.640
and Quality of Service Manual
is already posted there.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.320
So it's a PDF you can
download to your computer.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.640
There are also three books.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.880
I'm not expecting anyone to
read these books or to buy them.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.290
I brought them.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.490
Please pass them around.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.170
If you're interested because
you really like this topic,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.190
you can go ahead and buy them
or borrow them from somewhere.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.790
I think they're
in the libraries.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:42.239
So you can also get them there.

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:43.780
So just how you can
flip through them

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.670
and have a look if you want.

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.260
But as I said,
we're not expecting

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.774
that you read them or buy them.

00:05:49.774 --> 00:05:51.940
They're not really necessary
for any of the homework

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.981
that we're going to have.

00:05:52.981 --> 00:05:54.970
So it's supplementary.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:57.490
And finally, an acknowledgment.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.370
This course is Professor
Nigel Wilson's course.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.250
And I lecture it.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.090
But most of the material
that we have in this course

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.080
is provided by him and
follows of a long history

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.960
of teaching 1258 in the way that
we are teaching it here at MIT.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.617
It was his creative
process that led to this.

00:06:18.617 --> 00:06:20.450
Do you have any questions
about the syllabus

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.660
before we get started
with the class?

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.320
Any questions about
what we plan to cover

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.140
or what the style of
this course will be?

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.420
OK.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.630
In terms of homework, the
first one, which I passed out,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.940
is for you to work
on individually.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.220
If you don't have a copy
of that, please get--

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.270
it's one sheet in the front.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:50.990
And that's due a week from now.

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.860
It'll be your St.
Valentine's present for me.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.024
And please let me know
if you have questions.

00:06:57.024 --> 00:06:58.690
It should be a
straightforward homework.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.520
There's a reading that you do.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.870
And it's on Stellar.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.270
And then without
reading, you should

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.470
be able to answer the
questions on this homework.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.140
After this, you will have
some assignments that

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.180
are worked in pairs
or in bigger teams,

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.380
especially ones regarding data
collection and service planning

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.200
and operations planning.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.480
So there's going to
be a lot of teamwork.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.870
And I will send the survey.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.380
I will post an announcement on
Stellar, which should reach you

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.800
by email, regarding a
survey where I ask you

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.900
in more detail
about your interests

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.534
and your background on
things like programming

00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:37.950
and optimization,
which are things

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.650
that are not necessary
for taking this course.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.260
But at some point,
they might bring

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.380
in interesting perspective
in the homeworks.

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.010
So I try to
distribute that talent

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:53.730
evenly across the
groups doing homeworks

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.390
so that everybody has a chance
of getting that perspective.

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:00.647
But don't worry if you
don't have that experience,

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:01.480
it won't affect you.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:07.070
All right.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.580
We're ready to start.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.630
Do you have any questions
before we start today's lecture?

00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.910
OK, so today's
lecture is the sort

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.020
of introduction to the course.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:20.440
And we'll talk about the
current status and recent trends

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.030
of the public
transportation industry

00:08:22.030 --> 00:08:27.160
here in the US, what influences
those trends and that status.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.340
We'll have a critical
assessment of where we are

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.440
and the things that
we'd have to do

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:35.080
to increase the role of
public transportation

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.460
if that's what we want.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.650
We'll talk about
arguments put forth

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.970
in support of public
transport and, in some cases,

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:44.830
rebuttals for them.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.050
We'll talk what future
influences and ingredients

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.470
for future success.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.710
Let's get right into it.

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.440
If we look at the transit
industry right now.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:59.230
We have ridership patterns that
are increasing but moderately.

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.580
And they remain small.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.490
Public transportation in
the US and North America

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.800
remains a small percent
of the total mode share.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:11.470
Because most people travel
through using private autos

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.600
or modes like that.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.250
Now, there's a strong
financial support

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.200
from our local
government, local state,

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.220
and federal in terms of
funding and providing funding

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.710
from tax revenue.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.270
There has been
significant growth

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:28.190
in the number of new rail
starts in the past 25 years--

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:30.880
so new systems, new metro
systems, new light rail

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.260
systems.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:33.650
And we'll talk
about why that is,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:35.691
that it has to do with
the funding structure here

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:37.000
in the US.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.820
There's been also
major rebuilding

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.960
of many older systems.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.890
And that has to do with the
same funding incentives, which

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.570
is not necessarily
true in Europe

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:48.190
and other parts of the world.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.260
Institutional innovation
has been quite slow.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.670
But there's a
growing recognition

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:57.970
that, with the new modes of
transportation and where we are

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.740
and where we're going
in terms of trends,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.160
we might need to rethink some
of that institutional structure.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.620
And we'll get into that
later in the course.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.410
So if we look at the
trends in modal split--

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:16.210
that's one of the first
things that I mentioned--

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:19.300
over the last,
say, four decades,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:25.450
we see that auto is steadily
above 80% in the whole US.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.140
So it is the dominant
mode for transportation.

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.940
And these are journey to work.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.440
So this is the morning
commute to work from home.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.478
Transit, on the
other hand, floats

00:10:39.478 --> 00:10:43.640
right around between 2% and
3%, sometimes a bit lower.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.090
And what we can see
is that in the 1990s--

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:48.520
in 1990 and 1995--

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.860
you see a slight dip in
public transportation use

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.060
and some increase
in private auto use.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.800
And since then, we
started a recovery

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.050
towards lower auto use
and slightly higher

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.120
public transportation use.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.350
Walking is the same pattern
as transit and bicycling

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.920
also similar.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.750
But these are very
small components--

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.240
very, very small modes.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.330
References for this, if you want
more details, are listed below.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.050
In terms of ridership
in absolute terms,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.140
you see that, in the
last four decades,

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:26.500
we've had an increase,
so especially in rail.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:30.500
So if you look at the
dark teal right here,

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:34.390
most of this increase that
we see in the last 10 years

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.400
is from rail.

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.590
These are only public
transportation trips.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.930
So having rail
here in that we're

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:44.510
talking about metro and
subway, we have bus here

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.600
and then [AUDIO OUT]
all other modes.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.340
But it's all other
transit modes.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.990
So make sure that
you understand that.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:51.700
We're talking about light rail.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.060
We're talking about
ferries, other forms

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.290
of public transportation,
not private auto.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:00.820
But this is in
absolute terms, not

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.370
in relative terms in
terms of mode share.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:10.500
If we look at recent
trends from 2004 to 2014,

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.350
we see an increase in
public transportation

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.900
that is quite high,
especially when you compare it

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.160
to the population increase.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.810
And when you compare it to
the change in highway vehicle

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:24.300
miles of travel in the
US at national level.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.600
So we see a 2% increase
in highway vehicle miles

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.790
traveled and about 9%
increase in population

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.810
and about 21% increase in
public transportation use.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:38.730
So it's been
especially recently.

00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:44.580
And you can see a dip due to the
most recent economic recession,

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.280
but a pretty healthy
recovery after that.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.000
And part of what's
driving this is

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.120
that the population is
increasing, of course,

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.200
as it always has.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.607
But especially the urban
population is increasing.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:56.940
This happening all around the
world, not just in the US.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.520
In fact, it's happening
more outside of the US

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.040
than it is here in the US.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.750
If you look at
the UN projections

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.740
for population increase, most
of the population increase

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.860
in the world for
the next decades

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.280
is projected to occur in urban
centers and in Metropolis.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.930
So in fact, the population
change estimates

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.210
say that rural
population is actually

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:24.076
going to decrease by 2050.

00:13:24.076 --> 00:13:25.450
So not only are
you going to have

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.460
the natural rate of
population increase

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.709
that mostly will
happen in cities,

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.250
you're also going to have people
moving away from rural areas

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.360
into cities.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.880
And why is that?

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.750
Well, why are people
moving into cities?

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:40.570
And why is this
happening more and more?

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.057
We have some volunteers?

00:13:42.057 --> 00:13:42.557
Yeah.

00:13:42.557 --> 00:13:45.004
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:45.920
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Sure.

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:50.440
So access to jobs is a big one.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.508
Yeah.

00:13:51.508 --> 00:13:53.778
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.010
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: OK,
so it's more than that.

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:58.510
But yeah.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.840
So there are more cultural
activities and sports

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.970
and museums and all sorts of--

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:04.970
MIT.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:07.560
So cities-- when we talk
about agglomeration benefits--

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.560
I know we've heard that.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:14.180
But cities bring together
health care, education, jobs,

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.830
and people.

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:18.670
And so when you
live in a place that

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:20.620
has a high concentration
of these things,

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.420
you have more access
to those things

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.375
than if you were
to live outside.

00:14:24.375 --> 00:14:25.500
And that's true for people.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.130
It's also true for businesses.

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:30.610
A business that is looking
to hire talented people

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.930
from universities and have
access to, say, airports

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:37.540
and other businesses that
provide services to them

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.290
are more likely to find
that in a big city.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.910
So this is part of what's
fueling these trends.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.610
And in big cities, we
also have a problem

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:51.170
because of the high
densities of high traffic.

00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:54.850
So if you're looking at
traveling by private auto,

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.200
you're going to have congestion.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:00.700
And in that setting with high
densities and high traffic,

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.870
public transportation becomes
more competitive of a mode.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.200
But we also have to consider
the negative aspects

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.900
of public transportation from
the passenger's perspective.

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.010
You have to wait.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.010
It doesn't pick you
up at your door.

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:16.450
And it doesn't take you right
to the doorstep of where

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:17.410
you're going to.

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:18.910
So it's these tradeoffs.

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:23.260
And when there is enough
traffic and the densities

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.570
are sufficiently high,
then public transportation

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.630
can become very competitive
from a personal decision-making

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.568
standpoint.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.950
In the US, going back
to the US context--

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:38.350
and this comes from
the APTA Fact Book.

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:40.240
They publish this
every few years.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.930
And they always-- so this
is the 2015 publication

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:45.530
for two years before that.

00:15:45.530 --> 00:15:50.200
So with data from the American
Community Survey from 2013.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.240
And if we rank the
sort of largest US

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:00.070
cities and metropolitan
areas really by size

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:05.350
and then we look at
their transit mode share,

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:06.290
this is what we get.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.220
So the biggest one,
by far, in the US

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:12.087
is the New York
metropolitan area.

00:16:12.087 --> 00:16:14.420
And right below that, we have
San Francisco, Washington,

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.820
Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.860
And then you start seeing a
decrease and a pretty rapid

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:23.620
decrease in the
percent of workers

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.820
in those metropolises that use
transit to commute to work.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:35.590
So the question is, why is
the mode share so much higher

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:38.230
for these first few cities?

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.790
What do those cities
have in common

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.744
that the cities below
them don't have?

00:16:43.744 --> 00:16:46.410
AUDIENCE: They have
an old rail structure.

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.530
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: OK,
so that's a good idea.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:50.920
Yeah.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:51.450
Over here.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.840
AUDIENCE: I mean, they have
very, very high population

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.680
densities.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.077
New York is like 70,000
people per square mile

00:16:56.077 --> 00:16:58.250
and Dallas is
probably like three.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:16:59.330
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: OK.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:01.490
AUDIENCE: They have
expensive downtown parking.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.400
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Yes.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.930
Other ideas?

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:07.746
AUDIENCE: They're
all older cities.

00:17:07.746 --> 00:17:09.829
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: And it's
also related to the fact

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.250
that you have older systems.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.970
So in fact, those first few--
those first six that I've

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.329
mentioned, say New York
through Philadelphia--

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:22.650
are the oldest
systems in the US.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:23.420
DC is newer.

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:24.319
That's right.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:32.970
But most of the ones below them
are newer, even newer than DC.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:38.310
So these are cities that
had an urban fabric that

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.490
was created and
developed and densified

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.820
before the US road
infrastructure was developed

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.990
as it is today.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:50.610
And therefore, the densities
developed at a higher level.

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:53.520
And they already had
public transportation

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:57.540
serving those sort of OD
pairs in those cities.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:00.810
So it's sort of a
cyclical virtuous

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:03.630
cycle that sort of makes
public transportation

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.300
at those places more
efficient and more

00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:10.039
competitive than
the private auto.

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:11.080
Any questions about that?

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:21.700
If we look at so the
transit share modal split

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.280
for home-to-work journeys,
this is a little older.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:25.960
This is a study
that was completed

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.320
with data from the year 2000.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.070
And we have different
numbers here.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.950
But I just want to focus on
these five biggest public

00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:39.100
transportation
systems or big cities.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:45.100
And we see the mode share
in each of them for a car

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:49.660
and for transit in 2000
and transit in 2013.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:54.390
So we can see that, although
in Chicago it mostly

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:57.910
has stayed around the
same, in New York and San

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:00.790
Francisco and Washington and
Boston, it has increased.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:03.940
So there's been an increase
in the transit mode share.

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.520
Population has increased
in these cities

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.690
and so has the public
transportation mode share.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.580
In terms of public
transportation funding.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.670
So how will these systems
that are expensive to run

00:19:17.670 --> 00:19:18.420
get funded--

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.230
and expensive to
build get funded?

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:23.340
So the first thing to note
is that, in North America,

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:26.520
there's a tradition of
dividing the expenses

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.600
and the expenditures of
public transportation

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.770
into capital expenditures
and operational expenditures.

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:34.650
That's not true
elsewhere in the world.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.160
But it is in North America.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.980
So when we talk about
capital expenditures,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.810
we're talking about
building new systems,

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.930
extending systems,
procuring new vehicles,

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:47.400
rolling stock, repairs,
and things like that.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.260
Operating expenses
are what you used

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:55.560
to pay salaries of
drivers, pay for energy

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.480
or fuel to propel the
vehicles forward, et cetera.

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.900
So another thing to
note is that, if we

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.590
look at operating expenses
for example, about a third

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.590
of the operating expenses
are covered by fares.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.360
So when you use
the system and you

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.630
pay for it and you pay your
$2 or whatever it costs,

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.310
you're only paying
for about a third

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.250
of what it costs the system to
provide that journey for you

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.710
on average.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.000
It does vary from
system to system.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.170
And in some parts of the world,
these numbers are different.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:33.250
When we talk about local, state,
and federal support or funding,

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.630
this all comes
from tax revenues.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:37.870
So this could be sales
tax, especially when we're

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.290
talking about local and state,
and federal taxes, mostly

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:42.070
income taxes.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.120
In terms of capital
expenditures,

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.670
what I want to highlight
is that the federal support

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:53.000
is quite high, more than 40%.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.020
And that's much higher
for capital expenditures

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.240
than it is for
operating expenditures.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.850
What would that encourage
if you're a state

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.505
or you're an agency
and you're operating

00:21:02.505 --> 00:21:05.700
a public transportation agency
and you get a lot of subsidy

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.330
from the federal level--

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:11.460
so not necessarily
your constituents

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.820
for capital expenditures, but
not operating expenditures.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.275
What would that
encourage you to do?

00:21:18.275 --> 00:21:20.175
AUDIENCE: Build more
and maintain less?

00:21:20.175 --> 00:21:22.360
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Build
more and maintain less.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.460
That's exactly right.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.820
So remember I said
earlier there's

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:31.550
been a lot of new builds
in the last 25 years

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:34.550
and a of major repairs
in the last 20 years?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.750
This is why, because there's
a lot of federal support

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.850
for doing those projects.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:42.940
And unfortunately, you
build a bigger system

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:44.530
and you have to now run it.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.610
And that comes from
operating expenses,

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:48.190
which are not as
strongly supported

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:49.790
by the federal government.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:53.991
So that also hints at
maybe why the industry

00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:55.990
is where it is in terms
of state of grid repair.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.380
What influences these trends?

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.620
First one, and the very
obvious, is the suburbanization

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.390
of homes, employment,
and attractors.

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:11.310
People moving away from
cities to lower dense areas.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:14.070
Because property is cheaper
and parking might be free.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:20.730
In America, low costs for
car ownership and operation.

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:24.450
So we have low fuel
taxes in comparison

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:28.830
to other parts of the world and
low taxes when you buy cars.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:31.260
There is an extensive
urban road infrastructure

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:35.677
that is much higher than it is
in other parts of the world.

00:22:35.677 --> 00:22:37.260
And there are many
government policies

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:45.130
that sort of support the road
construction and maintenance

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:47.190
and the use of roads and
the private automobile

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:49.320
and not necessarily
to the same extent

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.090
support public transportation.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:54.210
These include things
like tax benefits

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:56.730
that you can take on your
return, parking requirements

00:22:56.730 --> 00:23:00.810
when there is new
construction that, again,

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.210
support the private auto.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.680
If we look at
suburbanization just

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.680
focusing on the first point and
looking at the same data set

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.929
I talked about earlier,
the 2000 journey to work,

00:23:09.929 --> 00:23:11.220
we have different numbers here.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:14.800
But what I really want to
focus on is we have here--

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.190
this is like an OD matrix
but by part of the city.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:22.050
So if you live in the
central city or a suburb

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:26.040
and you work in the
central city or suburb,

00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.130
what percent of total trips
are covered by each mode?

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:36.750
So we see that we have about 27%
of trips are from central city

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:38.250
to central city.

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:43.170
And about 20% are from the
suburbs to the central city,

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.930
so people commuting inbound to
the central business district

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:47.430
in the traditional sense.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:51.030
Then there's the reverse
commuters, about 9%,

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.990
who are living in
the central city

00:23:54.990 --> 00:23:57.220
and commuting outbound
into the suburbs.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:59.422
And then there is
the suburb to suburb,

00:23:59.422 --> 00:24:01.630
people who live in the suburb
and work in the suburb,

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.450
not necessarily in
the same suburb.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:07.230
OK, so that's interesting.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:10.140
That's how the trips are made.

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:12.300
What happens if we
look at the increase?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.780
What are the trends from 1990 to
2000 leading to these numbers?

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.500
Well, by far, the
biggest increase

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.320
was in suburb-to-suburb
commutes.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:28.380
And if we look at the public
transportation mode share,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.620
if you live in the city and work
in the city, about 14% of trips

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.330
are covered, are made by
public transportation.

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:36.900
It's lower.

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.750
It's about 6% if you're
going to or from the suburb.

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.480
And it's much lower, 2%,
if you live in the suburbs

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:43.680
and work in the suburbs.

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:47.280
So if you just focus
on three numbers here.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:53.340
43% of trips are from
a suburb to a suburb.

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:55.500
The trend is that
suburb-to-suburb trips

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.700
are increasing.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:00.210
And that is the
hardest thing to serve

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:01.730
with public transportation.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:04.940
Why is that?

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.250
Why is it difficult
to serve those trips

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.166
with public transportation?

00:25:09.166 --> 00:25:11.080
AUDIENCE: Low density?

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.870
GABRIEL SANCHEZ:
Why is low density--

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.500
why does that make it
difficult to serve--

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.900
AUDIENCE: Because then it's--

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.820
people that need
access to stations,

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.740
they're not [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.750
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Well, you
could put more service.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:30.530
You could put more bus
stops and stations.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:31.365
So--

00:25:31.365 --> 00:25:33.198
AUDIENCE: But then
there's not enough people

00:25:33.198 --> 00:25:35.010
to take it to make it
financially viable.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.051
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Exactly.

00:25:36.051 --> 00:25:38.660
So did you hear that?

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:40.190
So because you have
low densities--

00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:44.271
you have a sparse OD matrix,
as we say in transportation.

00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:45.770
You have fewer
people that are going

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:49.180
from any particular origin to
any particular destination.

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.260
When you don't have
those critical densities,

00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:54.170
it becomes very expensive
and very inefficient

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.930
to deploy resources to
move a lot of people

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:01.200
when the demand for moving a
lot of people is not there.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.610
On the other hand, when you
have dense corridors along which

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.080
many people want to move, you do
develop this competitive demand

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:12.110
pattern that is very well
served by public transportation.

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.410
And it's very correlated with
whether you are in the suburbs

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:17.960
or in the central city because
central cities are denser.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.010
And there are dense [INAUDIBLE]
corridors in the city,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.069
and also from suburbs
to the center.

00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:26.110
Any questions about this?

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.607
AUDIENCE: How would you--

00:26:26.607 --> 00:26:28.857
I guess you wouldn't consider
something like Uber pool

00:26:28.857 --> 00:26:30.407
to be covered by this.

00:26:30.407 --> 00:26:31.240
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: No.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.200
This excludes things like
the transportation network

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.550
companies.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.660
This is traditional
public transportation.

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:40.890
Yeah.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:44.560
OK, let's look at a few
images, some GIS charts that

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.780
were prepared by
Mikel Murga who used

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.936
to work in the transit lab.

00:26:48.936 --> 00:26:51.220
And he's an expert in modeling.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:52.270
Here's Boston.

00:26:52.270 --> 00:26:55.690
And what we have, let's
go back to the key here.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.200
It's based on the
census data from 2010.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.900
And red means car.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.496
Orange is carpooling.

00:27:04.496 --> 00:27:05.620
So that might include this.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.530
Or it might include you
dropping someone off.

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:10.120
Blue will be public
transportation.

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:13.210
And walking will be green.

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:16.600
So this is the center
of Boston right here.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.050
MIT is right here.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:21.580
This big green area where a
lot of people walk, that's us.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.250
That's MIT.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.950
The center of Boston right here.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.980
So lots of green, lots
of people walking.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.070
Lots of people who start
their trips there and are

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.250
going into Boston are also
taking public transportation.

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.930
You see a lot of blue.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:39.100
But as you start moving out of
that center, you get more red.

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.530
So this is supports what
we just talked about.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.290
There are lower densities
outside of the central business

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:47.560
district and this
denser Cambridge area

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:50.170
right here, big university
centers, hospitals,

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:52.120
and financial district.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.070
So outside, there
are lower densities.

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:57.820
And there's also a lower supply
of public transportation.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.340
So therefore, most of the
commutes are made by car.

00:28:00.340 --> 00:28:01.870
And therefore, you see more red.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.890
You do see some places though
where there's a lot of green

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:07.900
or a lot of blue.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:11.690
And usually, the they are
close to a commuter rail line.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.850
So if you follow,
the rail lines,

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.890
you'll see that,
along those corridors,

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.990
there is a bigger share of blue.

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:20.750
The same story in other cities--

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.300
Manhattan, of course,
being the biggest provider

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:27.050
of public transportation
and the city

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:29.740
with the most split for
public transportation.

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:32.480
A lot of green in
South Manhattan.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.410
A lot of blue right
around Manhattan.

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.480
But as you start
moving out, then you

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.790
start getting a lot more red.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.190
Same thing, just more intense.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.190
And then here's Chicago.

00:28:47.835 --> 00:28:48.770
Here's Chicago.

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:49.550
Same thing.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.700
City center is right here.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.950
So you can sort of spot
the city center of the city

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.190
by how people do their journeys.

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:00.160
Along the lake
coast, you see a lot

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.400
of trips made with
public transportation.

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.830
But as you start moving
out, especially away

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.570
from any rail lines
because, along rail lines,

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:13.370
you'll see some percent of
people taking commuter rail

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.450
into Chicago.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:21.470
OK, so any questions about
this, this picture of mode split

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.630
and how it changes
depending on where you are

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:24.800
and where you're
starting your trip

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.174
and when you're
ending your trip?

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:30.760
No?

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:31.580
OK.

00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:35.360
So here in the US, coming
back, especially to the North

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:39.260
American context, we
have our car road system.

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.470
So very highly developed,
more than in other parts

00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:45.470
of the world.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:46.550
Many people own cars.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.650
There are 600 cars for
every 1,000 people.

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:51.510
The car usage is high.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.800
If you look at the--

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.110
it's 10,000 vehicle kilometers
per person per year.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.310
Compared to other countries,
we have lower taxes,

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.610
lower fees, lower user charges.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:05.870
So sales taxes are 5% to 8%.

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:09.410
Users pay for only about 60%
of the road infrastructure.

00:30:09.410 --> 00:30:11.390
That comes from tolls
and from gas taxes.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:17.310
The fuel taxes here in
the US are 10% to 20%

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:18.520
of what they are in Europe.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.730
So it gives you an
idea of where we are

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.880
and why our policies
encourage owning a car

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.790
and operating a car.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:28.129
Parking is another big one.

00:30:28.129 --> 00:30:29.170
I already mentioned this.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:32.790
So the parking supply
in most of the US

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.250
is free and widely available.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:39.850
So there are 380 parking spaces
per 1,000 central city workers

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.250
in the 10 largest cities.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:42.769
Outside of that,
it's much higher.

00:30:42.769 --> 00:30:43.560
Everybody can park.

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.470
About 95% of car commuters
enjoy free parking.

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:50.400
So if it doesn't cost you to own
a car or to operate it and you

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.360
can park free-- you can leave
your piece of metal doing

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.650
nothing and taking up real
estate in a city with no cost--

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:00.460
then you might go
ahead and do that.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:04.940
So it's a highly developed
urban road system.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.420
We have more roads,
wider roads, longer roads

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:11.010
than in other
parts of the world,

00:31:11.010 --> 00:31:14.270
especially if we compare Europe.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.220
And we're talking here about
the 10 largest cities in the US.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:18.770
We're not talking
about rural areas.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.120
What do people say when
they're advocating for transit?

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.660
What are the
traditional arguments

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.720
put forth for transit
being good and therefore

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.130
we should support transit,
we should fund transit?

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:32.630
The equity is a big one.

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:39.310
So access for people who cannot
drive or choose not to drive.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:42.160
So we're talking about
elderly, handicapped,

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.690
children who can't
drive, poor people

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.520
who can't afford to
buy their own car

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.170
or to use modes like
Uber, for example.

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:52.420
So that's the equity argument.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.090
And that's a very
sound argument.

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:55.880
Congestion.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:58.210
So people say put
public transportation

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.070
to alleviate congestion.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:03.490
That's not such a good argument
because lots of the studies

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.190
that we've looked at,
even when a lot of people

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.980
do take public transportation
when a new system is put in,

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:11.680
the capacity released
in the streets

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.910
is usually very quickly.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.290
They demand it again.

00:32:17.290 --> 00:32:20.950
So that is not a very
effective method, by itself,

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:22.270
for reducing congestion.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:26.350
If you tie it to other things
like parking taxes or parking

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.060
caps or tolls, then
with a combination

00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.850
of an increase in public
transportation supply

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:38.230
and an increase in cost or
disutility for taking the car,

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:40.120
you can have an
impact on congestion.

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.270
Land use.

00:32:41.270 --> 00:32:45.580
So if you want a
nicer, walkable city,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.160
then you should have
public transportation.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.380
If you're driving your
car from home to work,

00:32:50.380 --> 00:32:52.030
you're not going to stop.

00:32:52.030 --> 00:32:53.740
You're going to work.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.960
And so when you're taking
public transportation

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.010
and you stop along
dense corridors

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.890
and you probably won't get
dropped off immediately

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.130
where you're going to so you
might have to walk by stores

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.830
and by restaurants,
that's going to generate

00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:09.970
commercial activity.

00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:15.520
And it's going to support a land
use that is of nicer quality

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.460
than the car might do by itself.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.270
Environmental.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:24.120
So if people say, let's put
public transportation in

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.970
because it's good
for the environment.

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:28.800
Well, it turns out
that actually it's

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:33.210
more effective to work
on the car technology--

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.090
hybrid cars, fuel efficiency.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:38.550
It's a much more effective way
to help the environment just

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.260
because so many people drive.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.410
The mode split is so much.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:46.990
It's about 80% for a car.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:52.640
It makes a bigger dent to
work on car energy efficiency.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.050
Same with energy.

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:56.030
It has to do with
the same things.

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.960
OK, other arguments.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.000
So economic expenditures
for private autos

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.930
may be used to improve local
economies and quality of life.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:07.670
So we say we subsidize
the private auto.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.710
Because people, through
their user fees,

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:12.530
are only paying for
about 60% of the costs.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:15.949
The remaining cost is
coming from tax revenue that

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.650
could have been spent on
nicer cities and nicer

00:34:18.650 --> 00:34:21.449
public transportation systems.

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.340
And then there's the
agglomeration benefits.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.920
If you want to increase
the economic activity

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.949
and the socioeconomic
welfare of a city,

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:30.600
then you can put in
transit because it

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.340
supports higher densities.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:35.909
So how would New York and
Boston and San Francisco

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:39.150
be or have developed
if they didn't

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.582
have their public transportation
systems right now?

00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:44.790
They really would be nothing
like they are right now.

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:48.270
If you took Manhattan and
shut down all the metros--

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.060
and we've had these real-life
experiments when hurricanes

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.170
come around--

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:53.850
the city shuts down.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.480
You can't commute into the
city without these systems.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.700
There is not enough
capacity on the roads

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.770
to bringing all those people
in and to support that economy.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.270
So there is a benefit to
having these systems in.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:09.270
But because these investments
were made sometimes

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:12.970
a century ago, nobody
is talking about

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:17.650
or quantifying the benefit in
assigning it to that system.

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.720
So the contribution of
earlier investments,

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:22.230
especially in heavy rail,
is not being valued.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:24.550
That has changed a
little bit recently.

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:27.810
So when London was doing
its economic analysis

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.200
for Crossrail, a big metro
system across the city,

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.270
they did say, we
need a long view.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:38.430
This is going to have benefits
lasting many, many decades.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.410
We're not looking at
a 20, 30-year horizon.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.120
We're looking at
way beyond that.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.700
We want London to prosper
and to become more dense

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:48.660
and to have higher
agglomeration benefits.

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.840
So other arguments
are that transit

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:55.380
decreases the external costs
of transportation in cities.

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.540
So when we look at
things like accidents,

00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.835
you're less likely to be
to get into an accident

00:35:59.835 --> 00:36:04.380
if you're in a bus than
if you are driving a car.

00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.390
Impacts on human health.

00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:10.695
Any clue about what
I mean by that?

00:36:10.695 --> 00:36:11.564
AUDIENCE: Walking.

00:36:11.564 --> 00:36:12.480
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Yeah.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:12.980
Walking.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:14.240
So you walk a little more.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:14.740
Yeah.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.760
There's the impact of if
you have a lot of traffic

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.470
and you're sort of
sitting in traffic,

00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:27.200
you're breathing in dirty air.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.860
So if that's the case,
pollution kills people slowly

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:34.640
but at a higher rate than
accidents and other things.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.700
So these are the
impacts on human health.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.940
And I did say earlier that
public transportation by itself

00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.590
is not going to address that.

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:45.890
But if you pair it
with some policy that

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:50.180
will curb the private auto
demand and reduce emissions,

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.164
then you can have an
impact on health care,

00:36:53.164 --> 00:36:54.830
healthier costs from
the government side

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:58.350
and the human health for people.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:02.000
So again, congestion, noise.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.800
We can reduce the noise
of cars on streets.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.430
And climate change,
global warming.

00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:15.460
Here's a nice picture of public
transportation catalyzing

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:17.110
sort of the urban fabric.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.630
So making cities
more walkable just

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:23.297
to highlight what
we said earlier.

00:37:23.297 --> 00:37:24.130
Critical assessment.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.610
So we've stabilized public
transport in North America.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:31.150
We saw that, in
the 1990s, we had

00:37:31.150 --> 00:37:33.130
an increase in the
mode share of auto

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.050
and a decrease in public
transport and walking

00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:35.830
and biking.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:39.459
And now, that's starting
to come back up.

00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:41.500
There are many new rail
initiatives like Phoenix,

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.624
Denver, and Salt Lake City.

00:37:42.624 --> 00:37:44.410
And they are successful.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.110
And especially if we look at
older systems like New York

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.600
City but also at some of the
not-so-old ones like Houston

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.080
and Seattle, we see
very successful systems

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.240
that are being
heavily used and are

00:37:55.240 --> 00:38:01.030
contributing to nicer land use
and developing the economy.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:03.610
Institutional change is
occurring very slowly, maybe

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:05.260
too slowly.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:08.390
Many things are changing
in terms of technology,

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:10.090
in terms of policy,
in terms of what

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.060
the private sector is offering.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.590
And the public sector
is not catching up.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.210
It's not moving as quickly.

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:20.930
So another challenge is the
retention of political support.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:22.690
So yes, question here.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:24.485
AUDIENCE: This is
just North America?

00:38:24.485 --> 00:38:26.610
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: This is
focusing in North America.

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:27.430
AUDIENCE: Because
China, for example,

00:38:27.430 --> 00:38:29.221
is building a crazy
amount of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:29.221 --> 00:38:31.780
GABRIEL SANCHEZ:
But they also have

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.110
a big increase in private auto.

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:36.420
So both things are happening.

00:38:40.170 --> 00:38:43.590
So retention of political
support is another challenge.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:49.320
So just keeping everyone happy
and having those stakeholders

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:53.430
in a political
constituency happy enough

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.870
to support you and
not try to defund

00:38:57.870 --> 00:39:00.030
the public
transportation sector.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:05.340
Especially-- that's critical
if public interpretation

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:08.190
is much better at serving
the most dense corridors

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:10.710
and you're only
benefiting people there.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.890
And people from, for example,
the rest of the state

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:15.630
don't see a direct benefit.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:18.600
But they're putting sales
tax into that system.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:21.480
That's a tricky
thing politically.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.030
So that's another challenge.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:28.570
So we expect to see continued
growth in the periphery.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.371
So suburbanization.

00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:32.620
Health care is getting better.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.910
So the percent of people
that are old and can't drive

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:37.270
is going up.

00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.240
And so that might
mean that we might

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.320
need more public transport.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:43.150
Technology is changing.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.300
Telecommunications is
advancing rapidly now

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.870
with all the internet of
things and sensors everywhere.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.230
We do get a lot of data.

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:54.732
And we can start using that
data to plan better systems

00:39:54.732 --> 00:39:56.440
and to analyze how
people are using them.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:59.900
And we'll get to that
later in this course.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:04.330
The public has a
higher expectation.

00:40:04.330 --> 00:40:05.980
Because you have a
smartphone and you

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.560
can know where the
bus is, you sort of

00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:10.780
are more aware of the system.

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.330
And you might start to demand
higher quality service.

00:40:13.330 --> 00:40:16.090
And if other parts of the world
or other systems are doing it

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:20.020
and mine isn't, then I'm
starting to expect that--

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:23.710
I know about it because we
share all of this information

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:25.580
through YouTube
and the internet.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:28.000
So I want the same
thing in my city.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.650
And I want the same
thing in my system.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.290
And then finally--
and this is very

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:34.660
recent-- the transportation
network company.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:39.090
So the likes of Uber and
Lyft are making a dent

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.590
on the demand and
the mobile split.

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:44.710
So this is somewhere in between
where it's not your own auto

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:46.690
and you're paying for something.

00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:49.540
You might be carpooling so
in some sense it's public,

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:50.230
but not really.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:53.590
So the other challenge
here is that a lot of these

00:40:53.590 --> 00:40:57.790
are startups that are heavily
funded by venture capital.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.540
And they are spending more
money than they can make

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.970
through their fair revenues.

00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:08.680
So it's not clear how that will
play out as the years go by

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.120
and if they can
keep their prices

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.750
and remain as competitive.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:16.070
So ingredients for
future success.

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:20.590
So again, speaking of the
political constituencies,

00:41:20.590 --> 00:41:23.020
maintaining a
supportive coalition.

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.280
So making sure that you
expand that base of people

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.900
who benefit from
public transport

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:31.360
and make the case that,
even if you're not directly

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:35.350
using public transportation, it
has economic benefit for you.

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:40.420
So that's necessary if we want
to move forward, especially

00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:44.950
with the government funding
local and state taxes

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.780
for example for
public transportation.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.050
Expand the definition
of public transport.

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:53.860
There is now a greater
variety of services

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:55.270
and more flexibility.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.550
And public
transportation systems

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.910
are starting to consider
different vehicle sizes

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.010
and partnering with
transportation network

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:11.190
companies to achieve
higher efficiencies

00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:17.880
and just target their
supply to particular demands

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.280
and densities.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.500
A greater involvement
of the private sector.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.360
So the use of transportation
network companies

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.020
is one example.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:31.620
But also partnerships
with the private sector

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:36.390
to operate bus service, so
public private partnerships.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.060
And innovative financing
and procurement techniques

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:44.440
for construction of new
lines or operations.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.370
Aggressive implementation
of new technology.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:50.020
So now, again, I said,
more sensors, more data,

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.250
better information provision.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:54.640
Tell your customers, your
passengers where the vehicles

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.560
are, what the reliability is.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.230
Make more effective decisions
like real-time operations

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:02.320
control to keep your system
operating as you planned it.

00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:05.210
We'll have an entire election
on real-time control later on.

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:08.150
And you can improve your vehicle
designs-- so all these things,

00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.650
right?

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.960
So when I refer to
improve vehicle design,

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.810
we'll talk more about
this in the next lecture.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.200
We have cleaner technologies,
more fuel efficient,

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.740
more quiet.

00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:22.840
So technology can be used
to improve the experience.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.990
And then there's the
organizational change.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:27.620
So that needs to happen.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.890
And the public sector is a
little slow in this regard.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:35.170
So greater operating staff
responsibility, accountability.

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:38.170
In many agencies, we have the
problem that it's not clear

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:40.030
who is responsible for what.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:42.400
And so whenever
some decision has

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.390
to be made, who do you
go to get that signature?

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:47.404
Who approves it?

00:43:47.404 --> 00:43:48.820
You have to talk
to several people

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.310
in different departments.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:51.700
And it just gets slow.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:53.740
So even for the simple
things, and sometimes

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:58.140
especially for simple
things, it's a little slow.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.750
So also increased
customer orientation.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.360
There's a culture, especially
in the more traditional

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:09.340
public transportation
agencies, that you run service.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:13.300
And you don't really think
about people and serving people

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.040
as if they were your customers.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.690
But that's changing.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:19.480
Some agencies, the most
cutting-edge agencies,

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.420
are really treating
people as their customers

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.200
and doing marketing and reaching
out to their customer base

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:29.770
to run surveys, understand
what makes them unhappy,

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:32.200
use that information to
make better decisions

00:44:32.200 --> 00:44:35.110
to respond to the feedback.

00:44:35.110 --> 00:44:37.890
So that's the end of my
introductory presentation.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:42.050
We're done a little early,
which is fine because today

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.950
is the first lecture.

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:46.430
So if you have questions about
any of what we talked about,

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.470
please let me know.

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.610
You might want to ask
that question right now so

00:44:49.610 --> 00:44:51.190
that other people can benefit.

00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:55.460
But if not, you can also just
come to me and we can chat.

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:57.070
Yeah, so.

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:57.570
Yeah.

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:59.530
AUDIENCE: Do you want to say a
few words about the assignment

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.510
1?

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.590
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Sure.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.270
Well, I already
did a little bit.

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:07.560
So it's an introduction
to cyclical transportation

00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:08.280
systems.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:15.970
So your first task is to
go out and go into Stellar.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:17.380
And I'm doing this on purpose.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.770
I want to make sure that
you have access to Stellar

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:21.311
because we're going
to be using that.

00:45:21.311 --> 00:45:22.950
So go to Stellar.

00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:24.126
Look at the reading.

00:45:24.126 --> 00:45:25.500
The reading is
very introductory.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.670
And it introduces you to the
idea of cycle time and headway

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.960
and all these things.

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:33.180
And that's how you
think as an engineer

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.010
of planning a public
transportation system

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:39.620
and determining how many
vehicles you need to operate

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.440
a service and the impact
of running time variability

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.970
on your system and the cost.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:49.650
So we're just getting our feet
wet with a very simple example.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.020
And I've generated
some data that you'll

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:56.460
be analyzing in a very
step-by-step fashion

00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:58.367
to sort of guide you
through that process.

00:45:58.367 --> 00:45:59.950
Later on in the
semester, you're going

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:05.340
to get real data, which is not
going to be as nicely laid out.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:09.690
And you're going to have a more
challenging task of actually

00:46:09.690 --> 00:46:12.390
planning service
using real data.

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:20.910
So this is an opportunity to get
the concepts sort of ingrained

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:25.320
and make sure you master
them before you tackle

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.450
the more challenging
task of doing it

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.760
with real data on
a messier situation

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.214
but on a more
realistic situation.

00:46:32.214 --> 00:46:34.244
AUDIENCE: How do you
wish that we submit it?

00:46:34.244 --> 00:46:35.410
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: On Stellar.

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:36.930
I don't want any
paper submissions.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.100
The other thing is--

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:39.030
so yeah.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.930
Please save your files as PDF
and upload them to Stellar.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:46.470
So the preferred
format would be PDF.

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:51.520
And the other thing you can do
for this one is a spreadsheet.

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:54.750
So if you want, you can
work on a spreadsheet.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:59.460
And just please be very clear
about here's question 1.

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:02.169
And lay it out clearly
for me and explain.

00:47:02.169 --> 00:47:03.210
There's some explanation.

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.890
Don't just plug and chug.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.610
Please explain your logic.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:07.860
A few sentences suffice.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:11.280
But explain why you
chose to do this

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:13.620
and what your calculations mean.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.290
And you can just send me the
spreadsheet instead of the PDF

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:16.980
if you want.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.830
And that could help because
I can see your work.

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:22.360
All right.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.210
He had a question.

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.876
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:47:23.876 --> 00:47:27.754
Yeah, this is sort
of a semantic thing.

00:47:27.754 --> 00:47:30.244
When you said the success
of the Houston system,

00:47:30.244 --> 00:47:33.240
what were you suggesting there?

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.350
GABRIEL SANCHEZ: Well, I mean,
demand has gone up, right?

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.751
There are many ways of measuring
the success of a system.

00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:41.250
But--

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:42.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
your bus system

00:47:42.172 --> 00:47:43.797
or is it that they
built a rail system?

00:47:43.797 --> 00:47:44.435
Or--

00:47:44.435 --> 00:47:45.810
GABRIEL SANCHEZ:
Just in general.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.180
I mean, it's a system
that was put in.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:51.880
And yeah, it could
be more successful.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.120
But people are using it.

00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:59.910
And it's having some
impact on the city.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:00.670
And it's visible.

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:07.350
So any other questions?

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:07.950
All right.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.100
Class dismissed.

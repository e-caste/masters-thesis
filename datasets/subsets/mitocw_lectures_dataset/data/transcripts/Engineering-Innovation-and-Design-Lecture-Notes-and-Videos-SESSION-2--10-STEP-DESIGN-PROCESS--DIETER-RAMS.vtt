BLADE KOTELLY: What was the
objective of the assignment?

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.039
Charlotte?

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.330
AUDIENCE: To test your product.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.381
BLADE KOTELLY: No.

00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:41.880
No.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.290
But I'm really happy
you tested my product.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.230
That was great.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.670
That was not the objective
of the assignment, though.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.996
Not 100%.

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:49.888
Ben.

00:00:49.888 --> 00:00:52.120
AUDIENCE: To see that
design is everywhere.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:52.300
BLADE KOTELLY: Yeah.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.805
That's part of it.

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:53.880
To see that design
is everywhere.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.588
So you can see all
the things that people

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:58.080
have done as well in
terms of their critiques.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.580
Christy.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.440
AUDIENCE: To start
analyzing the design.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.910
BLADE KOTELLY: To start
analyzing the design.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.350
Absolutely.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.099
And what are you
analyzing the design for?

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:06.910
OK.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.650
We can do this.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.680
What are you analyzing
the design for?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.127
Kenny.

00:01:09.127 --> 00:01:10.021
AUDIENCE: Do you
mean for what product

00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:11.584
are we analyzing
the design or are

00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:12.710
you thinking why
are we analyzing?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.543
BLADE KOTELLY: Oh, let's
talk about the why.

00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:16.223
Why are you analyzing design?

00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:17.878
AUDIENCE: So we can
incorporate what

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:20.953
we're learning into things
that we design [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:22.380
and what we design ourselves.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.590
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.380
You're going to incorporate
the things you're

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.380
learning in terms of being
able to do an analysis

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.910
and work it in somehow
to when you're designing.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:29.826
Isabella.

00:01:29.826 --> 00:01:31.867
AUDIENCE: To understand
effective and ineffective

00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:32.624
designs.

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:34.415
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, to
see what designs work

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:35.460
and what designs don't work.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.459
Now this is interesting.

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:39.019
You used one product.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:40.560
There weren't two
different products.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.393
You didn't say, well
this was a good design,

00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:43.610
this was a bad one.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.754
You said, within one product,
what was good and what was bad?

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:49.420
Other reasons why we
might have done it?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.470
If you get really good at being
able to critique other designs,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.500
you'll be able to be really good
at critiquing your own designs.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.310
So what you'll do
over the semester

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.430
is learn a whole
bunch about this.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.560
And at the end of
the semester, I

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.580
want you to look at the
same video you've made

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.230
and it see how you
could make it better.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.960
Let's see what comes
to mind about that.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.250
Do you have a comment, Joel?

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.244
JOEL SCHINDALL: No, just
watching the answers.

00:02:22.244 --> 00:02:23.410
BLADE KOTELLY: OK, so here--

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.250
JOEL SCHINDALL: But
actually, I think

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.680
whoever answered early in
it-- an awareness of design

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.780
so that as you go-- this course
actually takes place not just

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.480
in the two hours
that you're here

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.480
but in the hours in a week minus
hours that you're here that you

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.040
spend the rest of your lives.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.190
And we intend to project it
out there and have you actually

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.020
be aware during your
life of what design is.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.104
That's what's going to
make you a better designer.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:51.853
BLADE KOTELLY: OK.

00:02:51.853 --> 00:02:54.160
So, we're going to get
right into the meat of this.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.710
This is the 10-Step
Design Process.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.730
This is the core of what
we're going to be teaching.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.360
You'll use this process over
and over and over again.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.050
It's a great process to know.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.950
You might find that it
appears on pop quizzes.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.230
You might find it
appears on pop quizzes.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.985
And it might be something
that if you wrote on a card

00:03:17.985 --> 00:03:21.470
and you put in your
wallet and kept with you,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.940
you might be allowed
to use on a pop quiz.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.530
Just saying.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.372
It might be on many pop quizzes.

00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:35.080
But it might not.

00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:39.180
OK.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.260
So we start with these
first beginning steps.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.810
Number one, we want
to identify the needs

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.290
and really understand
the problem.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.109
In our last class I gave
you a design challenge.

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.150
So this is the first step,
identifying the needs.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.600
What is the problem we're
really trying to solve?

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.800
And if we can get
underneath that

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.750
we can design something in
a much more impactful way.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.010
So let's talk about this
interesting example here.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.090
I had a teacher as
an undergraduate

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.910
who designed a toothbrush.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.329
Now, I'll show you a picture.

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.410
This is Napoleon's toothbrush.

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.200
Napoleon Bonaparte
used this toothbrush.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.460
A long time ago.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.400
If you bought a toothbrush
in the '60s or something,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.830
you'd buy a toothbrush
that looked like this.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.700
Does that look
familiar to people?

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.762
Yeah, OK.

00:04:37.762 --> 00:04:39.720
He designed a toothbrush
that looked like this.

00:04:42.314 --> 00:04:43.980
That's his design,
the Reach toothbrush.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.990
Who's heard of the
Reach toothbrush?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.560
OK.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.540
And there are a lot
of different versions

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.390
that they wound up
making over time.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.540
But that's the early
version of the toothbrush.

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.020
People brush longer
and more thoroughly

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.570
based on the design of
the toothbrush alone--

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.060
with no instructions.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.980
Here's what happened.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.110
If you have a toothbrush and
it's a flat head toothbrush

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.890
like the one we showed you
before here-- like that-- you

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.450
hold it, you start brushing
your teeth like this.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.720
And you see people
can do this all day.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.100
They can watch a
sitcom with doing this

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.070
to their front
teeth, no problem.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.980
Very comfortable.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.850
But if they need to brush
other parts of their mouth--

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.400
and they do-- they do this.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.060
They take this.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.300
I'm going to represent
the bristles with my thumb

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.510
and hold the handle like this.

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.720
They brush their teeth
like this and then

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.560
they get their rear molars
like this on the side.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.630
And they want to get
the upper rear molars

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.660
on their sub dominant hand side.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.620
Which means they do this.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:46.250
Right?

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:47.200
I'm writing, so I do this.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.533
So everyone, if you're a
righty, put your right hand up.

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:51.242
If you're a lefty,
put your left hand up.

00:05:51.242 --> 00:05:53.450
Take your hand, make a fist
like that with your thumb

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.100
out, curve your wrist over,
and bring it across like that.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.920
Now hold this.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.689
Is that comfortable?

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:02.105
This is not a
comfortable position

00:06:02.105 --> 00:06:03.313
for your arm to be in, right?

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:04.040
OK.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.700
So as a result, people do this.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.590
And if you watch them
do it, they do this

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.700
and they go, ugh,
they get bored.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.340
And they stop brushing.

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.310
That's not good.

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:19.260
So this teacher, this professor
I had, to understand this,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.480
he did some studies.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:23.300
He had people stain
their teeth red.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.990
And then, with no mirror,
he said, brush your teeth.

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.400
And people would brush it.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.941
And then he'd look
inside their mouth

00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:32.650
and see the red was all
of the front and all

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:35.330
stuck in that part in the back.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:36.460
He said, that's no good.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.200
So he designed this thing.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.530
In fact, there's a ton of
innovations around this.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:42.520
Different handle.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.650
You see this side.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.110
Your thumb sits in that
groove really easily.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.870
In fact, you'll turn that
toothbrush 90 degrees

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.690
and your thumb will
rest right there.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.250
You do it automatically.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.200
You'll do it
automatically like this.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.550
And this is thin over
here at an angle.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.582
So it doesn't pull your
cheek out like this .

00:07:03.582 --> 00:07:05.040
That's not very
comfortable, right?

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.540
OK.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.287
So he did that.

00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:07.620
The head was shaped differently.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.860
Instead of doing a square
head, it's now tapered,

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.750
the bristles are
shaped differently.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.330
So here's the question.

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.430
What was the underlying
problem he was trying to solve?

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.693
Kristen.

00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:24.577
AUDIENCE: The fact
that people weren't

00:07:24.577 --> 00:07:28.846
able to reach their
back teeth properly.

00:07:28.846 --> 00:07:30.220
BLADE KOTELLY:
That was a problem

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.310
he was trying to solve but
it wasn't the underlying

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.601
problem he was trying to solve.

00:07:36.246 --> 00:07:37.787
AUDIENCE: The fact
that people didn't

00:07:37.787 --> 00:07:38.960
want to brush their teeth.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.553
BLADE KOTELLY: The
fact that people

00:07:39.553 --> 00:07:40.928
didn't want to
brush their teeth.

00:07:40.928 --> 00:07:43.196
That's a problem that
he was helping with

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.820
but that wasn't the
underlying problem.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.287
David.

00:07:48.287 --> 00:07:49.650
AUDIENCE: People with bad teeth.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.191
BLADE KOTELLY: People
have bad teeth?

00:07:51.191 --> 00:07:54.450
People with bad teeth--
not the underlying problem.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:54.995
[? Cosi? ?]

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:56.578
AUDIENCE: The design
of the toothbrush

00:07:56.578 --> 00:07:57.662
hadn't changed in a while.

00:07:57.662 --> 00:07:59.453
BLADE KOTELLY: The
design of the toothbrush

00:07:59.453 --> 00:08:01.070
hadn't changed in
a while and we're

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.990
getting closer now to
the underlying problem.

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.060
Because we saw that Napoleon
had a toothbrush very

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.100
similar to the toothbrush that
you could buy in the '60s.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:13.130
A small difference though, his
was they said silver-plated,

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.470
I think.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.194
Anyone here own a
silver-plated toothbrush?

00:08:18.194 --> 00:08:19.540
OK.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.890
Yes, Dennis?

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.810
AUDIENCE: The functionality
of the toothbrush?

00:08:22.810 --> 00:08:24.570
BLADE KOTELLY: The
functionality of the toothbrush.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:26.570
He definitely wanted to
change the functionality

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.240
of the toothbrush but it
wasn't the underlying thing.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:29.913
Louis?

00:08:29.913 --> 00:08:33.350
AUDIENCE: Was it to simply
build a better toothbrush?

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:36.189
BLADE KOTELLY: It was about
building a better toothbrush

00:08:36.189 --> 00:08:37.730
but that's not the
underlying reason.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:41.556
[? Shuni. ?]

00:08:41.556 --> 00:08:43.097
AUDIENCE: An
uncomfortable toothbrush

00:08:43.097 --> 00:08:45.799
was leading to poor
brushing habits.

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:46.590
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:48.215
But we're not getting
to the underlying

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:51.150
reason, what made him do this.

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.650
Emily.

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.285
AUDIENCE: Was it low
toothbrush sales?

00:08:54.285 --> 00:08:55.660
BLADE KOTELLY:
Well, interesting.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.490
It wasn't-- we're
getting very close now--

00:08:57.490 --> 00:09:00.690
it wasn't low toothbrush
sales, per se.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:05.330
But by doing that
he did make somebody

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:10.397
happy by increasing the
number of toothbrush sales.

00:09:10.397 --> 00:09:12.480
AUDIENCE: People have loads
of cavities back here?

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.080
BLADE KOTELLY: Oh, cavities.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.371
No, we're getting further away.

00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:16.440
Cavities is cooler.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.806
Sales is warmer.

00:09:18.806 --> 00:09:19.305
Patrick.

00:09:19.305 --> 00:09:20.796
AUDIENCE: The ability
to increase the price

00:09:20.796 --> 00:09:22.280
on the toothbrushes
that are new?

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.000
BLADE KOTELLY:
Increasing the price

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.270
of toothbrushes that are new.

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:25.940
That's interesting.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.266
Kind of.

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:27.820
Kind of.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.970
It's actually-- they
would have been happy

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.234
if the toothbrushes
were the same price.

00:09:34.234 --> 00:09:35.650
AUDIENCE: I mean,
but you're like,

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.130
trying to get people to
believe that it's worth

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.370
what you're paying for.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.320
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.820
For what though?

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.500
For this for that
particular toothbrush.

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.850
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:48.230
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:51.050
It's a little bit-- it's a
shade of meaning difference.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:52.246
I think your close.

AUDIENCE: To design
the best toothbrush?

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:54.550
BLADE KOTELLY:
Well, he definitely

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.050
wanted to design
the best toothbrush

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:57.710
and he did at the time.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:59.630
But we're now getting colder.

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.130
[? Cosi? ?]

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:01.390
AUDIENCE: So they
can make money?

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:01.920
BLADE KOTELLY:
Oh, to make money.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.560
Yes.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.420
To make money.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.970
Absolutely.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:06.747
For whom?

00:10:06.747 --> 00:10:07.580
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.637
BLADE KOTELLY: For who?

00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:09.830
AUDIENCE: For himself.

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:10.430
BLADE KOTELLY: For himself.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:10.929
No.

00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:12.920
He's a designer.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.850
Designers don't make
much money, it turns out.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:16.770
Some do.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:18.000
Some designers make money.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.750
Not a whole bunch of
designers make money.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.509
And they paid him a
fee to do this work.

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:24.550
They don't get residuals.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.190
Like if you make a movie and
you're a famous movie star,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.940
you get residuals.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.240
Designers don't get residuals.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.965
They should.

00:10:30.965 --> 00:10:32.290
Definitely.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:32.790
Ben?

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.114
AUDIENCE: Stakeholders?

00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:35.280
BLADE KOTELLY: Stakeholders.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.050
Yes, stakeholders, yes,
that's kind of close.

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.450
A little bit too far back.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:42.618
But if you tell me
which stakeholders.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:43.550
AUDIENCE: Company.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.758
BLADE KOTELLY: Which company?

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.630
AUDIENCE: Did he just not
like brushing his teeth?

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:53.255
BLADE KOTELLY: I don't think he
cared about brushing his teeth.

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:56.000
He was hired by a company
who said, hey, John.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.080
We make blank.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.580
We want you to make
something that's

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.050
going to sell a lot of blank.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:02.883
Can you fill in the blank?

00:11:02.883 --> 00:11:03.830
AUDIENCE: Toothpaste?

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:04.620
BLADE KOTELLY: Not toothpaste.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.430
That's a great idea.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.263
It's not toothpaste.

00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.640
Emily.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.514
AUDIENCE: Is it the
nylon, like the bristles?

00:11:13.514 --> 00:11:14.710
BLADE KOTELLY: It is nylon.

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:16.060
It is the bristles.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.230
Nylon is made by whom?

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:19.480
DuPont.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.410
Nylon bristles started
coming out in, I think, 1936.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:27.320
And they, DuPont
loves to sell nylon.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.901
And they said, hey John, we
want to sell a lot of nylon.

00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:32.400
Can you do something that going
to help sell a lot of nylon?

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.010
And they asked him to do this.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.990
So what he did is he looked
around the world and he said,

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:44.436
what in the world
is made of nylon?

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:46.270
It's a lot of research
just to figure out

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.640
what's made of nylon.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.000
What hasn't been redesigned in
a long time that's made of nylon

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.620
that I could redesign?

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.010
Hey, what hasn't been redesigned
in a long time, that's

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.120
sold all over the
world, made of nylon,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.122
has existing manufacturing
capabilities,

00:12:01.122 --> 00:12:03.330
so it's really easy to make
a small modification that

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.230
will sell a ton of nylon.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.730
Answer?

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.310
Toothbrush.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.990
So he made a toothbrush
and he improved the design.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.530
And they made a tremendous
number of changes

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:16.840
to the toothbrush in the
first design he made.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.110
And they kept releasing
them slowly over time.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.110
So people get used to it,
buy more toothbrushes,

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.420
buy more nylon.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.720
Cool, right?

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.842
So understand the
underlying reason.

00:12:26.842 --> 00:12:29.050
If you said, I want to sell--
if someone said to you,

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.100
I want to sell a
lot of nylon, it's

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.962
hard to figure out what to
do to sell a lot of nylon.

00:12:33.962 --> 00:12:35.880
And that was his approach.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.530
So what's the real problem here?

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:38.360
Information phase.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.280
What in the world exists
that can inform us

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.130
about this problem?

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.710
So what kind of things might
you do to understand a problem?

00:12:52.472 --> 00:12:53.180
AUDIENCE: Google.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.930
BLADE KOTELLY: You
can use Google.

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:54.922
Excellent.

00:12:54.922 --> 00:12:56.880
What else might you do
to understand a problem?

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.520
AUDIENCE: Talk to people who
are suffering from the problem.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.020
BLADE KOTELLY: Talk to people.

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:00.980
Do market research.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.060
Excellent.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.506
You might even look
at adjacent problems.

00:13:04.506 --> 00:13:06.130
Problems that are
not exactly the same.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.300
So if you're doing a
toothbrush redesign,

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:09.800
what other kinds
of things might you

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.410
look at to help
inform you about how

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:13.660
to design a better toothbrush?

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.213
Emily.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:18.060
AUDIENCE: Hair brush design.

00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:18.700
BLADE KOTELLY:
Hair brush design.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:19.650
Absolutely.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.002
Why?

00:13:21.002 --> 00:13:22.946
AUDIENCE: Might have
similar problems

00:13:22.946 --> 00:13:24.127
dealing with the product.

00:13:24.127 --> 00:13:25.210
BLADE KOTELLY: Absolutely.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.786
What else?

00:13:26.786 --> 00:13:28.084
AUDIENCE: Dental floss.

00:13:28.084 --> 00:13:29.250
BLADE KOTELLY: Dental floss.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:31.610
So you might figure out
what dental floss does well.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.194
In fact, there's a
dental floss device

00:13:33.194 --> 00:13:34.735
that looks kind of
like a toothbrush.

00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:35.610
It's got a handle.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:39.760
It's got a little small piece of
floss and you use it like this.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.700
So that's another way
of considering it.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:44.300
Excellent.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:45.350
Stakeholder phase.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.780
This is really important.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.530
What's wanted and who wants it?

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.330
Just because you
can make it doesn't

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.960
mean that people want it.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.060
Who knows what a VCR is?

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.750
Great.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:03.120
This example won't work one day.

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:03.620
OK.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.610
So here's the question.

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:11.540
If I made a VCR, what functions
would it have to have.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:13.410
I'll start you off.

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:15.485
Play.

00:14:15.485 --> 00:14:16.110
AUDIENCE: Stop.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.965
BLADE KOTELLY: Stop.

00:14:16.965 --> 00:14:17.380
AUDIENCE: Rewind.

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.140
BLADE KOTELLY: Rewind.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:18.540
And?

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.130
AUDIENCE: Fast forward.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:19.730
BLADE KOTELLY: Fast forward.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:20.230
What else?

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.180
AUDIENCE: Eject.

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:21.300
BLADE KOTELLY: Eject.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.942
That's great because
otherwise the tape

00:14:22.942 --> 00:14:24.480
is sitting stuck in there.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.060
Wow, it's an awesome
tape I keep using.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.816
I've watched "Tron" 145 times.

00:14:29.816 --> 00:14:31.047
AUDIENCE: Open.

00:14:31.047 --> 00:14:32.130
BLADE KOTELLY: What is it?

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.087
AUDIENCE: Open.

00:14:33.087 --> 00:14:35.170
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes, so we
have an eject mechanism.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.094
Pause.

00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:36.760
AUDIENCE: Power.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.634
BLADE KOTELLY: Power.

00:14:37.634 --> 00:14:38.650
AUDIENCE: Record.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:39.846
BLADE KOTELLY: Power, yes.

00:14:39.846 --> 00:14:40.555
AUDIENCE: Record.

00:14:40.555 --> 00:14:41.471
BLADE KOTELLY: Record.

00:14:41.471 --> 00:14:42.145
That's great.

00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:44.103
AUDIENCE: Some of them
have the little displays

00:14:44.103 --> 00:14:44.959
with like the time.

00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:45.750
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:48.165
I need a flashing 12:00.

00:14:48.165 --> 00:14:49.240
Let's do flash 12:00.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:49.740
OK.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:51.629
So, a time.

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:53.170
Why do we have a
time display at all?

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.808
Why was there ever a
time display on a VCR?

00:14:55.808 --> 00:14:57.519
AUDIENCE: So you know
long is the tape.

00:14:57.519 --> 00:14:58.560
BLADE KOTELLY: Well, yes.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.160
So we have some
sort of a method.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:02.596
That actually is separate.

00:15:02.596 --> 00:15:04.470
To position the tape,
I just use the counter.

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:07.410
It might go up to a thousand
or something-- or more.

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:09.500
The counter might tell me
a position of the tape.

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.310
What'd the time tell me?

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.500
Besides the time.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.050
AUDIENCE: How long
you've watched.

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.290
BLADE KOTELLY: It could tell me
how long I've been watching it.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:16.745
It might allow me
to do something.

00:15:16.745 --> 00:15:17.870
AUDIENCE: Timed recordings.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.400
BLADE KOTELLY: Timed recordings.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.020
I could not have to be
home and I could set my VCR

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.040
to record channel
four-- because back then

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:29.780
we only had five
channels-- channel four

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.190
and that would record
that at 5:00 PM

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:34.920
when I didn't get
home till 7:00.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:36.310
Big deal.

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:37.770
It was before DVRs.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.480
Amazing.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.050
What else?

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.500
OK.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.375
I like that list too.

00:15:45.375 --> 00:15:50.330
So, let's suppose I made a VCR
and it had all these features

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:54.710
on it but I took
away one feature.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:16:01.860
I took away the ability
for you to record.

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.550
Show of hands, who thinks
that's still useful?

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.540
Who thinks it's useless.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.040
OK.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.630
Why is it still useful?

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:10.368
A VCR that cannot record.

00:16:10.368 --> 00:16:13.236
AUDIENCE: Because
that ability is

00:16:13.236 --> 00:16:17.060
pretty-- it's decoupled
from the other--

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:19.317
from the other functions.

00:16:19.317 --> 00:16:21.900
BLADE KOTELLY: But why would I
want a VCR that doesn't record?

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.469
AUDIENCE: So you
can watch movies?

00:16:23.469 --> 00:16:25.010
BLADE KOTELLY: So
I can watch movies.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:26.510
When would I want to
watch movies, but not

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:27.551
be able to record things?

00:16:27.551 --> 00:16:28.780
AUDIENCE: When you rent them.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:30.113
BLADE KOTELLY: When I rent them.

00:16:30.113 --> 00:16:32.710
Or when I bring them to
a ski condo or something.

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.400
I go to someone else's
place, we bring up videotapes

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.150
and then people can
watch the video tapes.

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.200
Right?

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:38.760
Great.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:41.705
And what's the benefit of
not having that record head

00:16:41.705 --> 00:16:42.330
in the machine?

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.630
Because it's a record
head and a playhead.

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:47.195
AUDIENCE: It saves you a
lot of money manufacturing.

00:16:47.195 --> 00:16:49.570
BLADE KOTELLY: It saves you
a lot of money manufacturing.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:51.640
You can pass that savings
on to the consumer.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.200
Because these are two
different objects.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.530
OK.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:57.710
What if I took out,
instead of the record head,

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:58.720
I took out the playhead.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.490
Who thinks that's useful?

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:02.930
Who thinks it's useless?

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:03.880
You're all wrong.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:05.713
No, it's you're all
right, in a certain way.

00:17:05.713 --> 00:17:07.579
Why do you think it's useless?

00:17:07.579 --> 00:17:09.280
I can't play videotape.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.069
Why is it useless?

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.957
AUDIENCE: Because you
can record something.

00:17:10.957 --> 00:17:12.290
You can't watch it.

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.164
BLADE KOTELLY: As soon
as I record something,

00:17:14.164 --> 00:17:15.150
I can't watch it.

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.022
Kind of a weird
thing to do, right?

00:17:17.022 --> 00:17:19.230
Oh, I can't wait to watch
this thing when I get home.

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:20.150
I've recorded it.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.720
Now what?

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.150
I have no idea.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:24.200
But think of it this way.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.020
What if I had a
business and my business

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:35.840
was a video
duplication business.

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.001
You gave me one videotape and
I'd make thousands for you.

00:17:40.001 --> 00:17:42.450
You know at graduation
they shoot people

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:43.330
when they walk down.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:47.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.946
BLADE KOTELLY: With a camera.

00:17:48.946 --> 00:17:52.280
They shoot people when they walk
down and receive their diploma

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.580
and they shake hands.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:56.770
So, they have you on videotape.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.900
And what if people want
to order videotapes?

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.130
They want to duplicate them.

00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:03.420
Or back when you used to
buy videotapes, as a kid

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:07.520
perhaps, you bought "Bambi"
and you wanted to get a copy.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:14.900
Well, there's some room where
there's a machine and it plays.

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.310
And there are thousands
of machines that record.

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:21.740
Thousands.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:23.030
They can record and rewind.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:24.840
They can do nothing else.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.550
They record and they rewind.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:28.460
And that's all they do.

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.500
That's the whole thing.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.999
And so it's a lot
cheaper for people

00:18:30.999 --> 00:18:33.830
to buy thousands of those things
without the playhead or fast

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:35.070
forward or anything else.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:37.720
You can really make it a
much less expensive product.

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.886
So, just because you can
do it and you can put it on

00:18:39.886 --> 00:18:42.190
there doesn't mean you should.

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.674
So, stakeholder phase is
also a little bit bigger.

00:18:44.674 --> 00:18:46.090
Who are the possible
stakeholders?

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:47.280
We talked about this
a little bit before.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.970
I think Ben brought it up,
saying that the stakeholder can

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:53.760
be shareholders or
they could be people

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.480
who are related to the design
in some method, some aspect.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:03.095
Whether it's-- in this class.

00:19:03.095 --> 00:19:05.750
Let's take this
class, for example.

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:11.020
Who are your stakeholders
in this class?

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.806
Who's the primary stakeholder?

00:19:12.806 --> 00:19:13.800
AUDIENCE: Ourselves.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.620
BLADE KOTELLY: You.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.430
You're the primary stakeholder.

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.630
Who's another stakeholder?

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.412
AUDIENCE: Parents.

00:19:18.412 --> 00:19:19.370
BLADE KOTELLY: Parents.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.182
Why?

00:19:20.182 --> 00:19:21.896
AUDIENCE: Because
they're paying for it.

00:19:21.896 --> 00:19:23.770
BLADE KOTELLY: Because
they're paying for it.

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.603
And they want to get
some value out of that.

00:19:25.603 --> 00:19:26.360
Who else?

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.060
AUDIENCE: Staff.

00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.935
BLADE KOTELLY: Staff.

00:19:27.935 --> 00:19:28.490
Which staff?

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.350
AUDIENCE: All of you guys.

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.930
BLADE KOTELLY: All of us.

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:31.141
So we're all stakeholders.

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:33.390
AUDIENCE: You all want to
see this class be a success.

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.550
BLADE KOTELLY: No.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.050
We want to see you be success.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:35.697
It's different.

00:19:35.697 --> 00:19:36.280
AUDIENCE: Aww.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.113
BLADE KOTELLY: I don't
care about the class.

00:19:38.113 --> 00:19:39.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:40.230
It's true.

00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:41.220
AUDIENCE: I believe it.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.620
BLADE KOTELLY: The class
could be a massive failure,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.490
but if you're successful,
and we've helped

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:46.390
you do that, then
we've been successful.

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.015
That's our job, to
make you successful.

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:52.973
What other stakeholders
do you have?

00:19:52.973 --> 00:19:53.779
AUDIENCE: MIT.

00:19:53.779 --> 00:19:54.570
BLADE KOTELLY: MIT.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:56.030
How's MIT a stakeholder?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.530
What?

00:19:56.530 --> 00:19:58.196
AUDIENCE: They're
putting us on their CW

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:00.370
so they get more
attention to MIT--

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:01.790
BLADE KOTELLY: Well, maybe so
they can get more attention

00:20:01.790 --> 00:20:03.370
or maybe so they
can share the ideas

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.534
with people who can't be in
this room with all of you.

00:20:07.534 --> 00:20:09.450
So maybe there are two
different stakeholders.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.450
Maybe there's people that
want to get money from

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.260
and say, look at
this cool class!

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.630
I hope they think it's cool.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.340
Or maybe there are
people who say,

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.090
I really wanted to
hear about that lecture

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.420
that I can't get to.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.610
John's brother can't get
to this lecture today.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:23.990
Wanted to.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.050
Can't do it.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:27.196
So he's a stakeholder as
well of the recording.

00:20:27.196 --> 00:20:28.570
So lots of
stakeholders and we'll

00:20:28.570 --> 00:20:32.030
be discussing this next class.

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:33.850
Now we do
planning/operational research.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:34.710
What's realistic?

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.640
What limits us?

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.250
If we want to make
something, what limits

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.570
do we have whenever
we make something?

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:42.430
AUDIENCE: Cost.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.010
BLADE KOTELLY: Cost.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:43.509
Sure.

00:20:43.509 --> 00:20:46.795
What do you mean by cost?

00:20:46.795 --> 00:20:48.822
AUDIENCE: The cost
of manufacturing.

00:20:48.822 --> 00:20:50.530
BLADE KOTELLY: The
cost of manufacturing.

00:20:50.530 --> 00:20:51.614
What about software?

00:20:51.614 --> 00:20:53.530
Does it cost anything
to manufacture software?

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:54.230
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.794
BLADE KOTELLY:
What does it cost?

00:20:55.794 --> 00:20:57.240
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:59.110
BLADE KOTELLY: For
the-- well, yes.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:01.780
Let's call that the design
development portion.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.401
But how about the
manufacturing of it?

00:21:03.401 --> 00:21:04.900
Because if I
manufacture toothbrush,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.235
I've designed and
developed it and now I

00:21:06.235 --> 00:21:07.530
could have machines
that are stamping out

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.200
toothbrushes and putting
bristles all on stuff.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.110
How about software?

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.530
Any cost of software?

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.830
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:14.880
A lot less.

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.880
There is a cost, though.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.046
Because I gotta pay somebody
to host it and somebody

00:21:18.046 --> 00:21:19.970
to-- every time you
download software,

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.580
it costs a little bit of money
and that begins to add up.

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.394
So yes.

00:21:23.394 --> 00:21:24.707
AUDIENCE: Cost of memory--

00:21:24.707 --> 00:21:25.790
BLADE KOTELLY: Absolutely.

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:26.290
Yes.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.900
So there are costs
involved that can limit us.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.552
What else?

00:21:30.552 --> 00:21:31.460
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.520
BLADE KOTELLY: Time.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.100
What kind of time?

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.390
AUDIENCE: When you're in
the-- basically any stage,

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:41.196
you have a certain amount
of time to get this done,

00:21:41.196 --> 00:21:43.004
so you've got deadlines to meet.

00:21:43.004 --> 00:21:44.550
Plus, if you're
paying people to work

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:46.299
for you, the longer
they're working on it,

00:21:46.299 --> 00:21:48.479
the more that turns
into money later.

00:21:48.479 --> 00:21:49.270
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.960
So there are lots
of costs involved.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.320
I'm sorry, lots of
time costs involved.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.200
So the time it
takes for something

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.330
to be executed upon to the
time we have to execute it.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.920
In classes, you're
often limited by time.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.560
If you had an infinite
amount of time,

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.180
you could learn the material
much more easily, probably.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:09.952
What else are we limited by?

00:22:09.952 --> 00:22:11.660
AUDIENCE: Finite amount
of raw materials.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:12.993
BLADE KOTELLY: Materials, right.

00:22:12.993 --> 00:22:17.380
And materials can come
in a lot of versions.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:20.470
Resources can be
physical resources,

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:22.600
they can be people
resources, they

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.080
can be environmental resources
that we have access to.

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:27.538
Anything else?

00:22:27.538 --> 00:22:28.960
AUDIENCE: Technical
capabilities.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:29.410
BLADE KOTELLY: Abilities.

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:30.340
Knowledge.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:32.160
We can be limited by knowledge.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.860
So we have a team--
a brilliant team.

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.240
You're all brilliant people.

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.430
Who here knows the
process of opening

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.120
a restaurant that's successful?

00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:42.620
OK.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:45.760
So right now we're limited by
a certain level of knowledge.

00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:49.340
If we all decided to open a
successful restaurant tomorrow,

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.550
but you are all
brilliant people,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.990
so maybe we could figure
it out very quickly.

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.540
Maybe not.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:55.600
Maybe we'd find
someone who's already

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:57.160
opened a successful
restaurant to let

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.460
us know all the
things we should know

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.360
and short circuit that amount
of failure time we have.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:03.030
OK.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:06.300
So, from there we go
into a hazard analysis.

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.090
And we're thinking
about here, what's safe?

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:10.820
Or what can go wrong?

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.390
So in classical design, let's
say it's a baby's high chair.

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:17.410
I might say, well,
if the baby can

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.727
slip underneath the high
chair, that's not safe.

00:23:20.727 --> 00:23:22.310
So you gotta keep
that from happening.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:25.470
If I'm designing a
stock trading system,

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.650
where online you get
to buy stock or maybe

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:30.110
call over the phone.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.530
You say, buy 100 shares of
Microsoft at the market price.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.014
What could go wrong?

00:23:37.014 --> 00:23:37.680
AUDIENCE: Fraud.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.555
BLADE KOTELLY: Fraud.

00:23:38.555 --> 00:23:40.359
What kind of fraud?

00:23:40.359 --> 00:23:42.299
AUDIENCE: Someone
impersonates someone else

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:44.340
BLADE KOTELLY: So we have
a security issue there.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:45.280
We don't know if you are you.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:46.484
What else can go wrong?

00:23:46.484 --> 00:23:49.448
AUDIENCE: In terms of how
you design the website

00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:50.930
or whatever else--
the interface--

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:53.400
if it's really easy
to make mistakes.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.890
Say, an extra zero somewhere.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.960
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.550
What if I put a number in
and I don't put the dots

00:23:59.550 --> 00:24:00.705
and I have two zeros.

00:24:03.612 --> 00:24:06.116
It's a bit more than
a rounding error.

00:24:06.116 --> 00:24:10.670
In fact, a friend of mine
just made a piece of software

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:12.720
where you can pay-- you
walk into a restaurant

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.720
and if they have the
software running,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:17.130
you can walk in to say,
I'm here at the restaurant.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.487
And then when you want to
leave, if a bunch of you

00:24:19.487 --> 00:24:21.320
are all eating together,
so we're all eating

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.560
and we want to split
the bill differently,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.405
and he ordered something,
the very expensive caviar,

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:29.280
and she ordered the very
expensive champagne,

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.190
and she ordered the
very inexpensive fries,

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:36.640
and she ordered the somewhat
moderately expensive chicken,

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.224
and I didn't order anything.

00:24:38.224 --> 00:24:39.890
Well, we want to split
the bill somehow.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.150
Well, they make it
very easy to do it.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:46.952
But they were just testing it
in real life and for a server,

00:24:46.952 --> 00:24:49.160
the server came over said,
let me see how to do this.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.576
And he said, sure
let me show you.

00:24:50.576 --> 00:24:54.520
The server entered in the
numbers for how much we had.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.280
But it came out
to a huge number.

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:00.130
Much more expensive.

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:03.050
100 times more expensive.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.650
Because servers, on these
point of sale systems

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.120
that they press in, they
don't enter the decimal point.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.570
Because it's faster to
just type in the numbers

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.020
and enter two zeros.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:16.640
So his system required that
you enter a decimal point.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:19.090
And he realized, oh, gotta
change that behavior.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.560
So what can go wrong.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.600
We think about in
this hazard analysis,

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.205
which is lots of things.

00:25:25.205 --> 00:25:26.830
And so when you're
designing something,

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:29.350
you want to think of
what can go wrong.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:31.020
In software, we have bugs.

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:34.165
Bugs can go wrong and we
try to mitigate for that.

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:36.400
In physical design,
it can be unsafe.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.214
Someone's hand could
be caught something.

00:25:38.214 --> 00:25:39.380
They could pinch their hand.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.380
It could cause injury.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.522
From that, we do a
specifications phase to really

00:25:43.522 --> 00:25:44.230
sit down say, OK.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:45.580
What is required?

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.500
What's required of
this design without

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:52.790
any specific instructions
of how to design it?

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.180
What's required?

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.320
So in this phase,
we really sit down

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.710
to figure out what
we need to do.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:02.380
But we haven't said
what to do yet.

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.550
We go on to creative design.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.550
Who here knows
how to brainstorm?

00:26:07.550 --> 00:26:10.010
Who here does not know
how to brainstorm?

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:10.510
OK.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:11.480
Brainstorming is
really important

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.354
and we'll talk about
this a little bit later.

00:26:13.354 --> 00:26:15.244
How you brainstorm
is important as well.

00:26:15.244 --> 00:26:16.910
This is the part where
we begin to think

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.950
about all the different
things that are possible.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.950
And if you're working
with a good team or people

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.650
you like a lot, it's
easier to come up

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:25.660
with really interesting ideas.

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.040
They may be terrible ideas but
they may be very interesting.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.606
And that's OK.

00:26:30.606 --> 00:26:32.980
From there, we start narrowing
down to conceptual design.

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.670
What are the potential
solutions that we can make?

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:41.410
So we might have a few different
ones that look pretty good.

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:43.106
But they may not work together.

00:26:43.106 --> 00:26:44.730
We might say look,
we go down one path,

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.600
we can't go down the other path.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.207
They are mutually exclusive.

00:26:48.207 --> 00:26:49.790
Or if we try to do
both paths, they're

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.460
very hard to do together.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.800
So we narrow down
the concepts and then

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.000
we say, OK, we're going
to pick something.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.060
At this phase, you
might just say,

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.130
let's pick whatever
one we want to.

00:27:01.130 --> 00:27:05.030
Or you might have a process
for picking a design.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.960
You might ask
experts to help you

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.260
pick which approach to take.

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.540
You might do market research.

00:27:10.540 --> 00:27:12.289
You might do a whole
bunch of other things

00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:16.000
to figure out which
one you prototype.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.360
And lastly, the last
step is verification.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.880
And I don't mean
quality assurance.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.340
I don't mean does it work
to the specification.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.080
Of course we expect it to
work as we want it to work.

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.240
But I mean, do people like?

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:28.980
Can they use it?

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:30.470
Do they want to use it?

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:32.797
Is it emotionally and
intellectually compelling?

00:27:32.797 --> 00:27:33.630
Does it makes sense?

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:36.590
Does it connect with
people on these two levels?

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.800
And that goes right down
to very small things.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:42.006
To parts and cars.

00:27:42.006 --> 00:27:44.380
Goes to things that are consumer
products and things that

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:46.850
are less obvious in terms
of being consumer products.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:56.580
And we have an end solution but
is it an end solution, really?

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.470
What solutions or products
do you know that cannot be

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:01.630
improved upon?

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:02.210
Any ideas?

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.100
That's pretty good.

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:08.120
Maybe there is
something out there.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.550
But I like the idea that
we can improve on anything.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.120
So end solutions mean if there's
more room for improvement,

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.480
we go back and do the whole
process all over again.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.215
Let's map this to
cooking dinner.

00:28:19.215 --> 00:28:22.390
Who here has cooked dinner?

00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:25.586
Who has never cooked
anything in their life?

00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:28.200
Ah, it's worth cooking.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.700
You'll like.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:29.920
It will make you less hungry.

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.934
So let's start off.

00:28:32.934 --> 00:28:34.350
We're going to
identify the needs.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.695
What is the underlying
reason that we cook dinner?

00:28:37.695 --> 00:28:38.844
AUDIENCE: Hunger.

00:28:38.844 --> 00:28:39.760
BLADE KOTELLY: Hunger.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.032
Because we're hungry.

00:28:41.032 --> 00:28:42.740
What other underlying
reasons could there

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.984
be for cooking dinner?

00:28:43.984 --> 00:28:45.400
AUDIENCE: Other
people are hungry.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.299
BLADE KOTELLY: Other
people are hungry, yes.

00:28:47.299 --> 00:28:48.840
AUDIENCE: Could be
a social occasion.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.920
BLADE KOTELLY: A
social occasion.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.070
AUDIENCE: To stay alive.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:53.710
BLADE KOTELLY: To
stay alive, yes.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.448
Maslow's hierarchy here.

00:28:56.448 --> 00:28:59.304
AUDIENCE: Not to
take the dining plan.

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.210
BLADE KOTELLY: To avoid
a required dining plan,

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:04.970
you need to cook.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:05.280
OK.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:05.779
What else?

00:29:05.779 --> 00:29:08.720
AUDIENCE: To win or earn money.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.620
BLADE KOTELLY: To
win or earn money.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.750
Do you mean, on a TV show?

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:13.925
Fantastic.

00:29:13.925 --> 00:29:15.260
AUDIENCE: I like cooking.

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:16.010
BLADE KOTELLY: You like cooking.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.855
It's an enjoyable experience.

00:29:16.855 --> 00:29:17.647
It's fun to do.

00:29:17.647 --> 00:29:18.230
It's creative.

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.710
What else?

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:19.440
AUDIENCE: Boredom.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.290
BLADE KOTELLY: Boredom.

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:20.860
I'm bored.

00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:21.590
What should I do?

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.250
Watch TV?

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.570
No.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:23.270
Play video games?

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:23.660
No.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:24.160
Cook?

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.200
Great.

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.970
Why else would we cook?

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:31.460
AUDIENCE: To come
up with new dishes.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.210
BLADE KOTELLY: To come
up with new dishes.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:34.584
To create, to
innovate on dishes.

00:29:34.584 --> 00:29:36.182
What else?

00:29:36.182 --> 00:29:37.390
AUDIENCE: To impress someone.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.806
BLADE KOTELLY: To
impress someone.

00:29:38.806 --> 00:29:40.084
Who might you want to impress?

00:29:40.084 --> 00:29:41.500
AUDIENCE: Boyfriend
or girlfriend.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.583
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, a date.

00:29:42.583 --> 00:29:43.840
A boyfriend or girlfriend.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:44.820
Great.

00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:45.320
Jackie.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:45.819
OK.

00:29:45.819 --> 00:29:49.830
So Jackie has a date.

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:51.710
And she's identified the needs.

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:55.640
She's gotta impress her date.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.250
We go on to an
information phase.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.190
What in the world
can help Jackie

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.040
determine how to
impress her date?

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.642
AUDIENCE: What does
he like to eat?

00:30:06.642 --> 00:30:08.850
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes, so
she's lost her voice here.

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:11.670
And she said, what
does he like to eat?

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.170
Right.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:13.620
What does the date like to eat?

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:14.120
Right.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.110
That's what we want to find out.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.110
So we're doing market
research to that point

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:20.950
to figure out the preferences
of our target audience.

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:21.657
Emily.

00:30:21.657 --> 00:30:23.240
AUDIENCE: What the
date's allergic to?

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.170
BLADE KOTELLY: What's
that he's allergic to?

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:25.711
I would put that in
step number five.

00:30:30.899 --> 00:30:31.940
AUDIENCE: Food in season?

00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:32.650
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah,
food in season.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:32.870
Yes.

00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:34.828
We could be informed by
what food is in season.

00:30:34.828 --> 00:30:37.474
And how would we find out
what food is in season?

00:30:37.474 --> 00:30:39.710
AUDIENCE: Grocery
store or look online?

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.668
BLADE KOTELLY: You can
go to the grocery store.

00:30:41.668 --> 00:30:42.727
Now, tomatoes.

00:30:42.727 --> 00:30:44.560
Have you ever not been
able to find a tomato

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.300
at your grocery store?

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.551
But they're not in
season very long.

00:30:48.551 --> 00:30:50.842
So the question is, if you
want to get something that's

00:30:50.842 --> 00:30:53.680
in season and local perhaps,
you can go to grocery stores,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.127
you could look online.

00:30:55.127 --> 00:30:56.410
AUDIENCE: Farmers market.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.510
BLADE KOTELLY: A farmer's market
where the farmers who are local

00:30:58.510 --> 00:30:59.990
come over there
and they'll let you

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.365
know, we've got
lots of kohlrabi.

00:31:01.365 --> 00:31:04.019
Rabi Who here has
ever used kohlrabi?

00:31:04.019 --> 00:31:05.560
Who's ever heard
the word "kohlrabi?"

00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:06.059
OK.

00:31:06.059 --> 00:31:11.030
So it's one of those things that
farmers' markets have lots of.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.010
What else?

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.480
AUDIENCE: What's affordable?

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.854
BLADE KOTELLY:
What's affordable.

00:31:15.854 --> 00:31:19.840
I might put that under
our planning research

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.720
and operational research there.

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.550
Jackie.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:23.450
AUDIENCE: What do
you know how to make?

00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:24.490
BLADE KOTELLY: What do
you know how to make.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:25.460
Knowledge.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:28.070
That's what would be limited
by in planned research.

00:31:28.070 --> 00:31:31.580
But what else can inform our
decision can also be that.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.610
Which is, I happen to make
these four things really well.

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:37.160
So, that's part of my research.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.010
What else?

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:41.700
What else might we
look to, to help us

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.235
with planning a date for Jackie?

00:31:45.235 --> 00:31:47.490
AUDIENCE: Whether he or
she is vegetarian or not.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.930
BLADE KOTELLY: Whether the
date is vegetarian or not

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:50.640
could inform us.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.396
So some market research.

00:31:53.396 --> 00:31:55.730
AUDIENCE: What
kind of date it is.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:57.250
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah,
the kind of date.

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.550
We're going back to step one.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.028
Tell me about this.

00:32:00.028 --> 00:32:03.688
AUDIENCE: It could be a very
important occasion as far as

00:32:03.688 --> 00:32:04.420
like engagement.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:05.890
Or it might be
like a first date.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:07.710
BLADE KOTELLY: A first
date, an engagement.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.270
And they might be different.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:15.260
So the first date may not have
caviar and a diamond ring.

00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:15.853
It might.

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.770
Might be pushing it
a little bit much,

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:25.830
if you want the date to
go more than five minutes.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:26.330
OK.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.210
So, yes.

00:32:28.210 --> 00:32:33.138
So first day and an anniversary
date might be very different.

00:32:33.138 --> 00:32:35.450
AUDIENCE: What tools
you have to cook with?

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.180
BLADE KOTELLY: Tools
you have to cook with.

00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:36.960
Yes.

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.835
I might put that again
under planned research

00:32:38.835 --> 00:32:41.022
but information phase as well.

00:32:41.022 --> 00:32:42.480
AUDIENCE: What
Jackie likes to eat.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.563
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes,
what you want to yourself.

00:32:44.563 --> 00:32:50.240
Jackie enjoys pasta
and hates hamburgers.

00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:55.530
What about some resources that
are available for research?

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:56.490
Ann.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.156
AUDIENCE: You can get a cookbook
to see what types of foods

00:32:58.156 --> 00:32:58.940
go well together.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:32:59.981
BLADE KOTELLY: Cookbooks.

00:32:59.981 --> 00:33:00.750
Absolutely.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.290
And she said to
look at cookbooks

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.460
to see what kinds of
foods go well together.

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.510
Most cookbooks
don't tell you this.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:09.470
Interestingly, most
cookbooks tell you

00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:11.850
how to cook a specific
dish, but don't tell you

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:13.370
what to cook it with.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.350
Some very good cookbooks do.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.510
I recommend Mark Bittman
if you're cooking

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:18.546
and you're in college.

00:33:18.546 --> 00:33:20.920
It's a great cookbook and
tells you what to pair with it.

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.212
What did you say?

00:33:25.212 --> 00:33:26.170
I heard something else.

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:26.710
AUDIENCE: The internet.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:27.340
BLADE KOTELLY: The internet.

00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:27.980
Absolutely.

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:31.350
And what might we Google?

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.300
AUDIENCE: The price of
stuff at stores, recipes,

00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.857
what goes good with
it, everything.

00:33:35.857 --> 00:33:37.940
BLADE KOTELLY: So we have
we have recipes we could

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:39.890
Google, the price of
stuff at the store.

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.420
Let's bring up Google
for a second here.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:47.330
OK.

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.300
So, let's bring this over
and type in, price of stuff

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.540
at the store.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.819
Just slide it over-- Great.

00:33:54.819 --> 00:33:56.985
And slide it over to the
right a little bit, please.

00:33:56.985 --> 00:33:59.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:05.510
Jackie.

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:07.510
Do you like beer?

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.210
Like beer, Jackie?

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:11.989
Because if you do, this is
a great thing to Google?

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:13.260
OK.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.929
What else might we Google?

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:17.250
Thomas.

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:19.549
AUDIENCE: What does
my date like to eat?

00:34:19.549 --> 00:34:22.420
BLADE KOTELLY: Let's Google
what does my date like to eat?

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:25.870
On the board, 100 people
surveyed, top answers.

00:34:25.870 --> 00:34:29.689
10 foods you should never
eat on a first date.

00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:30.189
Phenomenal.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:41.440
The person's not
sure if they can

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:44.290
eat chorizo that is still not
expired for another month.

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:48.668
I'm glad they posted it on here
and it's the second result.

00:34:48.668 --> 00:34:51.624
What else should we Google?

00:34:51.624 --> 00:34:53.499
AUDIENCE: Delicious food
that's easy to cook.

00:34:56.972 --> 00:34:59.055
BLADE KOTELLY: Delicious
food that's easy to cook.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.440
It's auto completing.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:05.180
This is great.

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.920
Which I guess, John
has already been to.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.050
John is in charge or
does a lot of work

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:14.050
with the food at his
fraternity house,

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:16.290
and that makes a lot of sense.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:18.290
What else might
we Google for what

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.410
you should cook on a first date.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:25.880
How about, what should
I cook on a first date?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.520
I have no idea what's
going to come up.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.235
AUDIENCE: Be careful.

00:35:29.235 --> 00:35:30.574
Be careful.

00:35:30.574 --> 00:35:32.990
BLADE KOTELLY: Actually, go
back to what should I cook on.

00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:35.340
Let's go back to what
should I cook on.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.290
And hit space.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:40.950
A, letter A. Romantic
dinner, first date, and date

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:47.949
come up at the top three
suggestions by Google.

00:35:47.949 --> 00:35:48.740
That's pretty cool.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.601
OK, let's go back to
that slide, please.

00:35:50.601 --> 00:35:51.100
Yes.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:53.057
So this is pretty cool.

00:35:53.057 --> 00:35:54.640
OK, we're getting a
lot of information

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.556
right now from Google.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.460
And we're up here to
stakeholder phase now.

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.980
Who are the
stakeholders involved?

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:04.860
AUDIENCE: Jackie.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:06.620
BLADE KOTELLY: Jackie.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.482
Who else?

00:36:07.482 --> 00:36:08.297
AUDIENCE: Her date.

00:36:08.297 --> 00:36:09.670
BLADE KOTELLY: Her date.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.097
Who else might be
stakeholders involved?

00:36:12.097 --> 00:36:13.430
AUDIENCE: People that sell food.

00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:15.471
BLADE KOTELLY: People that
sell food, absolutely.

00:36:15.471 --> 00:36:16.206
Yes.

00:36:16.206 --> 00:36:17.192
AUDIENCE: Her parents.

00:36:17.192 --> 00:36:19.170
BLADE KOTELLY: Her parents.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:22.760
If they don't like
Jackie's date at all.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:24.700
Make the pineapple upside cake.

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.150
But mom, I can't make that.

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.041
Make the--

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:32.230
AUDIENCE: Maybe anybody that
shares the kitchen with Jackie.

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:33.370
People sharing the kitchen.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:34.420
There could be
other stakeholders

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.330
because maybe Jackie
lives with other people.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.122
And she's like, hey can you
be out of the kitchen tonight?

00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:41.080
I'm Like, no, I've got
a really important date.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.680
I'm making dinner.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:46.488
Two people making dinner
dates at the same time.

00:36:46.488 --> 00:36:47.792
BLADE KOTELLY: OK.

00:36:47.792 --> 00:36:48.500
Planned research.

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:50.610
What could we be limited by?

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.020
What could Jackie be limited by?

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:53.927
AUDIENCE: Cost.

00:36:53.927 --> 00:36:54.760
BLADE KOTELLY: Cost.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.260
Right.

00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:58.690
So maybe the beluga
caviar is prohibitively

00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:00.650
expensive for the date.

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.495
Daniel.

00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:01.960
AUDIENCE: Experience.

00:37:01.960 --> 00:37:03.043
BLADE KOTELLY: Experience.

00:37:03.043 --> 00:37:03.980
Cooking experience.

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.310
I can boil water but I
can't make a bechamel sauce.

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.810
OK.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:08.644
AUDIENCE: Equipment.

00:37:08.644 --> 00:37:09.685
BLADE KOTELLY: Equipment.

00:37:09.685 --> 00:37:10.350
Yes.

00:37:10.350 --> 00:37:15.150
I have a pot to boil water
in but do not own a toaster.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:16.240
Making toast is harder.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:17.390
Not impossible, but harder.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:21.790
Yes.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:22.620
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.340
BLADE KOTELLY: Time.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.210
Oh my god, the date's
in half an hour.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:27.930
I haven't started dinner.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.312
I haven't been to the store.

00:37:31.312 --> 00:37:32.020
Calling Dominoes.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.700
OK.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.765
What else could
you be limited by.

00:37:36.765 --> 00:37:38.670
AUDIENCE: Her date's
dietary restrictions.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:40.590
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes, and
I like that, actually,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.700
dietary restrictions
in that phase.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:43.986
Stephanie.

00:37:43.986 --> 00:37:45.360
AUDIENCE: Ingredients that
you can't find at the store.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.140
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah,
yes, ingredients

00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:46.860
that you can't
find at the store.

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:49.610
So sometimes certain-- you
have to go to special markets

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.220
to find certain kinds of special
spices or something else.

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.210
And if you can't get
that at your local store,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.330
then you may not be
able to get it all.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:38:00.741
Or maybe you have to fly it in
or mail order it or something.

00:38:00.741 --> 00:38:01.240
OK.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.820
This is good.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:04.650
Hazard analysis.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:15.110
What could go wrong when cooking
dinner for a romantic evening?

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:16.640
Rod in the back.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.480
AUDIENCE: Allergies,
food poisoning.

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:20.440
BLADE KOTELLY: Allergies
and food poisoning.

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:23.970
Should she cook the chorizo?

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:25.490
I don't know.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:27.910
Looks kinda iffy.

00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:29.697
Allergies, yes.

00:38:29.697 --> 00:38:30.821
AUDIENCE: Faulty equipment.

00:38:30.821 --> 00:38:32.370
If you have a bad stove.

00:38:32.370 --> 00:38:33.870
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes,
faulty equipment

00:38:33.870 --> 00:38:37.510
could cause a fire or something.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:39.432
That's really bad.

00:38:39.432 --> 00:38:42.170
AUDIENCE: Setting the
entire chicken on fire.

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:44.503
BLADE KOTELLY: He sounds like
he speaks from experience.

00:38:47.152 --> 00:38:49.390
AUDIENCE: Personal injury.

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:50.390
BLADE KOTELLY: Personal?

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.790
AUDIENCE: Injury.

00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:52.040
BLADE KOTELLY: Injury, yes.

00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:55.510
So when cutting onions,
look at the onion

00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:57.410
and don't try to make cool eyes.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.370
Stop.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:04.494
Bleeding is not considered cool
on a date if you can avoid it.

00:39:04.494 --> 00:39:06.360
AUDIENCE: Quantity of food.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.500
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes, quantity
of food, absolutely.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.450
This is a very real issue
that really happens on dates.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.700
I'll tell you a story when
I'm not on camera sometime.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:20.122
AUDIENCE: Your date
doesn't show up.

00:39:20.122 --> 00:39:21.080
BLADE KOTELLY: Oh, yes.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:28.060
She's not speaking
from experience.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:30.290
But yes, the date
doesn't show up.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:31.470
That is sad.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:32.694
That can be a very sad thing.

00:39:32.694 --> 00:39:34.610
AUDIENCE: Or you have a
pset due the next day.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.350
BLADE KOTELLY: Or you have
pset due the next day.

00:39:37.350 --> 00:39:42.180
Not a good day for
a romantic evening.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.300
What else?

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.009
AUDIENCE: Forgetting
to set a timer.

00:39:46.009 --> 00:39:46.800
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.810
That's an easy thing to go
wrong-- not setting timers.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:50.620
Yes.

00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:52.445
In fact, yesterday I
did not set a timer.

00:39:52.445 --> 00:39:54.910
I put a thermometer
inside the chicken

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:58.640
and I said, great, when
the thermometer reads 162,

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.580
I'm going to pull the
chicken out, no problem.

00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:03.940
I proceeded to enjoy the company
my friends and drink the wine

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.170
and went, oh my god, came
back over here, went oh, 175.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:07.670
Darn it.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:08.040
Yes.

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.190
I should have set a timer.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.560
That would have been helpful.

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:14.168
AUDIENCE: Unlabeled
food ingredients,

00:40:14.168 --> 00:40:16.513
such as salt and sugar.

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.840
BLADE KOTELLY: Confusing
two similar in appearance

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.340
ingredients like salt and sugar.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:29.010
Thomas sounds like he speaks
from experience in this one.

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:30.570
Yes.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.650
Not so good in
coffee, salty coffee.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:36.286
But I believe popular
in some places.

00:40:36.286 --> 00:40:39.189
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:39.189 --> 00:40:40.230
BLADE KOTELLY: I'm sorry?

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:41.720
AUDIENCE: Fire drills.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:43.421
BLADE KOTELLY: Fire drills.

00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:45.670
Something's that are a little
bit beyond your control.

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:46.170
OK.

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:46.870
So this is good.

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.200
Good hazard analysis for that.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.280
Specifications.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.613
From there, we try to figure
out what we're going to do.

00:40:51.613 --> 00:40:53.000
We might make a shopping list.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.400
We might make a list of what
we're doing for the recipes.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.690
We go on to design it.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.930
And then we have to figure
out, do people like it or not?

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:02.100
Verification.

00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:05.200
How do we test to figure out
if people are going to like it

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.556
or not?

00:41:07.556 --> 00:41:08.056
Ben.

00:41:08.056 --> 00:41:10.426
AUDIENCE: Take a small bite.

00:41:10.426 --> 00:41:11.800
BLADE KOTELLY:
Take a small bite.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.525
Take many small bites.

00:41:13.525 --> 00:41:14.900
Over the course
of the meal, they

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:18.100
say a good cook keeps tasting
it before you serve it.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:19.998
What else could you do?

00:41:19.998 --> 00:41:21.690
AUDIENCE: Get someone
else to taste it.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:24.530
BLADE KOTELLY: Get someone
else to taste it, yes.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:25.030
When?

00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:27.410
Do you say, psst, come over
here, John, come over here,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:29.850
I'm about to serve it to Jackie.

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:30.400
No, when?

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.453
At the time?

00:41:31.453 --> 00:41:32.300
AUDIENCE: Earlier.

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:32.990
BLADE KOTELLY: Earlier.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.698
How much earlier?

00:41:33.698 --> 00:41:35.046
An hour?

00:41:35.046 --> 00:41:37.452
AUDIENCE: Enough so you
have time to fix it.

00:41:37.452 --> 00:41:39.660
BLADE KOTELLY: Enough time
so you could fix it later.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:40.888
What else could you do?

00:41:40.888 --> 00:41:44.585
AUDIENCE: Call mom and ask
if it's supposed to be brown.

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:45.960
BLADE KOTELLY:
Mom, the chorizo's

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.570
not looking very good.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:49.470
Yeah.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.621
Purple, green, yeah.

00:41:51.621 --> 00:41:52.120
Use it?

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:52.620
OK.

00:41:59.695 --> 00:42:01.278
AUDIENCE: You could,
if you wanted to,

00:42:01.278 --> 00:42:03.202
do like a practice
dinner beforehand.

00:42:03.202 --> 00:42:04.160
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes.

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.660
A practice dinner beforehand.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.910
Let's see if you can make
this stuff and how it tastes

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:08.875
and if you like it.

00:42:08.875 --> 00:42:09.750
That's exactly right.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:10.250
OK.

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.115
So I've given you a design
process that I'll tell you,

00:42:13.115 --> 00:42:15.804
you can use for making
anything-- anything you ever

00:42:15.804 --> 00:42:18.220
make ever, ever, ever, ever,
ever, ever, ever, ever, ever,

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:20.961
ever, ever-- ever.

00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:22.470
In all your engineering
disciplines,

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.010
you can use this exact
same process all the time

00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:28.020
for anything you want to make.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.896
We've got it to cooking dinner.

00:42:29.896 --> 00:42:32.560
Let's have you try
it on your own.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.360
Let's try this.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.660
Here's your design challenge.

00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.460
Map the steps of throwing a
surprise party for your best

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:41.960
friend.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.760
You're going to map
the first five steps.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.384
I want you to work
in groups of three--

00:42:45.384 --> 00:42:47.290
the people in your vicinity.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.990
I'm going to give you about
five minutes to do this.

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.870
First five steps as
completely as you

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:56.391
can to throwing a surprise
birthday party for your best

00:42:56.391 --> 00:42:56.890
friend.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:58.620
Here we go.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.320
All right, so right
now the students

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.975
are trying to figure how to
map the steps to throwing

00:43:02.975 --> 00:43:05.130
a surprise birthday party
for their best friend.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:08.079
And they'll take about
five minutes to do this.

00:43:08.079 --> 00:43:10.620
Over those give minutes, they'll
try to map each of the steps

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:11.525
individually.

00:43:11.525 --> 00:43:14.810
And we're going to do a debrief
and figure out what they said.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:17.010
But now, if you want to,
try doing it yourself

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.850
and see if you can come up
with a really good solution.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:23.920
And see if they get some
ones that you don't get.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:36.100
All right, let's find out what
you said to solve this problem.

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.000
So you've had five
minutes to try

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.580
to figure out how to
solve the first five

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:43.530
steps of this problem.

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:47.550
To figure out how to
throw a surprise birthday

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:48.840
party for your best friend.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.574
What is the underlying problem
that we are trying to solve?

00:43:53.574 --> 00:43:56.009
AUDIENCE: They don't have
plans for their birthday

00:43:56.009 --> 00:43:57.470
and we want to make it awesome.

00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:58.300
BLADE KOTELLY: She said we don't
have plans for the birthday,

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.870
and we're trying
to make it awesome.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.440
Or they may have
plans for the birthday

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.350
and we're still trying
to make it awesome.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:08.444
What are the other aspects
of the underlying problem?

00:44:08.444 --> 00:44:09.770
AUDIENCE: It's a surprise.

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:11.620
BLADE KOTELLY: It
should be a surprise.

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:14.670
Stated in the problem
statement but also true.

00:44:14.670 --> 00:44:16.950
What else?

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:19.249
Underlying problems,
underlying objectives.

00:44:22.027 --> 00:44:24.900
AUDIENCE: Throw a fun party
for all those involved.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.300
BLADE KOTELLY: To throw a
fun party for those involved.

00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:29.258
Let's talk about those
involved-- who are they?

00:44:29.258 --> 00:44:31.320
Anybody.

00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:32.512
In the back.

00:44:32.512 --> 00:44:34.720
AUDIENCE: And the actual
person whose birthday it is.

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:36.220
BLADE KOTELLY: And
the actual person

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:37.570
whose birthday it is, yes.

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:38.160
What else?

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.030
That's it?

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:45.419
No other reason to
throw a birthday party?

00:44:45.419 --> 00:44:47.043
AUDIENCE: So that
you get one later on.

00:44:47.043 --> 00:44:49.390
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, it's for
you to get one later on.

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:52.925
In psychology, we call it
the reciprocity effect.

00:44:52.925 --> 00:44:53.424
Good.

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:54.350
OK.

00:44:54.350 --> 00:44:56.250
So, we've identified the needs.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.120
Information phase.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:01.480

BLADE KOTELLY: How
old they're turning?

00:45:05.785 --> 00:45:08.305
What do you mean by that?

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:11.990
AUDIENCE: Probably don't throw
a clown party for a 50-year-old.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:15.077
BLADE KOTELLY: You don't throw
a clown party for a 50-year-old.

00:45:15.077 --> 00:45:16.660
I happen to know
some 50-year-olds who

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.940
might enjoy that, but it'd
be kind of weird, right?

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:19.440
OK.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.220
So maybe you do.

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:22.535
Gotta pick your
50-year-olds very carefully.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:28.248
would inform it, absolutely.

00:45:28.248 --> 00:45:29.789
AUDIENCE: Just a
quick question, does

00:45:29.789 --> 00:45:33.459
surprise party automatically
mean it's a birthday party?

00:45:33.459 --> 00:45:35.500
BLADE KOTELLY: This is a
surprise birthday party.

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.600
I'm sorry, yes.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.149
In this case it did.

00:45:38.149 --> 00:45:39.440
I didn't put that on the slide.

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.010
Yes, you're right.

AUDIENCE: When they're free.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:44.840
BLADE KOTELLY: When they're free

throwing a surprise birthday

BLADE KOTELLY: If they
like surprises or not

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:53.770

inform us about how

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:56.702

party for someone who

00:45:56.702 --> 00:45:58.496

AUDIENCE: If they like to
go out bowling or something,

00:46:08.674 --> 00:46:10.450

To appeal to their
hobbies and likes.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:14.700
Great.

00:46:15.512 --> 00:46:16.840
AUDIENCE: What kind
of friends they have.

00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:18.756
BLADE KOTELLY: What kind
of friends they have.

00:46:18.756 --> 00:46:19.674
How do you mean that?

00:46:19.674 --> 00:46:22.381
AUDIENCE: It informs who we're
going to invite to the party.

00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:24.630
BLADE KOTELLY: Informs who
we're going to invite, yes.

AUDIENCE: Size and nature
of the social circles.

00:46:26.629 --> 00:46:29.280
So you could have small
gatherings or big gatherings.

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.071
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:46:30.071 --> 00:46:31.550
So how big the party should be.

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:33.570
What else could inform us?

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.820
AUDIENCE: Past parties
that you have been to.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.740
BLADE KOTELLY: Past
parties you've been to.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.323
Personal experience, where you
say, this was an awesome party.

00:46:39.323 --> 00:46:42.380
This party sucked-- we are not
going to do one of those again.

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:42.880
Right.

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:46.250

trick them into showing up

people at some point.

OK, good.

So that's information phase
that can inform us about it.

00:47:00.533 --> 00:47:02.484
But we forgot one of
our most valuable tools

00:47:02.484 --> 00:47:03.650
that we talked about before.

the neighbors that call
the cops all the time,

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:00.800
You don't want to
scare your friend

00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:02.250
if they have a heart condition.

00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:04.242
That's good.

00:49:04.242 --> 00:49:05.200
Cameron was that yours?

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah, weather.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.960
BLADE KOTELLY: Weather.

00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:10.870
So don't have an
outdoor party when

00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:14.030
it's going to be threatening
to have a thunderstorm.

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:17.830
Or in January in Boston.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:21.430
Not a good time for an
outdoor barbecue-- just isn't.

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:22.612
Kristen.

00:49:22.612 --> 00:49:25.196
AUDIENCE: You accidentally send
someone to the wrong location.

00:49:25.196 --> 00:49:27.653
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes, someone
goes to the wrong location.

00:49:27.653 --> 00:49:29.011
Thomas.

00:49:29.011 --> 00:49:30.647
AUDIENCE: You have
invited some people

00:49:30.647 --> 00:49:33.382
that your friend is
on bad terms with.

00:49:33.382 --> 00:49:34.340
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.764
The old ex-girlfriend issue.

00:49:37.764 --> 00:49:38.930
I thought you were together.

00:49:38.930 --> 00:49:40.030
We haven't been
together for months.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.821
I didn't know that.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:48.920
So I'll tell you a little story.

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:56.230
So my best friend
in high school--

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.950
we're best friends
and I'm throwing

00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:59.920
him a surprise birthday party.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:06.800
And my best friend was notorious
for not showing up to things.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.180
You make plans a
week ahead of time,

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.920
you confirmed a few
days ahead of time,

00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:13.770
it's Friday night-- ghost town.

00:50:13.770 --> 00:50:14.570
Just not there.

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.230
And no one knows where he is.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:17.990
He just was kind of casual.

00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:19.760
This happened all the time.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.630
And we all knew this.

00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:25.590
I said, OK, I'm going to
make sure he shows up.

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:29.940
So I said, look-- he's
really into art and design--

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:33.280
there's this great exhibit
coming up for an M.C. Escher

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.170
thing they're doing at
this museum in Boston.

00:50:35.170 --> 00:50:36.970
And there's someone
speaking and I'm

00:50:36.970 --> 00:50:39.910
going to buy tickets
to it for your birthday

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.494
and they're really
expensive so can we

00:50:42.494 --> 00:50:43.910
clear the date,
make sure it's OK.

00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:44.951
He goes, yeah, it's fine.

00:50:44.951 --> 00:50:46.270
Great.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.650
So it's like two months out.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:50.100
Two months.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:52.414
So a month later, I'm
like hey, looking forward

00:50:52.414 --> 00:50:53.330
to that exhibit thing?

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:54.197
He goes, oh, yeah.

00:50:54.197 --> 00:50:55.530
Do you have it in your calendar?

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.696
I do have it in my calendar.

00:50:56.696 --> 00:51:00.040
It's like the only thing
he had in his calendar.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:01.950
It's good.

00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:03.610
It's now like a week out.

00:51:03.610 --> 00:51:04.210
Hey, dude.

00:51:04.210 --> 00:51:07.300
Next Friday we're going to
the M.C. Escher exhibit.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:07.810
Right on.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:07.950
It's great.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:08.600
Perfect.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:10.710
It's Monday.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:13.880
Hey, Friday night, we'll
get together like 6:00-ish,

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:15.630
we'll go and get some
dinner or something.

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:16.760
Then we'll go-- yeah
it sounds great.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.260
Cool.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.630
Great.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.040
Wednesday.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.027
Got two days.

00:51:21.027 --> 00:51:21.610
Two days away!

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:21.970
Cool.

00:51:21.970 --> 00:51:22.510
Right on.

00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:23.050
Thursday.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:23.550
Tomorrow!

00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:30.280
Friday night, 6
o'clock, his house.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:31.505
I go there, what happens?

00:51:31.505 --> 00:51:32.651
AUDIENCE: He's not there.

00:51:32.651 --> 00:51:33.900
BLADE KOTELLY: No, he's there.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:34.470
It's amazing.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:38.850
I'm blown away.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:39.690
I'm like, he's actually there.

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:40.530
Incredibly cool.

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:44.870
So we do our whole thing.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:46.119
We go.

00:51:46.119 --> 00:51:46.910
We go to the thing.

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.701
We go to the house.

00:51:47.701 --> 00:51:49.116
We walk inside, open the door.

00:51:49.116 --> 00:51:50.490
I go around the
side of the door.

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.220
Everyone's waiting here.

00:51:52.220 --> 00:51:55.921
He comes up around the door,
everyone goes, surprise!

00:51:55.921 --> 00:51:58.732
And he's like, what?

00:51:58.732 --> 00:52:00.690
I said, dude it's your
surprise birthday party.

00:52:00.690 --> 00:52:01.860
Surprise!

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:06.470
And he's like, I thought we
were going to an exhibit.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:07.580
No, no, that was all fake.

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.705
But you bought the tickets.

00:52:08.705 --> 00:52:09.640
No, they're not real.

00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.130
And he was sad.

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:25.120
What we learned from
our hazard analysis,

00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:30.336
our post mortem, don't make
the other event sound more fun

00:52:30.336 --> 00:52:33.150
than a surprise birthday party.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.650
OK.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.000
All true.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.210
Next.

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:42.430
So, I've said you can
map this to anything.

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:43.850
Well, let's be a little
bit more serious here.

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.230
A little more serious about
the engineering aspect here.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.230
You have four minutes
now to map it to this.

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:53.290
Making a car fueled
by a nuclear reactor.

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:54.060
Same groups.

00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:55.090
Four minutes.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:59.254
If you happen to be
a nuclear engineer,

00:52:59.254 --> 00:53:00.391
you have a head start.

00:53:00.391 --> 00:53:00.890
OK.

00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:02.580
Right now, they're doing
the same exact thing

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:03.520
except for they're
mapping something

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:04.480
more engineering based.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.762
And the idea is
that they can start

00:53:06.762 --> 00:53:08.970
to apply something that
seemed very easy and informal

00:53:08.970 --> 00:53:12.030
to something a little bit
more of their engineering

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:12.540
curriculum.

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.399
It's not a big stretch
in this case here.

00:53:15.399 --> 00:53:16.940
They're going to
get lots of practice

00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.090
throughout the
whole semester being

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:21.500
able to apply this to a variety
of different environments

00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:23.317
and produce things
using this process.

00:53:23.317 --> 00:53:24.900
But here I wanted
to show that there's

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.416
a mapping that exists
between stuff that seems very

00:53:28.416 --> 00:53:30.790
unrelated to engineering, like
throwing a birthday party,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.645
and some very
engineering related.

00:53:32.645 --> 00:53:34.020
Let's see what
they come up with.

00:53:41.231 --> 00:53:41.730
All right.

00:53:41.730 --> 00:53:45.050
Let's find out what
you thought about how

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:46.910
to solve this problem.

00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:48.590
Mapping the steps
to making a car

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:51.020
fueled by a nuclear reactor.

00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.540
What is the
underlying objective?

00:53:52.540 --> 00:53:56.595
Or what could the
underlying objective be?

00:53:56.595 --> 00:53:58.960
AUDIENCE: Finding a
new means of fuel.

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.210
BLADE KOTELLY: Different fuel.

AUDIENCE: Job market
for nuclear engineers.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:15.910
BLADE KOTELLY: A job market
for nuclear engineers.

00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:16.960
That's very good.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.990
I like that.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:20.312
What else?

00:54:20.312 --> 00:54:21.660
AUDIENCE: Faster car.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.580

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.680
Zoom!

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:27.647
What else?

00:54:27.647 --> 00:54:29.230
AUDIENCE: Cleaner
for the environment.

00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:30.280

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:30.620
Yes.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.130
What else?

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:34.300
OK.

00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:37.840
Step number two,
what can inform us

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.050
about how to build-- where might
we look to understand about how

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:45.566
to build a car fueled
by a nuclear reactor?

00:54:45.566 --> 00:54:47.732
AUDIENCE: Other vehicles
fueled by nuclear reactors,

00:54:47.732 --> 00:54:48.399
like submarines.

00:54:48.399 --> 00:54:49.856
BLADE KOTELLY: Like
submarines that

00:54:49.856 --> 00:54:51.526
are fueled by nuclear
reactors, yes.

00:54:51.526 --> 00:54:52.900
Understand how a
submarine works.

AUDIENCE: Current car designs.

00:54:55.114 --> 00:54:56.530
BLADE KOTELLY:
Current car designs

00:54:56.530 --> 00:54:59.564
could inform us about
what we could do.

00:54:59.564 --> 00:55:02.686
AUDIENCE: How you could research
possible nuclear accidents.

00:55:02.686 --> 00:55:04.560
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, look
at nuclear accidents.

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.210
I'm going to put that under
the hazard analysis section.

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:09.180
But yes, absolutely.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:09.800

AUDIENCE: I just got
hired to work them.

00:55:19.980 --> 00:55:21.370
BLADE KOTELLY: She got hired
to work on them, great.

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:23.630
You could actually
research the thing

00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:25.606
that you might want to use.

00:55:25.606 --> 00:55:26.480

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:27.960
Yes.

00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.419
You could talk to professors
who deal with these things.

00:55:30.419 --> 00:55:32.960
AUDIENCE: What regulations exist
on nuclear reactors in cars.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.380

00:57:53.110 --> 00:57:53.860
BLADE KOTELLY: OK.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:59.210

BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.836
What would you pay
for a car if it never

00:58:27.836 --> 00:58:30.770
needed fuel ever again?

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:32.300
It's a good question, right?

00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:36.550
Would you pay a million dollars?

00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:37.126
No.

BLADE KOTELLY: Whether
people would even buy it.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:54.540
It's nuclear reactor.

00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:55.680
I don't want to get that car.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.590
But it never needs fuel again.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:58:57.630
I don't want that car.

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:58.390
Well, why not?

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:02.000
Because I don't want
to glow, I don't know.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.864
What else are you limited by?

00:59:05.864 --> 00:59:07.780

That doesn't seems so wrong.

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.162
So far, it sounds OK.

00:59:31.162 --> 00:59:35.090
Or are we talking about fusion?

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:36.350
What do you mean by that?

00:59:36.350 --> 00:59:37.850

BLADE KOTELLY: Oh, what
happens to the nuclear reactor

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.450
during a car crash.

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:45.254
What was that movie--
was it the new Batman?

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:46.745 --> 00:59:49.807
They had a nuclear

and it kind of like,
boom, boom, boom, boom.

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.820
You're like, oh no,
that seems so bad.

00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:57.385
But everything
worked out just fine.

00:59:57.385 --> 00:59:58.260
Batman saved the day.

00:59:58.260 --> 00:59:58.760
OK.

What else?

01:00:00.704 --> 01:00:05.010
AUDIENCE: Can it be modified
to serve another purpose.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:06.000
BLADE KOTELLY: Such as?

A what?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.790
AUDIENCE: Like a more
dangerous purpose.

01:00:07.790 --> 01:00:08.500
BLADE KOTELLY: A more
dangerous purpose.

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:08.930
So yes.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.263
You could have terrorists who
take advantage of the fact

01:00:11.263 --> 01:00:13.220
that you have a
nuclear powered car

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:14.817
to create a nuclear
powered bomb.

01:00:14.817 --> 01:00:15.775
I saw that in "Batman."

01:00:15.775 --> 01:00:16.275
I know.

01:00:16.275 --> 01:00:17.914
I saw.

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.330
Everything I ever
needed to learn,

01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:20.915
I learned from
watching "Batman."

Cameron.

01:00:21.414 --> 01:00:22.535
AUDIENCE: If it's
a fission reactor,

01:00:22.535 --> 01:00:23.450
where does the waste go?

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:24.190
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, waste.

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:25.898
Yeah, what do you do
with waste disposal?

01:00:25.898 --> 01:00:26.760
Right.

01:00:35.955 --> 01:00:38.186
What does that mean?

01:00:38.186 --> 01:00:40.102
AUDIENCE: If you
create nuclear waste,

01:00:40.102 --> 01:00:41.627
and you can't
control it, someone

01:00:41.627 --> 01:00:43.460
can take it and turn
it into a nuclear bomb.

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:44.418
BLADE KOTELLY: Yes, OK.

01:00:44.418 --> 01:00:46.280
So how do we keep that
thing from happening

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:50.470
that could be used
negatively and prevent that.

01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:51.662
What else could go wrong?

01:00:51.662 --> 01:00:53.120
AUDIENCE: Do it yourself people.

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:53.911
BLADE KOTELLY: DIY.

01:00:56.260 --> 01:00:58.060
How to build a nuclear
reactor at home.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:01.680
Yes this may require a few more
tools than most people have.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.180
OK.

01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:03.596
So are you beginning
to see how we

01:01:03.596 --> 01:01:06.140
can start applying this process
to things of engineering base

01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:06.822
as well?

01:01:06.822 --> 01:01:08.030
Right, that you have to make?

01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:11.600
And now, you may not be making
a nuclear powered reactor

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.730
car right now, but
Charlotte, you're

01:01:13.730 --> 01:01:16.330
working on these
small reactors, right?

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.007
And what could they be used for?

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:20.279
AUDIENCE: So the market
shares that number

01:01:20.279 --> 01:01:22.877
one, reactors are really
expensive and they're very big.

01:01:22.877 --> 01:01:25.799
And if you don't need
1,200 megawatts of power

01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:27.502
and you don't want
to spend $7 million,

01:01:27.502 --> 01:01:29.700
you can get 250 megawatts
of power for $1 million.

01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:30.449
BLADE KOTELLY: OK.

01:01:30.449 --> 01:01:33.020
So you could make a small
reactor and use it to do what?

01:01:33.020 --> 01:01:34.940
AUDIENCE: Basically,
you create electricity

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.380
and then distribute it cheaply.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.880
BLADE KOTELLY: So
cheap electricity.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.392
And where would you
want to do that?

01:01:39.392 --> 01:01:40.600
AUDIENCE: All over the world.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.650
BLADE KOTELLY: All
over the world.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.300
In even a company,
potentially like

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:45.900
Apple where they have that
new campus being put up.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.840
They have their own
power energy place

01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.739
and they might, potentially, put
a nuclear reactor there, right?

01:01:52.739 --> 01:01:54.530
They could power their
whole thing and then

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:58.500
supply the energy back to the
grid, if they chose to do that.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:01:59.640
OK.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:00.805
Joel, did you have a--?

01:02:00.805 --> 01:02:01.680
JOEL SCHINDALL: Yeah.

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.700
This process we're going
to use again and again

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:08.870
during the course of the term.

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.790
But I wanted to just
point out a few things

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:13.190
to set a little bit
of context for you.

01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:15.420
First of all, I think
there's an image

01:02:15.420 --> 01:02:18.650
that designers just kind of
go into this special sort

01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:21.870
of a daze and they come out
with a wonderful invention,

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:25.930
a great dress, a beautiful room
layout or something like that.

01:02:25.930 --> 01:02:29.270
And I want to point out that
it rarely happens that way.

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:33.180
The design is work and effort
and looking at relationships

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:34.660
and going again and again.

01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:36.930
And looking at what's
wanted and what's needed

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.450
and what's the context of it.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.400
And actually what
we described here

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.180
is not that different from
what you do as engineers

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.730
when you study engineering.

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:46.850
It's breaking down the
problem into parts,

01:02:46.850 --> 01:02:49.250
looking at the relationship
between those parts,

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:52.540
and optimizing the system,
just like you optimize

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:54.630
an engineering system
that's designed

01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:58.280
to generate electricity or
build a bridge whatever branch

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:01.630
of engineering that you
might be involved in.

01:03:01.630 --> 01:03:03.940
So actually you've got
the kind of training

01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:05.710
to be able to do good design.

01:03:05.710 --> 01:03:08.740
Second point I want to make--
the numbers, one, two, three,

01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:09.340
four, five.

01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:10.700
We all know how to count.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.840
So it sort of leads you
into thinking you do one

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.950
and then you do two and then you
do three and then you do four.

01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:19.140
And again, not that way
if you recognize that.

01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:22.690
Actually, good design, you're
actually doing it in parallel.

01:03:22.690 --> 01:03:25.210
You get about up to number five
and you're doing the hazard

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:27.980
analysis, you realize some of
the things, the assumptions

01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.740
you made early ain't going to
work that way because they're

01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.730
dangerous to your health
or other people's health.

01:03:33.730 --> 01:03:35.410
You go back to step one.

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:39.410
So actually, this is a very good
linear way of representing it.

01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:41.560
But in the actual
implementation of doing it,

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.627
you're going to move in and out
of all those different phases.

01:03:44.627 --> 01:03:46.210
And then the third
thing I want to say

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:48.910
doesn't quite apply here
but I spent a lot of time

01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:50.314
in the satellite industry.

01:03:50.314 --> 01:03:51.730
And in the satellite
industry, you

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:55.460
go through a very careful
analysis up front of the design

01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.850
that you've come up with.

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:58.840
Make sure that it's
reliable, that everything's

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:00.150
going to hang together.

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:04.450
And then, later on,
down around here,

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.430
you wind up making
a few changes.

01:04:06.430 --> 01:04:08.460
Things are just a
little bit different.

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:09.360
You modify this.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.410
You modify that.

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.640
And almost every serious
failure that occurs

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:16.160
is because after you
made those changes,

01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.640
no one kind of went back
to the beginning and said,

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:22.480
well did this perhaps change
the assumptions under which we

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.760
based our design and move
us onto a different track?

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.970
So again, you always have to
be aware of those things--

01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:32.882
just kind of a
perspective to put on it.

01:04:32.882 --> 01:04:33.828
BLADE KOTELLY: Rita.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:37.470
AUDIENCE: So say I'm Course 20
and I was hired by a Course 22

01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:41.690
company to be a project
manager and I don't even

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.192
know of the existence of
some of these problems that

01:04:44.192 --> 01:04:45.098
could come up.

01:04:45.098 --> 01:04:46.682
How do you go about
figuring that out?

01:04:46.682 --> 01:04:47.639
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes.

01:04:47.639 --> 01:04:49.770
How do you solve a problem
when you don't know much

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.542
about problem space.

01:04:51.542 --> 01:04:53.000
That is a good
question which we're

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.695
going to hold for
now because of time.

01:04:55.695 --> 01:04:58.480
But we will address it
because you will all

01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.690
be working on problems
over the semester which

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:04.297
you may no knowledge about.

01:05:04.297 --> 01:05:06.630
And so the question is how
do you acquire that knowledge

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:08.546
and how do you figure
out what you don't know.

01:05:08.546 --> 01:05:11.050
It's a great question.

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:13.130
I want to talk briefly
about innovation.

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:16.590
This is a huge thing.

01:05:16.590 --> 01:05:21.309
The course called "Engineering
Innovation and Design."

01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:23.350
I have a very particular
thought about innovation

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:24.600
that I want to share with you.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:31.840
This is a diagram from a
very famous design consultant

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:34.460
and how they explain innovation.

01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:39.100
Now, I think I see
where they're going.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:42.160
They talk about the business
on one side, technology

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.024
and people.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:46.440
And they say, look, innovation
happens in different places

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:46.940
here.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.750
Process innovation
occurs between business

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:49.650
and technology.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:51.310
Functional innovation
occurs over here.

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.851
Emotional innovation occurs over
here, like building a brand.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.920
And then they have
experience innovation.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:03.060
And this is this thing
that's very, very special.

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.870
They say yes, when we
combine understanding

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:08.030
of the business, the
technology, the people.

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:09.660
Do we build something
that people want?

01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.260
Is it able to be built?

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.930
And will it create a business
that can sustain itself?

01:06:13.930 --> 01:06:19.450
Then we have achieved great
experience innovation.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:20.630
Now it's not a bad model.

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:22.088
And it's not untrue
that innovation

01:06:22.088 --> 01:06:23.852
occurs in these places.

01:06:23.852 --> 01:06:26.440
But I think it's
not a useful model.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:30.670
I think in that zone here, you
build things that are useful.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:31.820
They're useful.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:33.770
But they may not be innovative.

01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:35.270
So here's my thing
about innovation.

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:42.480
There's something out there.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.650
There's something.

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:48.390
And you're required
to do something

01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:50.800
and yet you have this
other tension pulling you

01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:53.190
because you desire to
do something else that

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:54.170
seems in conflict.

01:06:57.290 --> 01:07:01.500
I'm required to create
a nuclear powered car

01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.100
but-- I desire to create
a nuclear powered car,

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.550
but I'm required to adhere
to laws of government,

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:09.240
which is causing
a lot of problems.

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:20.220
I am required to make an
artificial heart valve

01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:23.260
and I want to make
that but what I realize

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:26.050
is that there's a problem
because in this requirement,

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:28.990
I have something that spins
and it creates friction.

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.100
And the friction causes
blood platelets to form

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.640
and causes clotting.

01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:37.086
And I desire to have no clotting
happen even though I have

01:07:37.086 --> 01:07:40.670
this spinning object
in a heart valve.

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:41.830
Tension.

01:07:41.830 --> 01:07:44.590
I'm required to
pass the class but I

01:07:44.590 --> 01:07:47.185
desire to go out
drinking with my friends.

01:07:47.185 --> 01:07:48.060
These are in tension.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:48.560
OK.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:54.610
So when you have this and
you start stretching this,

01:07:54.610 --> 01:07:58.440
by resolving this, this is
where innovation occurs.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.810
Innovation is the result
of resolving your need

01:08:01.810 --> 01:08:07.470
to do something with your
desire of how it can be done.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:10.520
The designer's job
is to reconcile

01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:14.100
the seemingly irreconcilable.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.290
The designer's job
is to reconcile

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:18.903
the seemingly irreconcilable.

01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:23.187
It's not that you can't do it.

01:08:23.187 --> 01:08:24.520
Maybe you think you can't do it.

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.396
It appears that you can't do it.

01:08:26.396 --> 01:08:28.812
But you gotta think about it
differently or think about it

01:08:28.812 --> 01:08:29.560
from a new angle.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:32.297
Or get some new
information to resolve

01:08:32.297 --> 01:08:33.505
the seemingly irreconcilable.

01:08:33.505 --> 01:08:37.109
And that is what your
job is your whole lives

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:40.779
is to try to figure out the
solution to these problems.

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:43.020
If they were obvious,
people would just do them.

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.603
But when they're not
obvious, and they

01:08:44.603 --> 01:08:46.890
cause this tension,
this pain, this

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:48.926
is where the innovation occurs.

01:08:48.926 --> 01:08:50.550
And where you get
people who do things.

01:08:50.550 --> 01:08:58.229
Like a company called Levatronix
who took that spinning thing.

01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:00.350
And they said, well,
we know if they're

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:02.010
touching it causes friction.

01:09:02.010 --> 01:09:04.540
Instead, they used
magnets to levitate it

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.149
so there's no friction at
all inside of a heart valve.

01:09:10.365 --> 01:09:12.656
Do you want to talk about
the heart valve for a second?

01:09:12.656 --> 01:09:14.864
JOEL SCHINDALL: There's a
small company out in Walton

01:09:14.864 --> 01:09:16.450
called Levatronics.

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:20.180
And part of their charter was to
build an artificial heart that

01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.720
could be used at least
temporarily as substitution

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.220
until a real heart was
available for transplant.

01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:26.720
And you know, the
usual way that you

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.810
build a pump is a
rotary pump that

01:09:28.810 --> 01:09:30.880
produces just a
constant pressure.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.870
But everyone knows that
the heart beats like this.

01:09:33.870 --> 01:09:36.540
And everyone assumed
that the body

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.380
needs that heart beat in order
for the biological processes

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:42.149
to work as they're supposed to.

01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:43.939
Turns out, that's not the case.

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:47.870
Turns out that if you pump
blood smoothly through the body,

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:49.529
it works.

01:09:49.529 --> 01:09:52.670
You get oxygen from the lungs
to the parts that need it.

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:55.830
And you actually can have a
working rotary heart pump.

01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:58.980
So Levatronix thought, well,
this would be a great thing

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:02.930
to build except that the
spinning pump shaft has

01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:04.679
a bearing at either
end of the shaft

01:10:04.679 --> 01:10:06.970
and there's friction in the
bearing which creates heat,

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:09.280
the heat creates
blood clots, the blood

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.400
clots break off and go to the
lungs and that's an embolism

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.070
and the person dies.

01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:17.330
So the question was, well,
looks like you can't do it.

01:10:17.330 --> 01:10:21.450
So talk about reconciling
the seemingly irreconcilable.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:24.560
It turns out that
you can magnetically

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.910
levitate the ends of the shaft
so that they don't actually

01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:29.100
touch the bearing.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:31.840
And you have a
frictionless bearing.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:33.520
Now, it's not stable.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:36.570
It takes an external
electronic circuit

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:42.630
in order to be able to sense the
little latitudinal motions that

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:43.890
come up in the shaft.

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:46.460
But we're pretty advanced
in our technology now.

01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:49.410
We can sense the position of
the shaft and you can fix that.

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.650
And Levatronix has actually
been selling that product

01:10:51.650 --> 01:10:53.400
for the last four or five years.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.980
It's saved lives.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:55.700
It works.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.160
It reconciles the seemingly
inconceivable-- well,

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:02.780
inconceivable--
but irreconcilable.

01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:07.930
And that is what I would
call a real out of the box

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.290
innovative idea.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:11.290
Yeah.

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.790
AUDIENCE: Is this
the company that they

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:16.270
were written about
in "Popular Science?"

01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:21.660
They were having people who had
these smooth hearts going in.

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:25.825
And they were going into doctors
and freaking the doctors out

01:11:25.825 --> 01:11:28.980
because they didn't
have a pulse?

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:31.240
JOEL SCHINDALL: It
certainly would fit.

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.070
There were a few articles
about Levatronix.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.140
I don't know that specific one.

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:40.120
But yeah, that's right,
they don't have a pulse.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:44.840
So when you say that to be
alive, they must have a pulse,

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.710
perhaps that's not a
necessary precondition.

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.820
BLADE KOTELLY: OK.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:55.080
So I want you all to work in
pairs for just a few minutes.

01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:59.260
I want you to come
up a list-- let's

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:01.697
see who can come up with
the longest list in three

01:12:01.697 --> 01:12:04.280
minutes, what group can come up
with the longest list in three

01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:09.450
minutes, of either things
you've experienced personally

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:15.100
or things that you know about
where people had to reconcile

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:17.765
the seemingly irreconcilable.

01:12:17.765 --> 01:12:25.652
To solve a seemingly impossible
design problem at the time.

01:12:25.652 --> 01:12:26.610
You have three minutes.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.790
All right, let's find out.

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:36.550
OK.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:40.810
Who put down one thing or more?

01:12:40.810 --> 01:12:41.500
Wow.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.370
Pretty good.

01:12:42.370 --> 01:12:43.590
Two.

01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:45.560
Three things.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.790
Four things.

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:47.680
Five.

01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.670
Six.

01:12:48.670 --> 01:12:49.710
Seven.

01:12:49.710 --> 01:12:50.642
Eight.

01:12:50.642 --> 01:12:51.574
Nine.

01:12:51.574 --> 01:12:52.160
10.

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:52.660
OK.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.310
15.

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.810
20.

01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:59.870
25.

01:12:59.870 --> 01:13:00.370
OK.

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:01.790
21.

01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:02.290
22.

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.345
How many did you get?

01:13:08.345 --> 01:13:08.730
AUDIENCE: 22.

01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:09.771
BLADE KOTELLY: 22 things.

01:13:09.771 --> 01:13:10.280
22.

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:10.970
Both 22?

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:11.830
AUDIENCE: 21.

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:12.870
BLADE KOTELLY: 21, OK.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:19.250
Who only got five or fewer?

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.330
Five or fewer.

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:21.806
Tell us one of them.

01:13:21.806 --> 01:13:23.540
AUDIENCE: Portable media players

01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:25.330
BLADE KOTELLY:
Portable media players.

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:26.710
Tell me what you mean by that.

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:27.585
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.270
BLADE KOTELLY: Yeah, go ahead.

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:32.770
AUDIENCE: Basically
making something

01:13:32.770 --> 01:13:34.926
that is small and functional.

01:13:34.926 --> 01:13:36.342
BLADE KOTELLY:
That would do what?

01:13:36.342 --> 01:13:37.820
AUDIENCE: Playing
any kind of media.

01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:38.400
BLADE KOTELLY: Right.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:38.900
OK.

01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:42.330
So it's like the idea of putting
all your music in your pocket,

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:43.100
right?

01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:46.030
That seems impossible to do
at some point in time, right?

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.570
And now you're like, of course,
all my music's in my pocket,

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:53.865
all my videos are in my pocket,
everything's in my pocket.

01:13:53.865 --> 01:13:56.120
Got big pockets.

01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:56.710
OK, yes.

01:13:56.710 --> 01:13:57.640
So things like that.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:58.640
That's an excellent one.

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.354
In the back, yes.

01:14:00.354 --> 01:14:01.845
AUDIENCE: Infrared thermometers.

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:06.090
Yeah.

01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.620
How to be able to get the
temperature of something

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.310
at distance.

01:14:12.210 --> 01:14:13.730
Well, you got 21 of them.

01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:17.320
We're going to work
our way up to you.

01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:19.310
OK people who got 10 or fewer.

01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:21.060
Groups that got 10 or fewer.

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.324
OK.

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:22.990
Tell us, Daniel.

01:14:27.370 --> 01:14:29.930
AUDIENCE: Selling a product

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:31.580
BLADE KOTELLY: Selling a product
without having a salesforce.

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:32.590
Right, that's an amazing idea.

01:14:32.590 --> 01:14:34.048
Like, what do you
do when you don't

01:14:34.048 --> 01:14:36.160
have anybody doing the selling?

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.630
How can you possibly do that?

01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:40.935
And said, ah, I've
got the internet.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:41.560
I'm Jeff Bezos.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:45.404
I can sell everything the world.

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:49.170
Yeah.

01:14:49.170 --> 01:14:50.550
It seems impossible.

01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:52.970
GM is working on this and
putting a lot of effort

01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:54.032
into this.

01:14:54.032 --> 01:14:56.240
In fact I've had a conversation
recently with someone

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:57.886
who thought there's
no way we're going

01:14:57.886 --> 01:15:01.870
to have self-driving cars
in the next 15 years.

01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:05.310
They think well, maybe for
special lanes, special places.

01:15:05.310 --> 01:15:08.150
But I think we're going to see
a lot more self-driving cars

01:15:08.150 --> 01:15:12.020
with breathalyzers on them.

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.215
[PUFF] You are not driving home.

01:15:14.215 --> 01:15:17.290
Get in the backseat.

01:15:17.290 --> 01:15:18.500
You pass out.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.390
You wake up at home.

01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:20.552
OK.

01:15:20.552 --> 01:15:22.960
Amazing!

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.380
Who else?

01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.042
10 or fewer, yes.

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:27.500
AUDIENCE: Oh, no
sorry, I had more.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:28.380
BLADE KOTELLY: You
had more than 10.

01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:28.880
OK.

01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.640
Who had 10 or fewer?

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.830
AUDIENCE: Nuclear fusion.

BLADE KOTELLY: Nuclear fusion.

01:15:33.755 --> 01:15:35.177
Can we do it?

01:15:35.177 --> 01:15:36.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just
can't sustain it.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:37.870
BLADE KOTELLY: Just
can't sustain it.

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:38.369
Interesting.

01:15:38.369 --> 01:15:40.800
So we're so close.

01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.531
But we desire it.

01:15:43.531 --> 01:15:44.030
What else?

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.340
How about 15 or fewer.

01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:47.430
I'm sorry, were we at 15?

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:48.820
15 or fewer.

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.570

BLADE KOTELLY: The
invention of the light bulb.

01:15:52.528 --> 01:15:56.900
So people thought, boy, how do
we get light without candles?

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.400
Right.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:59.066
How can I stay in
light without candles?

01:15:59.066 --> 01:16:00.670
Who invented the light bulb?

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:01.990
AUDIENCE: Not Thomas Edison.

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:03.430
BLADE KOTELLY:
Not Thomas Edison.

01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:05.220
That was a correct answer.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.160
Swan did.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.610
Swan did in England.

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:08.450
Smaller version.

01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:09.810
Swan invents the light bulb.

01:16:09.810 --> 01:16:11.870
Edison's like, ugh, you.

01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:13.310
And he spends a
lot of time trying

01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:15.143
to figure out how to
get around this patent.

01:16:15.143 --> 01:16:18.680
But we all call them Edison
bulbs and not Swan bulbs.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:19.617
Do you know why?

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.020
AUDIENCE: Because he
made them really big.

01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:22.978
BLADE KOTELLY: Because
he made them really big.

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:23.740
How did he do it?

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:25.400
So clever.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.450
So in this whole thing,
we talked about process,

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.460
we talked about stakeholders
and all these different people

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:30.500
who are involved.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.820
And Thomas Edison had
a very smart staff.

01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:35.380
And the staff had a
very big-- we call it

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:37.130
systems thinking perspective.

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:41.080
They said, well
look, candles are

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:46.250
used or things that supply
light and heat, gas lamps,

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:52.940
are used on the
side of fireplaces

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:57.430
in a very expensive homes.

01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:59.400
Particularly in Boston.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.570
They said, here's an idea.

01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:04.270
We're going to take
these light bulbs things,

01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:07.460
we're going to run wires
right through the tubes that

01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:10.960
currently kept gas,
we'll turn the gas off,

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.394
and we'll put a little
meter outside of your house

01:17:13.394 --> 01:17:15.310
that will measure how
much of this electricity

01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:18.110
you're using for
your light bulb.

01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:19.310
It's all brand new, right?

01:17:19.310 --> 01:17:20.250
So everyone's
like, whatever, OK.

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:21.041
And so they did it.

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:23.950
It's cool because it won't
burn down your house.

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.810
And they put these bulbs in
and they ran the wires through.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:27.790
Because they, said,
if you don't like it,

01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:29.540
we'll pull out the
wires, turn the gas on,

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.390
everything just works.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:33.950
So it's easy low
switching costs.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.890
Easy to start trying it out.

01:17:35.890 --> 01:17:36.557
Low risk.

01:17:36.557 --> 01:17:38.140
If you don't like
it, you can go back.

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:39.020
No problem.

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.400
Money back guarantee.

01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:41.800
And a way of measuring it.

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.840
And that's why he became
hugely successful.

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.350
OK.

01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:46.850
Great.

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:50.845
Other inventions from

01:17:50.845 --> 01:17:51.470

BLADE KOTELLY: Yes.

01:17:53.130 --> 01:17:54.820
The SR-71 Blackbird.

01:17:54.820 --> 01:17:55.450
Yes.

01:17:55.450 --> 01:17:57.520
Something that would
go incredibly fast.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:17:59.520
How fast does it go?

01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:00.910
So fast we don't even know!

01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:02.160
I think it's still classified.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.300
And it goes so fast and
flew so high that it

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.600
couldn't be caught on radar.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.240
You couldn't even see.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:08.690
You didn't know it
existed at the time.

01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:10.773
AUDIENCE: The design
compromise was about the fuel

01:18:10.773 --> 01:18:12.830
because it's not
sealed at ground level.

01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:15.371
BLADE KOTELLY: Ah, yes, so the
design compromise specifically

01:18:15.371 --> 01:18:17.850
here, is that at ground
level, it just leaks fuel.

01:18:17.850 --> 01:18:20.585
Because when it goes so
fast, it gets really hot.

01:18:20.585 --> 01:18:22.210
And we all know from
your thermal class

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:25.670
that things expand when they
get really hot, like metal.

01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:29.250
And it would expand and all
of a sudden not leak fuel

01:18:29.250 --> 01:18:30.900
when it was flying really fast.

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.540
But on the ground it
is just dripping fuel.

01:18:33.540 --> 01:18:35.300
Pretty crazy, right?

01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:38.080
What if your car ran like that?

01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:38.670
I'd love that.

01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:41.120
I could drive fast all the time.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.640
I'm sorry, Mr. Policeman.

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.850
I had to drive fast.

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:46.122
I'd be leaking fuel
all over the ground.

01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:47.580
AUDIENCE: Alternating currents

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:48.170
BLADE KOTELLY:
Alternating currents.

01:18:48.170 --> 01:18:48.669
Tell us.

01:18:48.669 --> 01:18:50.194
What was the--

01:18:50.194 --> 01:18:51.735
AUDIENCE: They were
looking for a way

01:18:51.735 --> 01:18:56.100
to distribute and
transmit high voltage.

01:18:56.100 --> 01:19:01.960
Enough electricity to keep the
[INAUDIBLE] and direct current

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.401
would break.

01:19:04.401 --> 01:19:07.235
Would not-- it wasn't--

01:19:07.235 --> 01:19:08.360
BLADE KOTELLY: Didn't work.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:09.656
OK.

01:19:09.656 --> 01:19:11.234
AUDIENCE: Motion
pictures or movies.

01:19:11.234 --> 01:19:12.150
BLADE KOTELLY: Movies.

01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:13.250
Yeah.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.240
Movies.

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:20.000
I want to see in front of me,
stuff happening like I'm there.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.060
How do I do that?

01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:23.330
I just have to put you
there, in front of a train,

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:27.040
speeding towards you
at 100 miles an hour.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.490
Or put a camera and I
project on a big thing.

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:33.380
And it's so big,
it's so exciting,

01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:35.900
that people in the
audience were aghast.

01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.840
They gasped when they
saw people moving.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.950
What else?

01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:42.920
Actually, coming
off of that-- color.

01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.420
We don't think about
color too much.

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.350
All we think of is
black and white.

01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.805
But we want it in color.

01:19:46.805 --> 01:19:49.630
And that was a huge
process change.

01:19:49.630 --> 01:19:52.650
And how about 22 items or fewer.

01:19:52.650 --> 01:19:53.650
We'll give you a chance.

01:19:53.650 --> 01:19:55.769
Go ahead, Patrick.

01:19:55.769 --> 01:19:57.560
AUDIENCE: The printing
press was a big one.

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.976
BLADE KOTELLY: The
printing press.

01:19:58.976 --> 01:20:00.690
Yeah, huge deal.

01:20:00.690 --> 01:20:02.560
What was the issue?

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.740
AUDIENCE: They were
having to have scribes--

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.740
BLADE KOTELLY: Yeah, you
have to copy everything

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:09.100
by hand which leads to lots of--

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:11.301
AUDIENCE: Carpal tunnel.

01:20:11.301 --> 01:20:13.050
BLADE KOTELLY: I don't
know if they really

01:20:13.050 --> 01:20:15.500
cared about the carpal tunnel
syndrome thing back then.

01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:17.660
They might have cared.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:19.200
But lots of errors.

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:21.800
Lots of errors and translation
errors and tons of errors.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.038
And what else was
the issue there?

01:20:24.038 --> 01:20:25.667
AUDIENCE: Slow.

01:20:25.667 --> 01:20:26.500
BLADE KOTELLY: Slow.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.530
It's very limited.

01:20:27.530 --> 01:20:30.460
So if you had a book, it's a
very big deal to have a book.

01:20:30.460 --> 01:20:31.710
And probably in the future
it will be a big deal

01:20:31.710 --> 01:20:34.001
to have a book again because
we'll all be reading PDFs.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:40.050
And from-- is this
your group who go 22?

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:40.550
Yes.

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:41.055
OK, yes.

01:20:43.770 --> 01:20:44.750
AUDIENCE: Paper cups.

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:45.370
BLADE KOTELLY: Paper cups.

01:20:45.370 --> 01:20:46.895
AUDIENCE: How do
you use something

01:20:46.895 --> 01:20:49.070
that isn't waterproof
to actually hold water?

01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:50.380
BLADE KOTELLY: Right.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:52.680
So paper will let
water go through it

01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:54.050
at some point when it saturates.

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:57.000
And The question is how
do you make it waterproof.

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:57.500
Right.

01:20:57.500 --> 01:21:00.380
So these are all
incredible innovations

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:05.470
that occurred from paper cups to
something like SR-71 Blackbird.

01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:09.234
And what I want to do is show
you, quickly, a short video.

01:21:09.234 --> 01:21:10.650
This is a really
interesting thing

01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:12.330
because the year
it was made was?

01:21:12.330 --> 01:21:13.330
JOHN: 1987.

01:21:13.330 --> 01:21:14.330
BLADE KOTELLY: 1987.

01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:15.163
Take a look at this.

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.820
OK, So I won't show you
the whole thing here.

01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.810
If you'd like, we
can send you a link.

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:25.351
This is something
Apple made in when?

01:21:25.351 --> 01:21:26.060
JOHN: 1987.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.040
BLADE KOTELLY: And
in it you'll see

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:28.780
there's a date that
actually occurs.

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:31.282
And the date is?

01:21:31.282 --> 01:21:33.607
JOHN: One year before
Siri is launched.

01:21:33.607 --> 01:21:34.440
BLADE KOTELLY: Yeah.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:34.630
OK.

01:21:34.630 --> 01:21:36.360
So it's right around
Siri's launch.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.770
And now we can do almost all the
things you see in this video.

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.420
You'll see there's
a camera up there.

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.280
He has a video chat with her.

01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.470
They're looking up things.

01:21:45.470 --> 01:21:49.219
He's correcting his spoken
spelling of something

01:21:49.219 --> 01:21:50.510
which Google does all the time.

01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:52.960
With enough context, they
correct things, sometimes

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.324
even accurately.

01:21:55.324 --> 01:21:56.740
He's getting his
information here.

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:57.869
He's reading appointments.

01:21:57.869 --> 01:21:59.660
This is all something
that's happening now.

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:02.720
This was the idea they wanted
so desperately to create.

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.700
Something that allowed
you to do something

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:09.910
in the most natural way,
but with technology.

01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:12.370
And we're basically there.

01:22:12.370 --> 01:22:16.590
So for your homework, I
want you to do something

01:22:16.590 --> 01:22:20.661
that maybe none of you have
ever done before, your homework.

01:22:20.661 --> 01:22:21.160
No, the--

01:22:27.051 --> 01:22:27.550
OK.

01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:30.430
I want you to design a game.

01:22:30.430 --> 01:22:31.526
I want you to make a game.

01:22:31.526 --> 01:22:33.150
There's not many
requirements you have.

01:22:33.150 --> 01:22:34.360
But it's a two player game.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.532
Maximum cost of materials
must be under $5.00.

01:22:36.532 --> 01:22:37.490
You can find materials.

01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:38.910
You don't need to
spend any money.

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:41.118
But the cost of materials
if someone were to buy them

01:22:41.118 --> 01:22:43.930
and make your game,
has to be under $5.00.

01:22:43.930 --> 01:22:46.460
It must include an
element of chance.

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:49.034
Must somehow contain chance
by whatever method you want.

01:22:49.034 --> 01:22:51.450
And must be able to be taught
to someone else within three

01:22:51.450 --> 01:22:54.324
minutes.

01:22:54.324 --> 01:22:58.620
AUDIENCE: Do we actually have
to make it or just design it?

01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:01.450
BLADE KOTELLY: You need
to design it and make it.

01:23:01.450 --> 01:23:02.710
You design it and make it.

01:23:02.710 --> 01:23:04.960
I suggest you even try it out.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:08.960
We might try some
of them in class.

01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.260
We might try some
of them in class.

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:13.234
AUDIENCE: This is due what day?

01:23:13.234 --> 01:23:14.400
BLADE KOTELLY: I don't know.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.000
It's on your syllabus.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.960
I think it's due on--

01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:19.020
JOHN: Next Monday.

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.145
BLADE KOTELLY: Next Monday.

01:23:20.145 --> 01:23:22.000
It's due next Monday.

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:25.690
Yes, I'm not going to give
you two days to design a game.

01:23:25.690 --> 01:23:26.190
OK.

01:23:26.190 --> 01:23:28.340
Thank you very much, everyone.

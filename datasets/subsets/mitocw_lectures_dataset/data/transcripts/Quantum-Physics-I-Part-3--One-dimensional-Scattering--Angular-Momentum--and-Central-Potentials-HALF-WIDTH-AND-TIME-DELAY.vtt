00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.600
PROFESSOR: What is gamma?

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.340
Well, it seems to have
a beta in there, alpha.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.390
It's a little unclear
what gamma means,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.110
so let's try to
make sense of it.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.790
Gamma has units of energy,
because this term has

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.706
units of energy, and
therefore the other term

00:00:21.706 --> 00:00:24.330
must have units
of energy as well.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.695
So gamma has units of energy.

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:31.320
And from a unit of energy
you could get a time.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.500
So tau, you can define
it as h over gamma.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
That has units of time.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.470
h bar has units of
energy times time,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.940
so if you divide by energy,
you get units of time.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.390
And what is this number?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.280
So this is some time.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.656
And it's equal to m
over 2 alpha beta h bar.

00:01:05.656 --> 00:01:06.400
We have this guy.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.080
So the natural
thing, of course, is

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:17.509
to compare to the time delay
associated due to this process

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:18.550
that we've been studying.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.960
So all the time delay,
delta t, was 2 h bar dE--

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.420
no, d delta dE.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:41.750
And this is 2 h bar dk
dE times d delta dk.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:54.290
Now, d delta dk, we calculated
it up on the blackboard.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.190
So this was equal to--

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:07.350
this had been calculated as
1 over beta at resonance.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.610
At the resonance, this time
delay is calculated above,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.060
and it's equal to 1 over beta.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.590
This thing is also
easily calculated,

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.650
because this is 1
over dE dk, which

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.577
is h bar squared k over m.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.510
Therefore, what do we get?

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.120
2 h bar divided
by h bar squared.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.410
k, you're at rest so that's
alpha over m, m here.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.170
And d delta dk is a beta.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.830
So what do we get here?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:04.390
Delta t is 2m over
h bar alpha beta.

00:03:07.644 --> 00:03:12.634
And compare with this
one, it's 4 times tau.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.965
So h over-- so
the end conclusion

00:03:20.965 --> 00:03:26.960
is that h bar over
gamma, which is a time,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.340
is tau, which is equal
to delta t over 4.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.790
So that's the intuition
for the half width.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.850
So in the distribution of
this scattering amplitude,

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.530
there's a half width.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.610
It's an energy distribution.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.255
And there's a time
associated with it, which

00:03:49.255 --> 00:03:53.000
is h bar over the half width.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.220
And, being a time,
it must be related

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.515
to some physical time
that has a period,

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:03.320
and there's nothing
else than the delay.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.720
So if the delay is
large, gamma is small,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.170
and the width is small.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.800
It's a narrow resonance.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:21.050
So a narrow resonance is one in
which the width is very small.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.660
So this has enormous
applications.

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.245
It's used in nuclear
physics all the time.

00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:32.910
It's used in particle
physics as well.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.730
The Higgs-Boson was
discovered over a year ago,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.780
it's a particle
but it's unstable.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.240
It decays very fast.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.560
If you thought in
terms of that, it just

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.090
gets created by
a reaction, stays

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.210
in the well for a little
while, and poof, disappears.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.410
So its mathematics
in cross-sections

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.560
is governed by resonances.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.060
So we call the Higgs
particle a particle,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.900
but anything that is
unstable it's more like, more

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:14.690
precisely viewed as an object
that represents a resonance.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.160
The Higgs particle
doesn't live too long.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.780
Lives about 10 to
the minus 22 seconds.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.500
Very little time.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.490
And then it decays and it goes
into b-bbar, bottom bottom bar

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.130
quark.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:35.356
As it goes into z's, it
goes into tau lambda.

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:36.995
So it goes into two photons.

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:39.380
It can decay into
all these things.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:47.350
So in the case of
the Higgs-Boson,

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:49.960
the center energy
of the resonance

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:56.040
is observed in scattering
amplitudes at a center energy E

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.987
alpha of 125 GEv.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.440
The width is very small.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:16.320
In fact, the width is
about gamma, it's about 4

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.640
MEv plus minus 5%.

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.790
4 MEv, that's very
little, because an MEv

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.850
is 1/1000 of a GEv.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.700
So it's a very narrow resonance.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:39.366
And from this gamma,
you can get a time.

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:41.912
And the time is lifetime.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.860
It's about 10 to the
minus 22 seconds.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:58.110
So this is the language
that we use to describe

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.870
any unstable particle.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.110
We think of it as resonance.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:04.030
It's sometimes called resonance.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.500
And the title of papers
that appear at that time

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.930
is the resonance observed in
the data, the Higgs-Boson.

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.660
And the answer was yes.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.070
This was observed
as a resonance.

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.500
It is a scattering
amplitude that is uniform,

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:26.870
and it has some energy,
has a little peak.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.110
You can imagine
people can't quite

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.930
measure the width directly.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.765
It's too narrow.

00:07:32.765 --> 00:07:35.400
So the plots don't
show the width,

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.360
but the width is implied, and
there's related calculations

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.650
over here with the lambda.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.410
So it's all a nice story.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:47.060
OK.

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.730
So look what we've done.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.500
We began by discussing
that we could not get

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.280
time delays that were negative.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.260
Times advance, then we
get long time delays,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.800
and that's a resonance.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.790
We showed that they
correspond to changes,

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:09.200
rapid changes of delta in
the positive direction.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.537
And we've modeled them
so that in general, we

00:08:12.537 --> 00:08:14.890
have a general
description of what's

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.900
happening near a resonance.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.690
MICHAEL SHORT: All right, guys.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.620
So today I'm not going to be
doing most of the talking.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.510
You actually are,
because, like I've said,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.940
we've been teaching you
all sorts of crazy physics

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.500
and radiation biology.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.870
We've taught you how
to smell bullshit,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.000
taught you a little bit
about how to read papers

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.260
and what to look for.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.635
And we're going to spend the
second half of today's class

00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:43.680
actually doing that.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.710
Well, we're going to have a
mini debate on whether or not

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.848
hormesis is real.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.890
And you guys are going to
spend some time finding

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.038
evidence for or against it.

00:00:52.038 --> 00:00:54.330
Instead of just me telling
you this is what hormesis is

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.930
or isn't.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.600
So just to finish up the
multicellular effects

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.130
from last time,
we started talking

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.310
about what's called the
bystander effect, which says,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.560
if a cell is
irradiated, and it dies

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.440
or something happens to it,
the other cells nearby notice.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.110
And they speed up
their metabolism,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.520
their oxidative
metabolism, which

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.800
can generate some of the
same chemical byproducts

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.642
as radiolysis does,
causing additional cell

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:18.475
damage and mutation.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.350
And there was an interesting--

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.440
yeah, I think I left-- we
left off here at this study,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.090
where they actually
talked about most

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.300
of the types of mutations
found in the bystander

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.800
cells were of different types.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.890
But there were mutations
found, in this case,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.710
as a result of what's called
oxidative-based damage.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.690
This is oxidative
cell metabolism

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.590
ramping up and producing more of
those metabolic byproducts that

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.610
can damage DNA as well.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.320
What we didn't get
into is the statistics.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.650
What do the statistics look
like for large sample sizes

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.525
of people who have been exposed
to small amounts of radiation?

00:01:57.525 --> 00:01:59.150
I'm going to show
you a couple of them.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.820
One of them is the folks within
3 kilometers of the Hiroshima.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.510
So I want you to notice
a couple of things.

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.699
Here is the dose in gray,
maxing out at about two gray.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.980
And in this case
this ERR is what's

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.755
called Excess Relative Risk.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:15.130
It's a little
different than odds

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.850
ratio, where here an
excess relative risk of 0

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.820
means it's like
nothing happened.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.890
So anything above 0 means
extra excess relative risk.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.120
So what are some of the features
you notice about this data?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.520
What's rather striking
about it in your opinion?

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.580
Yeah?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.420
Charlie?

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
so in the [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.420
timeline from [INAUDIBLE]
timeline here.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.420
MICHAEL SHORT: This one?

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.045
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:45.962
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah,
these are the errors.

00:02:45.962 --> 00:02:46.480
Yep.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.397
What does it say here?

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:51.814
Is it-- more than one
standard error Yeah.

00:02:51.814 --> 00:02:54.155
AUDIENCE: There's a
lot of variability?

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:55.530
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, I mean, look

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.850
at the confidence in
this data at high doses.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.050
And then while you may say,
OK, the amount of relative risk

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.855
per amount of
radiation increases

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.980
with decreasing dose, which
is the opposite of what

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.200
you might think, our
confidence in that number

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.700
goes out the window.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.520
Now what do you think of the
total number of people that led

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.870
to each of these data points?

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.870
How many folks do you
think were exposed to gray

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.173
versus milligray of radiation?

00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:25.115
AUDIENCE: A lot less for
gray than [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:26.990
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
right, the sample size.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.700
I thought it was cold
and loud in here.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.870
The sample size for the folks
in gray is much smaller.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.620
And yet the error bars
are much smaller too.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.020
That's not usually the
way it goes, is it?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.450
Usually, you think larger
sample size, smaller error bars,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.110
unless the effects themselves
and confounding variables are

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.580
hard to tease out
from each other.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.540
If you then look at
another set of people,

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.871
all of the survivor--
oh. yeah, Charlie?

00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:56.454
AUDIENCE: How did they determine
the-- the doses [INAUDIBLE]??

00:03:56.454 --> 00:03:58.788
MICHAEL SHORT: This would
have to be from some estimate.

00:03:58.788 --> 00:04:00.070
This would be from models.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.990
It's not like folks had
dosimeters everywhere

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.280
in Japan in the 1940s.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.140
But this-- these
would be estimates

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.360
depending on where
you lived, let's

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.370
say in an urban,
suburban, or rural area,

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.760
let's see, things
like milk intake

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.250
right after the bomb, or
anything that would have given

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.880
you an unusually high
amount of radiation,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.040
distance where the
winds were going.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.540
This is the best you
could do with that data.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.770
And now look at all
of the bomb survivors,

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.000
including the ones outside
3 kilometer region,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.180
but still got some dose.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.805
What's changed?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.450
AUDIENCE: It seems like
they're less likely to get

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.290
more risk for less dose.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.170
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, the conclusion

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.840
is almost flipped for
the low dose cases.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.470
If you put them side by side,
depending on the folks living

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.740
within 3 kilometers of
the epicenter of Hiroshima

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.100
versus anyone exposed,
all the bomb survivors,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.160
you get an almost opposite
conclusion for low doses,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.600
despite the numbers
being almost,

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.400
you know, within each
others confidence

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.710
intervals for high doses.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:08.960
So what this tells us is
that the effects of high dose

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.200
are relatively easy to
understand and quite obvious

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.060
even with low sample sizes.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.790
What is different between
these two data sets?

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.240
Well, it's the only difference
that's actually listed here.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.167
Distance from the
epicenter, right?

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:30.750
So before I tell you
what's different,

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.030
I want you guys to try
to think about what

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.400
could be different
about the folks living

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.220
within 3 kilometers of
the epicenter of Hiroshima

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.750
versus anyone else in the
city or the countryside?

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.380
Yeah?

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.210
AUDIENCE: Would it
be like [INAUDIBLE]??

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.590
It seems like a the
closer, like, it

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.210
would be a lot more instances
where you get a higher dose.

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.384
So they're underestimating
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Could be, yeah.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.990
It might be harder to figure out
exactly how much dose folks had

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.900
without necessarily
measuring it, right?

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.260
But what other major factors
or confounding variables

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.860
are confusing the data here?

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.944
Yeah?

00:06:10.944 --> 00:06:15.664
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't a lot
of people who lived closer,

00:06:15.664 --> 00:06:18.690
like, not inside
the radiation, like,

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:24.118
the actual shockwave and heat
from the bomb [INAUDIBLE]??

00:06:24.118 --> 00:06:26.660
MICHAEL SHORT: So in this case,
these are for bomb survivors.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.110
So, yes, that's true.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.260
If you're closer, you
get the gamma blast.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.550
You get the pressure wave.

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.610
AUDIENCE: But like, even if
you survive that, it still like

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.560
would affect them in
addition to radiation.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.903
Is it counting for people who
got injured from that too?

00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:43.320
MICHAEL SHORT: It should just
account all survivors, yeah.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.737
AUDIENCE: So if
they were injured,

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.068
that could change how they
reacted to the radiation

00:06:47.068 --> 00:06:47.827
exposure.

00:06:47.827 --> 00:06:48.660
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.720
Absolutely.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.710
And then the other
big one is, actually,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.628
someone's kind of mentioned it,
but in passing, urban or rural.

00:06:56.628 --> 00:06:58.420
The environment that
you live in depends on

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.630
how quickly, let's say, the
ecosystem replenishes or not

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.510
if you live in a city or
what sort of other toxins

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.190
or concentrated
sources of radiation

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:08.890
you may be exposed to by
living in a city that's

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.558
endured a nuclear attack
or something else.

00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:13.600
It could also depend on
the amount of health care

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.220
that you're able to receive.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.850
If you show some
symptoms of something,

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.705
if you live way out
in the countryside,

00:07:18.705 --> 00:07:20.080
and there weren't
a lot of roads,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.590
then maybe you can't get
to the best hospital,

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.260
or you go to a clinic that
we don't know as much.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.857
The point is, there's a lot
of confounding variables.

00:07:29.857 --> 00:07:30.940
There's a lot more people.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.890
But anything from
like lifestyle,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.160
to diet, to relative exposure,
think about the differences

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.830
in how folks in the city
and out in the countryside

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.320
may have been exposed
to the same dose,

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.580
because, again, dose is given
in gray, not in sieverts.

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:47.170
That's the best we can estimate.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:49.150
But would it matter
if you were to exposed

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:52.210
to let's say, alpha-particle
containing fallout

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.970
that you would
then ingest versus

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:58.830
exposed to a lot of gamma
rays or delayed betas.

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.570
It absolutely would.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.722
So the type of radiation and the
route of exposure in the organs

00:08:04.722 --> 00:08:06.930
that were affected are not
accounted for in the study

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:09.630
because, again, the
data is in gray.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.390
It's just an estimated
joules per kilogram

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.630
of radiation exposure, not
taking into account the quality

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.230
factors for tissue, the quality
factors for type of radiation,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.730
the relative exposure,
the dose rate,

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.250
which we've already
talked about.

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:27.660
How much you got as a function
of time actually does matter.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.940
So all these things
are quite important.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.049
And for all these
sorts of studies,

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.600
you have to consider
the statistics.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.549
So let's now look at a--

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:38.100
I won't say, OK, a
cellphone-like study

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.470
where one might draw a
conclusion if the error

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:42.830
bars weren't drawn.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.740
So based on this, can you
say that very low doses

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.380
of radiation in
this area actually

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.770
give you some increased
risk of, what do they say,

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:52.760
female breast cancer?

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:56.730
No.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.880
You can't be bold enough to
draw a conclusion from the very

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.218
low dose region from, let's
say, the-- the 1s to 10s

00:09:04.218 --> 00:09:06.510
of milligray, that whole
region right there that people

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.550
are afraid of getting,
we don't actually

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:13.300
know if it hurts or it has
nothing, or if it helps.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.585
That's a kind of weird
thing to think about.

00:09:16.585 --> 00:09:18.210
So the question is,
what do we do next?

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.730
These are the actual
recommendations from the ICRP.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:23.130
And I've highlighted
the parts that

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.460
are important, in my opinion,
for everyone to read.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:30.800
And the most important
one, probably we'll

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.470
have to come to terms
with some uncertainty

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.400
in the amount of damage that
little amounts of dose do.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.760
So this is the ICRP saying
to the general public,

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.720
you guys should chill out.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.070
There's not much we can do
about tiny amounts of exposure.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:47.570
They happen all the time.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.000
You can either worry about it,
and get your heart rate up,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.800
and elevate your
own blood pressure,

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.830
and have a higher chance
of dying on your own,

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.710
or you can just chill
out because there is not

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.170
enough evidence to say
whether a tiny little amount

00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:03.470
of radiation, and we're talking
in the milligray or below,

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.290
helps, or hurts, or does
nothing, which leads me

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:11.850
into the last set of slides
for this entire course,

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.250
they're not that long because
I want you guys to actually

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.520
do a lot of the work here,
is radiation hormesis, real

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.890
or not?

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:21.920
There are plenty of studies
pointing one way or the other.

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:26.330
And I want to show you a few of
them with some other examples.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:29.030
The whole idea here is that
a little bit of a bad thing

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:31.370
can be a good thing,
much like vitamins,

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:34.730
or, let's say, vitamin A in
seal livers, a little bit of it

00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.240
you need.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.980
It's a vital micronutrient.

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.658
A whole lot of it can do
a whole lot of damage.

00:10:39.658 --> 00:10:42.200
You don't usually think of that
being the case for radiation.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.180
But some studies may have
you believe otherwise

00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.730
with surprisingly
high sample sizes.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.990
So the idea here is that if
you've got anything, not just

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.660
element and diet, but
anything that happens to you,

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:57.380
there's going to be some
optimum level where you could

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:00.200
die or have some ill
effects if exposed

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.390
to too much or too little.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.900
We all know that this happens
with high amounts of radiation.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.340
The question is, is
that actually happened?

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.000
So let's look at
some of the data.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.570
In this case, I mentioned
selenium and actually

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.910
have a fair bit of this
data that shows some,

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:23.170
let's say, contradictory
results in this case, where

00:11:23.170 --> 00:11:25.540
a whole lots of
different people were

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.120
exposed to a certain amount
of selenium accidentally.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.220
I don't think these were
any intentional studies.

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.880
But some folks received
massive doses of selenium

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:36.400
and tried-- folks tried
to figure out, well,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.890
what how-- oh, yeah, if you
want to see how much they got.

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:44.050
Remember that you want about 5
micrograms per day on average.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:47.090
That's a pretty crazy
amount of selenium

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.970
that ended up killing
this person in four hours.

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:52.580
But let's look at a sort of
medium dose, something way

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.250
higher than you
would normally get.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.640
Two different studies published
in peer-reviewed places--

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.870
this one says, "taking
mega doses of selenium,"

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.920
so enormous doses, "may
have acute toxic effects

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.750
and showed no
decreased incidence

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:13.550
of prostate cancer and
increased prostate cancer rates.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:15.350
35,000 people.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:18.770
The same supplements
greatly reduced

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:22.717
secondary prostate cancer
evolution in another study."

00:12:22.717 --> 00:12:24.800
Kind of hard to wrap your
head around that, right?

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.520
Both these studies were done
with, I'd say, enough people

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.368
and came to absolutely
opposite conclusions,

00:12:31.368 --> 00:12:33.410
showing that there's
definitely other confounding

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:35.660
variables at work here.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.790
So there's kind of two
solutions to this problem,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.530
increase your sample
size to try to get

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:42.290
a most representative
set of the population

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.430
or control for other
confounding variables.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.930
And then the question
is, how do you

00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:49.950
model how much is a
good thing to go over

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.300
what these models mean.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:54.760
The one that's described
right now in the public

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.920
is called the linear-no
threshold model.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.860
This means that if this
axis right here is bad

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:02.410
and this is axis
right here is amount

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:05.420
that any amount of
radiation is bad for you.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.420
What I think might be a
little bit more accurate

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.720
is called the linear
threshold model.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.980
If you remember from
two classes ago,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.570
the ICRP recommends
that, I think,

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.740
0.01 microsieverts is
considered nothing officially.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.990
That would mean there is
a threshold below which

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:21.615
we absolutely don't care.

00:13:21.615 --> 00:13:22.990
And if there are
any ill effects,

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.870
they're statistically
inseparable from anything else

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:27.120
that would happen.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.963
And that would suggest here
this linear threshold model,

00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:31.630
where this control
line right here would

00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:35.740
be the incidence of whatever
bad happens in the control

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:39.450
population not exposed to
the radiation, the selenium,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:40.700
the whatever.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:43.300
There's also a couple of other
ones like the hormesis model,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.090
which says that if
you get no radiation,

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.788
you get the same amount of ill
effects as the control group.

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:51.580
If you get a little
radiation, you actually

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.460
get less ill effects.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.263
In this case, this
would be like saying

00:13:56.263 --> 00:13:58.180
getting a little bit of
radiation to the lungs

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.730
could decrease your
incidence of lung cancer.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.935
Does anyone believe that idea?

00:14:03.935 --> 00:14:05.560
Getting a little bit
dose to your lungs

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.670
could decrease lung cancer?

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.470
OK.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.410
And then you reach some
point of crossover point

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:16.260
where, yeah, a lot of
this thing becomes bad.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.540
And the question is,
is radiation hormetic?

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.190
Does this region where
things get better actually

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:28.090
lead all the way to x equals
0 as a function of dose?

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:29.670
And I want to skip
ahead a little bit

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.110
to some of the studies.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.410
No, I don't want to skip ahead.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:38.210
There are some non
hormetic models

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.400
that have been proposed
in the literature.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.890
It's easy to wrap your head
around a linear model, right?

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.030
It's just a line.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.920
More is worse.

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:46.790
But the question is, how much?

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:49.820
So folks have proposed
things like linear quadratic,

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.130
where a little bit
of dose is bad.

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:56.450
And then a lot more dose is
more bad as a function of dose.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:59.090
That's actually kind of what
we saw in the Hiroshima data.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.990
And I'll show you
again in a sec.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.380
So the history of this LNT,
or Linear No-Threshold model,

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.450
states the following
four things--

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.740
radiation exposure is harmful.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.582
Well, does anyone disagree
with that statement?

00:15:13.582 --> 00:15:16.052
I think we all know that
even large-- you know,

00:15:16.052 --> 00:15:18.630
at least large amounts of
radiation exposure is bad.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:21.630
It's harmful at all
exposure levels.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.930
That's the one you
have to wonder.

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:26.570
Each increment of exposure
adds the overall risk,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.090
saying that it's an always
increasing function.

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:30.860
And the rate of
accumulation exposure

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.870
has no bearing on risk.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.730
The first one's easy.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.310
We know this is true
because you expose people

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:38.750
to a lot of
radiation, bad things

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.660
tend to happen,
deterministically.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.450
The second one, we
already know is false.

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:49.110
If you look at large sample
sets of data, like, the data

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:50.700
we showed before,
there's definitely

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.180
a non-linear sort of
relationship going, where

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:56.700
each incremental
amount of exposure

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.470
has the same amount
of incremental risk.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:04.090
We know from a lot of studies
that's not typically true.

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:09.000
Then the question is,
what about these two?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.750
So now it's going to--
we're going to find

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:14.420
and who you some fairly
interesting studies.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:18.610
In this case, leukemia as a
function of radiation dose,

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:21.430
what do you guys think
about this data set before I

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.020
seed any ideas into your heads?

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.180
So here is dose and
sieverts, not gray.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.410
And here is odds ratio, relative
risk of contracting leukemia.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.400
If you were to look at
the data points alone,

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.389
what would you say?

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:45.110
AUDIENCE: A little bit
of dose is good for you.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:46.960
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
you might think that.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.418
But look at all
the different types

00:16:48.418 --> 00:16:50.520
of models you can draw
through the error bars.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:51.960
As you could draw
anything going,

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.420
let's say, down and then up.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.150
You could draw a linear
no-threshold model,

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:59.250
as long as it got through
this line right here

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.530
or a linear quadratic model.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:04.470
So a study like
this doesn't quite

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:07.760
give you any sort of
measurable conclusion.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:11.829
A study like this might,
especially considering

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.260
the number of people involved.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.200
In this case, this
is the activity

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:21.339
of radon in air as related
to the incidence of lung

00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:24.369
cancer per 10,000 people.

00:17:24.369 --> 00:17:28.329
Notice the sample size
here, 200,000 people

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:32.620
from 1,600 counties that
comprise 90% of the population.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.310
Chances are you've then
passed the urban-rural divide.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.780
You've then passed any
region of the country.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.200
So by including such a
gigantic sample size,

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.540
you do mostly eliminate
the confounding variables.

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.700
So, location, you know,
house construction,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.880
urban versus rural,
age, anything else

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.408
are pretty much smeared out
in the enormous sample size.

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:55.450
And what do you see here?

00:17:59.772 --> 00:18:01.480
AUDIENCE: Looks pretty
good for low dose.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.440
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
you see a fairly

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:05.720
statistically-significant
hormesis

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.690
effect, where, you know,
the route of exposure

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.040
is very well-known.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.560
Everything else seems to
be controlled for by--

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.050
I mean, we've included
something like almost 0.1%

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:17.000
of the US population.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.690
That's not bad.

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:24.770
Other ones for people that get
more specific, targeted dose,

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.110
in this case, women who
received multiple x-rays

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.680
to monitor lung collapse during
tuberculosis treatment, a group

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.320
of people that can
be tightly controlled

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.600
and followed very well.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.300
These are numbers with
one standard deviation.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.500
And that, right there so
you can see, is centigray.

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.650
So this dose right here
is one gray worth of dose.

00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:47.750
That's a pretty toasty
amount of radiation.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.840
But below that,
again, statistically

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.290
significant-looking data.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.650
I don't know how many
people were in the study

00:18:56.650 --> 00:18:58.400
because I didn't extract
that information.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.025
But it's something you might be
doing in the next half an hour.

00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:04.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.790
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, it does.

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.200
It says deaths per 10,000 women.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.590
But how many people
were in the study?

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.340
The question is, what
is your sample size?

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.450
So like in the last study,
it was just 200,000 people

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.150
in the samples.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.400
That gives you some pretty
good confidence that you've

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.620
eliminated confounding results.

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.840
So I don't know how many
folks get tuberculosis

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:27.345
these days in the US, or whether
this was even a US study,

00:19:27.345 --> 00:19:28.970
chances are the sample
size is smaller.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.090
So than even if the data
support your idea of hormesis,

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.830
you have to call
into question, is

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:36.740
this a large enough, and
a representative enough,

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.542
sample size to draw
any real conclusion?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.700
So then let's keep going.

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.940
More data needed.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:47.233
Evidence for a threshold model.

00:19:47.233 --> 00:19:49.150
This is probably the
most boring-looking graph

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:51.460
that actually gives
you some idea of,

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.770
should there be a threshold
for how much radiation

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:55.000
is a bad thing?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.270
In this case, it's
very careful data.

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:00.910
It's a very carefully-controlled
data set, lung cancer

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:03.807
death from radon in miners.

00:20:03.807 --> 00:20:05.890
And folks that are going
down underground probably

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:07.522
have a higher incidence
of lung cancer

00:20:07.522 --> 00:20:08.980
overall from all
the horrible stuff

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:12.880
they're exposed to, whether
it's coal or, you know,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.950
if you're mining gypsum.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.130
Oh, there's lots of
nasty stuff down there.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.950
But there is an
additional amount

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.620
of deaths responsible
from radon.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.230
Here's your relative
list risk level of 1

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:25.400
and up to 10
picocuries per liter,

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:31.490
which was around the
maximum of the last study.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.520
It's as boring as it
gets, which helps refute

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.680
the idea of a linear
no-threshold model,

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:40.190
because if there was a
linear no-threshold model,

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:44.960
this dose versus risk would
be reliably and significantly

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.720
going up.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.500
So there's data out
there to support this.

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:53.640
And even-- even better
ones, lung cancer deaths

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:54.720
from radon in homes.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.460
The study was
careful to look at.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.470
If you look at the
legend here, these

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:02.870
are different cities ranging
from Shenyang in China,

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:05.630
to Winnipeg in Canada, to New
Jersey, which is apparently

00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:08.990
a city, to places in Finland,
Sweden, and Stockholm,

00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:11.120
which are somehow
different places.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:11.690
Yeah.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.898
So when you see a study like
this where they actually

00:21:13.898 --> 00:21:15.560
control and check
to make sure they're

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.080
not getting any
single locality as

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.810
an unrepresentative
measurement, and the data just

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:21.710
looked like a crowd--

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:25.928
a cloud along relative
risk equals 1,

00:21:25.928 --> 00:21:28.220
this either refutes the idea
that there is no threshold

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.600
or supports the
idea that there's

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.710
got to be some threshold lying
beyond 10 picocuries per liter.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.610
So, again, to me, it supports
the ICRP's recommendation

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:38.680
of chill out.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.180
You're going to have a little
bit of radon in your basement.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.310
But pretty big studies,
and quite a lot of them,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:46.670
show that a little bit isn't
going to add any risk to you.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:48.380
So if you're worried
about risk, they're

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:53.020
statistically is none based on
quite a few of these studies.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.770
And in order to enable you to
find these studies on your own,

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:59.090
I wanted to go through five
minutes of where to look.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:02.200
And the answer is not Google
because Google is not very

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.360
good at finding every study.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.460
It also picks up a
whole lot of garbage

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.800
that's not peer reviewed because
it just scrabbles the internet,

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.300
you know?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:12.430
That's what it does really well.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.560
Instead, I want us to
take the next half hour,

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:18.740
split into teams for
and against hormesis,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:20.660
and try and find
studies that confirm

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.660
or refute the idea that
radiation hormesis is

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.590
an actual effect.

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:29.220
So how many of you have
some sort of computer device

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.830
with you here?

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:31.330
Good.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.670
Enough so that there is
equal amount in each group.

00:22:34.670 --> 00:22:37.132
I'd like to switch
now to my own browser.

00:22:37.132 --> 00:22:39.090
And I want to show you
guys the Web of Science.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:51.210
Web of-- yeah, [INAUDIBLE]
I use Pine on my phone.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:54.460
It's much better science.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.730
So if you just Google search Web
of Science, and you're at MIT,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.380
it will recognize
your certificates

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:03.820
and send you into the actual
best scientific paper indexing

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.002
thing out there.

00:23:05.002 --> 00:23:06.730
AUDIENCE: Better
than Google Scholar?

00:23:06.730 --> 00:23:08.630
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, my god, it's
better than Google Scholar.

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:09.460
Yeah.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:11.080
If you think you've
found everything

00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:13.538
by looking at Google Scholar,
you're only fooling yourself.

00:23:13.538 --> 00:23:15.190
You're not fooling anybody else.

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:16.202
It's getting better.

00:23:16.202 --> 00:23:17.410
But it doesn't find anything.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.840
And Google Scholar is
really good at finding

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.310
things that aren't
peer reviewed,

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:24.040
self-published stuff,
things on archive, things

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.690
that you can't
trust because they

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.670
haven't passed the muster
of the scientific community.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:31.450
So instead, let's
say you would just

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:33.900
do a simple search for
radiation hormesis.

00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:34.810
You can all do this.

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:35.140
Don't worry.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:36.557
I'm not showing
you how to search.

00:23:36.557 --> 00:23:38.470
I'm showing you some
of the other features

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:40.500
of Web of Science.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.450
And you end up with 534 papers.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:46.660
You can, let's say, sort
by number of times cited,

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:51.190
which may or may not be a factor
in how trustworthy the data is.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.168
It might just correlate
with the age of the paper.

00:23:54.168 --> 00:23:55.460
It might also be controversial.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.510
So if people cite it as an
example of what to do wrong,

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.920
it might be highly cited.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.830
You know, people have made
tenure cases and like careers

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:04.330
on papers that ended
up being wrong.

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.840
And all you see is 10,000
citations saying this person

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.840
is an idiot.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.367
If the committee val-- you know,
judging you for a promotion

00:24:10.367 --> 00:24:11.950
doesn't read that
far into it, they're

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:15.300
like, oh, my god,
10,000 citations, right?

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:15.800
Boom!

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.140
Tenure, that's all
you have to do.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.540
I think I have it
a little tougher.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:25.340
The important part is while
with a title like that, oh, man,

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.110
the more-- the real
fun part though is you

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.150
can see who has
cited this paper.

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:31.700
So if you want to then go see,
why has this paper been cited

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:35.540
260 times, you can instantly
see all the titles, and years,

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.750
and number of additional
citations of the papers

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.310
that have cited it.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:45.300
So this is how you get started
with a real research, research.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:46.850
Yeah, that's what
I meant to say,

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.490
is starting from a paper and
a tool like Web of Science,

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.700
you can go forward and
backward in citation time,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.430
backward in time to see what
evidence this paper used

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:58.430
to make their claims,
forward in time to see what

00:24:58.430 --> 00:25:00.707
other people thought about it.

00:25:00.707 --> 00:25:02.040
So who wants to be for hormesis?

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.830
All right, everyone, all you
guys on one side of the room,

00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:11.020
all you guys, other guys on
the other side of the room.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.570
And I'd like you
guys to try to find

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:15.090
the most convincing
studies that you can

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.950
to prove the other side wrong.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.830
I suggest using Web
Science, not Google Scholar.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:24.240
It's pretty easy to figure
out how to learn how to use.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.220
And let's see what
conclusion we come to.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:32.270
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep,
hormesis by the wall--

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.350
yeah, anti-hormesis
by the window.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.850
There we go.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.800
And I'm going to hide this
because I don't want to give

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.060
anyone an unfair advantage.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.060
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.980
SARAH: So this is a graph
showing the immune response

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.120
in the cells of mice showing
that after they were given

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:58.010
doses from 0 to 2 gray,
or 0 to 7 on the right,

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:59.480
the response of
the immune system.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.120
So at the lower doses below like
0.5 gray, which is in the range

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:10.430
that we're looking at, well,
the immune system in the mice

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.520
had a stronger response
at low doses of radiation

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.410
and then very
quickly tapered off,

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:19.720
supporting the claim the
low doses are good for mice.

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.541
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:20.541 --> 00:26:21.624
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:22.124 --> 00:26:23.822
SARAH: I have another graph too.

00:26:23.822 --> 00:26:26.030
MICHAEL SHORT: So this
percentage change in response,

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:30.116
I'm assuming 100
years is no dose.

00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:31.060
OK.

00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:32.620
SARAH: Yes.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:35.740
So at higher doses, the
response of the immune system

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:39.370
was suppressed, which follows
with what all the other studies

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:45.251
show about giving doses in
excess of like 1 gray to cells.

00:26:45.251 --> 00:26:47.510
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:49.617
So anti-hormesis group.

00:26:49.617 --> 00:26:51.200
SARAH: Oh, I have
another graph, but--

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.710
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, you do?

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.310
SARAH: Yeah.

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:53.290
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, I wasn't
going to call them out.

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:54.950
I was going to have them
criticize what's up here.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:55.805
SARAH: Oh, no.

00:26:55.805 --> 00:26:56.680
I have another graph.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.013
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE] next.

00:27:00.122 --> 00:27:01.580
SARAH: I have two
of the same ones.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.740
No, I have another
one somewhere.

00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.660
I'll find it in a sec.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.930
This one.

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.600
All right, so this
one is incidences

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:23.170
of lung cancer based
on mean radon level

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:24.430
and corrected for smoking.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.040
So you can't say that it was
just from people smoking.

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.010
So for radon levels up to
7 picocuries per liter,

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:35.710
the incidence of
fatal lung cancer

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.190
actually decreased as
you had more radon.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.030
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.530
AUDIENCE:

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:44.518
SARAH: Yes.

00:27:44.518 --> 00:27:46.060
MICHAEL SHORT:
Anything else you guys

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.700
want to show before we let the
anti-hormesis folks poke at it?

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.133
SARAH: That's what I got.

00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:52.940
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:53.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:53.815 --> 00:27:55.398
MICHAEL SHORT: What
are your thoughts?

00:27:55.398 --> 00:27:57.550
AUDIENCE: OK, could you
go back to the last one.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.720
SARAH: I will try, yes.

00:28:03.530 --> 00:28:06.420
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any other [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] response.

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.570
AUDIENCE: So-- so
a mouse is twice--

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:15.490
almost twice as effective
at fending off disease?

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:19.378
OK, I-- I am not
a mouse biologist,

00:28:19.378 --> 00:28:24.238
but the smell test
makes me think that--

00:28:24.238 --> 00:28:26.190
that perplexed me.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:30.800
And I guess you didn't
do studies [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.740
SARAH: I am not personally
offended by this.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:33.470
So you're good.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.505
AUDIENCE: Enormous--
enormous change.

00:28:37.505 --> 00:28:40.820
And if radiation hormesis
has such a strong effect

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.280
on these mice, then why isn't it
something everywhere as a thing

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:44.780
now.

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:48.600
Like, if radiation-- if
hormesis is responsible for 80%

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.567
[? movement ?] in mice,
[INAUDIBLE] like where--

00:28:51.567 --> 00:28:53.400
SARAH: I don't know
that it was improvement.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:55.800
I think it was just in the
amount of response they saw.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:57.520
I don't know if
that means it's--

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.062
well, that doesn't
always mean it was

00:28:59.062 --> 00:29:01.480
effective at doing something.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:01.980
Right.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:03.990
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE]
you guys have comments too?

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.700
AUDIENCE: Additionally,
that's like an extremely small

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.680
of a dose for such
a massive response

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.000
in like a field that is
so based on probability.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.780
Like, how can something
like the dose range

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.990
that small have that much
of an impact on mice?

00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:22.038
SARAH: Well, from 0 to half
a gray is pretty significant.

00:29:22.038 --> 00:29:23.080
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.480
SARAH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.973
AUDIENCE: --before you
get to the 0.6 gray.

00:29:27.973 --> 00:29:29.390
AUDIENCE: You're
also only looking

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:33.010
at the cells from
[INAUDIBLE] it seems like.

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:35.650
And it like looked
varied depending

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:36.850
on the kind of tissue.

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.655
So you can't do it for overall.

00:29:39.655 --> 00:29:41.030
MICHAEL SHORT:
OK, I want to hear

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.700
from the pro-hormesis team.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.380
What makes your-- what makes
your legs a little shaky trying

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.310
to stand and hold this up?

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:50.062
MICHAEL SHORT: Aha.

00:29:50.965 --> 00:29:52.238
SARAH: Didn't read the study.

00:29:52.238 --> 00:29:53.134
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:54.463 --> 00:29:55.630
MICHAEL SHORT: I like this--

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.800
I like this idea
that, yeah, you're

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.990
only looking at one type
of cell, which may or may

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.570
respond differently to
different types of radiation.

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:03.230
There are no error bars.

00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:06.445
SARAH: No, not even
a whole mouse either.

00:30:06.445 --> 00:30:08.020
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in the mouse.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:11.040
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, oh to
trigger an immune response.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.317
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:12.317 --> 00:30:13.900
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
like-- there are--

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.072
there's other cells nearby.

00:30:15.072 --> 00:30:16.780
But they're like, oh,
you're not my cell.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:17.822
I'm going to [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:17.822 --> 00:30:19.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] mice.

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:19.953
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:30:19.953 --> 00:30:21.550
So that's-- that's
a valid point.

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:25.983
But, yeah, did it say
in the study how many?

00:30:25.983 --> 00:30:27.525
SARAH: Again, did
not read the study.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:28.233
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:31.132
Read the conclusion.

00:30:31.132 --> 00:30:33.590
MICHAEL SHORT: The data alone,
just taken it at face value,

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:36.470
make it look like hormesis is a
definite thing, Yeah, Kristin?

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:40.157
AUDIENCE: I'm saying if
there is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:40.157 --> 00:30:40.990
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.490
SARAH: True.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.920
Nine mice cell samples.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
go to the other study.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.830
SARAH: All right,
the-- the lung one?

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:48.700
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, it seems to be

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:49.992
more controlled and more legit.

00:30:49.992 --> 00:30:50.950
SARAH: Yeah.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.130
This one has error bars.

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:55.820
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, 1 has error
bars, 2, corrected for smoking.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.270
So let's see what
the caption says.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.840
Lung cancer fatality rates
compared with mean radon levels

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.410
in the US.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.720
SARAH: And for multiple
counties because it

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.260
talks about counties plural.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:11.760
So--

00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:18.270
MICHAEL SHORT: So
multiple counties

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:22.510
helped control for
single localities, or--

00:31:22.510 --> 00:31:25.930
AUDIENCE: So the 0 level
there is theoretical.

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.850
So the data that
you have down here,

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:32.050
like, we don't know what
actually happens [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:32.830
SARAH: Past what?

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:36.230
AUDIENCE: Like-- like below
1, the mean radon levels

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:39.140
because everyone is
exposed to radon.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.920
SARAH: Well, it says average
residential level of 1.7.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.560
So I think that means maybe
some people have less, maybe

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:45.640
some people have more.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.017
I don't know what the
minimum radon level is.

00:31:48.017 --> 00:31:49.600
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
not going to be 0.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.350
SARAH: It's not 0.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.910
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yeah, no one gets 0

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.410
unless you live in
a vacuum chamber.

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:55.452
SARAH: I don't know what
kind of scale that's on.

00:31:55.452 --> 00:31:56.430
AUDIENCE: Me too.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.010
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.510
Cool, yeah.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.220
So this-- this is
fairly convincing.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:02.120
If the point here
was to show there

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.838
is the theory of
linear no threshold,

00:32:03.838 --> 00:32:06.130
and here's what's an actual
data with error bars shows.

00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.930
It does a pretty
good job in saying,

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.020
the theory is not
right, in this case.

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.410
Can you say that in all cases?

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:13.330
It's hard to tell.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.750
In the first study you found
that was on the cellular level.

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.700
Maybe the multicellular level--

00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:21.940
multicellular level, certainly
not the organism level,

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.155
like we said, how many mice.

00:32:23.155 --> 00:32:24.280
This is just parts of mice.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:24.550
Just--

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:25.995
SARAH: It could
be the same mouse.

00:32:25.995 --> 00:32:27.370
MICHAEL SHORT:
Some cells-- yeah.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.300
This one is definitely
at the organism level.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:32.380
It's for-- for gross amounts
of exposure, how many of them

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:34.810
resulted in increased
incidence of lung cancer?

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:36.640
The answer is pretty much none.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:39.400
They all showed a
statistically-significant

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:43.053
decrease, which is
pretty interesting.

00:32:43.053 --> 00:32:43.720
So thanks a lot.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.220
Sarah.

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:45.037
And the whole team.

00:32:45.037 --> 00:32:47.120
Now one of you guys come
up and find [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.260
SARAH: Carrying the team.

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.925
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:50.925 --> 00:32:52.550
MICHAEL SHORT: So
who wants to come up?

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.140
Or does no one [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.590
SARAH: Let's throw down, right?

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.697
Fixing to scrap.

00:32:57.697 --> 00:32:59.530
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, you
can just pull it out.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:00.840
SARAH: OK, Are you sure?

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.673
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:33:01.673 --> 00:33:03.570
SARAH: OK.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:05.472
I don't want to break things.

00:33:05.472 --> 00:33:07.180
MICHAEL SHORT: No,
pulling it out's fine.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.220
If you jam it in, you
can bend the pins.

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.110
And that's happened here before.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:12.010
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:14.800
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, if you
want to take a minute to send

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.740
each other the links, go ahead.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.350
No, I like this,
though, is you can--

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.478
you can find a graph
that supports something.

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:34.770
And you can cite it in a paper.

00:33:34.770 --> 00:33:36.070
And you can get that
paper published.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.710
But looking more
carefully at the data

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:39.520
does sometimes call
things into question.

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.260
AUDIENCE: Just like [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:42.052
MICHAEL SHORT: Like,
I think you guys found

00:33:42.052 --> 00:33:44.160
a good example of
that mouse cell study

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:45.870
that looks like it
supports hormesis,

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:47.250
but you can't say so for sure.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.930
Make sure no one's
waiting for their room.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.920
No one's kicking us out.

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:19.560
AUDIENCE: Have we got a
paper that I found here

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.114
but we can't open up on there.

00:34:21.114 --> 00:34:22.239
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:24.035
Can you send me the link?

00:34:24.035 --> 00:34:24.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:24.970 --> 00:34:26.553
AUDIENCE: Wait, that
wasn't an option.

00:34:26.553 --> 00:34:27.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.382
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:34:28.382 --> 00:34:29.590
I mean, we can continue this.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:32.007
There's-- we're not-- since
we're not going to the reactor

00:34:32.007 --> 00:34:34.960
since that valve was
broken, let's keep it up.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.886
AUDIENCE: Hey,
[INAUDIBLE] workbook

00:34:36.886 --> 00:34:39.722
and [INAUDIBLE] put
it in the log book.

00:34:39.722 --> 00:34:40.889
AUDIENCE: That's your fault.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:41.764
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:41.764 --> 00:34:43.560
AUDIENCE: I wasn't
even [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.484
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:47.264 --> 00:34:48.686
Email us by name.

00:34:48.686 --> 00:34:50.108
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:51.311 --> 00:34:52.478
AUDIENCE: It's not over yet.

00:34:52.478 --> 00:34:53.426
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:54.137 --> 00:34:55.929
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
actually, I like this.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:57.210
This will be a good--

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:01.060
quite a good use of recitation.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.427
I'll keep my email
open in case folks want

00:35:03.427 --> 00:35:04.510
to send things to present.

00:35:06.865 --> 00:35:08.240
AUDIENCE: That's
the whole title.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.450
GUEST SPEAKER: So one--
one of the main problems

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.850
that we had with
the hormesis effect

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.940
was that all of the
studies that we've seen

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:24.720
seem to cover a large
scope of like tissues,

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.218
different effects, and
all sorts of things,

00:35:27.218 --> 00:35:28.760
like, yeah, there's
a lot of studies.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.760
There's a lot of trends.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.400
But, like, the
things in particular

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.275
that they're studying
are all over the place.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:38.935
And a lot of the--

00:35:38.935 --> 00:35:41.670
a lot of the research
done, like these studies

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:45.540
here, are not actually
meant to study hormesis.

00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.190
It's kind of like
recycled data that's

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:49.260
used from some other study.

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.680
And they're kind of like pulling
from multiple sources, which

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.080
increases the uncertainty.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.300
Then, additionally,
we have conflicting

00:35:57.300 --> 00:36:01.170
epidemiological
evidence of low dosages.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:03.810
So we're, in one instance,
you may see a reduction

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.430
in breast cancer mortality.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.915
You'll see excess thyroid cancer
in children, other, which is--

00:36:08.915 --> 00:36:11.290
MICHAEL SHORT: That's the same
study that was just shown,

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:14.393
the Cohen 1995
residential radon study.

00:36:14.393 --> 00:36:15.226
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:36:15.226 --> 00:36:16.674
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:17.757
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:18.257 --> 00:36:19.248
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:20.548 --> 00:36:21.840
GUEST SPEAKER: And so I think--

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:25.350
we're not-- I don't think we're
trying to disqualify hormesis

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.330
as, like, completely wrong.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:29.160
I think one of
the biggest issues

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.000
that we're taking with it
is that it's a small effect,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.032
if anything.

00:36:35.032 --> 00:36:36.990
It's something that we
really don't know about.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.170
It's hard to quantify.

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:42.000
And it's, at the end of the day,
really just not worth it, not

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.900
worth looking into because
of all of the variable--

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.680
variables that go into it.

00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:50.030
And the effects that, like,
we just don't know about.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.210
We don't understand it.

00:36:52.210 --> 00:36:53.790
So, yeah, fire away.

00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:54.580
MICHAEL SHORT: That's a a
great viewpoint, actually.

00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:55.700
Yeah, Monica?

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.440
OK, so it says support for
radiation hormesis [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.039
cell in animal studies, OK?

00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:09.838
And then it cites an example.

00:37:09.838 --> 00:37:12.280
Can you tell me how
that, like, you know,

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.180
supports what you're saying?

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.930
AUDIENCE: Can you just
highlight the part?

00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:17.938
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh,
right-- right up here.

00:37:17.938 --> 00:37:18.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:37:20.477 --> 00:37:22.310
GUEST SPEAKER: We haven't
seen it in humans.

00:37:25.256 --> 00:37:27.850
AUDIENCE: Well, often,
biological studies

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:31.880
are done on rats because they
have similar effects to humans.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.980
But it's a lifespan of, like,
1/10 a human's lifespan.

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:38.962
So, biologically,
that's accepted.

00:37:38.962 --> 00:37:40.420
GUEST SPEAKER:
Medicine also is not

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:44.155
accepted until it works
on humans, not on animals.

00:37:44.155 --> 00:37:45.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.830
GUEST SPEAKER: So we can
cure cancer in rats all day.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.780
But, like, if it doesn't
work in like the human body,

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.920
then it just--

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.250
we still don't use
it, like, it needs

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.280
to clear the hurdle
of human usefulness

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.380
before we actually use it.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:05.965
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's actually
look at this paragraph.

00:38:05.965 --> 00:38:08.810
They relate to carcinogensis
in different tissues

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.588
and the dose-response
relationships [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:12.588 --> 00:38:14.130
AUDIENCE: So there's
a line that says

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:15.880
the evidence for
hormesis in these studies

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.127
is not compelling since
the data may also be also

00:38:18.127 --> 00:38:21.100
be reasonably interpreted to
support no radiogenic effect

00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.060
in the low dose range.

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.610
Now, how would one interpret--
because you showed the Cohen

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.940
data.

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:33.490
So how would one interpret
that to mean no effect?

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.760
I'm trying now
determine in this--

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.237
are the claims of this paper
that you've been [INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:46.590
And this brings up,
actually, another point.

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:49.750
They do agree that there's been
hundreds of cell and animal

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:50.800
studies.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.870
They cite three human studies.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:54.460
So since we have
the time, you guys

00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:58.033
may want to look for more
than three human studies, done

00:38:58.033 --> 00:38:59.200
at the time of this writing.

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.420
It's not fair to take ones
that were done afterwards.

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:04.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.920
GUEST SPEAKER: What?

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:07.142
Let's find out.

00:39:07.142 --> 00:39:09.390
AUDIENCE: After 2000.

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.890
MICHAEL SHORT: It might say at
the bottom of the first page.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.932
AUDIENCE: Oh, wait, in
the-- in the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:13.932 --> 00:39:16.590
MICHAEL SHORT: 2000, yep.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:17.090
Yeah.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.870
So if you want to
refute that point,

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.910
you may want to find more
human studies pre 2000.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.880
It wouldn't be fair
to do otherwise.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:27.890
But, actually, I
liked what you said.

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:30.770
So what you're proposing--

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:36.087
if there's a mostly
blank board, is

00:39:36.087 --> 00:39:37.920
that most people should
adopt the model that

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.930
looks something like this.

00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:44.880
This is the axis of
how much bad or that 0.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:46.770
And this is dose in gray.

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:52.320
And whether your model does
this, or this, or this,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.600
it sounds to me like
you are defining a--

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.550
like you're defining
a kill zone.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:05.348
[INAUDIBLE] maybe the--

00:40:05.348 --> 00:40:06.140
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.930
MICHAEL SHORT: The point isn't
whether or not hormesis exists.

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:11.300
The effect may be so
small that who cares.

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.890
But the bigger discussion
is how much is that, not

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:16.820
is a little bit good.

00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.112
Is that what you're getting at?

00:40:18.112 --> 00:40:21.620
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, the like,
maybe it does look like this.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:25.880
But the dip is small,
really not that

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:29.695
different from the linear
threshold model, we noticed.

00:40:29.695 --> 00:40:31.070
MICHAEL SHORT:
Oh, so in addition

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:33.770
to being a basic
science question,

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.510
could the issue
of hormesis almost

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:40.507
be a sidetrack in getting
proper radiation policy through?

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:44.840
That's a point I hadn't
heard made before,

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.123
but I quite like it.

00:40:46.123 --> 00:40:47.540
Because it's not
like you're going

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:50.300
to recommend everyone smokes
three cigarettes a day

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:52.527
or, you know,
everyone gets blasted

00:40:52.527 --> 00:40:55.110
by little bit of radiation once
a year as part of a treatment.

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.725
I don't think anyone
would buy that.

00:40:56.725 --> 00:40:59.225
Even if it did help, I don't
think anybody would emotionally

00:40:59.225 --> 00:41:01.790
buy that.

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:02.710
But by focusing on--

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.460
you know, that-- there's
a nice expression

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.160
is the most important thing is
make the most important thing

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.270
the most important thing.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:14.060
It means don't lose sight
of the overall goal, which

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.490
is if you're making policy
on how much radiation

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:18.620
exposure you're
allowed, do you focus

00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:20.420
on saying, a little
bit is actually good,

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:23.480
or do you focus on saying,
here's the amount that's bad?

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.820
And anything below
that, we shouldn't

00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:29.540
be regulating or overregulating
because there's no evidence

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:34.640
to say whether it's good or
bad outside the kill zone.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.180
I quite like that
point, actually.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:41.000
It means that the
supporters of radiation

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.700
should chill out as well.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.947
Cool, all right, so any other
studies you want to point out?

00:41:46.947 --> 00:41:48.780
GUEST SPEAKER: We had
a couple of abstracts.

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:49.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, let's see.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:50.597
GUEST SPEAKER: But I don't--

00:41:50.597 --> 00:41:52.190
I'm not sure.

00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:53.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.556
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:41:57.556 --> 00:42:04.040
AUDIENCE: Some of the other ones
don't compare hormetic models.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.240
But they look at--

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.202
they say [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:08.202 --> 00:42:09.030
It's like--

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:09.770
GUEST SPEAKER: Do
you want to come up?

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:11.562
AUDIENCE: Yeah, this
one says [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:11.562 --> 00:42:12.603
GUEST SPEAKER: All right.

00:42:12.603 --> 00:42:13.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:17.920
AUDIENCE: It basically
compares threshold models

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:23.962
with no-threshold
models in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:23.962 --> 00:42:25.435
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.373
So perhaps hormetic is
still better for you,

00:42:33.373 --> 00:42:39.289
but they-- the [INAUDIBLE] was
good enough with [INAUDIBLE]..

00:42:41.988 --> 00:42:43.905
MICHAEL SHORT: So what
they're saying is the--

00:42:43.905 --> 00:42:45.960
the choice of model
really doesn't

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.690
matter, as long as it
fits through the data

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.400
that we've got.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:53.070
And it seems to be, again, what
happens in the low-dose regime

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.630
is less important, right?

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.630
AUDIENCE: And it will--
they were satisfied when

00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:59.654
it fell from the [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:04.230
MICHAEL SHORT: So they're saying
the best estimate of this--

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:08.320
interesting.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.600
AUDIENCE: They prefer no
threshold [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.767
MICHAEL SHORT: That's funny.

00:43:11.767 --> 00:43:14.260
"If a risk model with
a threshold is assumed,

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.780
the best estimate
is below 0 sieverts.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:22.290
But then how is their
confidence interval from--

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.990
oh, less than 0 to 0.13.

00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:26.630
They don't quantify
how much lower

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:30.585
it goes because a negative
dose doesn't make sense.

00:43:30.585 --> 00:43:31.085
No.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.750
So, yeah, it's a
strong conclusion.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:44.090
But it looks-- looks
fairly well supported

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.780
to say that we can't say with
those confidence intervals

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:52.470
that they give if there
is or isn't a threshold.

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:53.070
Interesting.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.362
What do you guys think of this?

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.910
So what would you
delve into the study

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.865
to try to agree with
or refute this claim?

00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:21.610
AUDIENCE: They use a linear
quadratic model only,

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.222
it looks like.

00:44:24.222 --> 00:44:26.510
So they're not considering
any of the other proposed

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:27.710
models, which is a little--

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.150
maybe not sketchy,
but it just seems

00:44:34.150 --> 00:44:36.560
like it'd be very easy
to consider other models

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.290
and why didn't they do that.

00:44:38.290 --> 00:44:40.000
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.570
You know, what no study
has gotten into yet is,

00:44:43.570 --> 00:44:47.260
what's the mechanism of, let's
say, ill effect acceleration.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.500
This is something that, at
least at the grad school level,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.460
we try to hammer to
everyone constantly

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.710
is not just what's the data,
but what's the mechanism.

00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:59.330
What's the reason for an
acceleration of ill effects?

00:44:59.330 --> 00:45:02.470
So if you guys had to think with
increasing radiation exposure,

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:05.920
let's say we wanted this linear
quadratic model idea, what

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.300
could be some reasons or
mechanisms for an increased

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:13.966
amount of risk per unit dose
as the dose gets higher?

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.060
Yeah?

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.140
AUDIENCE: Well, your
body [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.120
But then-- so at some--
you get more dose--

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.756
you get more dosing [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:27.235
It just keep fixing itself.

00:45:27.235 --> 00:45:28.878
And once you get
past a certain point,

00:45:28.878 --> 00:45:32.165
then it can't [? fix itself ?]
[? fast enough. ?] The

00:45:32.165 --> 00:45:37.588
additional damage keeps
snowballing events.

00:45:37.588 --> 00:45:39.560
And they're giving
it more damage

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.504
to curb more radiation
because you would run out of--

00:45:43.504 --> 00:45:45.772
of various [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:45.772 --> 00:45:46.605
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:45:46.605 --> 00:45:48.220
Works for me.

00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:50.320
Yeah, I like that--
the idea there

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.630
was that you've got
some capacity to deal

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.700
with damage from radiation.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:58.220
And then once you exceed that
capacity, you don't also--

00:45:58.220 --> 00:45:59.980
with a higher dose,
you don't also

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:02.680
ramp up your capacity
to deal with that dose.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.240
So in the linear
region, let's say,

00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:08.170
you're somewhat absorbing the
additional ill effects of dose

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:11.380
by capacity to repair
DNA or repair cells.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:13.390
Then once you exceed
that threshold,

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.310
you're beyond that point.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:18.190
So that could be a
plausible mechanism

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:21.250
for why there could be a linear
quadratic model that could

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:25.420
be tested, certainly with single
cell or multi cell studies,

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.800
like these-- these radiation
microbeams or, you know,

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:30.550
injecting something
that would be absorbed

00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:32.302
by one cell
[INAUDIBLE] irradiated,

00:46:32.302 --> 00:46:33.760
and seeing what
the ones nearby do.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.740
So you could count
that as number

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:38.230
of mutations, number
of cell deaths,

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.110
anything, something that could
be quantitatively tested.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:42.620
So that's pretty cool.

00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.770
I actually quite
like this study.

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.560
It's awfully hard
to poke a hole in--

00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.690
in the logic used here.

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:51.260
The claims aren't outrageous.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:53.260
They're saying, this is
what the data is saying.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.850
If you change the model, you
can or not have a threshold

00:46:57.850 --> 00:46:59.430
and still get an acceptable fit.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:04.070
Can we actually look
in the study itself?

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:07.050
One thing I want to
know is, what sort of--

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:09.370
do they do meta
analysis, or did they--

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.820
yeah, so this was on the
Japanese atomic bomb survivors.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.620
So did they analyze
previous data,

00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.870
or did they get their own.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:18.936
And then if so, what
was the sample size?

00:47:27.368 --> 00:47:31.336
Somewhere it'll be,
like, yeah, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.400
So where [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:47.945 --> 00:47:49.070
GUEST SPEAKER: Where am I--

00:47:49.070 --> 00:47:51.390
where should I be
looking for this--

00:47:51.390 --> 00:47:52.890
MICHAEL SHORT:
Probably further down

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.790
in any sort of
methodology section--

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:58.280
materials and
methods, here we go.

00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:03.170
OK, here it is, 86,500
something survivors.

00:48:03.170 --> 00:48:06.659
Oh, yes, with lots of follow up.

00:48:06.659 --> 00:48:08.867
AUDIENCE: But how are you
able to determine the dose?

00:48:08.867 --> 00:48:09.655
Like--

00:48:09.655 --> 00:48:11.280
MICHAEL SHORT: That
is a good question.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:12.697
AUDIENCE: Because
especially for--

00:48:12.697 --> 00:48:15.900
if we're looking like low
dose, and you're estimating,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:20.222
it's very easy to, like,
estimate wrong, or, like,

00:48:20.222 --> 00:48:22.430
because then-- then it calls
into question you have--

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:24.080
[INAUDIBLE] modeling
they're using.

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:24.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Mhm.

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.430
So that's a great
question is, how

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:28.830
do they know what
those people die?

00:48:28.830 --> 00:48:33.780
So how would we go about
trying to trace that?

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:35.670
This is when you
dig back in time.

00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:37.728
They reference this,
the data appears et al,

00:48:37.728 --> 00:48:38.520
whatever, whatever.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:40.480
So if you can go
to Web of Science,

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.920
pull up this Pierce
et al Web paper.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:46.120
Look at cited references.

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.770
Yeah, right there.

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.830
And look for that
1996 Pierce study.

00:48:50.830 --> 00:48:52.180
Let's see if it has it.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:58.566
You can just like control F
for Pierce, and we'll find it.

00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.650
Pierce and [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:05.208
Yeah, 1996, that's the one.

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:06.083
GUEST SPEAKER: Where?

00:49:06.083 --> 00:49:07.070
Which one?

00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.092
This one?

00:49:08.092 --> 00:49:09.390
MICHAEL SHORT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:09.390 --> 00:49:10.500
This is the 1996 one.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.240
Yep.

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.600
So let's see if we
can trace this back

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:19.512
and find out how they estimated
the dose of these folks.

00:49:19.512 --> 00:49:21.220
GUEST SPEAKER: So I
just go to full text?

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:22.053
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:49:29.635 --> 00:49:31.120
AUDIENCE: How [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:43.735 --> 00:49:44.485
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.780
So interesting, this LLS cohort.

00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:59.370
So there was some
life span study,

00:49:59.370 --> 00:50:01.703
which was also referred to
actually in the lecture notes

00:50:01.703 --> 00:50:05.380
as one of the original
studies, says,

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:10.025
who met certain conditions
concerning adequate follow up.

00:50:10.025 --> 00:50:11.150
Although estimates of the--

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:12.700
OK, I want to see the next page.

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.075
Although we
estimate-- that might

00:50:14.075 --> 00:50:15.424
be what we're looking for.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.520
Number of survivors, let's see.

00:50:24.975 --> 00:50:27.450
AUDIENCE: It's 92%.

00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.870
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, here we
go, materials and methods.

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.810
The portion of the
LSS cohort used here

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.210
includes the same
number of survivors

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:38.340
for whom dose estimates
are currently available,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:46.005
et cetera, with estimated doses
greater than 5 millisieverts is

00:50:46.005 --> 00:50:47.660
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.370
Table 1 summarizes the
exposure distribution.

00:50:50.370 --> 00:50:54.672
So let's go find table 1 and
see where the data came from.

00:50:58.109 --> 00:50:59.091
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:04.030
MICHAEL SHORT: So it turns out
that this is specifically--

00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:08.884
DS-86 weighted colon
dose in sieverts.

00:51:08.884 --> 00:51:09.384
Interesting.

00:51:09.384 --> 00:51:13.296
AUDIENCE: It [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:13.296 --> 00:51:16.903
So how did they get that?

00:51:16.903 --> 00:51:18.070
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't know.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:22.700
But it sounds like we need to
find this LSS, this Just LSS.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.180
So let's look at the things
that this paper cites.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.095
Find this LSS.

00:51:31.095 --> 00:51:33.720
So I'm walking-- what I'm doing
here is walking you through how

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.520
to do your own research.

00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.460
And if someone comes to you
with some internet emotional

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:41.970
argument of, this and that
about radiation is wrong,

00:51:41.970 --> 00:51:43.560
instead of yelling
back louder, which

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.480
means you lost the
argument, you hit the books.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.604
And this is how you
do the research.

00:51:48.604 --> 00:51:52.420
AUDIENCE: LSS-85, does that
mean it was [INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:54.750
MICHAEL SHORT: Probably.

00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:57.040
Version of-- title
not available.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:51:58.136
I hope it's not that one.

00:52:00.372 --> 00:52:01.330
Can you search for LSS?

00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.947
Nothing?

00:52:06.947 --> 00:52:08.530
So let's go back to
the paper and find

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.450
what citation that was.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.160
If you go up a little bit, I
think there was like a sup--

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.790
a superscript up to the
last page, I'm sorry.

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:20.286
There was a superscript
on LSS stuff.

00:52:33.182 --> 00:52:34.670
AUDIENCE: So general
documentation

00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:37.898
of the selection of LSS
cohorts [INAUDIBLE]..

00:52:37.898 --> 00:52:38.940
MICHAEL SHORT: Thank you.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:43.400
All right, let's find
references 9 and 10 in the--

00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:44.150
yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:46.233
AUDIENCE: Can you click
one of the References tab?

00:52:46.233 --> 00:52:48.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah,
up there, References.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:53.010
Awesome!

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:54.440
9 and 10, OK.

00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:00.102
Let's find them.

00:53:00.102 --> 00:53:01.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:02.375 --> 00:53:03.750
MICHAEL SHORT: So
let me show you

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:05.640
quickly how to
use Web of Science

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.974
to get what you're looking
for if I could jump on?

00:53:07.974 --> 00:53:10.460
GUEST SPEAKER:
[INAUDIBLE] up here?

00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.720
MICHAEL SHORT: You
don't have to, yeah.

00:53:12.720 --> 00:53:16.290
But thank you for being up here
for so long and running this.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:17.580
So we're looking for--

00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:25.730
where was-- the
article was here.

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:30.170
Went into references.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:33.700
I guess that was like the last--

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.200
I don't want to
close all your tabs.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:35.700
Here we go.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:40.150
So GW, is that
Beebe and Usagawa.

00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:43.930
So we'll go to Web of
Science, look for authors,

00:53:43.930 --> 00:53:47.188
any paper with those authors.

00:53:47.188 --> 00:53:48.730
So you can do a more
advanced search.

00:53:48.730 --> 00:53:52.690
This is where things get really
interesting and specific.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:53.850
So ditch the topic.

00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:05.530
Search by Beebe and
add a field, Usagawa.

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:07.360
And then anything
with these two folks

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:10.300
in the author field that is
indexed by Web of Science

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:10.890
will pop up.

00:54:13.848 --> 00:54:14.348
Nothing.

00:54:19.745 --> 00:54:21.060
Did I spell anything wrong?

00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:23.330
Usagawa, of course.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.410
That's unfortunate.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:39.630
Last thing to try
is Add Wild Cards.

00:54:51.362 --> 00:54:52.294
Interesting.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:57.310
This is actually one place
where I would use Google

00:54:57.310 --> 00:55:00.010
to find a specific report.

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.530
So because you're not looking
to survey a field that's

00:55:02.530 --> 00:55:04.840
out there, but you're
looking for any document

00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.625
that you can confirm
is that document.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:13.970
Let's head there.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:16.858
Oh, it looks like
Stanford's got it.

00:55:26.618 --> 00:55:28.420
That's something
that references it.

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:30.750
So at this point,
we've hit the maximum

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.508
that we can do on the computer.

00:55:32.508 --> 00:55:34.050
But if you finally
want to trace back

00:55:34.050 --> 00:55:38.670
to see how were the
Hiroshima data acquired,

00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:41.880
take these citations,
bring it to one of the MIT

00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:45.000
librarians like Christ Sherratt
is our nuclear librarian.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.458
AUDIENCE: He's a
nuclear librarian?

00:55:46.458 --> 00:55:49.110
MICHAEL SHORT: And we have
a nuclear librarian, yeah.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:50.563
MIT libraries is pretty awesome.

00:55:50.563 --> 00:55:52.230
So when you're looking
for anything here

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.680
in terms of research
or whatever,

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.280
there's actually
someone whose job

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.860
it is to help you find
nuclear documents.

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.668
And chances are, this
is a pretty big one.

00:56:00.668 --> 00:56:02.210
So I wouldn't be
surprised if we have

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:03.990
a physical or electronic copy.

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:06.360
So we're now like one
degree of separation

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:08.850
away from finding the
original Hiroshima

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:13.400
data, where we can find out how
did they estimate that dose.

00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:14.630
So I think this is fairly--

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:16.172
hopefully, this is
fairly instructive

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.950
to show you how do you go about
getting the facts to prove

00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:22.250
or disprove something, knowing
the-- not just the physics

00:56:22.250 --> 00:56:25.040
that you know, but how to
go out and find that stuff.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.010
Now, I did see a
bunch of sources

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:31.360
from the pro hormesis team.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:33.190
You still want me to show them?

00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:34.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:36.180
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:48.760
Thanks.

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:51.940
All right, you just want to
hold this up while your--

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:54.580
let's go to your sources.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:55.347
OK, here we go.

00:56:55.347 --> 00:56:56.180
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.848
MICHAEL SHORT: So walk us
through what you found.

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.640
GUEST SPEAKER: I just
need to open them up.

00:57:07.602 --> 00:57:09.060
AUDIENCE: Go through
them all, or--

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.410
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
let's do them all.

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:13.036
GUEST SPEAKER:
There's not too much.

00:57:13.036 --> 00:57:20.080
Kind of-- OK, so,
I unfortunately

00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.680
was not able to find like too
many pretty graphs, or data,

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:25.330
or anything of the sort.

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:28.240
But if you look up, what
did I search for this?

00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.510
I think I just looked
up radiation hormesis.

00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:34.200
And this is one of the
articles that turned up.

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.190
And it seems to be
pretty well cited.

00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:39.720
You can see it's
been cited 184 times.

00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:42.760
And kind of the quick look
through the citations,

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:45.880
from what I saw, seemed
to be in support of it.

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:54.902
And if you actually look at the
abstract itself, where is it?

00:57:54.902 --> 00:57:56.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:56.385 --> 00:57:58.260
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah,
well-- the last sentence

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.620
is pretty excellent.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.380
"This is consistent with
data both from animal studies

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.720
and human epidemiological
observations

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:08.640
on low-dose induced cancer.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:10.590
The linear
no-threshold hypothesis

00:58:10.590 --> 00:58:13.320
should be abandoned and
should-- and be replaced

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.600
by a hypothesis that is
scientifically justified

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.700
and causes less
unreasonable fear

00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:20.332
and unnecessary expenditure."

00:58:20.332 --> 00:58:21.540
MICHAEL SHORT: You know what?

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.600
I want to see what are the human
epidemiological observations

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:26.380
that they cite.

00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:28.710
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, so
unfortunately, the MIT

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:31.080
libraries does not
have an electronic copy

00:58:31.080 --> 00:58:31.800
of this article.

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.080
And I wasn't able to find one.

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.915
But going through some
of the citations for it--

00:58:37.915 --> 00:58:39.540
MICHAEL SHORT: Before
you do, could you

00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.530
go back to the article?

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:41.190
GUEST SPEAKER: Sure.

00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:42.270
MICHAEL SHORT: I want
to point something out.

00:58:42.270 --> 00:58:43.770
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes.

00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:46.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Can you tell
if this was peer reviewed?

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:48.735
GUEST SPEAKER: I do not
know how to do that.

00:58:48.735 --> 00:58:50.610
MICHAEL SHORT: It appears
to be a conference.

00:58:51.155 --> 00:58:51.360
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.060
MICHAEL SHORT: Not all
conferences require peer review

00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:55.680
in order to present the papers.

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:58.320
So while conference
proceedings will typically

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:02.040
be published as a record of
what happened at the conference,

00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.250
we don't know if this one
was peer reviewed and checked

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.292
for facts by an
independent party.

00:59:07.292 --> 00:59:09.292
Could you go up a little
bit, and maybe there'll

00:59:09.292 --> 00:59:11.530
be some information on that?

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.570
Oh, it did go in the British
Journal of Radiology.

00:59:17.570 --> 00:59:18.580
OK, that's a good sign.

00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:21.970
So conference proceedings,
you don't know.

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:24.880
But in order to publish
something in a journal,

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.130
you do because then in
order to get in the journal,

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:29.320
things have to be peer reviewed
to meet the journal standards,

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:31.815
regardless of whether they
came from a conference or just

00:59:31.815 --> 00:59:32.690
a regular submission.

00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:34.640
So, OK, that's good to see.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.020
So, now, what else you got?

00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.020
GUEST SPEAKER: And then
one of the key sentences

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:43.330
that I found right here,
adaptive protection

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:48.730
causes DNA damage prevention,
and repair, and immune system

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:50.350
or immune stimulation.

00:59:50.350 --> 00:59:52.240
It develops with
a delay of hours,

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:55.240
may last for days to
months, decreases steadily

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.720
at doses above about
100 milligray to 200

00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.580
milligray and is
not observed anymore

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.110
after acute exposures of more
than about 500 milligray.

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:06.880
That's all pretty interesting.

01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.330
Like I said, unfortunately, I
couldn't find the actual paper.

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:12.640
So you can't really delve
into some of those claims.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:16.930
But I tried to look at
some of the citations that

01:00:16.930 --> 01:00:17.710
delved into them.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:20.950
And this is where my
presentation gets a little bit

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:23.410
shakier because I'm
not particularly

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:27.430
good at parsing some of this
complex stuff very quickly.

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:28.930
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
do it together.

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:29.972
GUEST SPEAKER: All right.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:35.453
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:35.453 --> 01:00:37.620
MICHAEL SHORT: If you could
click Download Full Text

01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.106
in PDF, it'll just be bigger.

01:00:39.106 --> 01:00:39.856
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:43.800
MICHAEL SHORT: There we go.

01:00:47.155 --> 01:00:48.530
GUEST SPEAKER: So
it seemed to me

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:51.860
this one was more looking
through the statistics

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.730
of various studies.

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:55.700
I'm not entirely sure.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.495
But I think the conclusion--

01:00:59.495 --> 01:01:00.461
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:08.680
There we go.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.340
So the very last paragraph,
"the present practice

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:14.280
assumes linearity in assessing
risk from even the lowest dose

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.623
exposure of complex tissue
to ionizing radiation.

01:01:17.623 --> 01:01:19.290
By applying this type
of risk assessment

01:01:19.290 --> 01:01:21.330
to radiation protection
of exposed workers

01:01:21.330 --> 01:01:24.900
and the public alike, society
may gain a questionable benefit

01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:27.030
at unavoidably substantial cost.

01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:28.710
Research on the p
values given above

01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:30.690
may eventually
reveal the true risk,

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:33.960
which appears to be inaccessible
by epidemiological studies

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.260
alone.

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:36.802
MICHAEL SHORT: So
what are they going

01:01:36.802 --> 01:01:39.930
on claiming [INAUDIBLE] versus
not being willing to claim it?

01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:41.555
GUEST SPEAKER: So it
seems like they're

01:01:41.555 --> 01:01:45.230
saying that at the current,
there's not really a problem--

01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:48.750
a statistically
valid assertion of

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:51.540
the linear no-threshold
model and that the benefits

01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:55.770
to society gained from that are
not worth the cost to society

01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:56.760
from that assumption.

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.260
MICHAEL SHORT: So
what sort of costs

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:00.960
do you think society
incurs by adapting

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:04.390
a linear no-threshold
dose risk model?

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:06.890
GUEST SPEAKER: I mean, it could
pose unnecessary regulations

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:08.307
on like nuclear
power, which could

01:02:08.307 --> 01:02:10.460
be arguably better for society.

01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

01:02:11.330 --> 01:02:14.650
Nuclear power plants
emit radiation, fact,

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:17.870
to use the old cell
phone methodology.

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.870
There's always going to be some
very small amount of tritium

01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:21.800
released.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.600
The question is, does it matter?

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:27.290
And if legislation is made
to say absolutely no tritium

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.790
release is allowed,
well, you're not

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.740
going be allowed to
run a nuclear plant.

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.410
That's not the question
we should be asking.

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:36.390
The question we should be
asking is, how much is harmful?

01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:38.640
So I think that's what this
study is really getting at

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.300
is I'm glad to see someone
say, you may have a benefit.

01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:45.000
But the cost is not
worth the benefit.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.460
Like I-- I had a multiple
of the same arguments

01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:51.890
with different people when
they were complaining, well,

01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:56.120
how dare would you expose me
to any amount of radiation

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.620
at any risk that
I can't control.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:02:59.560
I used to protest
outside Draper Labs

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.450
for 30 years protesting
nuclear power.

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:03.963
I was like, OK, how
did you get there?

01:03:03.963 --> 01:03:05.960
They were like, oh, I drove.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.070
What?

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.350
In a car?

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.140
Do you even know the risks per
mile of getting on the road,

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.610
let alone in Cambridge
specifically?

01:03:14.610 --> 01:03:16.280
No?

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:18.950
Well, I was like, you
should really consider

01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:21.410
where you put your effort?

01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:25.257
It's-- again, it's
emotions versus numbers.

01:03:25.257 --> 01:03:26.840
I'm going to go with
numbers because I

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:30.950
tend to make bad decisions
when I follow my emotions,

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.710
as do most people because
most decisions are

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:36.630
more complex than fight
or flight nowadays.

01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:37.130
Yeah?

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:38.630
AUDIENCE: So a lot
of the discussion

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:43.795
just seems to be around
like expanding [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:43.795 --> 01:03:45.370
But a lot of the
arguments don't seem

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:50.363
to like really [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:58.720
But, yeah, like there's
a certain extent,

01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.160
like, oh, you will
see [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:11.080
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.527
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
are doing the same.

01:04:13.527 --> 01:04:15.110
MICHAEL SHORT: You
make a great point.

01:04:15.110 --> 01:04:18.090
That's why I like your--
your chosen idea so much

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:19.830
is, well, you didn't say chosen.

01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:21.993
That's what I-- yeah.

01:04:21.993 --> 01:04:23.910
Yeah, the question we
should be asking ourself

01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:27.060
is not what is the dose-risk
relationship, but when should

01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:28.238
we actually care.

01:04:28.238 --> 01:04:30.030
It's like both sets of
studies have kind of

01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:34.025
come to the conclusion
that, nah, right?

01:04:34.025 --> 01:04:36.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] dose
doesn't really matter.

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.580
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah, and
then I found this last one

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:40.050
is a little bit more assertive.

01:04:40.050 --> 01:04:43.560
It's kind of just
hitting the same nail

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.740
on kind of the elimination of
the linear no-threshold model.

01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:53.430
But then it does go on to make
some more powerful claim right

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:54.390
here.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.520
"These data are examined
within the context

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.400
of low-dose radiation
induction of cellular signaling

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:01.740
that may stimulate
cellular protection

01:05:01.740 --> 01:05:04.230
systems over hours to
weeks against accumulation

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:05.905
of DNA damage."

01:05:05.905 --> 01:05:07.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Was
this the paper cited

01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.953
in the other one that
actually said hours two weeks?

01:05:09.953 --> 01:05:11.370
GUEST SPEAKER: I
believe so, yeah.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:12.370
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, cool.

01:05:12.370 --> 01:05:14.341
GUEST SPEAKER: And
then we can actually--

01:05:14.341 --> 01:05:15.390
MICHAEL SHORT:
[INAUDIBLE] this one?

01:05:15.390 --> 01:05:16.182
GUEST SPEAKER: Yes.

01:05:16.182 --> 01:05:20.048
We can look up the full
text on Google Scholar.

01:05:20.048 --> 01:05:21.090
MICHAEL SHORT: That's OK.

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:23.465
When you know what you're
looking for, you can verify it.

01:05:23.465 --> 01:05:26.970
That's-- that's a useful thing
for Google is like to find

01:05:26.970 --> 01:05:28.000
known content.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:32.260
But if you're trying to
survey a field in Google, no.

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.242
GUEST SPEAKER: That's
not what I wanted.

01:05:34.242 --> 01:05:35.200
MICHAEL SHORT: Not yet.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.255
I'm sure-- I'm sure
they're working on it.

01:05:37.255 --> 01:05:38.713
But they're not
Web of Science yet.

01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:44.629
GUEST SPEAKER: All right.

01:05:44.629 --> 01:05:45.615
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:52.020
GUEST SPEAKER: Does anybody see
a Get The Full Paper button?

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.300
Oh, wait, right here, right?

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:54.620
That's it.

01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.920
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.700
Sign in?

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.760
MICHAEL SHORT: Sounds like
we don't subscribe to this.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.100
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, I was
able to get to it somehow.

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:03.065
Well, yeah.

01:06:03.065 --> 01:06:05.690
AUDIENCE: I have another article
supporting this claim, though.

01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:06.420
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:07.628
GUEST SPEAKER: But this one--

01:06:07.628 --> 01:06:09.880
AUDIENCE: Submit it, or
bring yours up, or whatever.

01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:11.297
GUEST SPEAKER: And
then this one--

01:06:11.297 --> 01:06:12.690
this one just had
some nice data.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.148
If I'm going to
summarize, it had--

01:06:14.148 --> 01:06:18.690
it was looking at the amount
of DNA damage instances

01:06:18.690 --> 01:06:23.850
compared normal background dose
to like very, very low dose.

01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:26.340
And the very, very low
dose was significantly less

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.380
than the normal background dose.

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.880
So that just kind
of shows that like

01:06:29.880 --> 01:06:33.660
very low levels of radiation are
like no worse for you than just

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.580
background dose,
which is interesting.

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:36.413
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:37.300
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.967
MICHAEL SHORT: I also
want to make sure,

01:06:38.967 --> 01:06:41.955
do you guys have more
articles you want to show?

01:06:41.955 --> 01:06:42.909
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:45.737 --> 01:06:47.570
MICHAEL SHORT: If you
want to send it to me,

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.432
I'll put it up here.

01:06:49.432 --> 01:06:51.890
GUEST SPEAKER: All right, I
minimized because I didn't just

01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:52.970
want to leave your email.

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:53.420
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, I don't care.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:54.140
There's nothing--

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:54.890
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:56.432
MICHAEL SHORT: I'll
bring it back up.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.550
So that's all the ones you sent?

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.256
Cool.

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:09.880
Actually, this one-- this
debate is turning out

01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.880
a whole lot more interesting
than previously because,

01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:14.290
well, because you're thinking.

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:16.070
It's actually really
nice to see this.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:17.435
And this is the--

01:07:17.435 --> 01:07:18.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.685
MICHAEL SHORT:
I'm not surprised.

01:07:19.685 --> 01:07:20.620
Don't worry.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.140
It's just pleasant to have
a debate about something

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:25.480
controversial with a
whole group of people

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.390
who are thinking and
researching rather than shouting

01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:30.116
and like throwing plates.

01:07:30.116 --> 01:07:31.388
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:31.388 --> 01:07:33.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, no, if
you want throw a chair,

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:34.645
but I might throw one back.

01:07:34.645 --> 01:07:35.635
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.920
MICHAEL SHORT: I wonder if
anyone's gone out recently

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:02.100
and has come up with all of the
pro and anti hormesis studies

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.380
and actually written
a paper that says,

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.870
that's not the point,
because, really, what we're

01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:07.770
getting-- huh?

01:08:07.770 --> 01:08:08.490
AUDIENCE: You could write that.

01:08:08.490 --> 01:08:10.907
MICHAEL SHORT: No, I think you
could write that paper now.

01:08:10.907 --> 01:08:13.173
AUDIENCE: Well, oh.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:15.840
MICHAEL SHORT: It would make for
a pretty cool undergrad thesis,

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.189
actually.

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:18.335
Yeah?

01:08:18.335 --> 01:08:19.710
Maybe I can tell
you a little bit

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.335
about what an undergrad
thesis actually

01:08:21.335 --> 01:08:23.220
entails because the
seniors are all asking.

01:08:23.220 --> 01:08:25.800
But it's good for you
to know ahead of time.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.319
So the main requirement
for an undergrad thesis

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.112
is it's got to be your work.

01:08:30.112 --> 01:08:31.529
That doesn't mean
you have to have

01:08:31.529 --> 01:08:35.080
collected the data yourself,
like done an experiment.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.590
But it has to be some
original thought, or idea,

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:39.870
or accumulation of yours.

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:43.920
So trying to settle this debate
and trying to figure out what

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.529
would be a proposed
chill region to say,

01:08:46.529 --> 01:08:48.660
forget the linear
threshold or no threshold.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:50.220
That's for the basic scientists.

01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.310
If you are a government and
want to legislate something that

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:56.460
actually captures should
people be afraid or not,

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.149
defining that region would
be a pretty cool study to do

01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:03.029
in the meta-analysis of
lots of other studies,

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:05.279
tracing back how worthy--

01:09:05.279 --> 01:09:08.279
I mean, a lot of people
refer to the Hiroshima data

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.680
set because that's about
the biggest one we have.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.350
In addition to folks with
radon or folks that smoke,

01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:15.990
they were all exposed
to the same thing

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:17.410
in the relatively same area.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:21.120
So it's a good control
group of people.

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.899
But how was-- how were
those doses estimated?

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:24.899
You have to dig that up.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.600
And the act of digging
that up and then recasting

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.250
all of these new studies
in the basis of everything

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.250
we've learned since would
make for a pretty cool

01:09:32.250 --> 01:09:34.240
undergrad thesis topic.

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.612
So as undergrad chair, I
wouldn't say no to that.

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:47.370
Threshold and other departures
from linear quadratic curvature

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.830
in the same data
set appears to--

01:09:49.830 --> 01:09:53.189
is it the LSS data set?

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:54.490
Let's try to get the full text.

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:00.820
Awesome!

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:02.500
I think it's looking good.

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:07.220
Great!

01:10:12.748 --> 01:10:14.040
Now I've seen that name before.

01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:18.400
Interesting.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:37.105 --> 01:10:38.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

01:10:38.230 --> 01:10:39.700
They propose
another model called

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:42.290
a power of dose, a power law.

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:44.835
And they say,
depending on this--

01:10:44.835 --> 01:10:46.210
there's little
evidence that it's

01:10:46.210 --> 01:10:49.180
statistically different
from one which

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:55.000
is a what do they call
one linear threshold

01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:00.190
quadratic threshold or linear
quadratic threshold, OK?

01:11:00.190 --> 01:11:03.350
So, again, it seems to be
yet another paper saying,

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:04.780
I don't think it matters.

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:07.000
Statistics says
it doesn't matter.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.156
You could fit any
model to this data.

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:20.110
Let's get to the methods.

01:11:20.110 --> 01:11:21.589
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:30.500
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.930
So dose response for
all non-cancer mortality

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:45.090
in the atomic bomb survivors.

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:48.020
So, also, in this case,
it's mortalities not

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:51.520
caused by cancer.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.430
AUDIENCE: Like, caused
by radiation disease?

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:56.860
Or is that caused
by [INAUDIBLE]??

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.250
MICHAEL SHORT: So
this would be--

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:03.750
I think what they're getting
at is is there a response,

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:06.060
or is there a change in
the amount of mortality

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:08.980
not due to cancer and the--

01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:09.930
the--

01:12:09.930 --> 01:12:12.780
AUDIENCE: Health benefits other
than decreasing risk of cancer.

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.515
MICHAEL SHORT: Or in this
case, health detriments, right?

01:12:15.515 --> 01:12:17.640
Because in this-- you know,
it never goes negative.

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.470
You can't really
tell in some cases.

01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.970
Let's see.

01:12:30.998 --> 01:12:33.040
Yeah, quite hard to tell,
especially considering.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:36.160
And so at the low doses,
what would you guys

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.000
say for the low dose data?

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.250
AUDIENCE: That doesn't matter.

01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:41.458
MICHAEL SHORT: I see a pretty
well-defined chill zone

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.860
right there, right?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.998
AUDIENCE: Chill zone?

01:12:44.998 --> 01:12:46.540
MICHAEL SHORT: We're
definitely still

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:49.360
in the chill zone at 0.4
sieverts of colon dose.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:51.967
And that's a pretty
hefty amount of dose.

01:12:51.967 --> 01:12:54.550
You know, we're talking eight
or nine times the allowed amount

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:57.490
that you're able to get in a
year from occupational safety

01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:58.690
limits.

01:12:58.690 --> 01:13:00.100
Once the doses
get higher, things

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.750
seem to get a little more
deterministic or statistically

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:07.030
significant.

01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:09.430
But, yeah, look at all
the different models.

01:13:09.430 --> 01:13:12.040
The linear threshold,
quadratic threshold,

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.770
linear quadratic
threshold, power of dose

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:17.860
all goes straight through not
just like in the error bars,

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:20.560
but almost straight through
most of the data points,

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:22.913
except for the
really far away ones.

01:13:22.913 --> 01:13:24.580
So this is a pretty
neat study, showing,

01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.080
like, hey, the
relationship does not

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:29.290
appear to matter for
doses of consequence.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:32.320
I would call 2 sieverts
a dose of consequence

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.290
based on our earlier discussion
of biological effects.

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:37.307
Luckily, it doesn't go
much farther than that.

01:13:37.307 --> 01:13:38.890
You don't want a lot
of people to have

01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:42.580
received doses beyond 10 gray.

01:13:42.580 --> 01:13:44.518
But this is pretty
compelling to me

01:13:44.518 --> 01:13:46.810
to say, like, we can argue
about what the real model is

01:13:46.810 --> 01:13:49.090
and what the underlying
mechanism is, but is

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:52.300
this a question we really
should be asking ourselves

01:13:52.300 --> 01:13:54.415
when the total risk--

01:13:54.415 --> 01:13:56.290
let's say, when the
total risk to an organism

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:59.830
reaches about 100%, once you
reach a a dose where it doesn't

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:03.010
even matter, then
is this a question

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:06.220
that we should really be
debating in the public sphere?

01:14:06.220 --> 01:14:09.390
I love the outcome of
this particular debate.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.870
Lots of statistics,
don't have time to parse.

01:14:19.613 --> 01:14:21.530
Is there anything else,
Chris, that you wanted

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:24.708
to highlight in this study?

01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:30.065
AUDIENCE: This appears
to [INAUDIBLE] comments

01:14:30.065 --> 01:14:32.392
on Professor Donald
Pierce on [INAUDIBLE]..

01:14:32.392 --> 01:14:33.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, OK, well--

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.000
AUDIENCE: Do you think it
could be the same Pierce?

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:35.990
MICHAEL SHORT: Maybe.

01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:37.940
It was a UK Pierce, I think.

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:47.940
That's pretty cool.

01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:49.440
So anyone else have
any other papers

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:52.050
they want to show for or
against or for our sort

01:14:52.050 --> 01:14:54.000
of collective new conclusion?

01:14:56.605 --> 01:14:58.063
Which is that we
should just relax.

01:15:02.230 --> 01:15:03.710
Cool.

01:15:03.710 --> 01:15:04.710
Well, that went-- yeah?

01:15:04.710 --> 01:15:05.210
Charlie?

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.960
AUDIENCE: I just had
had a question, like,

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.818
what would be like a
posed use of radiation

01:15:09.818 --> 01:15:12.806
hormesis [INAUDIBLE]?

01:15:12.806 --> 01:15:13.568
[INAUDIBLE]

01:15:13.568 --> 01:15:15.110
MICHAEL SHORT: So
let's say you could

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.740
prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
that a little bit of radiation

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.480
exposure was a good thing.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.670
You might then prescribe
radiation treatments

01:15:22.670 --> 01:15:25.523
in order to reap the benefits.

01:15:25.523 --> 01:15:27.440
I don't think there's
been a single study that

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.357
shows that there's like
deterministic benefits

01:15:29.357 --> 01:15:30.842
from irradiating people.

01:15:30.842 --> 01:15:32.300
Some of the studies
show that folks

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:35.390
that have gotten exposed
via various routes

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:37.250
do show a lower
incidence of cancer.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:41.540
So you could almost think
of it like a vitamin, not

01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:43.430
an injectable vitamin.

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:46.730
But-- so back-- there are
lots of pictures online

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:49.290
and stories of way up
in the north in Russia

01:15:49.290 --> 01:15:51.530
and northern countries
that expose you

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.270
to ultraviolet
radiation to stimulate

01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:55.670
the production of vitamin
D in your skin cells

01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:59.120
because in the absence of an
ingestible source of vitamin D,

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:03.105
you make it naturally, but not
when there's eternal darkness.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:05.480
So they'd actually have kids
stand in front of a UV lamp,

01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:07.610
which does have ill effects.

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:09.650
That can cause
also skin cancers,

01:16:09.650 --> 01:16:12.380
but the benefits of the
organism in generating

01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:14.793
vitamin D that you need
for health are greater.

01:16:14.793 --> 01:16:15.960
So that might be an example.

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:19.670
These-- these sorts of ideas
are not that far fetched.

01:16:19.670 --> 01:16:22.220
If you put little kids
in front of UV lamps,

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:23.840
which you know
can do bad things,

01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:26.270
but also does more good
things, then who's to say it

01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:27.590
shouldn't happen for radiation?

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:29.600
Well, no one's to
say yet because we

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:34.070
have no real conclusive
proof that it is helpful.

01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:35.824
But that was the-- yeah?

01:16:36.324 --> 01:16:40.800
AUDIENCE: Have there been any
mechanisms that [INAUDIBLE]??

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.550
MICHAEL SHORT: You
mean in-- for radiation

01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:43.690
or for something else?

01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:44.690
AUDIENCE: For radiation.

01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:47.065
MICHAEL SHORT: The mechanisms
of-- so that one study that

01:16:47.065 --> 01:16:48.100
Chris showed that--

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.010
what was the idea?

01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:52.750
That-- [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.988
The first one that you
showed, the mouse one,

01:16:54.988 --> 01:16:56.530
and then the one
that Chris mentioned

01:16:56.530 --> 01:16:58.210
where a little bit
of radiation dose

01:16:58.210 --> 01:17:00.940
stimulated the immune system.

01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.460
That might be a
potential good thing,

01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.700
where the damage or
death of a few cells

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:10.510
may stimulate the nearby ones
to ramp up an immune response,

01:17:10.510 --> 01:17:14.140
thus snuffing out any other
infection or problem that's

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.040
coming up.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.720
That could be a use.

01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:19.090
But we have to be proved
with much more confidence

01:17:19.090 --> 01:17:20.356
than anything I've seen today.

01:17:23.547 --> 01:17:24.630
So that's a good question.

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:25.963
Yeah, like how would you use it?

01:17:25.963 --> 01:17:28.835
Use it like a vitamin, like
a UV lamp, like a SAD lamp.

01:17:28.835 --> 01:17:30.210
Although, I don't
think SAD lamps

01:17:30.210 --> 01:17:33.580
do anything bad, the
Seasonal Affective Disorder,

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:36.850
the most unfortunate
acronym in the world.

01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:37.548
Yeah.

01:17:37.548 --> 01:17:38.504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:42.970
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

01:17:42.970 --> 01:17:45.250
I don't know if that
would be easy to swallow.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:46.980
Yeah.

01:17:46.980 --> 01:17:48.130
Cool.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:52.035
All right, any other
thoughts from this exercise?

01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:54.160
I think I'll do more
interactive classes like this.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:57.256
It's good to hear you
guys talk for a change.

01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.220
Cool.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:17:59.770
OK.

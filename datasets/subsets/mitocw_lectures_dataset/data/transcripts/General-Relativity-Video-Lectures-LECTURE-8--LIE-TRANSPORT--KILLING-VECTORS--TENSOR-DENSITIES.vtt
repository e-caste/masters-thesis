SCOTT HUGHES: Last
Thursday, we began

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.420
the work of moving
from special relativity

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.540
to general relativity,
and we spent

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.390
a lot of time unpacking two
formulations of the principle

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.050
of equivalence.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.930
So one, which goes
under the name

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.760
"weak equivalence principle"--

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.380
a simpler way of
saying that is that,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.160
at least over a
sufficiently small region,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.890
if there is nothing
but gravity acting,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.600
I cannot distinguish between
freefall under the influence

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.090
of gravity or a
uniform acceleration.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.250
The two things are
equivalent to one another.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.040
Basically, this is a
reflection of the fact

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.190
that the gravitational
charge and the inertial mass

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.360
are the same thing.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.550
That is the main thing
that really underlies

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.160
the weak equivalence principle.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.740
When I gave my tenure talk
a number of years ago here,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.760
I pointed out that there was
this wonderful program called

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.220
the Apollo program that was
put together to test this.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.989
And the way it was done was
that they put astronauts

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.406
on the moon, and
you actually show

00:01:06.406 --> 00:01:08.920
that, if you drop a hammer
and a feather on the moon,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.900
they fall at the same rate.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.668
Of course, the Apollo
program probably

00:01:12.668 --> 00:01:13.960
did a few other things as well.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.180
But I'm a general
relativity theorist,

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.430
so for me, that was the
outcome of the Apollo program,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.340
was test of the
equivalence principle.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.290
We also have a
different variation

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.740
of this we called the Einstein
equivalence principle, which

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.420
leads us to a
calculation that we went

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.930
through last time, which
states that we can find

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.430
a representation
over a sufficiently

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.190
small region of spacetime
such that the laws of physics

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.080
are reduced to those
of special relativity.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.120
And we did a
calculation to examine

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:52.780
this, where we showed, given
an arbitrary spacetime metric,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.420
I can find a coordinate system
such that this can be written

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.090
in the form metric
of flat spacetime

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.330
plus terms that are of order
so we have coordinate distance

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.960
squared.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.370
Let's put it this way-- so this,
in the vicinity of a point pl--

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.820
I'll make that clear
in just a moment.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.830
It ends up looking like of
order of coordinate displacement

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.280
squared with corrections
that scale as 1

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.860
over second derivative
of the metric.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.313
That sets the scale for what
these end up looking like,

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:29.730
or maybe it's
actually times that.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.870
Sorry.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.750
It's times that.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.010
Why did I divide?

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.625
I don't know.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:37.500
Oh, I know why, because
I wanted to point out

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.900
that that is what the scale
of 1 over this thing--

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.270
for God's sake, Scott!

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.980
Stop putting your
square roots in there!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.060
So it looks like that.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.060
And so this is
what I was saying.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.900
You have a curvature
scale that is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.887
on the order of square root of
1 over the second derivative

00:02:59.887 --> 00:03:00.470
of the metric.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.428
Apologies for botching
that as I was writing it

00:03:02.428 --> 00:03:03.407
up there quickly.

00:03:03.407 --> 00:03:05.240
OK, so we did a calculation
that shows that.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.990
And indeed, what we
did is we went through

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.720
and we showed that a general
coordinate transformation has

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.760
more than enough
degrees of freedom

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.210
to make the metric flat
to get the flat spacetime

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.890
metric at a particular point.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.410
And in fact, there are six
degrees of freedom left over,

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.895
corresponding to six
rotations and six boosts that

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:26.490
are allowable at that
particular point or event.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:29.610
Bear in mind we're
working in spacetime.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.640
We have exactly enough degrees
of freedom to cancel out

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.360
the first order term, but we
cannot cancel out the second

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.320
order term.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.030
And in fact, we find
there are 20 degrees

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.380
of freedom left over.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.770
And in a future lecture, we
will derive a geometric object

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.260
that characterizes
the curvature that

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.970
has indeed 20 degrees
of freedom in it

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.657
or 20 independent components
that come out of it.

00:03:51.657 --> 00:03:53.990
So this is the foundation of
where we're moving forward.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.390
And so what this
basically tells us

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.360
is that, in a
spacetime like this,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.130
we have what we call curvature.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.800
Trajectories that start
out parallel to one another

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
are not going to remain
parallel as they move forward.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.230
And where we
concluded last time,

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.030
we were dealing with
the problem that,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.665
if I want to take
derivatives-- and we're going

00:04:14.665 --> 00:04:15.790
to start with vector field.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.399
If I want to
differentiate a vector

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:21.839
field on a curved
manifold, it doesn't work.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:24.570
If I do the naive thing of just
taking a partial derivative,

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.070
it does not work.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.770
So I'll remind you
where we left off.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:47.855
So we found partial
derivatives of vectors.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.180
Let me put that in there.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.900
Partial derivatives
of vectors, and it

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.980
won't take much
work to show it's

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.490
true for one forms
or any tensor,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.810
so let's say, partial
derivatives of tensors

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.300
do not yield tensors.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.800
We're familiar with
this to some extent

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.258
because we already
encountered this

00:05:09.258 --> 00:05:11.920
when we began thinking
about the behavior of, even

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.280
in flat spacetime, flat
spacetime and curvilinear

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.780
coordinates.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.947
So that's the fact that the
basis objects themselves

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:19.170
have some functional dependence
associated with them.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.900
We're interpreting it a
little bit differently now.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.483
And so what we're
doing is we're going

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:25.192
to say that what's
going on here is that,

00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.640
on my curved
manifold-- and I want

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.015
you to visualize
something that's

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:32.410
like a bumpy surface or, if
you like, maybe a sphere.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.950
Think about if you are a
two-dimensional being confined

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.450
to the surface of a sphere.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:38.490
There's only two directions
at any given point.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.270
You can go up, or you can
go on the left-right axis

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.540
or the north-south axis, right?

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.070
And you would define unit
vectors pointing along there.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.330
But as you move around that
sphere, those of us who

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.570
have a three-dimensional life,
and can step back and see this,

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.650
we see that these basis objects
point in different directions

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.730
at different locations
on the sphere.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.730
The two-dimensional beings
aren't aware of that.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.022
They just know that they're
on a surface that's curved.

00:06:05.022 --> 00:06:07.140
And so they would
say that the tangent

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.270
space is different
for all these objects.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.700
They've imagined that every
one of these basis objects

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.700
lives in a plane that is tangent
to the sphere at any given

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.330
point, and that plane is
different at every point

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:18.550
along the sphere.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.750
So we interpret this by saying
that all of our basis objects

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.060
live in this tangent space,
and the tangent space

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.385
is different at every
point on the surface.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.490
So let me just write
out one equation here.

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.050
So when we looked at
the transformation

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.940
of a partial
derivative of a vector,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.360
if we looked at just
the components--

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.660
so this calculation
is in the notes,

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.370
so I would just write down
the result. What we found

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.060
was that, if I'm taking,
say, the beta derivative

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:24.830
of component A alpha,
what I found when

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:27.350
I want to go into a
coordinate transformation

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.590
is that there's
an extra term that

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.420
ruins the tensoriality of this.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:39.030
So this goes over to
something that looks like--

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.910
So the first term is what we'd
expect if this were a tensor

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:13.840
relationship.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.560
That's exactly the matrix
of the Jacobian between two

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.060
different coordinate
representations

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.360
that we expect to
describe how components

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.180
change if they indeed obey
a tensorial relationship.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.370
This extra thing here I
wrote on the second line--

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:30.430
that is spoiling it for us.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.840
So I began to give you the
physical notion of what we

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.470
were going to do to fix this.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.650
So let me just
reset that up again.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:40.809
So let's imagine I have
a particular curve that

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.470
goes along my manifold.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.860
I have a point P
here on the curve,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.920
and I have a point Q over here.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.000
And let's say that P
is at event x alpha.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.950
Q is at x alpha plus dx alpha.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:12.580
Here's my vector
A at the event Q.

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:19.480
And here's my vector
A at the event P.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.375
So what we discussed last time
is that, to get this thing,

00:09:22.375 --> 00:09:24.250
I'm just doing the normal
partial derivative.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.030
I'm basically imagining that
these are close to one another,

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:34.318
that I can just subtract A at
Q from A at P, divide by dx

00:09:34.318 --> 00:09:35.110
and take the limit.

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:37.630
That's the definition
of a derivative.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.360
And what this is telling us
is, mathematically, yeah,

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.580
it's a derivative, but
it's not a derivative

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.830
that yields a tensor quantity.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:47.080
And so we are beginning
to discuss the fact that,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.930
to compare things that have
different tangent spaces, that

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.450
live in different points
in my curve manifold,

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.080
I need a notion of transport
to take one from the other

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.720
in order to compare them.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.540
So there are two
notions of transport

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.620
that we're going
to talk about here.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.920
The first one is called
parallel transport.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.960
So transport notion one--

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.160
we call this parallel transport.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.820
I'm going to actually focus a
little bit on the math first

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:30.840
and then come back to what is
parallel about this afterwards.

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:40.140
So what I essentially need to
do is say, what I want to do

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.690
is find some kind of
a way of imagining

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:46.800
that I take the vector at
P and transport it over

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.080
to the point Q, and I will
compare the transported object

00:10:52.080 --> 00:11:21.240
rather than the object
originally at point P.

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.995
Abstractly, what I'm
essentially going

00:11:22.995 --> 00:11:24.620
to do is I'm going to do
what we always do in this.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.220
I'm going to imagine
that there is

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.380
some kind of an
operation that is

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.870
linear in the separation
between the two of them

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.020
that allows me to
define this transport.

00:11:35.020 --> 00:11:36.529
So let's do the following.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:51.690
So I'm going to assume that
we can define an object, which

00:11:51.690 --> 00:12:05.202
I will call Pi, capital
Pi, alpha, beta, mu, which

00:12:05.202 --> 00:12:06.410
is going to do the following.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:12.207
So what I'm going to do is
say that A alpha transported--

00:12:12.207 --> 00:12:14.540
and to make it even clearer,
how it's being transported.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:21.480
Let's say it's being
transported from P to Q.

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.470
This is given by
alpha at P, and what

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:30.250
I'm going to do is say that,
whatever this object is,

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.830
it is linear in both the
coordinate separation

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.410
of those two events
and the vector field.

00:12:45.293 --> 00:12:47.460
So far, I've said nothing
about physics, by the way.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.543
I'm just laying out some
mathematical definitions.

00:12:49.543 --> 00:12:51.840
I'm going to bring it all
together in a few moments.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.460
I'm then going to
say, OK, I know

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.400
that I had trouble with my
standard partial derivative.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.260
Let's define a derivative
operator in the following way.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:29.980
Define a derivative by
comparing the transported vector

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:37.860
to the field at Q.
So what I'm going

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:40.590
to do for the moment is
just denote this notion

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.980
of a new kind of derivative
with a capital D. Right now,

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.260
it's just another
symbol that we would

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.990
pronounce with a "duh" sound so
that it sounds like derivative.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.907
So don't read too much
into that for a moment.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:14:01.350
So I'm going to define
this as A at Q minus A

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:13.340
transported from P to Q and
then divide by the separation.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:16.660
Take the limit-- usual thing.

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:23.710
And when you do
this, you're going

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.440
to get something that looks
like the partial derivative

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.010
plus an additional term on here.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.370
It looks like this.

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.440
So I've said nothing
about what properties

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.240
I'm going to demand
of this thing.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.130
And in fact, there
are many ways that one

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:47.300
could define a transport
of an object like this.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.280
In general, when you do this,
this thing I'm calling Pi here

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.111
is known as the connection.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:10.080
It is the object that
connects point P to point Q.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.327
So let's make a couple
demands on its properties.

00:15:13.327 --> 00:15:15.410
So now I'll start to put
a bit of physics in this.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:40.010
So demand one is I'm going to
require that, when I change

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:51.500
my coordinate representation,
when I evaluate this

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.160
in my new coordinate
system, that I get something

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.190
that looks like this.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.530
If I do this, I'm going
to find that, when

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.910
I change coordinates and apply
it to the entire derivative

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.750
I've defined over here, that
little extra bit of schmutz

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.170
that's on the second line
there is exactly what you need

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.940
to cancel out this annoying
bugger so that you have

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.280
a nice tensor relationship left.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.070
So I'm going to demand that a
key part of whatever this guy

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:05.510
turns out to be is something
that cancels out the irritating

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.866
garbage that came along
with the partial derivative.

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:48.490
Combine that with what I'm
about to say in just a moment--

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:51.430
that pins things
down significantly.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:54.040
I'm going to make
one more demand,

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.205
and this demand is going
to then be connected

00:17:56.205 --> 00:17:58.330
to the physical picture
that I'm going to introduce

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.920
in about five minutes.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.270
My final demand is I'm
going to require that

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:07.040
whatever this derivative is--

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:11.960
when I apply it to
the metric, I get 0.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:23.630
If I do that, then it turns out
that the connection is exactly

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.370
the Christoffel symbol
that we worked out earlier.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:50.920
If I put in this demand, the
connection is the Christoffel,

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.260
and this derivative
is nothing more

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.000
than the covariant derivative.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.050
Der-iv-a-tive.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.600
This is just the
covariant derivative

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.517
we worked out earlier.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.020
So much for mathematics.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.192
The key thing which
I want to emphasize

00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:16.650
at this point in
the conversation--

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:18.870
I hope we can see the logic
behind the first demand.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.328
That's just something which
I'm going to introduce in order

00:19:21.328 --> 00:19:23.580
to clean this guy up.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.020
This is my choice.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.520
Not just my choice--
it's the choice

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:29.160
of a lot of people who have
helped to develop this subject.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.240
But it's a good one,
because, when I do this,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.730
there is a particularly good
physical interpretation to what

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:40.850
this notion of transport means.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:42.570
And bear with me
for a second while I

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:43.830
gather my notes together.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:56.280
So let's do the top one first.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.140
OK, so let's make
that curve again.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:49.260
And actually, let's just go
ahead and redraw my vector

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:49.980
field.

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:51.772
I do want to have a
different copy of this.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.360
Let me introduce
one other object.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.022
So I'm going to give
this curve a name.

00:21:04.022 --> 00:21:05.480
I'm going to call
this curve gamma.

00:21:11.062 --> 00:21:12.520
And this is a notion
that I'm going

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.820
to make much more precise
in a future lecture,

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.710
but imagine that there is
some kind of a tape measure

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:25.340
that reads out along the
curve gamma that is uniformly

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:27.800
ticked in a way that
we will make precise

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:28.740
in a future lecture.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.950
I will call the
parameter that is uniform

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.900
that denotes these
uniform tick marks--

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:47.577
I will call that lambda.

00:21:47.577 --> 00:21:49.410
If you want to read a
little bit about this,

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:52.140
this is what's known
as an affine parameter.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.870
We will make this a little
bit more precise very soon.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.800
With this in mind, you should
be able to convince yourself

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.760
that this field U defines the
tangent vector to this curve.

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:26.140
So let's say that my original
point here, that this

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:29.830
is at lambda equals 2--

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:33.790
and let's say this is
at lambda equals 7.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.610
And what I want to do
is transport the vector

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.510
from 2 to 7.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.570
Well, a way that I can
do this is by saying,

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:44.500
OK, I now know
that the derivative

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.890
that goes over here-- this is
just the covariant derivative.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.590
So I forgot to write this
down but from now on,

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.000
this derivative I wrote down--

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.430
I'm going to go back to
the gradient symbol we used

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:55.923
for the covariant derivative.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.590
What I can do is take
the covariant derivative

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:10.560
of my vector field, contract
it with this tangent vector.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.405
And what this does--

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:20.050
I'm going to define this as
capital D alpha D lambda.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.370
This is a covariant derivative
with respect to the parameter

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.860
lambda as I move along this
constrained trajectory.

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:42.240
What this does is this
tells me how A changes as it

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.250
is transported along the curve.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:20.820
I'm now going to argue--

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.220
what parallel
transport comes down to

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:42.840
is when you require that, as
you slide this thing along here,

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.810
the covariant total derivative
of this thing as you

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.280
move along the curve,
that it's equal to 0.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.340
OK, now let me motivate
where that's coming from.

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.110
Why is that?

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:04.930
So let's put all of our
definitions back in.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:07.865
Let's apply the definition
of covariant derivative

00:25:07.865 --> 00:25:09.490
that we discussed in
a previous lecture

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:10.990
and we've all come
to know and love.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.610
Now, this is the bit where
we begin to introduce

00:25:30.610 --> 00:25:32.210
a little bit of physics.

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.320
Let's imagine that
points P and Q

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.420
are sufficiently close
to each other that they

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.210
fit within a single,
freely falling frame.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.340
They can go into the
same local Lorentz frame.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:08.730
So remember, when I go into
my local Lorentz frame,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.790
the metric becomes the
metric of flat spacetime.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:15.230
G goes over to eta.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:17.730
There is a second order
correction to that.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:19.660
So the second derivatives--

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.340
I cannot find a [INAUDIBLE]
that gets rid of them.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.070
So there'll be a little bit
of that there, which tells me

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.200
how large this
Lorentz frame can be.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:31.390
But I can get rid of all
the first derivatives.

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.160
And if you get rid of all
the first derivatives,

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.740
you zero out the Christoffel
symbols in that frame.

00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:40.550
So in that frame, there
are no Christoffel symbols.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:27:16.060
So what this means is
that, in this frame,

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:21.645
this just becomes the idea
that a simple total derivative

00:27:21.645 --> 00:27:24.270
of this object-- you don't need
to include all the garbage that

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.150
comes along with the
covariant derivative--

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.230
this is equal to 0.

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:37.810
And that's equivalent to saying
that, as I take this vector

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:42.250
and transport it along, I
hold all of its components

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:46.150
constant as I slide it
from one step to the other.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:14.757
So I start out with
my A at point P here.

00:28:14.757 --> 00:28:16.340
And then I slide it
over a little bit,

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:19.790
holding all the components
constant just like this--

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.750
slide over again,
slide it over again.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:25.788
Da, da, da, da da.

00:28:25.788 --> 00:28:27.216
Da, da, da, da, da.

00:28:31.498 --> 00:28:33.040
Till finally, I get
it over to there.

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:34.240
What this is doing is that--

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.730
any two vectors in the middle
of this transport process--

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.100
I am holding them
as parallel as it

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.850
is possible to hold them,
given that, to be blunt,

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.130
you can't even really
define a notion

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:54.250
of two objects being
parallel on a curved surface

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.140
if there's a macroscopic
separation between them.

00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:59.640
But if you think about
just a little region that's

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.740
sufficiently small,
that it's flat

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:05.620
up to quadratic
corrections, then a notion

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.710
of these things being parallel
to each other makes sense.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:13.060
And this idea, that I'm going
to demand that, upon transport,

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.370
the derivative of
the metric equals 0,

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:18.820
thereby yielding my connection
being the Christoffel

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.700
and this derivative being
the covariant derivative--

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:24.040
it tells us that this
notion of transport

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:26.080
is one in which
objects are just kept

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.230
as parallel as possible
as they slide along here.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.020
And that is why this is
called "parallel transport."

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.530
It's as parallel as
it's possible to be,

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:36.806
given the curvature.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.690
So as I switch
gears, I just want

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:05.730
to emphasize I went through
the mathematics of that

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:09.000
with a fair amount
of care because it

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.190
is important to keep this stuff
as rigorous as possible here.

00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:15.930
This notion of
parallel transport

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:19.680
gets used a lot when we start
talking about things moving

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.090
around in a curved spacetime.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.820
In particular, if you
think about an object

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:29.280
that is freely falling,
and it is experiencing

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.100
no forces other
than gravity, which

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:35.160
we are going to no longer regard
as a force before too long--

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.170
if you just go back to Newtonian
intuition, what does it do?

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.190
Well, you give it an initial
velocity or initial momentum,

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.060
and it maintains it.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:44.880
It just continues going
in a straight line.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.280
In spacetime, going
in a straight line

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:51.120
basically means, at
every step, I move

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:55.620
and I take the tangent to my
world line, my four-velocity,

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:58.060
and I move it
parallel to itself.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:30:59.730
So this notion of
parallel transport

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.350
is going to be the
key thing that we

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:03.990
use to actually define
the kinetics of bodies

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.470
in curved spacetime.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:09.380
There's a tremendous
amount of work

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.040
being done by all sorts
of things these days

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:16.190
that's based on studies of
orbits in curved spacetime,

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:19.500
and they all come back to this
notion of parallel transport.

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:20.000
All right.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:20.620
Bear with me a second.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.160
I just want to take
a sip of water.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:28.270
And then I'm going to talk about
the other notion of transport,

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.173
which we are going to discuss--

00:31:30.173 --> 00:31:32.590
I always say, briefly, and
then I spend three pages on it,

00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:34.970
so we're going to discuss.

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:36.090
All right.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.970
So parallel transport
is extremely important,

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:41.620
and there's a huge
amount of physics

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:45.330
that is tied up in
this, but one thing

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:49.330
which I really want to emphasize
is that it is not unique.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.025
And there is one
other one which we

00:31:51.025 --> 00:31:54.490
are going to really use
to define one particularly

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.970
important notion, instead of
quantities, for our class.

00:32:10.210 --> 00:32:14.020
So suppose I've
got my curve gamma,

00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:16.300
and I'm going to, again,
take advantage of the fact

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:23.680
that I can define a set
of tick marks along it

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.190
and make that vector U be
the tangent to this curve.

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.770
And I'm going to, again,
have my favorite points,

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:43.520
x alpha at point P plus
dx alpha at point Q.

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.760
There's another notion of
transport that is-- basically

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.030
what you do is
you cheat, and you

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:56.840
imagine that moving from point
x alpha to x alpha plus dx alpha

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.910
is a kind of coordinate
transformation.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.790
So let's do the following.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:09.772
Let's say that x
alpha plus dx alpha--

00:33:09.772 --> 00:33:11.480
we're going to take
advantage of the fact

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.040
that, since we have this tangent
notion built into the symbols

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:21.380
we've defined, we'll
just say that it's

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:25.580
going to be the tangent
times the interval of lambda.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.180
And what I'm going
to do is define

00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:33.750
this as a new coordinate
system, x prime.

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:38.750
So that's the alpha component
of coordinate system x prime.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.540
It's a little bit weird
because your x prime has

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.250
a differential built into it.

00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:44.000
Just bear with me.

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:52.390
So what we're going to
do is regard the shift,

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:58.150
or the transport, if
you prefer, from P to Q

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.727
as a coordinate transformation.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:20.000
It's the best eraser, so
I'll just keep using it.

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:36.040
So what I mean by that is
I'm going to regard x alpha,

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.830
and I'm going to use a
slightly different symbol.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.364
I will define what the L is.

00:34:40.364 --> 00:34:42.739
So this is transported, but
I'm going to put an L in here

00:34:42.739 --> 00:34:44.739
for reasons that I will
define in just a moment.

00:34:48.210 --> 00:35:02.830
This, from P to Q, is what
I get if I regard the change

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:05.620
from point P to point Q
as a simple coordinate

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.030
transformation and do my
usual rule for changing

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:11.670
coordinate representation.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.950
So expand what the definition
of x prime is there,

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.770
and what you'll see is that
you get a term that's just

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.080
basically dx alpha dx beta.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:27.000
Then you're going
to get something

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.790
that looks like the
partial derivative

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:30.840
of that tangent vector.

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:41.030
And remember, this
is being acted on.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:47.980
I should've said this is
this thing evaluated at P.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.480
Great.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.530
So we fill this out.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.460
OK.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:19.760
So that's what I get when I
use this notion to transport

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.100
the field from P to Q.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.110
Let's think about
it in another way.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.080
Now, these fields are
all just functions.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:33.260
So I can also express the field
at Q in terms of the field

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:37.078
at P using a Taylor expansion.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.950
I'm assuming that these are
close enough that everything

00:36:42.950 --> 00:37:37.840
is accurate to first
order in small quantities,

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:40.000
so nothing controversial
about this.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.945
I'm assuming dx is small
enough that I can do this.

00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.260
But now I'm going to
get rid of my dx beta

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:27.290
using the tangent field U.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:32.810
Now, before I move on, I
just want to emphasize--

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.750
these two boards here,
over the way the left--

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.610
we're talking about two
rather different quantities.

00:38:38.610 --> 00:38:40.250
The one I just
moved to the top--

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:49.670
that actually is the field-- if
you were some kind of a gadget

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:51.620
that managed your field A--

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.540
that would tell you
what the value is

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:58.520
that you measure at
point Q. This would tell

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.710
you-- what do we
get if you picked P

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:05.180
up and, via this transport
mechanism, moved it over to Q?

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:09.560
They are two potentially
different things.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.088
So this motivates another
kind of derivative.

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:41.400
So suppose I look at A--

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.160
value it at a Q--

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.530
minus A transported--
whoops, that's supposed to be

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:50.730
transported from P to Q--

00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:02.210
defined by D lambda.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.440
I will expand this
out in just a moment.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.970
Now I will, at last,
give this a name.

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:14.750
This is written with
a script L. This

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:24.580
is known as the Lie
derivative of the vector A

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:30.120
along U. Anyone heard of
the Lie derivative before?

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.110
Yeah.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:34.375
So at least in the context where
we're going to be using it,

00:40:34.375 --> 00:40:36.750
this is a good way to understand
what's going on with it.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.420
We'll see how it is
used, at least in 8.962

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.730
in just a few moments.

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:44.670
Filling in the details-- so
plug in these definitions,

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.040
subtract, take limits,
blah, blah, blah.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:54.540
What you find is
that this turns out

00:40:54.540 --> 00:41:02.530
to be U contracted on the
partial derivative of A

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:13.320
minus A contracted on the
partial derivative of U.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.530
Exercise for the reader--

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.540
it is actually
really easy to show

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.400
that you can promote
these partial derivatives

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.977
to covariant derivatives.

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:42.755
And what this means is that,
when you evaluate the Lie

00:41:42.755 --> 00:41:44.630
derivative-- so
notice, nowhere in here

00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:46.838
did I introduce anything
with a covariant derivative.

00:41:46.838 --> 00:41:48.890
There was no connection,
nothing going on there.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.432
If you just go ahead
and work it out,

00:41:50.432 --> 00:41:53.600
basically, when you
expand this guy out,

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.312
you'll find you have connection
coefficients or Christoffel

00:41:56.312 --> 00:41:57.770
symbols that are
equal and opposite

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:59.270
and so they cancel each other.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.930
So you can just go from
partials to covariants.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.070
Give me just a second, Trey.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:05.990
And this is telling us
that the Lie derivative

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.800
is perfectly tensorial.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.330
So the Lie derivative
of the vector field

00:42:11.330 --> 00:42:13.610
is also a tensor quantity.

00:42:13.610 --> 00:42:16.681
You were asking
a question, Trey.

00:42:16.681 --> 00:42:20.078
AUDIENCE: In the second term,
did you miss the D lambda?

00:42:24.297 --> 00:42:25.130
SCOTT HUGHES: I did.

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.630
Yes, I did.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.300
Thank you.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.970
There should be a D
lambda right here.

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.850
Thank you.

00:42:29.850 --> 00:42:30.540
Yes.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.040
Yeah.

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:34.010
If you don't have
that, then you get what

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.670
is technically called "crap."

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.360
So thank you for
pointing that out.

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:48.230
For reasons that I hope you
have probably seen before,

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.850
you always compute
the Lie derivative

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:53.630
of some kind of an object
along a vector field.

00:42:57.698 --> 00:42:59.990
So when you're computing the
Lie derivative of a vector

00:42:59.990 --> 00:43:06.690
field along a vector,
sometimes this

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.762
is written using a commutator.

00:43:09.762 --> 00:43:11.970
I just throw that out there
because you may encounter

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.220
this in some of your readings.

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.820
It looks like this.

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.245
So let me just do
a few more things

00:43:28.245 --> 00:43:30.620
that are essentially fleshing
out the definition of this.

00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:33.120
So I'm not going to go through
and apply this definition

00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.840
very carefully to
higher order objects.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.550
What I will just say
is that, if I repeat

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:43.687
this exercise and, instead
of having a vector field

00:43:43.687 --> 00:43:45.770
that I'm transporting from
point to point, suppose

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:46.937
I do it for a scalar field--

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.750
well, what you actually get--
pardon me for a second--

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:11.468
is this on the partial, but the
partial derivative of a scalar

00:44:11.468 --> 00:44:13.260
is the covariant
derivative because there's

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.700
no Christoffel that couples in.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:29.320
If you do this for a one-form,
where it's a 1 indexed

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:48.910
object in the
downstairs position,

00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:51.030
you get something
that looks like this.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:54.980
And again, when you expand out
your covariant derivatives,

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:58.530
you find that your Christoffel
symbols cancel each other out.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:45:00.440
And so, if you
like, you can just

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:05.540
go ahead and replace
these with partials.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:08.381
And likewise, let me just write
one more out for completeness.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.080
Apply this to a tensor.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.280
So it's a very similar
kind of structure

00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:36.190
to what you saw when we did the
covariant derivative in which

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:40.900
every index essentially gets
corrected by a factor that

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.270
looks like the covariant
derivative of the field

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:44.888
that you are
differentiating along.

00:45:44.888 --> 00:45:46.430
The signs are a
little bit different.

00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:51.290
So it's a similar tune, but
it's in a different key.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:04.490
OK, so that's great.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:08.117
And if you get your
jollies just understanding

00:46:08.117 --> 00:46:09.950
different mathematical
transport operations,

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.368
maybe this is
already fun enough.

00:46:13.368 --> 00:46:15.410
But we're in a physics
class, and so the question

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:18.020
that should be to
your mind is, is there

00:46:18.020 --> 00:46:20.910
a point to all this analysis?

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:27.887
So in fact, the most important
application of the Lie

00:46:27.887 --> 00:46:30.340
derivative for our purposes--

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.130
in probably the
last lecture or two,

00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:42.610
I will describe some stuff
related to modern research

00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:43.810
that uses it quite heavily.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:47.980
But to begin with in our class,
the most important application

00:46:47.980 --> 00:47:01.610
will be when we
consider cases where,

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:05.880
when I compute the Lie
derivative of some tensor

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:09.200
along a vector U and I get 0.

00:47:24.932 --> 00:47:26.890
I'm just going to leave
it schematic like that.

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:30.400
So L U of the tensor
is equal to 0.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:37.104
If this is the case, we say that
the tensor is Lie transported.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.350
This is, incidentally,
just a brief aside.

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:56.900
It shows up a lot
in fluid dynamics.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.670
In that case, U often
defines the flow lines

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.110
associated with
the velocity field

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:04.735
of some kind of a
fluid that is flowing

00:48:04.735 --> 00:48:06.808
through your physical situation.

00:48:06.808 --> 00:48:08.600
And you would be
interested in the behavior

00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:13.530
of all sorts of quantities that
are embedded in that fluid.

00:48:13.530 --> 00:48:15.350
And as we're going
to see, when you

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:19.010
find that those quantities are
Lie transported in this way,

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:21.693
there is a powerful
physical outcome

00:48:21.693 --> 00:48:23.360
associated with that,
which we are going

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.410
to derive in just a moment.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:34.819
So suppose I, in fact, have a
tensor that is Lie transported.

00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:08.170
So suppose I have some tensor
that is Lie transported.

00:49:08.170 --> 00:49:16.830
If that's the
case, what I can do

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.740
is define a particular
coordinate system

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:22.765
centered on the curve for
which U is the tangent.

00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:47.250
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to define this curve such

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:55.350
that x0 is equal to lambda,
that parameter that defines

00:49:55.350 --> 00:49:58.530
my length along the curve in
a way that, I will admit I've

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.540
not made very precise
yet but will soon.

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:13.370
And then I'm going to require
that my other three coordinates

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:15.080
are all constant on that curve.

00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:47.780
So if I do that, then my tangent
vector is simply delta x0.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.980
In other words, it's only got
one non-trivial component,

00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:52.780
and its value of
that component is 1.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:50:59.650
And this is the constant.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:03.580
So the derivatives
of the tangent field

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.520
are all equal to 0.

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:26.360
And when you trace this through
all of our various definitions,

00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:28.790
what you find is that
it boils down to just

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:31.970
looking at how the
tensor field varies

00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:36.350
with respect to that parameter
along the curve itself.

00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:39.375
If it's Lie transported,
then this is equal to 0.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.870
And so this means that,
whatever x0 represents,

00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:53.430
it's going to be a constant
along that curve with respect

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:54.776
to this tensor field.

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:01.003
Oh, excuse me.

00:52:01.003 --> 00:52:01.670
Screwed that up.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:13.980
The tensor does not vary with
this parameter along the curve.

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:30.100
This was a lot, so let's
just step back and think

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:32.380
about what this is saying.

00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:37.255
One of the most important things
that we do in physics when

00:52:37.255 --> 00:52:39.040
we're trying to
analyze systems is

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:40.960
we try to identify
quantities that

00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.080
are constants of the motion.

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:47.340
This is really tricky
in a curved spacetime

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:52.440
because much of
our intuition gets

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:56.010
garbled by all of the facts
that different points have

00:52:56.010 --> 00:52:58.530
different tangent spaces.

00:52:58.530 --> 00:53:00.750
You worry about whether
something being true,

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:03.240
and is it just a function
of the coordinate system

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:04.560
that I wrote this out in?

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:07.980
What the hell is going on here?

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:12.390
The Lie derivative is giving us
a covariant, frame-independent

00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:18.250
way of identifying things that
are constants in our spacetime.

00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:22.950
So we're going to wrap
up this discussion.

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:25.890
Let's suppose that the tensor
that I'm looking at here

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:27.180
is called the metric.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:54:06.750
Suppose there exists a vector
C such that the metric is Lie

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:08.960
transported along this thing.

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:28.420
What does this tell us?

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:43.570
So first, it means there
exists some coordinate such

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:52.270
that the metric does not vary.

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:55.090
The metric is constant with
respect to that coordinate.

00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:58.120
Essentially, if you go through
what I sketched a moment ago,

00:54:58.120 --> 00:54:59.920
this is telling us
that the existence

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.470
of this kind of a vector, which
I'm going to give a name to

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:05.240
in just a moment--

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.000
the existence of
this thing demands

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.274
that my metric is constant with
respect to some coordinate.

00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.650
I am not going to prove
the following statement.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:19.920
I will just state it,
because, in some ways,

00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:23.025
the converse of that statement
is even more powerful.

00:55:38.690 --> 00:55:54.640
If there is a coordinate,
such that dgd,

00:55:54.640 --> 00:56:01.318
whatever that coordinate
is, is equal to 0,

00:56:01.318 --> 00:56:02.985
then a vector field
of this type exists.

00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:18.423
So the second thing I want to
do is expand the Lie derivative.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:32.810
So if I require that my metric
be transported along the vector

00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:44.047
C, well, insert my definition
of the Lie derivative.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:05.120
Now, what is the main
defining characteristic

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.980
of the covariant derivative?

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:10.142
How did I get my connection
in the first place?

00:57:10.142 --> 00:57:11.850
In other words, what
is this going to be?

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.300
OK, students who took
undergraduate classes with me,

00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:19.300
I'll remind you of one
of the key bits of wisdom

00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:20.175
I always tell people.

00:57:20.175 --> 00:57:24.040
If the professor asks you a
question, 90% of the time,

00:57:24.040 --> 00:57:27.220
if you just shout out, "0,"
you are likely to be right.

00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.973
[LAUGHING]

00:57:28.973 --> 00:57:30.640
Usually, there's some
kind of a symmetry

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.190
that we want you to understand,
which allows you to go,

00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:34.448
oh, it's equal to 0.

00:57:34.448 --> 00:57:36.490
By the way, whenever I
point that out to a class,

00:57:36.490 --> 00:57:39.040
I then work really hard
to make a non-zero answer

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:40.310
for the next time I ask it.

00:57:40.310 --> 00:57:45.640
So the covariant derivative
of g is 0, so this term dies.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.850
Because the covariant
derivative of g is 0,

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:52.940
I can always commute the metric
with covariant derivatives.

00:57:52.940 --> 00:57:55.540
So I can take this, move
it inside the derivative.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:58.129
I can take this, move it
inside the derivative.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.590
So what this means is this
Lie derivative equation,

00:58:23.590 --> 00:58:35.090
after all the smoke clears,
can be written like this.

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:38.210
Or, if I recall,
there's this notation

00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:42.633
for symmetry of indices,
which I introduced

00:58:42.633 --> 00:58:43.550
in a previous lecture.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:47.660
The symmetric covariant
derivative of this C

00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:48.920
is equal to 0.

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:58.350
This equation is known
as Killing's equation,

00:58:58.350 --> 00:59:07.620
and C is a Killing vector.

00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:10.710
Now, this was a fair
amount of formalism.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:14.520
I was really laying out a lot of
the details to get this right.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:20.807
So to give you some context
as to why this matters,

00:59:20.807 --> 00:59:22.890
there's a bit more that
needs to come out of this,

00:59:22.890 --> 00:59:26.460
but we're going to
get to it very soon.

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.560
Suppose I have a
body that is freely

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:30.900
falling through some spacetime.

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:31.650
And you know what?

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:32.858
I'm going to leave this here.

00:59:32.858 --> 00:59:35.427
So this is a slightly
advanced tangent,

00:59:35.427 --> 00:59:36.510
so I'll start a new board.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:03.130
So if I have some body
that is freely falling,

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:05.840
what we are going to
show in, probably,

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:10.720
Thursday's lecture is that the
equation of motion that governs

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.830
it is-- you can argue
this on physical grounds,

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.510
and that's all I
will do for now--

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:18.710
it's a trajectory that parallel
transports its own tangent

01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:19.580
factor.

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.010
For intuition, go into
the freely falling frame

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:24.500
where it's just the trajectory
from special relativity.

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.900
It's a straight
line in that frame,

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:29.580
and parallel transporting
its own tangent vector

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:34.430
basically means it just moves
on whatever course it is going.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:49.010
So this is a
trajectory for which

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:52.610
I demand that the four-velocity
governing it parallel

01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:55.790
transports along itself.

01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:59.150
Now, suppose you are
moving in a spacetime that

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.530
has a Killing vector.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.240
So this will be
Thursday's lecture.

01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:24.600
Suppose the spacetime
has a Killing vector.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.990
Well, so there will be some
goofy C that you know exists,

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:31.860
and you know C
obeys this equation.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:33.900
By combining these
things, you can

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:41.220
show that there is
some quantity, C,

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.830
which is given by
taking the inner product

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:47.400
of the four-velocity of
this freely falling thing

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.260
and the Killing vector.

01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:51.960
And you can prove that this
is a constant of the motion.

01:02:06.018 --> 01:02:08.560
So let's think about where this
goes with some of the physics

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.500
that you presumably all
know and love already.

01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.100
Suppose you look at a spacetime.

01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:18.465
So you climb a
really high mountain.

01:02:18.465 --> 01:02:20.590
You discover that there's
a spacetime metric carved

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:22.660
into the stone
into the top of it.

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:24.760
You think, OK, this
probably matters.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.870
You look at it and you notice it
depends on, say, time, radius,

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:29.710
and two angles.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:39.250
Suppose you have a metric
that is time-independent.

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:49.040
Hey, if it's
time-independent, then I

01:02:49.040 --> 01:02:53.450
know that the derivative of
that thing with respect to time

01:02:53.450 --> 01:02:54.500
is 0.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.320
There must exist
a Killing factor

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:00.020
that is related to the
fact that there is no time

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:01.150
dependence in this metric.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:25.675
So you go and you calculate it.

01:03:25.675 --> 01:03:27.800
So this thing, that C is
a constant of the motion--

01:03:35.838 --> 01:03:36.880
I believe that's P set 4.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.340
It's not hard.

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:44.170
You combine that equation
that we're going to derive,

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:46.000
called the geodesic equation,
with Killing's equation.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.600
Math happens.

01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:47.408
You got it.

01:03:47.408 --> 01:03:49.575
So suppose you've got a
metric that's time-dependent

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.210
and you know you've
got this thing.

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:51.918
So you know what?

01:03:51.918 --> 01:03:53.860
Let's work it out
and look at it.

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:56.080
It becomes clear,
after studying this

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:10.340
for a little bit, that the C for
this Killing vector is energy.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.620
In the same way that, if
you have a time-independent

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.710
Lagrangian, your system
has a conserved energy,

01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:18.110
if you have a
time-independent metric,

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:19.777
there is a Killing
vector, which--

01:04:19.777 --> 01:04:21.110
the language we like to use is--

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:23.690
we say the motion
of that spacetime

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:26.660
emits a conserved energy.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.890
Suppose you find that the metric
is independent of some angle.

01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:33.710
We'll call it phi.

01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:35.310
Three guesses what's
going to happen.

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:37.580
In this case-- just
one guess, actually.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.105
Conserved--

01:04:38.105 --> 01:04:39.230
AUDIENCE: Angular momentum.

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:41.490
SCOTT HUGHES: Angular momentum
pops out in that case.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:45.290
So this ends up being the
way in which we, essentially,

01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:47.750
make very rigorous
and geometric the idea

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:53.572
that conservation laws are put
into general relativity, OK?

01:04:53.572 --> 01:04:55.530
So I realize there's a
lot of abstraction here.

01:04:55.530 --> 01:04:57.238
So I want to go on a
bit of an aside just

01:04:57.238 --> 01:04:58.970
to tie down where we
are going with this

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:01.760
and why this actually matters.

01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:04.575
OK.

01:05:04.575 --> 01:05:05.110
Let's see.

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.230
So we got about 10 minutes left.

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:12.000
So what we're going to do
at the very end of today--

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.050
and we'll pick this up
beginning of next time.

01:05:14.050 --> 01:05:17.870
So for the people who walked
in a few minutes late,

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.165
the stuff that I'm actually
about to start talking about we

01:05:21.165 --> 01:05:23.540
need to get through before
you can do one of the problems

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:24.370
on the P set.

01:05:24.370 --> 01:05:26.120
So I'm probably going
to take that problem

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.016
and move it on to
P set 4, but I'm

01:05:28.016 --> 01:05:30.560
going to start talking
about it right now.

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:39.980
So we've really focused a
lot, so far, on tensors.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:48.530
We're going to now start talking
about a related quantity called

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:49.850
tensor densities.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.523
There's really only two that
matter for our purposes,

01:05:58.523 --> 01:06:00.190
but I want to go
through them carefully.

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:01.780
So I will set up with
one, and then we'll

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.460
conclude the other
one at the beginning

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:04.900
of Thursday's lecture.

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:07.950
So let me define this first.

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:09.700
I'm going to give a
definition that I like

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.260
but that's actually
kind of stupid.

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:24.250
So these are quantities that
transform almost like tensors--

01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:31.060
a little bit lame, but,
as you'll see in a moment,

01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.100
it's kind of accurate.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.520
What you'll find is that
the transformation law

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:53.003
is off by a factor
that is the determinant

01:06:53.003 --> 01:06:54.670
of the coordinate
transformation matrix.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:09.150
Take it to some power.

01:07:13.493 --> 01:07:15.660
So there's is an infinite
number of tensor densities

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.130
that one could define.

01:07:17.130 --> 01:07:19.800
Two are important
for this class.

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:44.350
So the two that are
most important for us

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:54.780
are the Levi-Civita symbol and
the determinant of the metric.

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:05.580
So we use Levi-Civita already
to talk about volumes.

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:08.012
And it was a tensor
when we were working

01:08:08.012 --> 01:08:10.470
in rectilinear coordinates,
where the underlying coordinate

01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:14.100
system was essentially
Cartesian plus time.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.484
It's not in general, OK?

01:08:15.484 --> 01:08:16.859
And we'll go
through why that is.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.710
That'll probably be the last
thing we can fit in today.

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.450
So let me remind you--

01:08:24.677 --> 01:08:29.490
Levi-Civita-- I'm going to
write it with a tilde on it

01:08:29.490 --> 01:08:34.680
to emphasize that
it is not tensorial.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:40.550
So this is equal to
plus 1 if the indices

01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:45.529
are 0, 1, 2, 3 and
even permutations

01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:53.960
of that equals minus 1 for
odd permutations of that.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:59.090
And it's 0 for any
index repeated.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.380
Now, this symbol has a
really nice property when

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:16.090
you apply it to any matrix.

01:09:16.090 --> 01:09:17.979
In fact, this is a theorem.

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.979
So I'm working in
four-dimensional space.

01:09:36.979 --> 01:09:44.920
So let's say I've got a 4-by-4
matrix, which I will call m.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.580
Write a new [INAUDIBLE]
notation, m alpha mu.

01:09:48.580 --> 01:10:11.500
If I evaluate Levi-Civita,
contract it on these guys,

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:18.050
I get Levi-Civita
back, multiply it

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:21.360
by the determinant
of the matrix m.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.050
Now, suppose what I
choose for my matrix

01:10:34.050 --> 01:10:36.480
m is my coordinate
transformation matrix.

01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.930
So I'm just going to
write down this result,

01:11:14.930 --> 01:11:20.480
and I'll leave it since we're
running a little short on time.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.908
You can just double check
that I've moved things

01:11:23.908 --> 01:11:25.700
from one side of the
equation to the other,

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.825
and you can just double-check
I did that correctly.

01:11:31.010 --> 01:11:34.430
What that tells me
is that Levi-Civita

01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:39.450
and a new set of
prime coordinates

01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:43.070
is equal to this guy
in the old, unprimed

01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:53.590
coordinates with all my usual
factors of transformation

01:11:53.590 --> 01:12:11.990
matrices and then
an extra bit that

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:14.780
is the determinant of the
coordinate transformation

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.340
matrix.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.050
If it were just
the top line, this

01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:20.100
is exactly what you would
need for Levi-Civita

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:23.205
to be a tensor in the way
that we have defined tensors.

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:23.705
It's not.

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:48.370
So the extra factor pushes away
from a tensor relationship.

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:51.100
And so what we would say
is, because this is off

01:12:51.100 --> 01:13:02.610
by a factor of what's
sometimes called the Jacobian,

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:07.290
we call this a tensor
density of weight 1.

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:19.320
So in order to do
this properly--

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.740
I don't want to rush--

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:24.390
at the beginning of
the next lecture,

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:27.890
we're going to look at how
the determinant of the metric

01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:29.167
behaves.

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:31.250
And what we'll see is that,
although the metric is

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:34.100
a tensor, its
determinant is a tensor

01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.950
density of weight negative 2.

01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:39.920
And so what that tells
us is that I can actually

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.370
put together a combination
of the Levi-Civita

01:13:43.370 --> 01:13:46.730
and the determinant of
the metric in such a way

01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:49.328
that their product is tensorial.

01:13:49.328 --> 01:13:51.245
And that turns out to
be real useful because I

01:13:51.245 --> 01:13:54.050
can use this to define,
in a curved spacetime,

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:57.170
covariant volume elements, OK?

01:13:57.170 --> 01:13:58.923
With this as written,
my volume elements--

01:13:58.923 --> 01:14:00.590
if I just use this
like I did when we're

01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:03.020
taught about special relativity,
my volume elements won't

01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:06.800
be elements of a tensor,
and a lot of the framework

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.170
that we've developed
goes to hell.

01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:11.510
So an extra factor of the
determining of the metric

01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:13.220
will allow us to correct this.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.770
And this seems kind of abstract.

01:14:16.770 --> 01:14:19.490
So let me just, as a really
brief aside, before we conclude

01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:22.200
today's class--

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:26.980
suppose I'm just in
Euclidean three-space

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:30.070
and I'm working in
spherical coordinates.

01:14:38.490 --> 01:14:41.390
So here's my line element.

01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:51.240
My metric is the
diagonal of 1r squared

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:55.080
r squared sine squared theta.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.284
The determinant of the
metric, which I will write g--

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:06.560
it's r to the fourth
sine squared theta.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.060
What we're going
to learn when we do

01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:14.380
this is that the metric is a
tensor density of weight 2.

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.710
And so to correct it to
get something of weight 1,

01:15:16.710 --> 01:15:17.670
we take a square root.

01:15:23.153 --> 01:15:24.820
If you're working in
circle coordinates,

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.720
does that look familiar?

01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:28.990
This is, in fact,
exactly what allows

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:31.853
us to convert differentials
of our coordinates.

01:15:31.853 --> 01:15:33.770
Remember, we're working
in a coordinate basis.

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.220
And so we think of
our little element

01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.200
of just the coordinates.

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.290
It's just dr, d theta, d phi.

01:15:41.290 --> 01:15:42.880
This ends up being
the quantity that

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:46.390
allows us to convert the little
triple of our coordinates

01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:48.730
into something that has
the proper dimensions

01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:51.880
and form to actually be
a real volume element.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.078
And so dr, de theta, d phi--

01:15:54.078 --> 01:15:55.120
that ain't enough volume.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:58.720
But r squared sine theta,
dr, d theta, d phi--

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:00.273
that's a volume element, OK?

01:16:00.273 --> 01:16:02.440
So basically, that's all
that we're doing right now,

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.510
is we're making that
precise and careful.

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.135
And that's where I
will pick things up.

01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:08.190
We'll finish that
up on Thursday.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.590
PROFESSOR STRANG: OK.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.430
So this is a fun lecture.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.640
This is the lecture
where understanding

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.460
the gradient, which
we did last time;

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.250
the divergence, that
we almost completed;

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.630
those two pieces
now come together

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.870
into Laplace's equation.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.150
Things work in a fantastic
way, so I enjoy this one.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.440
So the result will be that we
have the potential function

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.910
u that we've spoken about,
and take its gradient.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.580
Now is coming a stream
function, s, that's

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.460
connected with the divergence.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.220
When the divergence
is zero, there's

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.510
something called a
stream function, s.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.540
And these, the connections
between those two functions, u

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.730
and s, are crucial.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.810
And connecting
gradient to divergence

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.620
will take us to
Laplace's equation.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.460
And then you'll see the special,
special role of x+iy in 2-D.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.680
So this is in two dimensions.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.270
OK.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.290
So let me begin with divergence.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.460
This is the divergence
of w, of course.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.030
And solve it.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.700
Just as we wanted to solve
Kirchhoff's current law,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.840
A transpose w equal zero, so
now in the continuous case,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.710
we want to find solutions to --
we want to find divergence-free

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.580
fields.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.100
Source-free fields,
you could say.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.720
That's about the
best word we have,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.020
divergence-free, meaning
there is no divergence.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.960
So what have we got here?

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.070
We've got one equation
in two unknowns.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.170
Last time, with the
gradient business,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.180
we had two equations for u,
and only that one unknown.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.870
Now we've got one equation,
two unknowns, because we're

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.400
looking at the transpose.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.040
So there should be
a lot of solutions.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.370
Right?

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.750
If you give me a
w_1, then probably

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.830
I'll be able to find a w_2.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.210
But there's a neat way
to describe the solutions

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.280
to that equation, the
divergence-free fields.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.550
It's to introduce something
called a source function --

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.980
a stream function,
sorry, stream function.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:53.640
OK, and now the idea will be
that if I let -- let me try.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.860
I take any function s(x,y),
any function whatever.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.920
So now I try --
let w_1 be ds/dy.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.560
Maybe I should say, maybe
I should go this way.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.420
I'm looking for solutions.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.970
OK.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.010
So I take any function s, I
take its y derivative to be w_1.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.340
And you can tell me
what w_2 has to be?

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.280
So if w_1 is ds/dy,
this will be what?

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.260
This'll be the second -- the x
derivative of the y derivative.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.480
Right?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.590
If w_1 is the y derivative, then
when I take the x derivative,

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.470
I've got this cross derivative.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.040
So what would be the
smart choice for w_2?

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.510
So I'll say then,
then w_2 will be --

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.720
now I've sort of
said what w_1 is,

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.230
what's the w_2
that goes with it?

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.840
Well, it's whatever it
takes to cancel this.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.530
I want this to be, in other
words I want it to get zero,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.050
so this should be the
second derivative s.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:16.400
And what am I going
to put now? dydx.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.510
I'm using the same
very crucial fact

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.420
that the cross derivative
can be in either order.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.770
So what do I see for w_2?

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.230
Do you see what w_2 is?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.610
This is supposed to match that.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.610
There's a minus
sign. w_2 is what?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.650
Minus ds/dx.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.760
Right?

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.320
Minus ds/dx.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.060
That's the minus ds/dx.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.250
If I take any function s, I
let w_1 be its y derivative

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.890
and w_2 be minus
its x derivative,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.030
then the divergence
will be zero.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.550
Because I'll have
the cross derivative

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.400
minus the cross derivative,
of course that'll be zero.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.720
So these will be my w_1's -- my
w's. w_1, w_2, coming from s.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.300
So I have what I expect,
with two unknowns,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.090
only one equation, I've
got lots of solutions.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.950
I create any function
s, and that will be one.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:21.570
So that's a stream function.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.640
And it has a physical
meaning, so we get to see it.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.000
And it has a fantastic
connection to the potential.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.830
So up to now -- so this is
now the moment pieces come

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.370
together.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.470
Up to now, we had the divergence
and the gradient separately.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.680
So up to now, what we had was,
we started with the potential

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.375
u, and we went to v -- I called
it v for this application --

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:50.000
[du/dx, du/dy].

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.890
OK.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.590
And now, over on this side,
I had the divergence of w

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.230
equals zero.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:08.670
And that led me to w being,
what we just said, ds/dy,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.710
and minus ds/dx.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.220
OK, two separate pictures.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.480
Now we're going to
connect the framework,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.160
going to give the
connection between v and w.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.560
And the connection will
be the easiest possible;

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.820
they'll be equal.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.870
So the c in our framework
is the identity.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.290
I want to say, I want
to look at our framework

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.830
when c is the identity.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.070
So v and w are the same.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:41.730
In other words, what
equation do we get then?

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.440
We started with u,
we take the gradient

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.760
of u, that's v. We go
over here, and we still

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.720
have the gradient of u,
because this was the v

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.770
and now it's also the w.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.160
And then we take
-- what do we take?

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:03.390
Minus the divergence of
the gradient of u, equals,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.510
let's say, f.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.740
Shall we say f, to
make something happen?

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.570
Or zero -- I'll say zero.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.300
I'll say zero.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.330
Yeah, because zero
is the one that

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.490
give us Laplace's equation.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.200
The official name would be
-- that's Laplace's equation.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.120
Do you recognize it?

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.980
We'd better write
it out properly.

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.970
The divergence of the
gradient is the Laplacian.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.600
So this is Laplace.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.560
Famous equation.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.510
Steady-state type of equation.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.630
It goes with
steady-state problems.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.950
Let's just figure
out what this is.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:55.420
So w is, since these are the
same, w is now [du/dx, du/dy].

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.690
It's the gradient.

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.200
Now what happens,
do you see what

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.290
happens when I take the
divergence of the gradient,

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:07.210
the divergence of this w?

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:09.390
I just want to write
that equation out.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.460
It's crucial.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:17.200
I need brilliant colors
and lights shining, now,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.460
for what goes in there.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.100
Because I want to take the
divergence of the gradient.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.320
So what does that mean?

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.460
I take the x derivative
of the first component,

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.190
plus the y derivative
of the second component.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.530
The minus sign is not going
to matter, with a zero

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.140
on the right hand side.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.850
I could cancel the minus.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.700
So, but let me say it again.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:43.120
The divergence is, it applies
to a vector, I've got a vector.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.940
I take the x component
of the first -- of w_1.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:52.100
So that'll give me d
second u/dx squared.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.230
And I take the y derivative --
I should have said derivative --

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.340
y derivative of the
second component.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:05.570
And the y derivative of that
is d second u/dy squared.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:08.030
And I get zero.

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:11.330
So that's Laplace's equation.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.200
You see, the whole idea
is Laplace's equation,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.300
in working with
Laplace's equation,

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.930
we have three elements, here.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.430
The gradient comes in,
the divergence comes in,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.840
and equality comes in.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.230
Would you like to see a more
general Laplace's equation?

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.610
Well, a more general
Poisson's equation.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:43.080
So underneath Laplace,
let me write Poisson.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.440
You got the pronunciation, the
brilliant French pronunciation

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.080
there, of Poisson?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.130
That was my best.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.620
I can't improve on that one.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.730
So it comes in when
there's a right-hand side.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:59.920
So the normal Poisson equation
is second derivative with

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.680
respect to x, second derivative
with respect to y -- well,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.260
actually, it should
have a minus there.

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:11.050
Really should be a minus there.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.090
You remember why
the minus is there.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.840
The minus is there to make
the whole thing positive.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.340
Right?

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.190
That sounds crazy, that the
minus makes it positive.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.790
But these second derivatives are
negative definite, as always,

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.370
and the minus makes
them positive definite.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:32.350
So I don't remember whether --
maybe I often include the minus

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:35.770
over here -- equal f(x,y).

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:36.920
So there's a source.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.740
Poisson has a source term.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.950
Laplace doesn't.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.760
And just while I'm talking
about this framework,

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.800
if there was a c(x,y),
so this would be or.

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.980
I'll put or.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:55.450
The more general one
would be the x derivative,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:03.410
because I'm taking the
divergence, of a c(x,y)du/dx,

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:08.140
and the y derivative of a c
-- so you see the difference.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:13.130
I'm now allowing some
variable conductivity.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:18.010
Variable whatever,
variable material.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.490
du/dy equals f, again.

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.470
So that would be the
more general one.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:27.290
I don't think we
plan to study that.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.280
Well, that's not
the most general,

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.110
I could have more and
more things there.

00:11:32.110 --> 00:11:36.880
But that shows you
a variable material.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.180
Yeah, that material is variable.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:42.130
I would use the word --
what word would I use?

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.600
It doesn't depend
on the direction.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.760
I'm using the same c(x,y)
in the x direction and the y

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.880
direction.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.390
Therefore in all directions.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.820
And I didn't come
prepared with that word.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.290
What's the word
for when it doesn't

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.890
depend on the direction?

00:11:58.890 --> 00:11:59.740
Isotropic!

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:00.340
Thanks.

00:12:00.340 --> 00:12:01.330
Isotropic.

00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:03.320
So that's isotropic.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.230
So that's really
our framework there.

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:09.110
At least for
isotropic materials.

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:10.640
And then we could
have more general

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.950
with anisotropic materials.

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:14.290
That would be fun.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.190
All of those things are fun.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:19.280
But Laplace's equation
is the most fun of all.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.280
So let me take f to
be zero, c to be one,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.050
get back up to
Laplace's equation,

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.780
and begin to make connections.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.200
Begin to make connections.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.590
OK.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.750
The beautiful connection
is the one right here.

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:44.640
When v and u are the same,
when v and w are the same,

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.370
then I just read off.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:52.730
If v is the same as w, then
how is the potential function,

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.810
which is on the left side,
connected to the strain

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:59.690
function, which is coming
from, any time div w is zero,

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.660
I've got a stream
function in 2-D, here.

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:06.130
The connection is
just, those two match.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:14.890
du/dx is the same
as ds/dy, and du/dy

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.750
is the same as minus ds/dx.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.970
You see that the two sides of
our world are coming together.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:28.080
We're dealing with flows
that are both gradient flows,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.170
they come from a
potential, you could often

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.000
say potential flows, I see the
word ideal flows coming in.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.300
These are very special flows.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:47.770
So aero couldn't work entirely
with these flows, of course.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.700
These are such ideal flows.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.760
Proper aerodynamics,
you've got shocks,

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.650
you've got all sorts
of stuff going on.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.810
But in a region where
everything's beautiful,

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:04.430
then you get back to this,
total steady state, steady flow,

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:06.340
steady potential flow.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.240
We've got those
equations that connect u

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.130
on one side with the
divergence business,

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.330
the stream function
on the other side.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.710
So I want to focus on these.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:22.700
Actually, I mean, so the
heart of Laplace's equation

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.680
is in there.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.280
OK.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:30.522
First, do you know the
names of those two guys?

00:14:30.522 --> 00:14:31.980
I shouldn't call
them guys, they're

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.820
the greatest
mathematicians ever.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.530
Maybe after Gauss.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.020
Do you know whose names are
associated with those two

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.530
equations?

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:47.140
Well, Lagrange was great.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.300
I'm not saying anything
about Lagrange.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.220
But he didn't do this.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.910
So two, one French
and one German.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:15:00.070
So the French guy's
name is Cauchy.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:04.260
And the German is --
so these are Cauchy,

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.770
and the German is a
really fantastic guy.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.520
Anybody know his name?

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.450
Cauchy-Riemann.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:11.950
Yeah.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.320
The other name is Riemann.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:21.170
Cauchy-Riemann equations,
that connect the two pieces,

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.180
u and s.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.660
And they're the subject
of an enormous theory

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.110
that we'll just touch on here.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.820
OK.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.140
And we'll see them graphically,
and we'll find solutions.

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:35.720
So this is one way
to pose our problem.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.890
Notice something here.

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.250
I think that if we
have these equations,

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:45.130
a solution u should
satisfy Laplace's equation.

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:49.460
Because this equality will
take us around the loop.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:54.240
So do you see that if I
could solve these two --

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.740
here's the point.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.470
I'm going to get Laplace's
equation solved by u.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:03.630
Laplace's equation will
also be solved by s.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.540
The stream function.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.160
So what's going to happen
is, I get two solutions.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.100
A pair of solutions.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:17.870
Laplace's equation, solutions
to that come in pairs, u and s.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.800
So we get them two at a time.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.680
And they're connected
in this remarkable way.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.470
Let's see, can you see
that u will satisfy --

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.140
this is the key to everything.

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:30.681
Does u satisfy
Laplace's equation?

00:16:30.681 --> 00:16:31.180
Sure.

00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.660
I take the x derivative
of that, and I add

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.760
to the y derivative of that.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:36.990
Do you see, it works.

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:40.450
The x derivative of this,
plus the y derivative of this

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:43.890
is exactly the cancellation
of the cross that I wanted.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:51.860
So I do these, I combine
those into Laplace.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:56.760
Shall I just go through
that verbally again?

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.280
I take the x derivative
of this, which gives me

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.620
the cross derivative of s.

00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.260
This asked me to take
the y derivative,

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:06.150
so I get the cross
derivative again.

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:08.240
With the minus sign,
they add to zero.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:13.530
I just want to point
out that also, s

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.690
satisfies Laplace's equation.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:20.960
Can we do that one?

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.090
I claim that also,
the stream function

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:25.510
solves Laplace's equation.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.940
Because we want the x
derivative of ds/dx.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:31.470
So ds/dx is minus this.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.790
Do you see what's happening?

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.480
When I take the x
derivative of ds/dx,

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:41.200
I get minus the cross
derivative of u for this guy.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.430
It's the y derivative
of this, which is

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:45.540
plus the cross derivative of u.

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.890
They cancel.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:50.350
So u and s are just together.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.350
Oh, let's find some solutions.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.900
They're great to find.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.770
And then draw them.

00:17:57.770 --> 00:18:03.290
OK, can I find some solutions
to Laplace's equation.

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.900
And I'm going to
find them in pairs.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.970
So I'm going to have a list
of u's and their corresponding

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:15.840
s's.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.110
OK.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.210
These are solutions to Laplace.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.400
These are, solve
Laplace's equation.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.000
So we've got Laplace's
equation in our minds.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.599
Actually, furthermore,
they solve Cauchy-Riemann.

00:18:29.599 --> 00:18:31.140
Because they're
going to be connected

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.120
by our Cauchy-Riemann equation.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.130
So, solve Laplace
and Cauchy-Riemann.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:40.120
OK.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.650
Suppose I take u(x,y)=x.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.290
I'm going to start
with an easy solution.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.320
That certainly solves
Laplace's equation.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.080
You've got Laplace's
equation in mind?

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.611
Let me write it up here again.

00:18:55.611 --> 00:18:56.110
u_xx+u_yy=0.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.030
I take the chance
to write it again,

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.340
to do it in this little
bit shorter notation,

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.680
just subscripts
instead of partials.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:10.800
And also, s_xx+s_yy=0.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.980
But most of all,
the Cauchy-Riemann

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.220
that connects the two.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:25.880
Well, does u=x solve
Laplace's equation?

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.490
Of course it does.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.640
The second x derivative, if
the function is x, is zero.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.540
And the second y derivative
is very, very zero.

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:37.400
[LAUGHTER] So what's s?

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:40.260
What's the s that goes with it?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.400
It'll be simple, too.

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:47.220
So the s -- so u is x, right?

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.670
I'm starting with this x.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.160
So du/dx is one.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.570
So what do you figure s is?

00:19:55.570 --> 00:20:00.670
If du/dx -- see, u is just x
itself, so du/dx is only a one.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:03.180
That derivative was easy.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.620
Then ds/dy is
supposed to be one,

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:09.590
and ds/dx is supposed
to be zero, I guess.

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:13.380
Do you see what s is? y.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:16.750
S is y. s is y.

00:20:16.750 --> 00:20:19.310
Of course, that solves
Laplace's equation, too,

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:20.890
and it solves Cauchy-Riemann.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.030
The x derivative of this is
the y derivative of that.

00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.390
One equal one.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.550
And the y derivative of that
is minus the x derivative

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:30.480
of that, zero equal zero.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.350
OK, so that's an easy one.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.620
I'm going to go up a level.

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.870
I want to take a second degree.

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.890
So my next guy in the
list will be -- a pair,

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:48.210
it's a list of pairs -- will
be x squared minus y squared.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:50.500
First of all, it better
not be in that list

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.320
unless it solves
Laplace's equation.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.080
And then if it is,
we'll find an s.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.700
So plug it in mentally,
can you plug this

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.180
into Laplace's equation?

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:05.200
What's the second x
derivative of this function?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.720
Two.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.300
Right? xx brings down a two.

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.300
What's the second y derivative?

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.270
Minus two, from this term.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:19.111
And then put them into Laplace's
equation, two minus two.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:19.610
Correct.

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.430
Zero.

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:21.560
All right.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.070
Now I'm looking for the
s that goes with it.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.160
The other one in the pair.

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.490
OK, maybe I'd better
think through what --

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:37.180
so this is supposed to
give me the s, du/dx --

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:45.130
let me copy Cauchy-Riemann here,
so we can just focus entirely

00:21:45.130 --> 00:21:46.440
on that board.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:54.780
So du/dx, this is 2x in my
example. du/dy is minus 2y.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.370
So what am I learning?
ds/dy should be 2x.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:02.500
ds/dx should be 2y.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.600
There are minus
signs on both there.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.180
What's s?

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.220
Do you see s?

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:13.660
The y derivative is 2x,
the x derivative is 2y,

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:21.851
and that stream function is 2xy.

00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:22.350
Right?

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.650
2xy.

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:28.100
Because the x derivative
of this is 2y,

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.230
and the y derivative
of this is 2x.

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:34.520
And we saw 2xy last time also.

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:38.940
And of course, it solves
Laplace's equation easily.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:43.040
Plug that in, the second
derivative is zero.

00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.640
The second x derivative is
zero, second y derivative

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.630
is zero, everything.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.480
So that's a pair.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.560
This is a nice pair.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.240
You want to shoot
for third degree?

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.510
We could maybe figure out third
degree, just by jiggling it.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:06.950
After that, we're
going to need an idea

00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:08.860
to get up to fourth degree.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.310
Let me try third degree.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.100
Cubics, now.

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.470
So I'm looking -- first I just
want to get somebody here.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.260
So it's some x cubed.

00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.110
And then I'm going to need some
more stuff, because x cubed

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:26.360
by itself certainly won't work.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.260
I need something more.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.820
And I want to plug it
into Laplace's equation

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:33.670
and figure out
what should it be?

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:37.590
OK, so when I plug this
into Laplace's equation,

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.710
what do I get?

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:44.240
Let me do Laplace's
equation over here,

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:51.270
to try to get the
u of degree three.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:56.260
So what's u_xx, so far?

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:57.930
6x, right?

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:01.040
Bring down, we've got 3x
squared, then we get 6x,

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.350
so I've got a 6x.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:09.010
And I'm looking for -- so u_yy
should be minus 6x to cancel

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.160
that.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.530
So what do I want there?

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.190
What do I need?

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:19.420
I need a minus,
I'm sure of that.

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:25.370
So the second y derivative
should be this 6x deal.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:29.110
What do I want?

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.550
3xy squared?

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.800
That sounds good.

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:34.250
Let me write it down
and see if it is good.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.940
OK.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.230
The second y derivative.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.140
Yes.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.730
We'll bring down a two, and
then the y's will disappear

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:43.560
and I'll have the minus 6x.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.430
Golden.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.380
OK, that's great.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:48.710
That's great.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.820
Is that correct?

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.500
I mean, it's great,
but is it right?

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.350
Yes.

00:24:52.350 --> 00:24:52.990
Yes.

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:54.100
OK.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:01.020
Now, you have faith that
there's another one?

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.260
Well, yeah, there
is another one.

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:06.570
Cauchy-Riemann
never let us down.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:09.630
There will be an s
that'll go with that,

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.120
that'll solve a
Cauchy-Riemann equation,

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.360
and it'll look like it.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:21.820
And I think, I think -- and I
just sort of reverse x and y

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.900
to get another one, because
if I exchange x and y,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.470
I'm still OK with
Laplace's equation.

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:35.050
I think something like
3yx squared minus y cubed.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:39.000
If that worked, then this
one should work, too.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.310
Because I just switched
x and y, and I think

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.480
it'll work right here.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.450
The second x
derivative will be 6y,

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:52.560
and the second y derivative
will be minus 6y.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.490
I think that's good.

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.720
OK.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.470
Let's put this list
on hold for a moment.

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.990
Something's -- obviously,
there's some pattern here that

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:06.380
we've got to locate.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:08.230
Can I put it on
hold for a moment

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:11.990
and take, for example,
the graph of this one.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:15.140
And I want to draw the pictures.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.020
Before I get a
complete list, I want

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:22.470
to draw the pictures
of these functions.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:24.300
And what do I mean by pictures?

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:31.970
I mean draw the -- so now I'm
taking the u to be x squared

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:36.300
minus y squared,
and the s to be 2xy.

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.720
And I want to draw those, I
want to draw the vector field

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.930
of the gradients of those guys.

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:47.820
OK, so this is the u
-- I want to draw --

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.300
this is the potential x
squared minus y squared.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:54.820
So what are they
equipotential curves?

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.010
So this is now --
I'm drawing the flow.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.100
And to draw the flow, I draw the
curves on which the potential

00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:06.300
is a constant. x squared minus
y squared equal constant.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.230
So what kind of a
curve is x squared

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.740
minus y squared equal constant?

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.360
It's a hyperbola.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.150
It's a hyperbola.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.430
So x squared minus y squared
equal, let's take one,

00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:21.080
for example.

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.910
As one constant.

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:27.940
So x=1 will be on the
curve, when y is zero.

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:30.640
And then what else
will be on the curve?

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:37.620
If x is a little bigger,
like two -- so here's (1, 0).

00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:42.240
That point is certainly -- x
squared minus y squared is one

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.030
for that.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.730
Suppose I go out to x=2.

00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:50.770
What should y be then,
to make this right?

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.250
Where's the curve going?

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:56.310
When x is two, what is y?

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:59.450
Square root of
three, plus or minus.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.930
So square root of three
is something like this,

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.510
up or down.

00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:09.050
It's a curve, like so.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:14.120
It's a hyperbola.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:20.350
And now, if I change
c to four, let's say,

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:26.200
then it'll go through (2,
0), and it'll go up this way.

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:34.700
And if I change x to something
very small, it'll still -- oh,

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.880
there's a Greek
word, asymptotes.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:39.380
Oh, yeah.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.190
What do I get if -- the
asymptote is when this is zero.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.900
Yeah.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.680
When that is zero,
what's my curve?

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:54.100
What are x and y?

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.610
They'll be the same. x
will be y, or minus y.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.100
I'll be on that straight line,
or on this straight line.

00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:04.820
So all these other
hyperbolas are

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:10.270
kind of asymptotic,
whatever the word is.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.600
Right, do you see them?

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:15.310
As a bunch of hyperbolas?

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:23.330
And actually, more
hyperbolas -- well, yeah.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.390
Let's see, back when
I had a one there,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:32.580
I took x and y to be positive,
and I got that hyperbola.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:36.150
But since I'm
squaring them there,

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.470
also these hyperbolas are here.

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:46.650
So these same guys are on
that side of the picture.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.850
Those are the equipotentials.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:55.200
So these are the equipotentials.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.240
OK.

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:03.500
Now, let me draw s.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:08.920
So those will be the equi -- no,
I don't want to say equi-stream

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.430
functions.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.120
That's awkward.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.740
So now, I want to draw s equal
constant, like one or whatever.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.320
So I've drawn this with
a whole lot of constants,

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.780
and now I want to
draw the other guys.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.730
What do those curves look like?

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.380
And what's their name?

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.170
A curve on which the stream
function is a constant

00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:37.220
has a nice name, streamline.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:40.940
So now I'm going to
draw the streamlines.

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.470
And what are the streamlines?

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.640
The streamlines
will be the curves

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.400
that the actual material flows.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:56.630
If you drop a leaf into
this flow, and you watch it,

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:00.070
it'll flow along a streamline.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:02.010
And we can draw those lines.

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.830
So what are those?

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:09.060
2xy=1, or the equation y=1/(2x).

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:11.200
That's also a hyperbola, right?

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.510
That's also a hyperbola.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:18.260
This is a fantastic
picture, in which

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:21.820
we have two sets of hyperbolas.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:25.520
We're second degree, that's why
we're getting two hyperbolas.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:29.650
I'm not going to tackle drawing
-- MATLAB could do it --

00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:33.470
drawing the equipotentials and
the streamlines for this guy.

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:37.570
Oh, but I'm willing
to tackle this one.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:42.980
What are the equipotentials and
the streamlines for the easiest

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:46.260
one in the list, there?

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.530
Can I just draw that one?

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:51.170
Because it makes a point very
clear, that we'll see when

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.100
we draw these.

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:59.170
Okay, so what's the picture,
the corresponding picture?

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.500
Here is the xy-plane again.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:07.930
What are the equipotentials
for this pair?

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:09.960
And the streamlines.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:15.340
The equipotentials are x equal
constant, what are those?

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.680
Those are lines, vertical lines.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:21.120
So the equipotentials
are just vertical lines.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:26.720
Equipotentials, x
equal a constant.

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.130
And what are the streamlines?

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.450
Horizontal lines.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.240
Streamlines go this way.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.110
And what's the great
point about these?

00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:40.610
These are the streamlines,
s equal constant.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:45.730
And of course, what
do you notice here?

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.870
They're perpendicular.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:50.070
The streamlines
are perpendicular

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.400
to the equipotentials.

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.520
And why?

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.780
It's because -- you
remember we talked about,

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.580
what does the gradient mean?

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.320
Which way does the
gradient point?

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.930
It points perpendicular
to these equipotentials.

00:33:04.930 --> 00:33:09.590
And in this case, all these
equipotentials are parallel,

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.780
and the perpendicular
lines are the streamlines,

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.000
and they're all parallel.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.480
Now over here, we haven't
got straight lines.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.260
but we still have
the beautiful figure.

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:24.470
Now I'm ready to tackle it.

00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:26.820
I'll draw these curves.

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:31.690
They're hyperbolas, like y=1/2x.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.560
If I just make that y=1/2x.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:36.780
That's a line that
comes down this way.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.490
Let me try to draw it.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.120
I'll use dashed lines.

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:46.890
Of course, as x gets
bigger, y gets smaller.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:52.990
But y never makes it to
zero, because if y was zero,

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.550
no x would work.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:34:01.550
But if I change that one to to
a four, I've got a bigger --

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.900
this is coming out here.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.390
If I change that to
something very small,

00:34:09.390 --> 00:34:12.230
I'll get one that's coming --

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:17.200
Do you see how
the picture works?

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.670
These are all right angles.

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.850
That's the great thing.

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.240
Right angles.

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:27.950
90 degree angles.

00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:31.660
Between the streamlines
and the equipotentials.

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.740
You may have seen
this before, and now

00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:36.280
I just want to ask you why.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:39.920
Why are those 90 degrees?

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:44.920
We kind of see it physically,
that the gradient --

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.430
the flow is in the
gradient direction.

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:49.750
And we know that
gradients are always

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:54.330
perpendicular to
equipotential lines.

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.990
The gradient of any function
is perpendicular to the level

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:00.440
curves.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.230
That's all we're seeing here.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:08.230
But we're seeing these two
fantastic families of curves.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.060
Equipotentials perpendicular
to the streamline.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.940
And the reason
they're perpendicular

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.750
is Cauchy-Riemann.

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:19.130
Cauchy-Riemann is telling
us they're perpendicular.

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:24.610
Because the gradient
-- yeah, you see that

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:28.460
they're perpendicular, and this
may be overkill to try to give

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.180
a proof.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:39.410
The gradient of u --
what I want to say is,

00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:43.320
the gradient of u is a 90 degree
rotation of the gradient of s.

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.900
Let me put it that way.

00:35:44.900 --> 00:35:49.920
The gradient of s --
the gradient of u,

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:57.180
rotate 90 degrees, rotate
gradient of u by 90 degrees,

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:04.940
pi/2, and you get grad s.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.470
That's what these equations say.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:14.680
That if I take the gradient of u
-- yeah, let me try to do that.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.960
So I take the gradient of u.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.480
That's [du/dx, du/dy].

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:25.270
So if I have a vector
in 2-D, [du/dx, du/dy].

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:30.500
And I want to rotate a
vector by 90 degrees.

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.400
What's the result?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:38.090
Suppose I have a vector [a, b],
and I'm looking to rotate it.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:40.960
What's the vector
that goes that way?

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:47.120
If that vector is [a, b],
that vector should be what?

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.530
You may not have done this,
but it's worth just noticing,

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:52.530
and you won't forget it.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.140
It's got to have a zero
dot product, right?

00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:58.720
So I'm looking for
a vector, here.

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.450
This went out a and up b.

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.130
I'm looking for a
vector there that's

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.350
perpendicular to this vector.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:08.260
So what should it do?

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.360
What am I going to put there?

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.880
A b.

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.330
And what am I going
to put -- oh no.

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:17.480
It went backwards, sorry.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.540
When I put there, I should
have put -- minus b.

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.820
And what goes there? a.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.130
Yeah.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:28.760
That's the perpendicular one.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:29.920
Right?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.940
That's the 90 degree rotation.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.560
And that's what Cauchy-Riemann
is doing for us.

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.490
I take the gradient,
I take this vector.

00:37:38.490 --> 00:37:42.270
Now I rotate by 90 degrees,
means I reverse these,

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.410
reverse the sign, and
I've got the gradient

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:48.400
of S. Or minus
the gradient of S.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:51.480
I won't say whether
the rotation is plus 90

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.110
degrees or minus 90 degrees.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:38:05.250
This can remain an exercise
to see it slowly and clearly.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:07.990
I'm happy if you see it
in the picture there.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:12.740
And of course, you saw
it in this picture, here.

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.220
So this is a moment, then,
to take a little pause.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:21.310
Because we've got ten
minutes for the great event.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.700
We've got the general idea.

00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.400
The u equal constants
and the s equal constant.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:29.360
These two families of
perpendicular curves,

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.560
one telling us where level
sets for the potential,

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.060
the other telling us the
direction of the flow.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.680
The flow goes perpendicular
to the level sets.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.250
It's just wonderful.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:50.540
And now I would like to get the
pattern that's going on here

00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:52.920
and complete that list.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:57.910
OK, well that pattern,
like, comes out of the blue,

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.500
I have to admit.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.800
You might sort of recognize
it, that something -- here is,

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.880
obviously, stuff
to the first power.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.260
Here we've squared
something to get here.

00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.370
Here we've cubed something.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:14.380
You sort of recognize
these numbers, 1 3 3 1,

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:23.200
or one, minus three, whatever.

00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.730
We're taking powers
of something.

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:31.180
And that something is what
comes out of the blue.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.370
It's this quantity, x+iy.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.230
Complex variables.

00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:44.210
Everything here was
real until this moment.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:47.360
And then I'm saying
that the complex number

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:52.150
i, the imaginary number i,
the square root of minus one.

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:56.790
Which of course, it's
not a real number,

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.540
but it has the property,
whenever we see i squared,

00:39:59.540 --> 00:40:00.740
we write minus one.

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.230
So then, we know
how to deal with it.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.020
OK.

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:04.780
Sort of.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:09.080
Anyway, so that complex
number I'll call z.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:14.060
And here's what I think.

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:19.350
I think that these two
pieces are the real

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:24.330
and the imaginary parts of z.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.070
Now, these two
pieces are the real

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:34.350
and the imaginary
parts of z squared.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:38.210
These two pieces
will be the real part

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:42.040
and the imaginary
part of z cubed.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:45.360
And if we check
that, and then we

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.860
begin to see, why should these
satisfy Laplace's equation,

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:50.790
we'll have the whole pattern.

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.601
It'll just be x+iy,
fourth power, fifth power,

00:40:54.601 --> 00:40:55.100
sixth power.

00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:00.720
We can make a complete, infinite
list of pairs of solutions

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.620
to Laplace's equation.

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:09.050
So let me just check what I
said about the squares first.

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:11.302
How do you do x+iy squared?

00:41:11.302 --> 00:41:12.760
Because that's what
I believe we're

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.540
seeing in the quadratic list.

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:23.800
So I claim that if I take x+iy
squared, just do it normally,

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:32.190
I get x squared, and I get 2ixy,
and I get i squared y squared.

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:34.830
Right?

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:39.440
I just squared it, following
normal algebra rules.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.560
Now what's the real part?

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.980
What's the real part of this
x+iy squared? x squared,

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:49.140
this is real.

00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:52.020
And this is real, because
i squared is minus one,

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:55.850
this says minus y
squared, that's our guy.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:42:01.190
And the imaginary part is 2xy.

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:04.220
The imaginary part is the
part that multiplies i.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:13.400
So by some magic -- next time is
the fun of exploring this magic

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.570
-- we get solutions
to a real equation.

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:20.360
We get two solutions
to a real equation,

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:24.500
by working with this
complex thing, x+iy,

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:30.240
and taking things like -- now,
if I go to x+iy cubed, well,

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.340
let me just say it'll work.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:39.670
We'll have -- it's like,
if you cube something,

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.920
you're going to see 1 3 3 1.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:52.320
You'll have an x cubed, and a
3x squared iy, and a 3xiy twice,

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.360
and a one of the iy cubed.

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.010
And then you look to see what
part is real, and you say,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.750
x cubed is real.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:07.240
And i squared is the minus,
so I have minus 3xy squared.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.870
Golden.

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:10.930
And you look for what
part is imaginary,

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:15.090
and you see the 3x squared
y, and you see the i cubed --

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:19.650
so what's i cubed?
-- is minus i.

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:24.650
So that's an imaginary term,
with the minus we wanted.

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:26.720
So now we've got
the whole thing.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.230
We've got solutions
to Laplace's equation,

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:37.650
coming from all the powers.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.350
This is now the
moment to celebrate.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:45.520
Because we've got a
giant family of solutions

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:50.160
to Laplace's equation.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.690
We've got the real parts.

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:57.850
So u is the real part
of x+iy to any power.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:06.420
And s will be the
imaginary part.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:10.700
And I claim that, just as it
held for n equal one, two,

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:15.360
three, for every n,
these will be solutions

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:18.110
to Laplace's equation.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:21.120
Not only that, they'll be
connected by Cauchy-Riemann,

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:31.490
so they'll be the potential and
the stream function for a flow.

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.640
And we've got lots of them.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:39.040
And, why don't we get
even more, because we

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:41.730
have a linear equation here.

00:44:41.730 --> 00:44:44.050
So what are we allowed to
do, if we have solutions

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.620
to a linear
equation, what are we

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.230
allowed to do with
those solutions

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.360
to get more solutions?

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.790
Combine them.

00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:56.500
I can take any
combination of these guys.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.970
I can take "or." "And,"
"or," I don't know which,

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:04.140
should I put "or," "and?"

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:08.070
The real part of any
combination of these.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:13.160
So I could take a combination
of, I can take coefficients

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:22.820
c_k, or c_n, maybe I should
say c_n, (x+iy) to the nth.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:25.800
So if I take a
combination of solutions,

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.760
with coefficient c_n,
I still have solutions.

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:38.410
And what will be the twin
solution, or the stream

00:45:38.410 --> 00:45:40.670
function that goes with this u?

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:45.850
So this is another u, this is
virtually a complete family

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.980
of u.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:51.070
Because we have all these
coefficients to choose.

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:52.410
And what will be the s?

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.360
So what's the
corresponding s, then?

00:45:55.360 --> 00:46:02.940
It's the imaginary part of
-- what? -- the same thing.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:10.190
We're just taking
that same combination

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.840
of the special ones.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:15.030
So the special
ones were (x+iy)^n.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.910
And the combinations are those.

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.510
Yeah.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.600
These are fantastic solutions.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.840
And now, since I'm blessed
with two more minutes,

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:29.460
I get to make them much easier.

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.320
Because already when I got
up to x cubed and y cubed,

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.150
they're looking messy.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.300
You say, okay, great to
have all these solutions,

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:40.560
but how am I going to use them?

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.250
They're getting more and more
complicated as n increases.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:49.160
But switch to polar coordinates.

00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:54.060
Make the same list
in polar coordinates.

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.850
So again, I'm just going
to list the same guys

00:46:56.850 --> 00:47:02.505
in polar coordinates r, theta.

00:47:02.505 --> 00:47:03.880
Then you'll see
the pattern, then

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:05.660
the pattern really jumps out.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:10.500
So what is x in
polar coordinates?

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:14.620
If I switch from x, y,
rectangular coordinates, to r,

00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:20.330
theta, polar coordinates,
x is r*cos(theta).

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:25.510
And y is r*sin(theta).

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:30.360
Well, so far it doesn't look
any easier. x and y look fine.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:36.290
But let me go to the second one.

00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:41.180
So this is now r squared
cos squared theta, right?

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:48.000
Minus, this is r squared
sine squared theta.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.590
Trigonometry comes in.

00:47:51.590 --> 00:47:53.520
I have r squared
cos squared theta,

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.580
minus r squared sine squared
theta, I want to simplify that.

00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:02.230
So it's got an r
squared, and it's got

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.910
a cos squared theta
minus sine squared theta.

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.950
Anybody remember
that? cos(2theta)!

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.980
And this one.

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.830
Well, what do you
think is coming?

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:19.520
What do you think
is coming here?

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.940
I have 2r*cos(theta)
times r*sin(theta).

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:27.250
I have two, I've got
an r squared, again,

00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.460
times 2cos(theta)*sin(theta).

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.380
So what's
2cos(theta)*sin(theta)?

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:34.460
sin(2theta).

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:36.790
You get it. sin(2theta).

00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:41.670
And you know what's
coming next, right?

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:46.160
You know that now, the whole
family in polar coordinates --

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:50.590
what's the nth power?

00:48:50.590 --> 00:48:53.020
We can now write down
the nth one in this list.

00:48:53.020 --> 00:49:04.620
It is r^n -- for the nth
pair, r^n times cos(n*theta),

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:09.960
and r^n sin(n*theta).

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:16.530
So those are the
twins, the u and the s

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:21.960
that we get if we use
polar coordinates.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.640
So that's just terrific.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.280
Now we have a whole
lot of solutions

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.100
to Laplace's equation.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:31.710
And we have, don't forget,
all combinations of them.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.780
And we're really ready to go.

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:41.220
So Friday we'll be solving
Laplace's equation in the cases

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:45.720
that we can do it, by
pencil and paper, by chalk.

00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:48.990
And then, after that, comes
solving Laplace's equation

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.627
by finite differences
and finite elements.

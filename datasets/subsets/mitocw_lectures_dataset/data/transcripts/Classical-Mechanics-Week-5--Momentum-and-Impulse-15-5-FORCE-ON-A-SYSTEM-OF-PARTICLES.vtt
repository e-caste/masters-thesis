WEBVTT

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.950
Now we'd like to
analyze in more depth

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.900
our result that for a
system of particles--

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.780
so let's indicate our system.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.730
We had particle 1.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.650
We have our jth particle.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.500
And we have a
particle N. So here's

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.780
our system of particles
where the total force caused

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:28.010
the momentum of the system
of particles to change.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, I'd like to examine that
concept of the total force.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.620
Before we said that our total
force on the jth particle--

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.870
we just wrote it like this.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.630
And I'm going to put a little
t up here for the moment.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.070
Because when we examine
what force we mean here--

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.580
and I also want to put a little
boundary around our system.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.460
And let's now consider
another particle

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.910
internal to the system.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.230
And let's try to
identify the types

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.390
of forces on the jth particle.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.200
We can really have two
types of forces here.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.270
Our first force can be an
interaction between these two

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.450
particles.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.110
So what I'll write is the
force on the jth particle

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.079
due to the interaction between
the k and the jth particle.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.870
And I'm going to put
a little sign up here.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.660
I'm going to write
this internal.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.490
What do I mean by internal?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.479
This is a force strictly
between the internal particles

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:33.600
in the system.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.870
Now, of course,
we know that there

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.460
must be a force on
the kth particle

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.390
due to the interaction between
the jth and the kth particle.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.810
And we can call that internal.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.220
So what we have
here is that we can

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.420
divide-- there can still be
other forces acting on the jth

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.350
particle.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.060
And we'll do a
decomposition like this.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.030
We'll say that the total
force on the jth particle

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.990
can come from some
external forces.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.800
There could be an object
outside our system.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.050
If these were interacting
gravitationally,

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.150
there could be a
planet outside here.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.590
And this could be a moon.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.630
And our system is
just the moons.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.360
That would be an external
gravitational force,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.960
plus the total internal forces.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.170
So I'm going to keep
this same color.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.079
Internal on the jth particle.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.140
Now how do we write this
total internal force?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.260
Well, we're interested in the
force on the jth particle.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.400
But the internal forces can come
from all of the other particles

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.820
in the system.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:54.140
So what we're looking at
here is for a sum over all

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.110
of the possible interactions
where the other particles, k,

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.800
go from 1 to N. And we have
to be very careful here that

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.780
in this sum k cannot
be equal to j.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.910
Now this sum-- again, because
it's a little bit tricky

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.800
to understand-- is the internal
force on the jth particle.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.110
Here's the kth one.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.329
But this could be a sum.

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.340
I'll just draw one here.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.220
This is the internal
force on the jth particle

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.400
due to particle number 1.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.740
And so we're adding
as k goes from 1 to N

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.660
all of these internal forces.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.190
But we're excluding
the case when

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.560
k equals j, because
that would be

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.840
a force of an object on itself.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.120
And this quantity
here, we can write

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.180
as the total internal
force on the jth particle.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.800
So in summary, we see that the
total force on the jth particle

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.640
is equal to the total
external forces.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.140
I didn't say total there.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.800
I'm assuming there could
be many different types

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.930
of internal forces plus
the total internal force.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.900
A little bit later on,
we can drop the T's

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.990
for simplicity of notation.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:22.100
But this is our big idea, that
a force on the jth particle,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.530
external plus internal.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.490
And now when we
look at this sum,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.720
and we want to now
apply our main idea,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:41.360
we have that the force, which
we're writing as-- let's

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.120
explore this.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.210
Our total force is the sum of
the forces on the jth particle.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.120
And we've now done
this decomposition.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.040
I'm going to drop total.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.550
So it's the sum of the external
forces on the jth particle.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.310
j goes from 1 to N.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:15.930
And here, we have a sum
of the internal forces.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.230
So we have our sum j.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:25.149
It goes from 1 to N of the
internal forces on the jth

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.648
particle.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.940
Now we want to apply
Newton's second law.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.760
And the concept is
very straightforward.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.720
But the mathematical expression
can be a little bit messy.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.880
We know by Newton's
second law that the sum

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.690
of a pair of internal
forces is zero-- third law,

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.320
by Newton's third law.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.840
So what we're saying
here is, as an example,

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.120
for Newton's third
law-- let's just focus

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:12.230
on this particular pair-- that
F internal kj plus F internal jk

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.750
is zero.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:20.880
So this is the statement
that internal forces

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.950
cancel in pairs.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.390
And so when I look at this
total internal force, which

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.950
is the sum of all of these
pairs of internal forces,

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:45.240
I can see that the total
internal force has to be zero.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.830
So internal force
cancel in pairs.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.400
Now here, we can see
it another way if we

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.080
want to look at this notation.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.960
We took the sum.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.710
j goes from 1 to
N of F internal j.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:04.770
Now we use our definition
for F internal.

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.160
This where things get
a little bit messy.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:13.140
k goes from 1 to N.
k not equal to j.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:20.220
j goes from 1 to
N. F internal kj.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.290
This looks terribly messy.

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:29.820
But what we're saying is this
sum is just a sum of pairs.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.850
And every single pair
in this adds to 0.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.520
So what we have for
our statement now

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.710
is that the total force is the
sum of the external forces,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.080
plus the sum of
the internal forces

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.480
which we've now said
that cancels in pairs.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.110
So let's rewrite that as the
total force-- now instead

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:57.390
of writing this
sum, let's write it

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:02.340
as the sum of the
external forces.

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:06.790
And the internal
forces cancel in pairs.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:11.610
And so this is now our
force on our system.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.270
It's only the external force.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.540
And now we can recast
our Newton's second law

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:22.050
for a system of particles
with the following statement

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:28.740
that the external force causes
the momentum of the system

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.270
to change.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:36.840
And this becomes our expression
for Newton's second law

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:39.690
when we apply it to
a system of particles

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.000
where the beauty of this idea is
that no matter how complicated

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.850
the interaction is
inside the system,

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:51.870
all of those interactive
pairs sum to zero.

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:56.310
And so only thing that
matters is the external force

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.060
in terms of changing the
momentum of the system.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.290
And now we'll look at
some applications of that.

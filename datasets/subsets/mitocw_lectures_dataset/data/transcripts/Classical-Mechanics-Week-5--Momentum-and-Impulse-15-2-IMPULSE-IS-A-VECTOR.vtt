00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.580
We would now like to use
Newton's second law to relate

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.630
impulse to change in momentum.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.900
So again, let's
look at our set up.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.560
We have an object
m, a velocity V,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.150
and, let's say, here the
picture as t initial.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.230
And we have some
initial velocity.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.700
And then a little bit later
in time, we have time t final.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.070
The moment the
velocity has changed.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.729
And that's because throughout
this time interval,

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.860
we're applying an impulse.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.500
We can call this
the i hat direction.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.460
Now recall that our
definition of impulse,

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.440
it's a vector quantity.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.110
It's equal to the
integral of the force.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.300
Now when I write force
of t, I mean force

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.280
as a function of time.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.410
And that's our dummy
variable t prime.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.920
It's not force times time, but
force is a function of time.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.860
And we're integrating
from the initial

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.800
to the final time period.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.400
Now here's where
we use the second--

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.880
the version of
Newton's second law,

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.690
which is that force causes
the momentum of an object

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.000
to change.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.500
So we can write this integral t
prime t initial, t prime equals

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.050
t final of dp dt.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.350
I'll just make a
note that we've now

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.960
applied Newton's second
law, and because we're using

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.490
our dummy variable dt prime

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.259
And you can see that the
two dt primes cancel.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.470
And this just
becomes the integral

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.780
from t initial t prime
to t final of dp.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.720
And this is a pure differential.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.870
And so we end up with impulse
is the momentum at t final minus

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.280
the momentum at t initial.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.960
Now recall, this is
a vector integral.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.420
But a vector integral is
just three separate intervals

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.700
for each component.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.290
So each component of impulse
satisfies this equation.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.450
For instance, the x
component of impulse

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.710
is how the x component of
momentum is changing in time.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.170
Now generally, when we
write a final momentum

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.430
in our final state minus the
momentum during initial state,

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.760
we can call this the
change in momentum.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.800
So down here, we would have
change in the x direction.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.079
And so in conclusion, we
now have an integral way

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.410
of casting Newton's second law.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.260
We have that impulse
causes momentum to change.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.840
And so we can see that
the si units of impulse

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.020
are the same as the
si units of momentum,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.140
which we saw before was
kilogram meter inverse seconds.

WEBVTT

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.580
ADAM MARTIN: And so I just
want to say a couple sentences

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.610
about DNA sequencing,
just to finish that up.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.870
And so you'll remember this
slide from last lecture.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:35.630
And remember, the way this
Sanger technique works

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.450
is to set up four
different reactions where

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.120
each reaction has
a different one

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.970
of these dideoxynucleotides.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.120
OK, so there's four
reactions, each

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.760
with different dideoxy NTP.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.830
And I brought along a gel
that I ran a while ago,

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.460
which is basically-- it's from
sequencing gel, and you can--

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.550
I'll pass this around so
you can take a look at it.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.650
So the four different
lanes for each sample

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.300
are the different
dideoxynucleotide reactions.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.570
And what I want you to notice
as that's passing around

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.780
and you're looking at it is
that the different reactions

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
with the different
dideoxynucleotides

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.500
give different patterns
of DNA fragment lengths.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.140
So there are different
patterns of fragment lengths.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.950
And the different patterns
are based on the fact--

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.000
this is based on the sequence,
the sequence of the template,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.500
OK?

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.190
And so if we look at the
example up here, what you'll see

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.900
is that in this banding
pattern for dideoxy TTP,

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.900
you see that there's a really
short fragment at the bottom

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.830
there, and so that fragment
indicates that there must be

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.620
an A in the template sequence.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.240
The next fragment up would be
this one in the dideoxy GTP

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.610
lane, and that indicates that
one nucleotide beyond this A

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.120
is a C position, and
so on and so forth,

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.270
such that you can sort
of order the fragments

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.630
and see which reaction
has a fragment

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.110
and then read off
a DNA sequence.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.880
OK, so conceptually,
that's how you

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.150
would read off the sequence
of a given strand of DNA, OK?

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.720
So you might be wondering,
if now, we just read off

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.160
sequence as a series of colors,
why am I even introducing

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.510
this technique?

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.160
And the reason is
because I think

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.730
it's important for you as
potentially future scientists

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.870
to know that when you're
faced with a problem,

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.480
how you might discover
something new.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.540
And I see the
Sanger method of DNA

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.250
sequencing as a really
clever and elegant way

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.510
in which Fred Sanger solved
the problem of DNA sequencing,

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.710
and while we don't necessarily
do it that way today, it still

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.500
illustrates a concept
that's important,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.020
the concept of
chain termination,

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.260
and I think there is something
to be learned from this older

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.900
technique, even if
it's not exactly how we

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.750
sequence DNA today.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.020
So for today's
lecture, we're going

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.300
to continue on our quest to
basically clone a gene that's

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.935
responsible for a disease.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.960
And so we started this
in the last lecture.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.930
And I guess one
thing we would want

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.120
to start with is
a disease, so I'm

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.860
going to introduce to you now
a disease called aniridia.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:23.720
And in order to clone
the gene for a disease,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.320
it has to be a
heritable disease,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.590
in this case, because we're
going to use linkage analysis

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.420
to identify it.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.250
So aniridia is a disease that's
an eye disease in humans.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.800
It's a rare eye disease.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.020
So I want to show you a bit of
an example of this eye disease.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.180
The way this disease
manifests itself

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.930
is it's basically the
affected individual

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.380
has an eye that is
lacking an iris.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.230
So I'm going to show you
what this looks like.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.950
If you're squeamish or
don't like weird eyes

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.320
and you don't want to
look, you can look away.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.150
But I will show you affected
phenotype in 3, 2, 1, OK,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.910
everyone looking who
wants to see weird eyes.

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.860
OK, good.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.970
So that is a individual that
has aniridia, and also this one.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.750
So you see there's no
clear iris in these eyes.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:25.470
And this disease is associated
with other abnormalities

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.550
of the eye that
severely impair vision.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.940
And this is an
inherited disease,

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.580
and this is a
pedigree from a family

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.600
or series of families where
the disease is propagating.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.720
And so anyone have a suggestion
as to what mode of inheritance

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.220
this is?

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.450
Anyone want to rule a mode out?

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.010
Rachel, you have an idea?

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.416
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say X-linked dominant,

00:06:00.416 --> 00:06:07.890
but [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.940
ADAM MARTIN: OK, so let's
take X-linked dominant.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.950
So if it was X-linked
dominant, then this male

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.950
would have an X chromosome
with the dominant allele

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:24.840
of the disease and should
only pass it to his females.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.880
So I don't think that
it would necessarily

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.350
be X-linked dominant.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.967
Anyone else have an idea?

00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:31.550
Yeah, Georgia?

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:32.690
AUDIENCE: Autosomal.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.130
ADAM MARTIN: Autosomal dominant.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:37.200
I like autosomal dominant.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.860
So in this case,
you see you have

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.440
an individual with
the disease and they

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.262
marry into a family with
no history of the disease.

00:06:46.262 --> 00:06:48.470
One thing I'll point out,
for many of these diseases,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:52.970
they're extremely rare, so if
you see sort of a family tree

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.820
where there's no
instance of the disease,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.920
if it's a rare
disease, it's likely

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.660
that these individuals
are not carriers.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.270
And so in this case, if you
assume that this person doesn't

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.750
have any form of the--

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.550
isn't a carrier for
the disease, then this

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.980
cross here resulting
in about half

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.710
of the individuals affected
with the disease, that

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.790
would be a characteristic of
an autosomal dominant disease.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:21.470
So everyone understand my logic?

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:22.190
Yes, Carlos?

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.897
AUDIENCE: What are--
why is two and that

00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:27.230
looks like three on the slide,
why are they crossed out?

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.300
ADAM MARTIN: I think
they're deceased.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.800
Yes.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.120
OK, so let's say
you have a pedigree.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:42.930
You have pedigrees, you're able
to try to link this marker to--

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.480
or the disease phenotype with
various molecular markers,

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:49.560
which we discussed in
last week's lectures,

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:55.260
then you're on the
way to performing

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:58.740
a process which is known
as positional gene cloning.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:04.470
And what positional
gene cloning is

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.000
is it's basically cloning
a gene and a allele that's

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.710
responsible for a disease based
on its position in the genome,

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:18.000
it's position in a particular
chromosomal region.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:25.740
So it's basically
cloning a gene based

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:31.920
on its chromosomal position
or its chromosome position.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:42.030
And the first step of
positional gene cloning

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.900
would be to establish maybe
what chromosome it's on.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.970
And a straightforward way to
do this, as we've basically

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.420
been discussing almost from
when I started lecturing,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.700
is to create some
sort of linkage

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.220
map or do linkage
mapping to identify,

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:06.160
in the case of humans, molecular
markers that this disease

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.160
allele is linked to.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.930
And remember, in
last week's lecture,

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.530
we talked about a number
of different polymorphisms

00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:22.410
that are present
in the human genome

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:28.050
that we can use to establish
linkage with a given phenotype.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.920
In this case, it's
a human disease.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:35.280
And we talked about this example
for a microsatellite marker.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.630
And in this case, we
talked through this example

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.290
of how this dominant
allele, P, is linked

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:47.010
to this microsatellite
allele m double prime,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.070
because if you look
at the pedigree here,

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:54.000
all of the affected
individuals here

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.090
contain this m double
prime sized fragment

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:00.030
for this microsatellite.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.220
Another thing to
notice here is you

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.510
can see that this couple has
been faithful to each other,

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:09.240
because basically,
each of the children

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:13.050
have an allele from the father
and an allele from the mother.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:16.500
So you can see that type of--

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:22.590
you can see that using this type
of molecular marker as well.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:24.880
OK, so you establish linkage.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:30.820
So linkage mapping establishes
the chromosome position

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.890
of a given allele and the gene.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.310
And this chromosome
position sort of

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.340
gets maybe in the right
country, but you still

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:47.370
have a long way before you get
to the specific street address.

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:49.720
And so you have to then
sort of narrow it in

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:54.580
to identify a smaller region
of the chromosome that could

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.730
possibly contain this gene.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:02.140
And so what you would do is go
from this linkage map, where

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.520
you maybe identify the position
of this gene within a couple

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.840
map units, to this
next resolution of map

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:14.390
called a physical map, OK?

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.210
So we go from the
linkage position

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.430
to the physical map
of the chromosome.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.810
And the physical map,
as the name implies,

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:31.040
is when you have
physical pieces of DNA

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:36.260
that are present in this
region of the chromosome.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.510
So the physical
map means you have

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.530
cloned, so recombinant
pieces of DNA,

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:49.220
cloned pieces of DNA which
encompass a given chromosome

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:50.520
region.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:58.150
So these are encompassing
a chromosome region.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:10.910
OK, so how would you
get a piece of DNA

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.560
that sort of is in this region?

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.790
How would you start?

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:17.870
How would you start
fishing for that DNA?

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.910
So you've gone through
the process of linkage,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.200
you've identified sort
of a polymorphism that is

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.330
linked to the disease allele.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:35.650
How would you go from there to
getting a physical piece of DNA

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:41.690
that is present in that
region of the chromosome?

00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:43.720
So let's think back to--

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.760
Jeremy, did you have an idea?

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:52.388
AUDIENCE: Start by using PCR
to just amplify that chunk.

00:12:52.388 --> 00:12:55.800
[INAUDIBLE]

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.597
ADAM MARTIN: And what
primers, I guess,

00:12:57.597 --> 00:12:58.680
would you use for the PCR?

00:13:01.902 --> 00:13:05.600
AUDIENCE: Depending on which
chunk you're trying to get,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.740
you'd use [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:11.240
ADAM MARTIN: OK,
so Jeremy is saying

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:14.150
if you knew the
sequence, and I guess

00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:18.800
if you're doing this
microsatellite analysis,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.310
you had primers that recognize
a sequence at a given

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:25.100
genomic position, so you
actually know something

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:29.060
about the sequence because
of this polymorphism,

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:34.730
so you can use that knowledge
to then look for this sequence.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.040
And you could even look for
the microsatellite in a DNA

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.540
library.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.780
OK, so you have
cloned pieces of DNA,

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.650
and you're going to start with--

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:49.880
I'm going to swap this.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.470
Your starting
position could be one

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.200
of these polymorphisms in
the sequence around it,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.500
which you already know.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.140
So let's say you had this
microsatellite marker.

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:07.810
You could then--
what I'm drawing here

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:10.610
is a piece of genomic DNA.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.805
So this is genomic DNA.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.480
I'm just drawing the insert.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.430
This would be recombinant DNA.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.150
It would be present in
some vector or plasmid.

00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:28.090
But if you can identify
the sequence that

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.770
contains this
microsatellite marker,

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:36.610
then you would have the
microsatellite, but also

00:14:36.610 --> 00:14:39.190
the surrounding DNA, OK?

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:43.000
So that sort of anchors
you at a given position.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.240
Now, you don't know if your
gene is in that piece of DNA,

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.190
but you know that
it's linked, and so it

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:52.270
should be around that
piece of DNA somewhere.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:55.640
And so it's unlikely
your gene is

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.460
going to be on this small
piece of DNA that's cloned.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.350
This is probably just a
few kb, and you could still

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:04.750
be very far away
from this, but that

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:08.230
serves as a starting point
from which you can go from

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:10.780
to get more and
more pieces of DNA

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:13.330
such that eventually, you
have a bunch of pieces of DNA

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:16.650
that are going to span
the entire region.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:21.130
So the way you identify
other pieces of DNA is you

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:26.170
could start with a piece of DNA
maybe at the end of this insert

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.510
and look for other
inserts that are not

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:33.800
identical to this piece that
also contain this piece here.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.680
So that might get
you a piece that's

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:41.050
overlapping, but extends
farther than your initial piece.

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:43.600
So now you've moved
slightly farther away

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.650
from your starting point, which
is this starting polymorphism.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.950
Then you could choose maybe
another DNA sequence here

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:56.280
and look for a piece
of DNA that, again,

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.740
is extending a bit farther out.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.350
And so you can see
how iteratively,

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.710
you can get farther and farther
away from this starting point

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:07.540
that you know your
gene is linked to.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.280
And this process of going
sort piece by piece and clone

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.700
by clone away from
a starting position

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.530
is known as a chromosome walk.

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.570
And you can do this
bidirectionally.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.360
So you could also start
with a sequence of DNA

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:32.230
here and look for a clone
that goes the other way.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:38.350
And you can see on
my slide up there,

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.960
you can see that in
this case, they've

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.290
taken a one map unit
region of the chromosome

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:48.610
and they're illustrating
physical pieces of DNA that

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:52.750
are overlapping that
encompass this entire region.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.440
So this could be much bigger
than the amount of DNA that

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:59.380
would fit in one of these
clones in the bacteria,

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:02.740
but by sort of identify
overlapping clones,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.839
you get the entire region.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:09.880
And what this is called here,
because these pieces of DNA

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.289
are contiguous with each other,
this is known as a contig.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.900
Yeah, Jeremy?

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.790
AUDIENCE: So would
how you get the--

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.590
once you find one
of those pieces,

00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:29.864
how do you get the primer
for the end of it to start?

00:17:29.864 --> 00:17:32.170
Do you actually sequence
each of these pieces of DNA?

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:33.340
ADAM MARTIN: You
could sequence it,

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.960
or you could use a
technique that I'm

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:37.300
going to talk about at the
end of my lecture, which

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.980
I'll come back to.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.190
So nowadays, you'd probably just
sequence it and then maybe look

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.520
for that in another clone.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:50.260
But even before we could
sequence DNA in entire genomes,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.840
you could do that
type of experiment

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:55.040
by using a technique
called hybridization,

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.150
which I'll come back to.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:02.480
OK, so the question in this
chromosome walk then becomes,

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.260
how do you know when to stop?

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:08.290
Because you could do this
for a very long time,

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.950
but it might not be useful.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.400
So you have to
know when to stop,

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.760
and you need to know when
you arrive at the gene

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:18.340
that you're interested in,
which would be the gene that

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.155
is responsible for the disease.

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:25.300
So another way to
phrase this question is,

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.960
how do you know when you have
an interesting gene on one

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.980
of these fragments?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:34.660
So let's say this is an
interesting gene here.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.760
How do you identify
interesting genes?

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.695
So now, let's talk about
identifying interesting genes.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.770
Anyone have an idea
for how they would--

00:18:55.770 --> 00:19:00.040
what criteria they would use
to define a gene as being

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:00.910
interesting here?

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.780
I mean, one could say that
all genes are interesting.

00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.450
If it's a gene, it's
interesting, right?

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:20.770
How might we define whether or
not there's a gene even there?

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.680
It could be-- there
could be a gene--

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:25.490
how would you define a gene?

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.130
Can someone define
for me a gene?

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:32.630
Yeah, Miles?

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:33.940
Is it Miles?

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:35.590
No?

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.590
Malik, OK.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:43.652
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] that would
create a starting and stopping

00:19:43.652 --> 00:19:44.576
point.

00:19:44.576 --> 00:19:47.617
So like [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:47.617 --> 00:19:49.700
ADAM MARTIN: So you'd look
for a piece of DNA that

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.120
has a start and a stop codon?

00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.970
So you'd look for an open
reading frame, basically.

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.840
Yeah.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.970
You could look for an
open reading frame.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.660
And so I totally agree
with Malik there.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.300
And another criteria
you could use

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.450
is if it's encoding a
protein, at some point,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.500
it also must have been
transcribed as an mRNA.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.150
And there are some genes
that are transcribed as RNA

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:21.980
but don't make a protein,
and they're often

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:27.560
involved in coding or in
regulation of gene expression.

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:28.730
So I'm going to--

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:32.460
I'm going to say,
is it transcribed?

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:37.420
So is there some
transcript that's made?

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.700
And specifically, is it
transcribed in the tissue

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:41.870
that we're interested in?

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.790
So if we're talking
aniridia, we might

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:53.750
be looking for genes that are
being expressed or transcribed

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:57.325
specifically in eyes.

00:20:57.325 --> 00:20:58.700
You're looking
for something that

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:00.770
might be expressed in the eye.

00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:02.990
If it's not
expressed in the eye,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.390
that gene's going to be
much less interesting to you

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.900
because the phenotype of
aniridia is clearly in the eye.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.680
OK, what might be some
other criteria here?

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.120
Well, one criteria might be,
is there a conserved gene that

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.070
has an interesting
function that's

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:25.750
maybe similar to the
disease related phenotype?

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:39.535
So is there a conserved gene
with an interesting function?

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:51.600
And to take this
example of aniridia,

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.570
let's say you're doing
this chromosome walk,

00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:56.580
and you identify
a gene, maybe you

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.630
sequence part of this clone,
you get a string of sequence,

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.450
and you realize that the
sequence that you get

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:08.280
is related to a gene
from a model organism,

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:12.930
and maybe that gene
is called eyeless.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:18.000
If you've identified a region
of sequence in a human,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.560
in the human genome that's
mapping to an eye disease gene,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.540
and you find out
that in that region,

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.080
there is a conserved
gene called eyeless,

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.840
might be a very
interesting gene for you.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:32.670
So eyeless is a gene.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:34.500
So here's a normal fly.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.670
You see it has that
bright red eye.

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.430
The eyeless gene,
when mutated, results

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:44.460
in a fly that now just
doesn't have a white eye,

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:48.120
but has no eye altogether.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.810
So it turns out that the
aniridia gene is the homolog

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.520
of the eyeless gene in flies.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.240
That's not how it was
identified initially,

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.810
but nowadays, there's a lot of
information in model organisms.

00:23:01.810 --> 00:23:05.580
And so if you're sort of
trying to identify a gene,

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.010
and you see that there's
a gene in the neighborhood

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:11.610
you're looking at
with a function that's

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:15.630
related to a gene
like eyeless, which

00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:18.960
has a clear sort of analogy
in terms of phenotypes,

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:21.540
then that's going to increase
your interest in that gene.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.840
So I'm going to come
back to this point

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.710
here, which is how
do we determine

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:35.640
whether a piece of DNA that's
on one of these inserts

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.340
that we're getting as we
walk across the chromosome,

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:42.990
how do we know whether
it is transcribed or not?

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:44.940
And to get at this, I'm
going to introduce you

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.940
to a concept which
is important in

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:54.230
and of itself, which
is the idea of cDNA.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:55.850
So cDNA.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:57.650
And specifically,
I'm going to show you

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:02.240
how one would make a cDNA
library, which is basically

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.180
a library of different cDNAs.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:09.640
And so what cDNA is, as
shown up there on my slide,

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:14.165
a cDNA is complementary DNA.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.730
It's complementary DNA,
meaning that is the complement

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.210
of an mRNA transcript.

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:40.990
This DNA is the complement
of an RNA or mRNA transcript.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:54.170
One thing to watch out for is
it's not complimentary DNA.

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:56.180
So this is MIT.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:59.780
This is a no compliment
zone, so I don't want

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.745
to see any complimentary DNA.

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:10.030
All right, so let's think
about complementary DNA.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:14.860
So remember, we've talked
about the central dogma

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:20.545
and how DNA encodes for RNA,
which encodes for protein.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.600
And so the information
flows from DNA

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:30.150
through RNA to protein.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.990
But there are some
specialized cases in biology

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:37.950
where this information
flow is reversed.

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:42.210
So there can be a reverse
of information flow

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:45.405
where information
flows from RNA to DNA.

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.220
OK, so that's pretty cool.

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.090
Where does that happen?

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:56.700
Well, there are viruses,
such as retroviruses,

00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:03.990
one example of a retrovirus
is HIV, and the virus life--

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:08.490
the virus genome is a
single-stranded RNA molecule,

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:14.040
and the life cycle of the virus
is that inserts into the host--

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.100
the host genome, which
is double-stranded DNA.

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:21.420
For a retrovirus to do that,
it needs to take its RNA genome

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.590
and make double-stranded DNA
in order for it to insert.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:29.220
So this is an example in
biology, which is basically

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.100
breaking the rules that we
talked to you about earlier

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.990
in the semester.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:37.860
Also, there are
retrotransposons which

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.630
do a similar process,
going from an RNA molecule

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.610
to double-stranded DNA.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:48.010
So this is a specialized
case, and it's interesting,

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:54.570
and we can take advantage of it
to basically clone and identify

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:56.010
mRNA transcripts.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.110
OK, so I'm going to tell you
how to make complementary DNA,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:07.060
and I'll go through
a series of steps.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:13.320
The first step is we want to
make complementary DNA of mRNA,

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.405
so we need a way
to purify the mRNA.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.750
So anyone have any idea
how to purify mRNA?

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.170
First, we could maybe
draw an RNA molecule here.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:31.020
What are some salient
features of mature mRNA?

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:31.565
Yeah, Carlos?

00:27:31.565 --> 00:27:33.273
AUDIENCE: It'll have
the five-prime cap

00:27:33.273 --> 00:27:34.190
[INAUDIBLE] phosphate.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.230
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah, it'll
have a five-prime cap.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.290
Anything else?

00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:37.790
Jeremy?

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:38.580
AUDIENCE: Poly-A tail.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.247
ADAM MARTIN: It'll
have a five-prime cap

00:27:40.247 --> 00:27:41.480
and a poly-A tail.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.600
I'm going to take advantage
mostly of the poly-A tail here.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.580
So here, we have a poly-A tail.

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:55.660
OK, how might we use that
poly-A tail to purify mRNA?

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:56.160
Natalie?

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.663
AUDIENCE: Well, you
can add a [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:58.663 --> 00:28:00.507
because you know
they're [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.507 --> 00:28:01.340
ADAM MARTIN: Mm-hmm.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.975
What sequence would you use?

00:28:02.975 --> 00:28:03.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:04.558
ADAM MARTIN: Yes.

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:09.550
So Natalie has suggested
using poly T, which

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:13.480
she said would stick to
this poly A tail because

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:17.050
of base pair hybridization, OK?

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:22.690
So let's say we have a bead
or some type of resin with dTs

00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:25.450
hanging off of it.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:27.190
So I'll draw a few
of them, but you'd

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:34.060
have maybe a lot of
them sticking off, OK?

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.360
So you have a bead with
pieces of DNA, all of which

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.940
are poly dT hanging off of it.

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:46.120
And then these poly dTs, if
you add cytoplasm from cells,

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.710
the mRNA in that cytoplasm is
going to stick to this poly dT

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:55.540
bead, and it will
stick with a higher

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.660
affinity than other things that
are non specifically sticking

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.770
to the beads, and you can
wash these beads with buffer

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:05.350
and salt to get rid
of everything that's

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.660
non-specifically
sticking to the bead,

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.870
and then you're left
with just a bead that's

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.750
enriched with mRNA, which
is what was specifically

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:15.760
sticking to this, OK?

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:16.705
So you could purify--

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:36.750
you're purifying the mRNA based
on its affinity for a poly dT,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.250
OK?

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:42.170
So then you're going
to have enrichment

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:45.940
of mRNA in your sample.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:51.270
And so then once
you have your RNA,

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:55.150
you're going to want to
somehow go from RNA to DNA, OK?

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:04.710
So the next step will involve
somehow going from RNA to DNA.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:07.020
So let's draw our
piece of RNA here.

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:08.150
Here's our RNA.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:10.320
It has a poly A
tail so it's mRNA.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.095
There is 5 prime.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:22.840
OK, so now we need to
take advantage of a trick.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:26.050
We can still take
advantage of dT

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:29.080
because we can use
this as a primer

00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:32.310
because polymerase
usually requires

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:38.410
some primer and a three prime
hydroxyl in order to extend.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:43.450
Now, can we use DNA polymerase
to extend this primer?

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:44.880
Jeremy is shaking his head no.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.380
Why?

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:51.040
AUDIENCE: Because
DNA [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:52.460
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.400
So what Jeremy is
saying is DNA polymerase

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:59.120
is a DNA dependent
DNA polymerase, OK?

00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:03.680
DNA polymerase can only use
this if this is DNA here, OK?

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.460
So we need a different type
of enzyme, essentially,

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:13.640
in order to make DNA
from RNA, and luckily,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.500
molecular biologists--

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.960
actually one of whom
was here at MIT--

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:20.540
discovered this type
of enzyme, and it's

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.320
called reverse transcriptase.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:27.170
Reverse transcriptase.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:32.420
This is an enzyme that's
encoded by retroviruses in order

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:36.440
to make double
stranded DNA from RNA,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:40.130
and that allows the retrovirus
to insert into the host genome,

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.240
OK?

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:47.150
And what reverse transcriptase
is is it's an RNA dependent DNA

00:31:47.150 --> 00:31:48.140
polymerase, OK?

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:51.060
So it takes RNA
as its substrate,

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:57.020
and then it synthesizes DNA
on the opposite strand, OK?

00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:05.222
So this is an RNA
dependent DNA polymerase.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.950
OK, so if you add
reverse transcriptase

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:18.800
to mRNAs that have these dT
primers, then what you get

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.310
is a new strand,
which is DNA here.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.570
This is the strand of DNA.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:33.800
And then you have a strand
of RNA opposite it, OK?

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.290
So at this step, you
have a DNA RNA hybrid.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:42.860
So this is a DNA RNA hybrid.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:49.590
Let's see.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.140
Reveal some more of this.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.030
This is the process
which I'm basically

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.230
outlining on the board.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.860
So then you want
double stranded DNA,

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.070
so you don't want this strand
of RNA that's down here,

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:05.950
so you have to get rid of it.

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:13.270
So you would degrade
the RNA, and this

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.540
is done using another
enzymatic activity, which

00:33:16.540 --> 00:33:19.570
is derived from reverse
transcriptase, which

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.510
is termed RNAs H activity.

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:28.990
So you can add an
enzyme RNAs H, which

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:32.530
RNAs H takes this
DNA RNA hybrids

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:35.800
and degrades the
RNA part of it, OK?

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.910
So this is going to
degrade the RNA strand.

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.170
And if you degrade
the RNA strand,

00:33:42.170 --> 00:33:44.440
then you're left with
a single strand of DNA.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.820
So you have single
strand of DNA here,

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.540
and now what you need
to do is to synthesize

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:59.690
the second strand of DNA.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.940
So you need a second
strand synthesis.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.960
And so you need, again,
a primer in order

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.260
to prime the synthesis here.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.850
So there are a variety
of ways to do this.

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.360
You can add some
type of hairpin,

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:23.340
which is five prime here
and three prime here,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.550
and then you can use
either DNA, polymerase,

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:31.590
or reverse transcriptase, which
also can be a DNA dependent DNA

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:35.389
polymerase to transcribe
this strand here, OK?

00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:42.270
So again, you add polymerase,
and now you've gone

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:46.980
and you've generated
double stranded DNA, OK?

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:51.750
So everyone see how we've
gone from an mRNA transcript,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:55.889
and we've done the reverse of
everything we just told you

00:34:55.889 --> 00:35:00.780
in the first half of the course
because we've gone from RNA

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.940
and we've made DNA, OK?

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.100
But this will be really
useful because now we

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.990
have a stable piece of DNA that
we can clone into a plasmid

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.690
and we have a record of
this transcript being

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:17.730
present in our sample, and we
can propagate that on and on,

00:35:17.730 --> 00:35:20.310
so we've cloned it, OK?

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:23.760
All right, what's going to be
special about this piece of DNA

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.050
versus a piece of genomic DNA?

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:27.550
Natalie?

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:31.220
ADAM MARTIN: Yes, so
Natalie suggesting

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.950
that it doesn't have introns,
and that's totally right.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:41.880
So this is not like
genomic DNA, and what

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:47.540
Natalie said is because
mRNA is processed,

00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:51.810
the introns are spliced out,
such the mature mRNA only

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:57.150
has the axons, and so this
piece of complementary cDNA

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:00.220
is going to have no introns.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.610
How else is it different?

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:10.878
Yeah, Jeremy?

00:36:10.878 --> 00:36:12.670
AUDIENCE: It's not
going to have promoters.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.090
ADAM MARTIN: It's not
going to have a promoter.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:14.770
Yes, Carmen?

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:19.820
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
have [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:23.000
ADAM MARTIN: You might
see a poly A and T

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.860
sequence in the cDNA.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:26.710
Yes, that's true.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.600
OK, so you might have
poly A, poly T. I'm

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.830
going to focus on
the other part from--

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:41.180
there's going to be no promoter,
enhancer, regulatory sequences.

00:36:41.180 --> 00:36:45.950
Basically, it's got no sequence
that's not transcribed, right?

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:49.160
The DNA is only going to have
the part of the gene that

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:54.180
was physically transcribed by
the RNA polymerase originally.

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:59.115
OK, so no
non-transcribed regions.

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:10.550
No non-transcribed regions,
and Carmen's absolutely right.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:14.110
You will also have possibly
a poly A or poly T sequence.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:27.360
OK, so when you get these
cDNAs, you might have--

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.910
you have more than
one mRNA in a sample

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:34.350
like a cytoplasmic extract,
so you're going to prime--

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.510
you're going to
make multiple cDNA

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.500
and different cDNAs will reflect
different transcripts that

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.080
are present in your sample, OK?

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.630
So you could have
one clone that's

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.350
one gene, another clone
that's a different gene,

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:51.450
and another clone
that's another gene,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:55.440
and you could have thousands of
clones of these different DNAs.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:38:00.630
What's going to be special
about what types of genes

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:03.810
are you going to get for
I guess different tissues.

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:08.070
Are they going to
be the same or not?

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:08.730
Yeah, Carlos?

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:11.815
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.815 --> 00:38:12.690
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.740
You're not going to see--
if you've prepared a tissue

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.440
and there is no gene being--

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:22.260
if one gene was not expressed
or transcribed in that tissue,

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:25.350
you will not get a cDNA
for that particular gene

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.630
in your library, OK?

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.090
So the representation of genes--

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:42.210
the representation of
genes in a cDNA library

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:47.550
is totally dependent on what
genes are being expressed, OK?

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.470
So this representation
is going to be

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:56.130
proportional to the expression
level, and the more genes--

00:38:56.130 --> 00:38:59.040
the more a gene is
expressed in a given tissue,

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.430
the more copies of
cDNA for that gene

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.200
you would see in
the library, OK?

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:06.510
So there's really
a proportionality

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.480
between the number of
clones in a library

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.120
and the expression
level of a gene,

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.210
where in the most extreme
case, if this gene is not

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:16.800
expressed at all,
you're not going

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:21.890
to see it represented at
all in the cDNA library, OK?

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.330
And then a corollary
to this statement

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:30.540
is that if you make cDNA
libraries from different cell

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.680
types or different tissue
types, the cDNA libraries

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.020
are going to be different
between those different types

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:39.780
of sources of mRNA, OK?

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:46.860
So in other words,
different tissues

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:47.960
give you different cDNA.

00:39:59.550 --> 00:40:01.900
OK, so there is the process.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.580
So I went through
most of the side.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.540
Yes, miles?

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:08.415
AUDIENCE: Is this a way you can
determine what gene sequences

00:40:08.415 --> 00:40:10.720
are expressed in all cells?

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:16.588
Because in certain mRNA strands
across all tissue samples,

00:40:16.588 --> 00:40:22.870
those are basic cell functions
and expressed in a [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.283
organism?

00:40:24.283 --> 00:40:26.200
ADAM MARTIN: So you're
asking, if you grind up

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:28.630
like an entire
organism and if you

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:31.150
get a cDNA from that
library, could you

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:36.370
tell if it's expressed in
all different cell types?

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:39.970
Even if you have one cell
type that expresses a gene,

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.530
if you grind up the
entire organism,

00:40:42.530 --> 00:40:45.850
then you're going to have some
mRNA that represents that gene.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:48.820
So I don't think it would
be as an effective measure

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.600
to determine the ubiquity of
expression of a given gene,

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.430
but in just a minute,
I'm going to give you

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.580
a tool that would allow you
to answer the exact question

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.220
that you're asking, OK?

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:04.590
Any other questions
about the cDNA library?

00:41:04.590 --> 00:41:06.920
OK.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.850
So I just wanted to mention that
a comeback to this example I

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:15.000
gave on the identification
of the human CDK gene.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.150
So remember, we started
with yeast that were mutant.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.430
They had
temperature-sensitive mutants,

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:25.040
and we transformed these
mutants with a library,

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.140
but I didn't really tell
you what the library was.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.260
It was in fact the cDNA
library from humans that

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.740
was transformed into yeast, OK?

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.460
And that's because yeast genes--

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.150
for the most part, they don't
have a lot of interests, and so

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.245
the yeast--

00:41:39.245 --> 00:41:41.840
the machinery is not
able to splice out

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.290
the human interactions
and human genes, OK?

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:47.810
And so this was done
with a human cDNA

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.300
library, which then encoded--

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:54.080
one of which encoded the
cumin CDK gene, and that

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.920
allowed Paul Nurse to
discover the piece of DNA that

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:01.190
encoded for the human CDK, OK?

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:03.440
So I just wanted to
kind of retroactively

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.440
go back and sort of tell you
how that experiment was done.

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:13.660
OK, so now I'm going to
get to my final point

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.980
for this lecture, which is
this final technique, which

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:21.850
will allow us to determine
whether or not a transcript is

00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:24.880
expressed in a single
cell type or ubiquitously

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:29.260
through an organism, and this
involves a technique, which

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.780
is known as hybridization.

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:38.920
And what hybridization
is is if you're

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:41.830
starting with a
piece of DNA, you

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:44.170
don't need to know
its sequence in order

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.690
to determine whether
there are sequences that

00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:51.220
are similar or identical to
it, because hybridisation

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:57.160
is basically if you
have some sequence

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.310
and it's single stranded
such that you have a DNA

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:03.010
backbone but you
have base pairs that

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:06.790
are able to pair with
their complementary bases

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:10.840
and you can use a piece of
single stranded DNA like this

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:15.880
and you can label it such that
if the labeled piece sticks

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.960
to another piece that has
identical or similar sequence,

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:23.830
you'll be able to visualize
it in some way, OK?

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:25.360
So this is called--

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:32.770
you're looking for things
that anneal or hybridize

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:37.360
to a particular
specific sequence.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:43.420
So you don't need to know
the sequence a priori, OK?

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.020
You just need to have this
physical piece of DNA,

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.350
and you can use this single
stranded piece of DNA

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:55.510
to then fish for
similar sequences, OK?

00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:59.710
So we could take a piece of DNA
here maybe that's in a gene,

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:02.200
and we could fish
through a DNA library

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:07.600
to try to identify a cDNA clone
that has sequence identity

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:10.480
to that piece of DNA, OK?

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:13.960
And the way this is done
is to take a cDNA library.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.910
So each of these colonies
here would express or have

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.910
a different clone of DNA.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.910
You can then take a
nitrocellulose filter, put it

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:28.450
on this plate, which would
stick the bacteria in place

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.470
to that filter, and you
could then lice the bacteria

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.100
and denature the DNA, and then
the DNA is stuck to the figure,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.610
but now it's single stranded.

00:44:39.610 --> 00:44:42.400
You can then add your
probe, which is labeled,

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.000
and look for the colonies
that this probe sticks to,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.180
and that would then identify
a particular cDNA, which

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:52.300
would identify whether
or not a piece of DNA

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.630
is expressed in a
given tissue type, OK?

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:59.390
So everyone see how
that would work?

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:02.680
So in addition to doing this
on a nitrous cellulose filter,

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:06.310
you can also do
this in a tissue,

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.860
and that's known as
in situ hybridization.

00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:15.820
And in this case, in
situ hybridization,

00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:19.150
you're searching for mRNA in
a section of fixed tissue.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.550
OK, and I have an
example from this paper

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:37.000
here, which is the
paper this are cloned.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.420
In this paper was the
cloning of the aniridia gene,

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.800
and they identified a gene of
interest, which is called Pax6

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:48.400
now, and they basically
used a piece of DNA

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.620
that they thought
was interesting,

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.180
and they did in situ
hybridization in an organism,

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.620
in this case, you see an eye.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.980
This is an eye here,
and the label Pax6

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.810
is labeled in
yellow, and you can

00:46:01.810 --> 00:46:04.390
see how this transcript
is present throughout

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.430
the entire eye, right?

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.840
And the way you would see if
it's tissue specific is you

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:12.820
look in other tissues and you
wouldn't see this yellow label.

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.010
So that's how you
would determine

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:18.580
if it's expressed in a
specific tissue or ubiquitously

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:19.540
throughout an organism.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.760
OK, so this Pax6 gene.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:25.323
Oop.

00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:26.990
So I was going to
ask, what do you think

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:32.130
would happen if you
hyperactivate Pax6 in humans,

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:39.380
and this is one idea, but
actually, I just made that up,

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:44.750
or Stan Lee made that up,
but actually, Stan Lee never

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:48.920
in fact mentioned whether or
not cyclops is a Pax6 mutant,

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:53.810
but we can do a different type
of experiment, which might be

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:58.100
more ethical, which is we
know there's a fly gene that's

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.020
homologous to Pax6.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:04.310
And what we can do in
flies is we can topically

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:07.910
express this islets
gene in non-eye tissues

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:09.890
and see what happens.

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:11.510
OK so, this is pretty wild.

00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:15.990
This is my Halloween
image of the class.

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:18.410
So this is a fly
where eyeless has been

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.190
expressed all over its body.

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:22.940
OK, so here you see
there's an eye--

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:25.010
It's normal eye-- here.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.660
You can see there's
now another eye

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:29.040
growing in the
front of its head.

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.150
You can see here's an eye
growing on this fly's back,

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:34.520
and you can see the legs.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:38.330
There's eye tissue all over
the legs of this fly, OK?

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:43.130
So this Pax6 gene, which is
conserved from flies to humans

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:46.430
is the master regulator
of eye development, OK?

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:48.640
And at least in flies,
if you topically

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.160
express this in other parts
of the body, you get an eye.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.360
I should say these are
not functionalized.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.650
They don't hook up to
the brain the same way

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:59.510
the normal eye does.

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:01.760
So it's not like
this fly can see out

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:04.460
of the back of its head.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:06.290
OK, that's it.

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:09.590
I'm done, and good luck
on your exam on Wednesday.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.770
We will see you here.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.750
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Now, this
is how we left on Tuesday.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.820
We got to this point where we
had put a particle in a box.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.860
We put a quantum mechanical
particle in a box.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.400
And it was an
infinite square well.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.404
And what's this called?

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:45.568
AUDIENCE: Energy levels.

00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:47.360
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Energy
levels, and what's

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.262
really weird about them?

00:00:49.262 --> 00:00:50.720
AUDIENCE: They're discrete.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.680
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, meaning
if you have this one here

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.540
and then you have
another energy here,

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.670
can it have energy in between?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.493
No.

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:01.160
Can that quantum
particle be in between?

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.880
No, in energy.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.970
And so the question
was, can we connect that

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.550
to things like what we
see in the universe,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.140
like the spectral lines?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.795
So what I want to do--

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:12.170
there's a little
bit more we need

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.240
to do to do that connection.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440
And so I want to spend some time
today just going through that

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.650
and going to the hydrogen
atom, because this is not

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.400
the hydrogen atom.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.990
It's not an infinite well.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.160
And then from the
hydrogen atom, we'll

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.820
talk about how just
from that, just

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.800
by solving for
the hydrogen atom,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.430
we literally have this
incredibly deep understanding

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.870
of the entire periodic
table and all of chemistry.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.930
So it's a pretty
powerful thing to do.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.530
So we're going to start
with a little bit of review,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.032
and then this
real-world example.

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:50.990
And then I've got to tell
you a few things that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.230
are really important, like you
have this thing called "spin."

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:55.520
So we'll talk about that.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.290
We'll end with that, and talk
about how from this solution,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.490
you get this--

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.870
pretty awesome, pretty amazing.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.340
So some review-- so we went
through this on Tuesday.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.320
So why did people even
need quantum mechanics?

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.530
Well, because things were
failing, and crumbling,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.070
and catastrophing
all around them.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.110
And so how long--

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.850
so classical atom, oh, no,
there's a classical atom.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.620
Photoelectric effect
was one of them.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.050
Who can explain
what happened here?

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.450
These are some of the
reasons why we needed

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.913
a new theory after 400 years.

00:02:41.913 --> 00:02:43.830
What's going on with the
photoelectric effect?

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.780
Anyone remember?

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.490
Yeah.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.013
AUDIENCE: A description of the
phenomenon or why it happened?

00:02:59.013 --> 00:02:59.930
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yes.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.680
AUDIENCE: OK, so basically,
you take some light.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.320
You shine it at a metal, and
a bunch of electrons come off.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.560
And if you increase the
intensity of the light,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.090
the number of
electrons coming off

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.710
increases, but not
the energy, which

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.490
was sort of counterintuitive.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:15.490
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Why was
that counterintuitive?

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.670
AUDIENCE: Because if
light's not a particle,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.670
it's just like a
wave, then you expect

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.260
if you're shooting more light
at it, that's more energy.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.920
So if an electron gets
hit by a bunch of light,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.230
you'd think it would
get a bunch of energy,

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.750
and you'd also get a higher
energy, but it doesn't.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.840
And the solution
was that the photons

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.970
are produced by electrons
changing energy levels

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.330
or something like that.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.445
And so they come in
discrete packets of energy.

00:03:41.445 --> 00:03:42.820
And so when they
hit an electron,

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.800
they shoot it off at
some particular energy.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.470
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And what's that?

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.210
AUDIENCE: It's
frequency dependent.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:47.950
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's just
dependent on the frequency,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.545
exactly.

00:03:48.545 --> 00:03:49.420
That's exactly right.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.920
So does everybody see that?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.440
So this was called the
"photoelectric effect."

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:58.750
And it was the reason Einstein
was given the Nobel Prize.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.840
It's a very
important explanation

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.832
of this very confusing
effect, which

00:04:03.832 --> 00:04:05.290
is that you increase
the intensity,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.075
but the energy of
those electrons--

00:04:07.075 --> 00:04:07.950
see what's happening?

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.575
You're shining light on a piece
of metal and electrons fly off.

00:04:10.575 --> 00:04:13.840
And you can measure how much
energy those electrons have.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.520
And you increase the
intensity of light,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.130
and they don't have any more
energy, which was really

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.410
bizarre if light is a wave.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.130
What Einstein said
is, no, actually, oh,

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.990
but it does depend on the
frequency of the light.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.590
So that makes sense if
light can be considered

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.500
as particles of zero mass--

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.490
that's weird-- that have
an energy associated

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.960
with their frequency.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.240
So that was really important.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.160
The energy of
something you thought

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.850
was a wave, light,
actually can be considered

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.220
as a particle associated
with the frequency,

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.310
have the energy of a particle
associated with that frequency.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.320
And then what was
the classical atom?

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.010
What's wrong with this one?

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.800
How long do we live
in a classical world?

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.086
What's the most we could
live in a classical world?

00:05:05.086 --> 00:05:06.790
AUDIENCE: 10 to the
minus 12 seconds.

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.460
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: 10 to the
minus 12 seconds, it's game

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.000
over.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.750
Why?

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.735
What's happening?

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:16.433
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:16.433 --> 00:05:17.350
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Why?

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.058
What's happening?

00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:19.940
So it's accelerating,
and we know

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.250
that an accelerating charge--

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.248
radiation, and it loses energy.

00:05:25.248 --> 00:05:27.290
And if it loses energy,
it should just spiral in,

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.570
and that takes about 10
to the minus 12 seconds.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.720
So we know that's
not true, either.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.910
Actually, I wanted to
put this out there.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.590
This is from Wikipedia, and it's
a sort of explanation of that.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.770
And so if you want to
understand more and read more

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.380
about the classical
atom, get a book

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.245
on Lienard-Wiechert potentials.

00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:50.120
I'm sure just the name
alone is inspiring you

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.870
guys to want to dig deep.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.160
And those are the ones.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.310
That's what you can do to
get the time-varying EM

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.100
field for a point charge
in arbitrary motion.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.840
But look at that--
they're not corrected

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.132
for quantum mechanical effects.

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.710
So that's what was
such a problem.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.310
This was right around 1900.

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.670
So they had it, but then they
tried to apply it to an atom,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.300
and here's what happens.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.457
It's accurate, but breaks
down at the quantum level.

00:06:21.457 --> 00:06:23.290
Quantum mechanics sets
important constraints

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:26.800
on the ability of a particle
to emit radiation, i.e.,

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.040
it doesn't in an atom.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.850
Sometimes, I think this is
kind of interesting to look at.

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.060
Basically, we have this
problem that an atom will

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.888
sort of self-destruct, and the
electrons just spiral down.

00:06:39.888 --> 00:06:41.680
The solution really,
if you think about it,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.920
is it doesn't do that anymore.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.030
But now why?

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:51.320
Well, because of the fact that
particles are waves and waves

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.070
are particles.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.900
And it comes from
the quantization.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.930
So I want to make sure
that we're all on that page

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.120
by the end of today, that
we all kind of see that.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.900
So that's the reason,
is because particles can

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.130
be both waves and particles.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.440
Waves can be waves
and particles.

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.610
Everything is one happy family.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.350
Can't we all just get along?

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.750
Here are some particles
going through slits.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:21.860
Now what's happening here?

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.590
Actually, you can think
of this as a particle

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.540
or it kind of looks like
a water wave, doesn't it?

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.160
But see, that's the whole point.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.630
That's what particles are.

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:39.360
So what's happening here?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.090
Can somebody explain
why it's showing this?

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.810
What's going on?

00:07:47.612 --> 00:07:51.876
We've got on the
left, how many slits?

00:07:51.876 --> 00:07:52.630
AUDIENCE: One.

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:52.990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And on the right?

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:53.770
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.170
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
What's the difference?

00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.280
AUDIENCE: Interference.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.480
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yes.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.300
What's interference?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:03.008
AUDIENCE: Two different
waves, and you've

00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:03.925
got peaks and troughs.

00:08:03.925 --> 00:08:06.730
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, so that
you get two waves coming out

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:12.190
of-- but look, the same particle
creates no interference here

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.030
because it just bubbles through.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:19.210
But if you have two slits, it
can create two little waves.

00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.430
And those interfere and
they cause complex behavior.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.658
And that is what
blew people away.

00:08:25.658 --> 00:08:27.700
And oh, by the way, you
can see that there's also

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.283
some really cool
interference going on

00:08:29.283 --> 00:08:31.282
in the backscattering
from the edges,

00:08:31.282 --> 00:08:32.740
because you get a
little scattering

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.880
off the edges on both cases.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:37.669
But what we're looking at is
what's happening over here.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.169
And so it's just really weird
that you could throw particles

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:42.600
through slits, and they
were like water waves,

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.890
not like particles.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:49.680
That was another really
bizarre experiment.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:55.660
And again, one of the big,
important stepping stones

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.290
was the fact that you
could describe the energy

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.940
of a particle by its frequency.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:06.180
And then de Broglie came and
said, actually, not just light.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:09.300
No, everything-- all matter--

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.550
can be considered as both
a particle and a wave.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.760
This is stuff we
talked about Tuesday.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.330
And so what that means is
that I have a wavelength.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:21.560
What's my wavelength?

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.290
35, 10 to the minus 35.

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:25.940
But I'm OK with that.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.560
I feel that quantum
is right here.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:35.030
I feel it somewhere within.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:39.710
But see, when things are really
small like an electron, which

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.320
is this part of the class--
we care about those electrons.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:46.040
And I motivated that on Tuesday,
and we'll come back to that

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.120
as we go through examples.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.570
So if I want to know
about an electron,

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:52.190
that's a really small thing.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:56.450
And so its wavelength-- and
we talked about this Tuesday--

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.570
the wavelength associated
with the particle

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:03.500
is about the same
size as the distances

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.480
the particle sort of
goes out for a walk

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.010
on, on a daily basis, otherwise
known as its "chemical bond."

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.960
If you're an electron,
you kind of walk

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.090
along this chemical bond.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:20.390
That's sort of what you do, if
you're in a bonding situation.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:24.170
And that distance of that
walk is roughly the same

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.800
as your wavelength,
as your wave nature.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.370
Your wave nature-ness
is important then.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.770
And so because of that,
we can't describe it

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.060
without quantum mechanics.

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:40.590
You have to have a
way of describing it.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:44.060
And it has to be something
that is based on a wave.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:45.980
So that's the breakthrough.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.620
And I'll go through
that again just quickly.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:58.550
But what we came out with is the
fact that particles are waves.

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:00.800
So they have wave functions.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.740
And this wave function is
what we'll be solving for.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.050
This is what we want in
this part of the class.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:06.920
We want that.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.560
And so it'll have some form.

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.170
And we showed a few forms,
and I'll show you more today.

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.480
But we showed a few for
a particle in a box.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:24.350
That had a cosine, and then
it had one node in the middle.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:28.730
But what's amazing about this
is that this has no meaning

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.060
we know of.

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.340
We do not understand
what this means.

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.000
So you have this
intimate function

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.800
that describes the
particle, and we

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.940
don't know how to interpret it.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:48.710
The big breakthrough came
in making the connection

00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:54.080
that the square of that
function is meaningful.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.310
But that's pretty cool.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.100
So think about if
I had a position.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.430
Wait, you had this--

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.000
you did classical
molecular dynamics,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.100
so you have the position
of the particle.

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.740
That's a function of time.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.560
Imagine saying that
that has no meaning,

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.100
or you don't know what it
means, only the square of it.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.110
So something as
fundamental as the wave

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:18.810
itself that is the solution
to the equation to our f

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:22.290
equals ma, which is Schrodinger,
something as fundamental

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.720
as that, we don't
know what it means.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:27.400
But we do know what
its square means.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.760
And what does the square mean?

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:29.960
AUDIENCE: Probability.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.210
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Probability.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.416
So tell me a little
more about that.

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:36.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, so tell
me-- this is a particle right

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.370
here.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.920
You're starting to
see it, I can tell.

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.540
I can see that you're
starting to see it.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:49.220
I can feel the excitement
about this, too, in the room.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.570
It's tangible.

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.220
This is a particle.

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.640
You see this now not as a
wave, not as a particle.

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:57.350
You see it as both.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:58.942
Now, if this is a
particle and that's

00:12:58.942 --> 00:13:01.400
why I'm going to show you a
little video on it in a second.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.400
But if this is a
particle, where is it?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.697
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
by chance [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:07.697 --> 00:13:09.530
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: But
I mean, I know that it

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:11.860
can be a particle again.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:13.222
We it can go back and forth.

00:13:13.222 --> 00:13:15.680
That's what it did when you
sent it through the two slits--

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.050
it became wave, then
it became a particle.

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.400
So can I say that
it's spread out?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.210
Is it spread out?

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.540
How do I interpret that?

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.378
AUDIENCE: The probability
of finding a particle is

00:13:35.378 --> 00:13:37.112
2 to the negative 3.

00:13:37.112 --> 00:13:38.070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Good.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:43.880
That's sort of the way
that I like to look at it.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.500
I mean, the particle is--

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.830
in a way, you can think
about it is spread out

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.750
until you measure it.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.160
It's sort of everywhere in here,
because there's no here here.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.430
There's only a certain amount
of chance to be here here.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:03.520
So I have a kind of big chance,
if I measure where it is,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.930
of finding it here.

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:08.230
And then I have no chance
of finding it here.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:10.660
And then it's sort of medium
chance here, and a big chance

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.370
there, if I measure it.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.720
So that's really what
these functions mean.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.750
And those functions
are the ones that we

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.060
solve for to find out
where electrons are.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:26.180
And where those
electrons are is what

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.750
is absolutely critical to
doing a whole lot of material

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:32.270
science, as I
mentioned on Tuesday,

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:38.570
and as we'll talk about when
we apply this to problems.

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:40.070
And that's what you get.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:45.560
You get bizarre distributions
of probabilities.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:49.760
Here's an electron thrown
into a wall that is infinite,

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:54.110
and here is an electron thrown
into a wall that's finite.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.240
So that's my quantum
mechanical ball.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:57.620
Did I show this Tuesday?

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.870
I don't think I did.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.550
So if it's thrown
into an infinite wall,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.900
it actually can't go through.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.610
The probability--
we worked this out.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:06.920
If you have an infinite
boundary here--

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.110
we talked about that Tuesday--

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:11.300
you can't have any function.

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:12.860
The only solution is 0.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.117
So it can't penetrate at all.

00:15:14.117 --> 00:15:15.950
So it completely bounces
back, although look

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.950
at the weird things it
does when it bounces back.

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:22.910
That's the wave function of
a ball thrown into a wall,

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:30.110
or if you want, an electron
thrown into a material.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.660
But over here, you
see it's not infinite,

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.540
and all kinds of
interesting things happen.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.420
It does bounce back in a
similar way, but some of it

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:39.218
goes through.

00:15:39.218 --> 00:15:40.010
What's that called?

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:43.500
AUDIENCE: Tunneling.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.672
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Tunneling, right.

00:15:45.672 --> 00:15:47.130
And you better
believe that this is

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:52.180
as effect we use in
technology all the time--

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.660
tunneling of charges,
very important.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:01.050
If I take my macroscopic
ball and I throw it,

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:06.340
or if I just run myself with
a helmet on into the wall,

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.770
how much of me is
going to tunnel?

00:16:11.662 --> 00:16:13.808
AUDIENCE: Not enough.

00:16:13.808 --> 00:16:15.850
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What is
enough in that example?

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.840
So why aren't I tunneling
if I run into that wall?

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.262
AUDIENCE: You're not
running fast enough.

00:16:26.262 --> 00:16:27.720
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
I'm not running--

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.310
so actually, that's true.

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:32.570
I'm pretty slow.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:40.210
But the thing is that
there's another reason.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:44.890
What is it about me that
is really different here?

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:45.870
AUDIENCE: You're big.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.710
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: I'm big,
and so what does that mean?

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.490
What's small?

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.020
AUDIENCE: Your wavelength.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.790
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
My wave function--

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:54.920
my wavelength, not
my wave function.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.430
My wave function is everywhere,
but it just doesn't really

00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:59.900
spread out that much.

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:05.690
Because the wavelength of
me is 10 to minus 35 meters,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:08.869
and remember, when
quantum matters

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.920
is when your wavelength is sort
of on the same scale roughly

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.920
as the stuff you're
involved with.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.109
And I'm involved with a thing
that's a meter over there.

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.579
So if I'm 35 orders of magnitude
smaller in my wavelength,

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.280
there's not going to
be any quantum effects.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.430
You won't tunnel very often, not
enough to make it worth trying.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:37.800
Now, here's the goofy
video, which is kind of fun.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.311
So I'll just play it,
and then we'll move on.

00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:40.936
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:41.561
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:17:41.561 --> 00:17:42.320
I love the music.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.045
- A true giant of
quantum revolution

00:17:44.045 --> 00:17:48.070
was Werner Heisenberg.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:50.935
And from the vagueness of
positions of electrons and de

00:17:50.935 --> 00:17:54.460
Beuys standing wave orbits,
he drew a tremendous insight,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.260
which he stated like this--

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:01.890
"The more precisely the
position is determined,

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:08.100
the less precisely the momentum
is known, and vice versa."

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.740
And while it may seem like
a bunch of gobbledygook,

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.310
it was the insight necessary
to understand how an object can

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.350
be both a particle and a wave.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.840
This single statement
led to the understanding

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.320
that subatomic particles
can disappear and reappear

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.028
in another place.

00:18:27.028 --> 00:18:28.612
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's really weird.

00:18:28.612 --> 00:18:30.400
- And they can do
this without existing

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.960
in the intervening space.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.760
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's really weird.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:38.650
- When an electron is
trapped inside an atom,

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:41.080
the places it can
disappear and reappear

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.465
include specific locations
around the nucleus.

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:51.000
And that makes it
look like a shell.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.990
Basic particles can also be in
more than one place at a time,

00:18:54.990 --> 00:18:56.310
if the time is brief enough.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.740
An electron can travel
from here to there

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.930
along all possible
paths simultaneously.

00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.800
And even more astounding,
these particles

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.510
can appear out of the
nothingness of space,

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:21.640
exist for an extremely brief
instant, and then disappear.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:25.150
Scientists call them
"virtual particles."

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:31.240
They may be virtual, but they
can have very real effects.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.640
All this jumping around
makes particle descriptions

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.210
so inexact.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.870
But then existence itself is
inexact at these tiny scales.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.560
The question is
often asked, what

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.570
is it that is wave
when a particle is

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.620
described as a wave?

00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.430
And after a lot of
hem-hawing around the issue,

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:02.810
the right answer is,
existence is waving.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.260
The particles are
jumping around,

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:08.840
coming into and
out of existence.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.750
And those places where the
wave crests are maximum,

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.570
are the places where the
particle materializes

00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:18.160
most of the time,
while the places where

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.090
the crests are minimum are the
places the particle avoids.

00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:28.250
The wave is a map of the
particles' existence.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.450
And as the wave changes, the
particle changes as well.

00:20:34.607 --> 00:20:35.190
[END PLAYBACK]

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.482
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: There you go.

00:20:36.482 --> 00:20:38.880
I love these kinds of
videos, and not just

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.730
for the soundtracks, because
those are pretty cool.

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:46.260
But I think that he
got a little bit ahead

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.520
of where I want to be, but does
everybody see that weirdness?

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.760
Is everybody getting
a feel for it?

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.410
OK, he said something
that's mind blowing.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:21:00.710
What did he say that I
said was really deep.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:02.078
Anybody remember?

00:21:02.078 --> 00:21:03.757
AUDIENCE: Existence is waving.

00:21:03.757 --> 00:21:05.090
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Existence is--

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.720
well, yeah.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:08.450
Oh, actually, there
were so many things.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:10.820
You're going to have
to see this again.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.520
And again, this is one of those
things-- you take this with Dr.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:15.620
Quantum, was it Dr. Quantum?

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.420
You take this video
with you, too--

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.620
to the bars, to the dorms,
wherever you're going

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:23.540
to do your next social thing.

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:26.820
And you just see
what the response is.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.580
You ask what their opinion
is, and it's a great way

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:33.630
to engage with people.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:34.130
Yeah.

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.050
AUDIENCE: Does the wave
function exist all the time?

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:38.050
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Sorry?

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:41.600
AUDIENCE: Does the wave function
exist all the time, too?

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.010
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That
is a good question.

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:45.240
And yes.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:47.420
I mean, it's changing
all the time,

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:49.857
but it exists all the time.

00:21:49.857 --> 00:21:51.440
Here's the thing,
though-- did anybody

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:53.313
catch the other thing
that's going on here?

00:21:53.313 --> 00:21:55.230
I'm going to talk about
this at the end today.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:55.872
But--

00:21:55.872 --> 00:21:57.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.870
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, yeah,
I can't even go there,

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:01.280
that's so crazy.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.620
What else?

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:04.930
Yeah.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.140
AUDIENCE: Virtual particles.

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.030
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Vertical
particles, vacuum fluctuations,

00:22:09.030 --> 00:22:10.610
but we're not going
there either--

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.930
mind blowing.

00:22:12.930 --> 00:22:15.680
I mean, in quantum mechanics,
stuff actually appears out

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.060
of nowhere.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.190
Out of nothing
you get something,

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.660
and then it disappears.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.610
Those are called
"vacuum fluctuations."

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:23.300
What else?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.920
But it's all related to this.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.220
Basically what he
said is that particles

00:22:28.220 --> 00:22:31.830
can disappear and then
reappear somewhere else.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:35.520
And actually, if you
take field theory,

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.110
which I really don't
recommend for most people--

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:41.810
I still remember my final
exam in field theory.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.950
It was 90 pages long.

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:45.470
It was a 24-hour,
take-home exam.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.110
Anyway, I still remember
asking my field theory teacher

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:57.580
in graduate school,
how can that be?

00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.590
How can a particle disappear?

00:22:59.590 --> 00:23:01.840
Because basically when
you get down to it,

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.300
that's pretty much
how things move

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.340
at the very smallest scales.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.320
They disappear and
then they reappear.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.570
That's what the math
tells us, at least.

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:12.537
How can that be?

00:23:12.537 --> 00:23:13.495
I didn't get an answer.

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:18.072
This gets deep.

00:23:18.072 --> 00:23:19.780
It's really cool and
really mind blowing.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.100
And we just don't really know.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.910
We don't connect it so much
anymore in the classrooms

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:28.670
to the mind-blowing
awesomeness of it all.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.400
But I love it.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.650
Now, I'll get to
that towards the end.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.230
I'll come back to that.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.970
Now, what we need-- so
we have these waves.

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:42.495
We know that particles are
waves and waves are particles.

00:23:42.495 --> 00:23:43.870
And we know that
the particles we

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:45.400
care about in this
part of the class

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.950
are going to have to
be described by a wave.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.640
How do we talk-- what's the
F equals ma of that wave?

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.640
It's dictated by-- it's
the Schrodinger equation.

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.990
That's it.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.610
That's our f equals ma.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.100
It's telling us how
this wave is going

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.770
to change in time and space.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:04.990
And so we talked about that.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.860
And we basically
just wrote this down

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:10.280
and said this is the equation.

00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.510
We're not going to go into the
details of where it comes from,

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:17.710
but there's so many places where
you can read more about that.

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:20.627
But this is our
governing equation.

00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:22.210
And basically, what
you have is a kind

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.820
of kinetic energy of the wave.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.000
That's this del squared thing,
kinetic energy operator,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.260
and a potential.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:33.220
And that together, we call
h, we call the Hamiltonian.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:36.340
That's got its own
special name because just

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.450
like T plus V in classical
physics is the energy,

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:45.940
we consider this thing, h
squared over 2m del squared

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:47.770
plus V to be the energy.

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.810
That's h.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:51.940
But it has to act
on the wave function

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.320
in order to get that energy.

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.780
And that's basically what
the Schrodinger equation is.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:57.370
Because we said,
we're going to say

00:24:57.370 --> 00:25:00.040
that h doesn't depend
on time usually,

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:01.555
for the things we care about.

00:25:01.555 --> 00:25:02.930
And if it doesn't
depend on time,

00:25:02.930 --> 00:25:06.010
then we can get
rid of the t here,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.350
and we could separate
the time dependence out,

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:10.090
which is what we do.

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.750
And we're left
with H psi equals E

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.660
psi, which is the
equation we need to solve.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.440
And I'll come back
to it in a second.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.440
Here's the bit on
Schrodinger I mentioned

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.980
that I think is amazing.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:24.970
This is, again, from Wikipedia.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.600
You see, he found
the standing waves.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.360
See, there it is.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.530
He found the standing waves
of this relativistic equation,

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.390
but the relativistic
corrections disagreed

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:35.590
with Sommerfeld's formula.

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.230
Discouraged, he put
away his calculations

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.960
and secluded himself
in an isolated mountain

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:43.930
cabin with a lover.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.220
I find it amazing--

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:50.770
not that part, but I find it
amazing that seriously, he

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:52.300
had to be convinced.

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.670
See, he came back
from the cabin and he

00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:57.790
decided that his earlier
calculations were novel enough

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.140
to publish.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.900
It's a good thing,
because it's pretty much

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.070
one of the most important
equations of the last century.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:10.360
And it's the equation
we will be solving.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.720
That's why I think this
history is interesting.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.660
OK, so there it is.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:18.100
So we talked about how
you can take the f out,

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:21.430
because if H doesn't
depend on time, then

00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:24.780
you can just set them
equal to a constant.

00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:27.630
You can set each side
having its own function

00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:30.870
dependent on its own variable,
r and t in this case,

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:32.070
and they equal a constant.

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.918
And then you get the Schrodinger
equation we care about,

00:26:34.918 --> 00:26:36.960
which is the one we'll be
solving, which is H psi

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.800
equals E psi.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.520
And then we did this,
and we said, well,

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.250
how do you solve it?

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:48.740
What if you have a very
simple particle in a box.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:52.720
And the box's walls
go up to infinity.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.040
Then you can solve it.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.810
And it's because
you have basically

00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:00.030
the particle is either
between 0 and L, in which case

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:05.740
here, then v is 0, and
so you get this equation,

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:11.290
or it's out here in this
region, in which case

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:14.110
V is infinity, which
means psi has to be 0.

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.550
That's the only solution.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.970
And then this is the
interesting part.

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:21.470
And when you look at this, you
see that the general solution

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.630
is sines and cosines.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.540
So we did that, but then there
was the very important thing

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.210
that happened.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:29.110
What is it?

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:34.095
And you get a solution
for E. Once you

00:27:34.095 --> 00:27:36.220
say the general solution,
you get a solution for E.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.320
So this is just a
standing wave, and you

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.470
get a solution for E,
which depends on k squared.

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.916
But what's really
important that we did next?

00:27:43.916 --> 00:27:45.245
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:45.245 --> 00:27:46.620
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And that does--

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.360
yes, and what did that do?

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.320
AUDIENCE: It quantizes.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.780
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Quantizes.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:54.690
Once you have the
boundary conditions,

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.330
it limits what this can be.

00:27:58.330 --> 00:28:01.000
We didn't limit it until
we applied the boundary

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.500
conditions.

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:04.170
Then we applied the boundary
conditions and boom,

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.020
this thing is quantized,
and out from that

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.690
drops such a relief
for the world,

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:13.670
which can exist for more than
10 to the minus 12 seconds.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:18.140
Because that quantization
is, in fact, the answer.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:21.905
It's that those electrons can
only be at certain energies.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:29.480
They cannot radiate energy
off of the atom and spiral

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.080
to the middle because they can't
be at another energy except

00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.820
the one it's in, and
then the next one.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.780
And it's real.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.360
I think I may have
shown this on Tuesday--

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.680
that you can actually
visualize the spatial extent

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.440
of the orbitals.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.380
And I put some more--

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.120
this is actually
cutting-edge research.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.370
Visualizing the shape of
electrons is not easy,

00:28:53.370 --> 00:28:54.450
but it can be done.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:58.160
There's been some really
phenomenal breakthrough

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:58.700
experiments.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:02.900
This was in Scientific
American a decade ago.

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:09.010
Now I want to move from
particle in a box to real stuff.

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:11.770
And the first real
stuff that's relevant

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.490
is hydrogen. And it's
only one element,

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.570
and I mentioned last time
that it's not necessarily

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:24.190
useful enough to do, say,
materials engineering.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:26.110
And so you'd like to
have a little bit more

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.520
of the periodic table.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.630
That's true, but you'll see
that with hydrogen alone,

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:33.788
we get our answers
to so many questions

00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:35.080
about the whole periodic table.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.503
And it is a real
useful material.

00:29:39.503 --> 00:29:42.170
How much of the universe is made
of hydrogen, does anybody know?

00:29:44.876 --> 00:29:47.425
AUDIENCE: 70?

00:29:47.425 --> 00:29:49.300
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That's
a really good guess.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.580
It's about 75%.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:54.030
That's a lot of hydrogen.
Now, how much of that

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:58.613
is in usable form on Earth
for the hydrogen economy?

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:11.920
How much hydrogen is usable
for hydrogen-powered cars

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.550
on this planet right now,
in an immediate form?

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.140
Zero.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.920
That's part one of the
hydrogen economy problem.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.900
You've got to make the hydrogen.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.070
There isn't any more.

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.090
It's too light.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.370
This planet's gravity
couldn't hold it.

00:30:32.370 --> 00:30:36.590
So anything that was free, left
or bonded to something else.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.500
You've got to make
the hydrogen. What's

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.510
part two of the hydrogen
economy problem?

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.410
Storing it.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:48.470
So you've got two big problems
with the hydrogen economy.

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:51.290
I'm not saying it's
not worth looking at.

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:56.780
We will not be driving
around this way,

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.800
but I'll talk a little bit
more about hydrogen. I just

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.160
love motivating the topic
we're about to go into.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:07.460
And since I want to talk
about the hydrogen atom,

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.625
I will talk a little more about
hydrogen storage materials.

00:31:10.625 --> 00:31:12.500
And we will calculate
some properties of them

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.410
using quantum mechanics.

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:16.430
But I love this.

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.660
The history of hydrogen
is a very interesting one,

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:20.930
but I love going
back to Jules Verne.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:25.130
In 1874, Jules Verne
said, "I believe

00:31:25.130 --> 00:31:27.170
that one day hydrogen and
oxygen, which together

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:28.760
form water, will be
used either alone

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:32.750
or together as an inexhaustible
source of heat and light."

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.010
I love that.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.590
Anyway, we're not
there, not even close.

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:41.560
I think a hydrogen
economy is a possibility.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.700
And I think there's some
great research going on.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:49.240
And it should stay as research
for at least another 30,

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:49.860
40 years.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:51.910
I'll come back to--

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:54.040
it's going to need
about that much research

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.390
to really make an impact
in the energy scene.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:01.520
I'll come back to that later.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:06.890
So that's a little motivation
for hydrogen. Now here it is.

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:10.270
Hydrogen has a
proton, an electron,

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:14.830
and it's got some distance
that that electron sits away

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.070
from the proton.

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.690
What do I need to know?

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:25.300
Well, I need to
know the potential.

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.420
So what's the potential here
between these two charges?

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.920
One's negative, one's positive.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.880
They feel an attraction.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.600
How does it go with r?

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.770
Yeah.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:39.960
It goes as 1 over r.

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:46.140
So now that-- I got my
V. It's the potential

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:47.550
that charges feel.

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.940
And that's got to go now into
the Schrodinger equation, which

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.990
I then need to solve.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:57.870
And that'll tell me what the
possible wave functions are.

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:59.550
And so here's what
it looks like, see?

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.410
We had H psi equals E psi.

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:03.570
That's our master equation.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:06.690
Then we said, that's the
kinetic plus potential.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.900
And then we said, that's
the momentum term, remember,

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:13.630
we talked about Tuesday, which
is just a second derivative.

00:33:13.630 --> 00:33:15.100
It's a second
partial derivative.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.390
It's a del squared, and plus
this potential term, which

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:23.970
I now put in here explicitly
for the hydrogen atom, E

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.780
squared over 4 pi epsilon 0 r.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.090
And that's the question
I need to solve.

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:35.260
And it turns out that you
can solve this exactly.

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.170
You can solve this
exactly, just like you

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:41.170
could the particle in the box
with the infinite boundaries.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.620
And that's really cool.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:45.520
So you've got an electron.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:49.370
You've got one particle,
just one electron.

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:51.410
These are its
spatial coordinates.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.510
And you can solve for
it in this potential,

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.810
in this 1 over r
potential exactly.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.690
And the easy way to do that
is to switch it to spherical

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.700
coordinates.

00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:03.620
So I won't go through
the math in detail.

00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:07.790
There's literally like 100
sites and 50 Wolfram Alpha apps

00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:11.090
you can look at that
go through this,

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.960
and really, really
wonderful material on this.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.800
But basically, the key point
is that when you write it

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.239
in spherical coordinates,
you switch from XYZ Cartesian

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:27.080
to spherical coordinates, you
can actually separate this

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:35.929
into essentially three quantized
problems-- theta, r, and phi.

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:40.130
And so you can write psi
now as a function of the r

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.830
and a function of the theta
and a function of the phi.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.175
And what ends up happening--
and then so you put that in.

00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:47.550
And there's a
little bit of math.

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.949
It's actually not that much.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:51.031
I'm not going to go through it.

00:34:51.031 --> 00:34:52.489
But you put that
in, and basically,

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.850
just like that
particle in the box,

00:34:55.850 --> 00:35:01.420
just like that, each one of
these variables gets quantized.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:05.620
It gets its own
sort of E-type term,

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:09.160
and it gets a quantization.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.190
So these are the
equations that it

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:15.350
leads to when you do the
separation of variables.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:20.740
And I think I have-- yes,
and the quantization is--

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.590
I think maybe on the next page
I have the actual energies.

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.140
But the solution--
remember, just

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.720
like the quantization of a
particle in a box, the same

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.410
here.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.710
It only can happen, you
can only have a solution,

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.420
if in this case,
we're going to have

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:39.070
a quantum number called n is 1,
2, 3, or something else going

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.670
up.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.370
Or in this case, we'll have
a quantum number called l.

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.800
That's also, by the way,
the main quantum number,

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.850
the orbital quantum number, and
then we have this little m sub

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:49.960
l, which is the magnetic one.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:53.790
How many of you
have not seen these?

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:55.020
So you've all seen these?

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.050
How many of you have seen this?

00:35:57.050 --> 00:36:00.050
OK, so I'm glad to see
all the hands go up.

00:36:03.050 --> 00:36:04.850
And so that's what you have.

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:07.130
And it's a very special case.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:09.660
And how many of you remember
that s stands for "sharp?"

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:11.180
See, I forget that.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:15.510
Seriously, did you all
remember this sharp principle

00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:16.740
and diffuse?

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:20.440
And I love f, which
is "fundamental."

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:27.540
So I want to know what's not
fundamental about silicon,

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.030
which has no f electrons?

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:34.180
Anyway, I thought that
was an interesting label.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:39.160
So this is how we designate,
from these quantum numbers,

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.950
which come from just solving
the Schrodinger equation for one

00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:44.830
electron in a 1 over
r potential-- that's

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.720
how we get all of
these designations

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.140
that you're used to--
s orbitals, p orbitals.

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.770
And you see, you get
different wave functions.

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:59.630
You get these functions,
these same wiggly functions

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.720
that I've been showing you.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.155
You get four different values
of these quantum numbers.

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.930
And those functions can
be plotted in space.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:16.580
This is just given those
spherical coordinates

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.490
and the functions of
those, you can plot them.

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:23.180
And you see that they
make really funny shapes.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:31.740
Why is this so important?

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:33.810
I said it on Tuesday.

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:36.925
Why is the funniness of
those shapes important?

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:43.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:45.732
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
because what am I looking at?

00:37:45.732 --> 00:37:47.190
Actually, let's go
to the next one.

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.510
That's kind of fun.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:50.250
What am I looking at here?

00:37:50.250 --> 00:38:00.920
This is the 1s orbital of
hydrogen, 2s orbital, 3s, 4s.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.020
Look at how they're all spheres.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.430
They're all
spherically symmetric.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:10.560
And then you go 2p
orbital and you see

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.580
that it has a different shape.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.760
So its function, these
are wave functions.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.830
Remember, the wave function
is-- what's the wave function?

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:31.050
Who knows?

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:33.835
Does any of you know?

00:38:33.835 --> 00:38:38.170
If anybody has some ideas,
this is like an open problem,

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.010
an open discussion.

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:42.510
But what is interesting
about these?

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.190
So these are the wave functions.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.176
From that, what can I get?

00:38:46.176 --> 00:38:47.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.260
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, if I do what?

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:50.093
AUDIENCE: Square it.

00:38:50.093 --> 00:38:51.810
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Square it.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:57.410
So these landscapes
squared tell me what?

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.370
Where the electron is.

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:08.170
And that is
incredibly important.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.680
That's it-- where
is that electron?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:17.160
Well, if you are fundamental
as opposed to diffuse,

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:21.330
you have some really bizarre
places you can be and not be.

00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.460
You can't be anywhere
where this isn't.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.200
That's the point.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.290
It's a probability distribution.

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:36.200
It dictates-- basically, all
the behavior of materials

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.590
comes from these,
these distributions.

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:44.330
They dictate what
materials do and become.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:47.000
Now in the hydrogen atom--

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.750
so what happens?

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:53.220
So you get these
shapes of the size,

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.710
and then you also get those E's.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.500
And remember, we solved
for the E's and then

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:03.340
we put the boundary conditions
on, and then it was quantized.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:15.710
And the quantization in hydrogen
can be calculated exactly.

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:18.170
So the quantization of the
energy levels in hydrogen

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.513
is exactly minus
13.6 over n squared,

00:40:21.513 --> 00:40:23.180
where n is the principle
quantum number.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:25.850
How many of you have seen this?

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:28.900
Sort of half.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.140
So 13.6 eV over n squared
is the quantization.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:38.960
That means the energy of an
electron in this first orbital,

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:42.590
that one up there, if I put
an electron in that orbital,

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:50.342
its energy is bound to
the atom by 13.6 eV.

00:40:50.342 --> 00:40:51.300
So what does that mean?

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.640
Yeah.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:59.112
AUDIENCE: If you give it 13.6 eV
or greater, it'll become free.

00:40:59.112 --> 00:41:00.070
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:03.850
That's the ionization
energy of that electron.

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.630
But hydrogen has all
of these other orbitals

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:08.830
accessible to it.

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.000
Maybe I could put an
electron up to another level,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.060
like the 2s level.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.560
And if I do that, it's
all the way up to 3.4.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.260
So now it's only bound
by 3.4 eV in the atom.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:25.960
And what does that make it?

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:35.410
Is it sort of less
stable, more stable?

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:36.327
AUDIENCE: Less stable.

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.577
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Less stable.

00:41:37.577 --> 00:41:39.408
So it'd be much more
easy to pull it off.

00:41:39.408 --> 00:41:41.950
Now, do you think that that has
something to do with bonding?

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.950
You better believe it.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:55.060
Where electrons sit in energy
relative to other electrons

00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.760
in other atoms, or
in their own atom,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:02.850
has everything to do with
how things bond together.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:04.800
And that bonding is
the one that you've

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:09.140
been just fitting to like
a Lennard-Jones potential.

00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:10.400
You've just been fitting it.

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.400
All that bonding is what you
just-- in classical physics,

00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.650
in classical modeling, you have
to have some potential form.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:20.930
And all of the
intricacies of the bonding

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.370
get swept up into that.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.410
But you can see why
that's so much more

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:29.090
complicated than that,
just by looking at these.

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:32.840
OK, but now, that
series that we just

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:37.340
got from a simple particle
in 1 over r potential

00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:43.550
explains all of these
levels that are observed.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.950
So does everybody remember this?

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:50.570
And poor number six
who didn't get named?

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.540
What are these?

00:42:54.730 --> 00:42:58.630
When you see these, what
does it make you think?

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:06.110
Spectral-- now explain what's
happening in the Lymann series.

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.140
What's happening?

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:09.765
AUDIENCE: You're moving from one
orbital down to the ground one

00:43:09.765 --> 00:43:12.075
and it's emitting photons
at those wavelengths.

00:43:12.075 --> 00:43:13.950
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And
why are they different?

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:17.270
Why do I have all these
different ones in one series?

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.974
AUDIENCE: The amount of energy
it gives off as it goes from n

00:43:19.974 --> 00:43:22.980
equals 7 to n equals 1 is
different from n equals 2 to n

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:23.480
equals 1.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:25.020
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:27.590
And if you go up to
2 and you stop at 2,

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:29.720
then you have other energies.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:33.620
Because it all comes down to,
then, what the differences are.

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:36.680
To get an electron to
go from here to here,

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.870
you need the difference
in these energies.

00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:41.270
And to go from here to here,
you need that difference.

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:44.520
No more and no less will do.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.420
Now, when the electron comes
back down, what happens?

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.438
Anybody know what happens?

00:43:55.438 --> 00:43:56.480
AUDIENCE: It emits light.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.855
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It emits light.

00:43:57.855 --> 00:43:59.870
It gives that energy
back out as light.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:01.940
And that's what you
see when you look out

00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:03.500
at these spectral lines.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.360
So it emits light at
exactly this energy.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:09.460
Can it emit light
at something else,

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.430
at a different amount of energy,
or a different frequency?

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.640
Because we know for
light, the energy

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:20.350
is equal to the frequency
times a constant.

00:44:20.350 --> 00:44:23.435
Can it emit light
at this frequency,

00:44:23.435 --> 00:44:24.310
something in between?

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:24.810
Why not?

00:44:28.224 --> 00:44:29.210
AUDIENCE: Quantized.

00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:32.660
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, it just can't

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:38.600
because it's a wave
problem that has

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.540
as its solution quantization.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.320
And now, I come to the question
of, well then how does--

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:47.730
so that's what's happening.

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.425
That's the picture of these
electrons coming back down,

00:44:50.425 --> 00:44:52.050
and emitting different
colors of light.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.620
It explains what
people saw and couldn't

00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.660
understand for so long.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.900
This simple solution,
mathematical solution,

00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:01.800
does it all.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.660
It really crystallized
what was going on,

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.760
and it really confirmed
that this is the right way

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.920
to picture things--

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.790
the wave equation and
the Schrodinger equation.

00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:17.160
Now, what's happening when
an electron goes from here

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.750
to here?

00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:21.980
How does it do that?

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:28.400
It cannot go in between, but
we know it does do this all

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.310
the time.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.935
We just look out in space and we
see it happening all the time,

00:45:31.935 --> 00:45:33.240
but we can do it here.

00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:37.910
We can build materials
that do this for a living.

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:43.760
Where are those electrons
going when they go from the 2p

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.690
to the 1s?

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:47.940
Where are they going?

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:54.640
Who can tell me?

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.722
Yeah.

00:45:55.722 --> 00:45:58.180
AUDIENCE: They're all sort of
described by a wave function,

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:58.680
right?

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:00.700
So it has some
non-zero probability

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.432
to be in one place and
a non-zero probability

00:46:03.432 --> 00:46:04.390
to be in another place.

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:06.700
And if you hit it with
a photon or something,

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.223
or have some perturbation
to your hydrogen atom,

00:46:09.223 --> 00:46:11.140
then it's going to have
a non-zero probability

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:13.700
to be in one electron
energy level than another.

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.087
And so it just sort of ends
up falling into one of them.

00:46:17.087 --> 00:46:18.670
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That actually works.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:23.142
That is a great interpretation
of what's happening.

00:46:23.142 --> 00:46:25.600
And that actually works, and
it even works all the way down

00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:26.260
to the nucleus.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:30.250
By the way, decay to
the nucleus is possible

00:46:30.250 --> 00:46:33.400
because those s orbitals--

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.670
I was just showing you a
slice of them, an isosurface.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:40.420
But they have a non-zero
magnitude all the way down

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:41.290
to the nucleus.

00:46:41.290 --> 00:46:46.450
It just won't happen very often,
because the probability is

00:46:46.450 --> 00:46:52.840
so low that it's why
we have a universe.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.190
If that overlap was more,
if the wave function

00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:58.390
going into the middle--

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:08.270
if this is the nucleus
and this is the electron,

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:13.340
and the wave function of the
s orbital looks like this,

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:21.830
and it's almost 0, that's
why we are alive today.

00:47:21.830 --> 00:47:28.090
But if this looks more like
this, no, we wouldn't make it.

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.610
There's just too much
probability for the electron

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:35.140
to decay into the nucleus, and
give off that amount of energy,

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:37.150
and the atom collapses.

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:44.375
So we should be very thankful
to quantum mechanics.

00:47:44.375 --> 00:47:47.660
Now, there are
situations, though,

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.300
when you actually
have nodes in between.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.340
And that's a tougher one.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:56.550
The node means the wave
function goes exactly to 0.

00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:00.240
Now what's happening?

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.820
And here, we go
back to this world

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:06.480
of particles, this field
theory world, basically, of how

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.260
particles move, by essentially
annihilating themselves

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.590
and reappearing.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.910
That's how electrons
really move.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:19.030
Now any questions
about any of that?

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.970
No questions at all?

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:31.920
OK, we're going to
start taking this

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:35.280
to the next level,
which is obviously going

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:38.713
to have to be more complexity.

00:48:38.713 --> 00:48:40.880
There are some constants
that I'm just putting here.

00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.470
I'm not going to
spend any time on it,

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:44.120
but these are the
constants you'll

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:46.580
be using in the quantum world.

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.310
We have an electron
volt. We have a Rydberg,

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:51.620
which is 13.6 electron volts.

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:53.370
And just to make it
interesting, there's

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:57.200
a Hartree, which
is a half of that.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:01.090
And then the same with
angstroms and Bohr.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.680
These are the kinds of unit--

00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.110
do you say angstrom,
do you say Bohr--

00:49:05.110 --> 00:49:09.190
to-may-to, to-mah-to--
you can choose, but just

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:11.700
keep track of it all.

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.720
Now, as we go to more complex--

00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:17.670
so I've given you a
particle in a box,

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:20.490
and then I gave you a
particle, actually, on Tuesday,

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:22.140
in an oscillator.

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.270
And then I give you a
particle in 1 over r.

00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:26.800
And that got us a long way.

00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.060
We explained spectral lines.

00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:30.520
We got hydrogen right.

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.770
But if I just add a little
bit more complexity,

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:36.060
you see things get really messy.

00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:38.280
Now, this was a problem.

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:41.550
I wanted to show
how messy things get

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:47.340
with analytic solutions as a
kind of motivational exercise.

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:48.870
So I gave this on
a homework problem

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:51.610
in this class two years ago.

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:57.600
And I'll admit that
was probably a mistake.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:04.260
I had a lot of people at
office hours, because you see,

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.220
this is the same thing.

00:50:05.220 --> 00:50:07.050
I'm throwing my
quantum mechanical ball

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.090
into a wall that has
another wall behind it.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.840
So can't you just set it up?

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.370
Well, sure, you can.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.860
And this is what you get.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.130
And you put that
into Mathematica,

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.370
which every single student
did, and it chokes--

00:50:24.370 --> 00:50:25.960
can't do it.

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.190
Too many for Matlab.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:32.440
I guess too many boundary
conditions, or too many

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.540
variables, or
something, but nobody

00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:37.000
could get Mathematica
to do this without

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.340
some intelligent substitution
of variables first,

00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:40.660
which was sort of the trick.

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:44.380
But my point in this was
not to make students suffer.

00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.510
I don't like to do
that, but it was just

00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:48.430
to convey how hard
this equation gets

00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:53.050
to solve with just a little
bit more complexity than one

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.400
particle in a well or in 1
over r, or something like that.

00:50:57.400 --> 00:51:03.510
It gets really hard, and
that's why we need computers.

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.690
And that's what computation
in the last 50 years has done.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:09.780
It has made this, together
with some algorithms,

00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:13.080
some simplifications
that you'll hear about--

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.250
it has made this
equation solvable

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:20.970
for much more complex systems.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.760
So I can also say,
well, let's not

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.050
make the potential
more complicated.

00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:31.800
Let's just add another electron.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.880
So now, I'm still with
a 1 over r potential,

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:38.740
but I've got two of them.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.950
So now, all of a sudden,
my potential term

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:45.970
is these electrons
interacting with the proton,

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:50.050
but also those electrons
interacting with each other.

00:51:50.050 --> 00:51:54.600
That's r12, the distance
between the two electrons.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:56.760
And boy, does that
make this equation

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:00.090
hard to solve analytically.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:05.650
You cannot use
separation of variables.

00:52:05.650 --> 00:52:12.450
So even just one more electron,
it's a deal breaker, basically.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:15.960
And now you think we
want to do big molecules.

00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.160
We want to do fullerenes.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:19.530
We want to do silicon.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.450
We want to do
thousands of electrons.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.270
Analytic approaches won't work.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.380
So what can you do?

00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:32.990
Well, there are two
different ways to go.

00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:34.760
You've got to do something.

00:52:34.760 --> 00:52:39.470
You've got to make it easier,
because as you'll see,

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:43.880
an exact solution, even with
the most powerful computers

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.950
in the world times squared
are not going to do it.

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:52.010
You need to make approximations
to the actual equation.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:55.530
And you'll hear about
those next week.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.980
And one thing you can do is
you can use perturbation theory

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.360
to say that this Hamiltonian
is actually some simpler

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.430
Hamiltonian.

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:08.190
That Hamiltonian is
some simpler Hamiltonian

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:12.300
that you can solve easily
plus some perturbation to it.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.640
We're not going
to really do that.

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.070
Has anybody used
perturbation theory?

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.280
So we're not going
to do it much but,

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.360
I'm just using it for reference.

00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:25.530
And then, so you do
something for something.

00:53:25.530 --> 00:53:28.710
Perturbation theory, what you do
is you say, well, that's hard,

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:30.130
so I'm not going to do that.

00:53:30.130 --> 00:53:32.490
But this is actually kind
of related, and it's easy,

00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:33.960
and I know how to do this.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.500
So I'll do this and then
add something to it.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.710
That's basically
perturbation theory.

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:43.470
But what we're
going to do is we're

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:48.630
going to try to solve it using
more of a matrix eigenvalue

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:49.330
approach.

00:53:49.330 --> 00:53:51.960
And again, we are not going
to go deep into the math here.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.830
And you will not be
tested on the math.

00:53:55.830 --> 00:53:59.250
As I said, my goal here
is to have you guys

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:04.410
applying these equations
to real materials problems.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:08.160
But I do think that it's useful
to know what's under the hood,

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.440
to know what equations
are being solved

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.900
when you press "Simulate."

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:16.440
So you'll hear more
about this, and how

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.740
you go about actually
making these approximations,

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.210
making the
approximations you need

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:27.690
to make in order to get
an eigenvalue problem that

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:29.870
can be solved on a computer.

00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:31.870
There are a couple of
different ways to do that.

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:33.995
The way that we're going
to settle on in this class

00:54:33.995 --> 00:54:35.827
is density functional theory.

00:54:35.827 --> 00:54:37.410
So we'll talk a
little bit about that.

00:54:37.410 --> 00:54:40.050
And again, the only Nobel
Prize in computation

00:54:40.050 --> 00:54:42.720
was given for that, the
development of that theory.

00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.070
Now, there's one more
thing I need to talk about

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:52.030
before I move to just
a couple of examples

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:54.850
online that I'd
like to show you.

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:58.340
And that is that there's
something still missing here.

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:12.690
So we've got-- let's
see, we've got this 1s.

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:15.270
So now we know where
these things come from.

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:17.370
We really know where they
come from, the solution

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:18.720
to the hydrogen atom--

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:27.890
2p, 3s, and so on.

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:30.290
And then hydrogen would be what?

00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:31.730
How would I show hydrogen here?

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:36.310
Put an arrow there.

00:55:36.310 --> 00:55:39.160
What would helium be?

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.240
One more.

00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:42.190
OK, tell me carbon--

00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:43.590
I like carbon.

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:44.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:46.215
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Carbon is right here.

00:55:46.215 --> 00:55:47.740
It hits me in the
heart every time.

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:49.804
How many more?

00:55:49.804 --> 00:55:51.707
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:55:51.707 --> 00:55:53.040
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And then what?

00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:53.767
AUDIENCE: Two up.

00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:54.850
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Two up--

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:57.550
oh, why not like this?

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:58.050
No?

00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:01.640
It just feels wrong-- exclusion.

00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.120
Now we're talking.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:05.760
You guys already kind of
have a feeling for this.

00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.660
But actually, you
can have materials

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:10.400
that violate someone's rule.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.662
Anyone know what
that rule is called?

00:56:12.662 --> 00:56:13.787
AUDIENCE: Pauli exclusions.

00:56:13.787 --> 00:56:15.370
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, actually, this

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:16.760
doesn't violate
Pauli exclusions.

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:17.570
AUDIENCE: Hund's rule.

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.320
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Hund's rule-- very good,

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.800
whoever pulled that one out.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.150
That was good.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.870
But this is how
carbon usually looks.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:28.490
Now, something that
we've done here

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.370
is we've already done what
I'm about to tell you, which

00:56:31.370 --> 00:56:33.290
is we've put spin in there.

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:36.510
We've put those electrons
pointing up or down.

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:38.390
But we also have
those quantum numbers.

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:40.960
This is n.

00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.910
N equals 1.

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:48.970
This is n equals 2, and this
is l equals 0, l equals 0.

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:50.710
And this is p.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:55.720
So this is n equals
2, l equals 1.

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.860
And each one of these is an m.

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:04.710
m equals plus or minus 1 and 0.

00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:07.103
So that's why I have three p's.

00:57:07.103 --> 00:57:08.520
So those are those
quantum numbers

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:10.920
you get from quantizing the
solution to the Schrodinger

00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:14.280
equation for an electron
in the 1 over r potential.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.340
But there's this one more thing,
which was also very surprising

00:57:17.340 --> 00:57:19.710
at the time, which
is that if you

00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:22.230
put a particle, in
this case silver atoms,

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.440
if you think about electrons
as charges spinning,

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:27.987
you should have a reaction
to a magnetic field.

00:57:27.987 --> 00:57:29.445
They should have
a magnetic moment.

00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:35.220
But classically, you see, if
you have charged spinning,

00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:36.780
you get a magnetic field.

00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:41.040
Classically, if you shoot this
through a really large magnet,

00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:44.250
you should just get a whole
range of lines of fields.

00:57:44.250 --> 00:57:48.450
But just like the double slit,
it didn't turn out that way.

00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:53.360
You got two dots
instead, only two dots.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:54.460
And these are very famous.

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:56.290
These are the
Stern-Gerlach experiments,

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:58.810
which were done all
around the same time they

00:57:58.810 --> 00:58:00.190
were figuring all this out.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.000
And what it showed is that the
spin can only be up or down.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.850
It can only be two things.

00:58:06.850 --> 00:58:12.040
There's only two values for the
spin of an electron, the spin

00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:14.200
being the thing that's
causing this thing

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.830
to have a magnetic moment
that's causing it to react

00:58:17.830 --> 00:58:20.825
to the external magnetic field.

00:58:20.825 --> 00:58:23.260
You should get a line.

00:58:23.260 --> 00:58:25.090
You should get all this--

00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:28.900
classically, electrons should
have any spin they want.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:31.510
I don't know what that
was, but it should be

00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.400
able to point in any direction.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.040
But no, it can only point
this way or this way.

00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:39.170
Now, is an electron
really spinning?

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:43.810
If a charge is spinning,
it has a magnetic moment,

00:58:43.810 --> 00:58:45.445
but is an electron
really spinning?

00:58:49.770 --> 00:58:52.320
How does it have
a magnetic moment?

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.420
Let's talk.

00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:58.200
That's a really good
one, too, but it does.

00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.270
And you think about
it as spinning

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:06.060
because that is our classical
Maxwell sort of ENN framework.

00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.680
We think about charged spinning.

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.310
You've done it.

00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:12.930
You make current go through
a wire, and you get a field.

00:59:16.087 --> 00:59:17.670
And that's why we
use the word "spin."

00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:19.530
It's sort of like "orbital."

00:59:19.530 --> 00:59:21.810
Should we really be
using the word "orbital?"

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:25.110
Is this electron orbiting?

00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:27.000
No.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.950
And that's another
ice-breaking question.

00:59:29.950 --> 00:59:32.430
You go to your friend,
and you just say,

00:59:32.430 --> 00:59:36.150
do you think electrons
are really orbiting?

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:37.440
Just like that.

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:40.290
And see how many people say yes.

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:43.180
They kind of are
spinning in our minds.

00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:48.040
But the spin is up or down
because of those experiments.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.740
Now then, the sort
of end of the story--

00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:58.440
so they have a magnetic moment,
and it gives them up and down.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:01.770
And they can only
be up and down,

01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:04.690
only up and down, two values.

01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:09.850
And so what you have is sort
of a new quantum number.

01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:15.040
You have spin, which is
equal to plus or minus 1.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.890
That's that and that.

01:00:17.890 --> 01:00:19.360
So now each of
these-- and that's

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:21.490
why with these collections
of quantum numbers,

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:25.900
you can get that many
electrons into those shells.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:26.790
And I love this.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.998
So somebody said
"Pauli exclusion."

01:00:29.998 --> 01:00:32.290
Somebody tell me what the
Pauli exclusion principle is.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:35.597
Yes.

01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:37.680
AUDIENCE: Two fermions
can't be in the same state.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:41.400
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, so two
electrons, we'll just say,

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.470
which are fermions, cannot
be in the same state.

01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:47.370
And what do you mean
by the "same state?"

01:00:47.370 --> 01:00:53.970
AUDIENCE: That they can be in
sort of the same energy shell

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:56.880
with the same spin
at the same time.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.290
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK, very good.

01:00:58.290 --> 01:01:00.840
Basically what it means is
they cannot have the exact same

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.530
quantum numbers.

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:09.290
Pauli exclusion says
you cannot do this.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:12.290
Now, I mentioned you
can violate Hund's rule.

01:01:12.290 --> 01:01:15.410
And you can violate
Hund's rule by having

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.230
degenerate orbitals
with the same energy,

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:20.570
and doing it there.

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:21.920
But usually, you don't.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:25.640
Pauli exclusion is an
incredibly important aspect

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.720
of quantum mechanics.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:30.500
It says that no two
electrons, fermions,

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.720
can occupy the same
set of quantum numbers

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:33.830
when you include spin.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:40.560
That is what gives us literally
the periodic table and all

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.920
of chemistry when you add
that to quantum mechanics.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:49.370
That is what gives us the rest,
that plus the hydrogen atom.

01:01:49.370 --> 01:01:51.560
You don't need much
more, except you do.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:58.880
But I love this letter from
Thomas to Goudsmit in 1926.

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.850
"I think you and
Uhlenbeck"-- because they're

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:07.580
the ones that discovered
this stuff in working out

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:08.600
the theory--

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.030
"have been very lucky to
get your spinning electron

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:14.360
published and talked about
before Pauli heard of it.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.240
It appears that more
than a year ago, Kronig

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.820
believed in the
spinning electron

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.320
and worked out something.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.352
The first person he
showed it to was Pauli.

01:02:23.352 --> 01:02:26.450
Pauli ridiculed the
whole thing so much

01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:30.110
that the first person became
also the last, and no one else

01:02:30.110 --> 01:02:32.600
heard anything of
it, which all goes

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.900
to show that the
infallibility of the deity

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:39.770
does not extend to his
self-styled vicar on Earth."

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.140
So Pauli had an
interesting reputation.

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:50.340
But that is amazing to
me, because this is it.

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.640
This is one of the foundations
of the Pauli exclusion

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.690
principle, so Pauli built
his whole reputation

01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:00.300
and really made an
important contribution

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.790
because of what apparently
he didn't really

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:03.870
believe in at first.

01:03:03.870 --> 01:03:06.060
So it goes to show--
keep an open mind.

01:03:09.240 --> 01:03:12.660
So that's what we just said,
can't have the same quantum

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:13.620
numbers.

01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:16.710
Got to mix up the quantum
numbers, and that's it.

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.090
And that is it.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:22.290
You see, because now, we had all
these levels from the hydrogen

01:03:22.290 --> 01:03:24.180
atom solution--

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:30.240
an electron a one electron in
a simple 1 over r potential,

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:31.740
and we got all those levels.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.560
And now all we need
to do is fill them up.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:39.960
And with the Pauli exclusion
principle, we know the rules.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.760
We know the rules.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.140
We know we can only
put two electrons here.

01:03:44.140 --> 01:03:48.100
We know we can only
put two electrons in s

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.130
and six electrons
in p, so eight here.

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:54.480
We know we can only put
two, six, and how many in d?

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:06.790
10, because n goes from
minus 2 to plus 2, so 5.

01:04:06.790 --> 01:04:08.380
I mean, d has that.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:13.150
So that's starting to sound
a whole lot like this.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.190
That's it.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:19.320
Essentially, with those
fundamental principles

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.350
that were worked out in
the '20s, and the solution

01:04:22.350 --> 01:04:24.750
of the hydrogen atom,
you get essentially all

01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:26.900
of the periodic table.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.870
It's really powerful.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:31.310
It's pretty darn cool.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:35.570
And you can connect, as I said,
back to the spectral lines

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:36.990
and all of that.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:41.990
Now, what I want to spend
the last couple of minutes on

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:48.660
is I wanted to show you-- has
anybody looked at the quantum

01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.160
part?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:50.830
You guys are still doing
homework from the last part,

01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:51.330
right?

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:58.590
So on the NanoHUB, there is--

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:02.848
so you go to the
NanoHUB, and you go to--

01:05:02.848 --> 01:05:04.140
sorry, I should check this out.

01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:06.330
There I am.

01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:07.560
That's amazing.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:12.600
That's a picture from, like,
I won't say how long ago.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.140
That's embarrassing.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:16.830
So you go.

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:18.790
This is my personal thing.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.120
But anyway, the tool
you want is this one,

01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:22.900
and it has a little
star next to it.

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.850
That's so exciting.

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:28.210
It's called the "MIT Atomic
Scale Modeling Toolkit,"

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:31.910
formerly known as the Berkeley
Atomic Scale Modeling Toolkit,

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:35.290
because I developed
it at Berkeley.

01:05:35.290 --> 01:05:39.440
So much for that,
but it's now at MIT.

01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:42.170
And if you click that,
these are actually

01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:46.750
tools I developed for a class I
made up when I was at Berkeley,

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:49.480
when I valued
sunshine over science.

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.860
It doesn't say that.

01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:55.030
And you can launch it,
and you'll see that--

01:05:55.030 --> 01:05:56.810
and you can rate it a 10.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.640
Don't rate it anything else.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:03.260
But please rate it,
or don't rate it.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:07.800
Everybody is so star driven
these days, number of stars.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.270
What was that?

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:12.020
There was an NPR piece
the other day about

01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.500
how there's this whole business,
opportunity sprouting up,

01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:18.980
of people who have
companies, where all they do

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:22.100
is they get your number of
stars for your products high.

01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.827
So they have people
around the world,

01:06:23.827 --> 01:06:25.910
because you've got to do
it from different places,

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:29.570
and you've got to write
fake reviews of products,

01:06:29.570 --> 01:06:34.070
and have different fake
Google email addresses--

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:38.870
blowing me away, the
so-called internet.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:44.620
Now, you look here, and you
see that actually in this MIT

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.410
Atomic Scale Modeling Toolkit,
there are many things.

01:06:47.410 --> 01:06:48.340
There are many things.

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.660
We will be using
two tools from this,

01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:55.130
and both are quantum
mechanical tools.

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:59.350
One is going to be GAMESS, which
is a quantum chemistry package.

01:06:59.350 --> 01:06:59.870
It's free.

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:03.790
You can download it and run
it on your laptop, actually.

01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:05.710
And it's for
molecules and atoms.

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:09.750
And another is going
to be called SIESTA.

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:12.810
So you play games,
you take a siesta.

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:17.040
And this one, we're going
to use when we do solids.

01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.733
Both of them are going to
use an approximation called

01:07:19.733 --> 01:07:21.900
"density functional theory"
to solve the Schrodinger

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.010
equation for real materials.

01:07:24.010 --> 01:07:26.640
So let's just take, in the
last few minutes of class,

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.200
let's take a look at GAMESS.

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:31.030
And you can see--

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:34.440
why isn't it letting me-- it's
not letting me scroll down.

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:35.070
Seriously?

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:41.250
Oh, there's my scrollbar there.

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:45.158
OK, so the input is actually
pretty straightforward.

01:07:45.158 --> 01:07:47.450
So you can calculate the
energy or you can optimize it.

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:50.840
The method is going to be DFT,
Density Functional Theory.

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:53.540
The basis set is something
you'll learn about on Tuesday,

01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:57.930
what that is, but pick Medium.

01:07:57.930 --> 01:08:00.450
And then I want to
not have a solvent,

01:08:00.450 --> 01:08:03.650
but I want to plot
these orbitals.

01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:09.830
And then, I think it
disappeared again.

01:08:09.830 --> 01:08:12.840
Don't you guys love the NanoHUB?

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:16.220
It's so bug free.

01:08:16.220 --> 01:08:19.310
And now it's not dragging.

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:19.939
It's great.

01:08:19.939 --> 01:08:22.430
So what you can do
is you can do New,

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:26.520
and let's do the carbon
atom, my favorite one.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.569
And I'm going to--

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:30.850
do you guys know
about XYZ coordinates?

01:08:30.850 --> 01:08:33.229
So you put the number of
atoms in the top line.

01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:37.540
You leave the next line blank
or you write whatever you want.

01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.720
And, well, don't let me see some
of the things you might write.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.529
I don't know.

01:08:41.529 --> 01:08:44.795
And then you put the atoms
with their XYZ positions.

01:08:44.795 --> 01:08:46.420
So carbon is going
to be at the origin,

01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:47.830
and we click "Simulate."

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:48.880
And it's doing it.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.600
That's it.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.620
It just solved the Schrodinger
equation for carbon, something

01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.670
you couldn't do for
a million years--

01:08:55.670 --> 01:08:57.010
no, for 50 years--

01:08:57.010 --> 01:08:58.540
analytically.

01:08:58.540 --> 01:09:00.670
And it just did it.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:07.819
And now it's still
executing a script,

01:09:07.819 --> 01:09:11.529
which is very frustrating.

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:14.370
Is it this slow for you guys?

01:09:14.370 --> 01:09:17.170
This is one atom.

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:17.670
Man.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.529
Well, so we go back to here.

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:26.540
One thing you got
right there is you

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.800
got those energy levels, which
I can't scroll down to look at.

01:09:33.830 --> 01:09:40.220
This is so amazingly
frustrating.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:45.350
So now, what I'm going to
do, since it's not working,

01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:48.420
is I'm going to try it again.

01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:53.560
And I'll pick a
different basis, low.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.860
See if that works.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.110
And I just did the Schrodinger
equation for carbon.

01:09:59.110 --> 01:10:02.350
You've got to be kidding me.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:05.860
You've got to be kidding me.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.760
Really?

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.080
Seriously?

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.130
Let's try a different atom.

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:12.743
Let's try-- somebody
give me an atom.

01:10:12.743 --> 01:10:13.410
AUDIENCE: Boron.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:15.702
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: All right,
this is going to be lucky.

01:10:19.142 --> 01:10:20.100
This is going to do it.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:25.270
Oh, yeah, It's not
able to do it--

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:31.690
unbelievable.

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.530
Let me just try one more thing.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:40.580
I'm going to try
putting two atoms in.

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:41.740
Let's see if that helps.

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.810
And we'll optimize it.

01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:50.120
Yeah, now it is a party.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:58.590
Oh, OK, but did it
give me the orbitals?

01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:59.090
No.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.870
Hang on.

01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:05.890
Sorry, guys.

01:11:05.890 --> 01:11:07.620
Oh, it's still here.

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:19.200
Let's just see if it
gave me the orbitals.

01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.970
OK, there they are.

01:11:20.970 --> 01:11:24.660
OK, this is it.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:28.470
It was Firefox, which I never
use, but it came to the rescue

01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:29.220
for this one.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.200
So look at this,
just really quickly,

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:32.330
because if you want
to play with this,

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.955
this will just take
one minute to show.

01:11:33.955 --> 01:11:37.890
OK, there, I did
the carbon dimer.

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.890
That's a lot of electrons,
and it just solved it.

01:11:40.890 --> 01:11:43.650
Because of what you're
going to learn on Tuesday,

01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:45.780
the approximations,
it just solved it.

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.470
And look-- if you right
click on top of the image,

01:11:49.470 --> 01:11:51.690
you get surfaces, and
then you get orbitals.

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.040
And look at that--

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.976
that is actually-- what do
you think those two are?

01:11:56.976 --> 01:12:00.150
There are two
carbon atoms here--

01:12:00.150 --> 01:12:01.230
the s's.

01:12:01.230 --> 01:12:05.040
Those are those 1s's
together in the dimer.

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.300
And these are now the 2s and
p's, all bonding together.

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:11.100
And you want to
know how they look?

01:12:11.100 --> 01:12:16.350
Well, here's one of those s's.

01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:17.500
There it is.

01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.750
It's an S orbital in
the dimer, though.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:22.930
And it looks very much
like the atomic s orbital,

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:24.020
which it should.

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:24.520
Why?

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:31.490
Remember, those are the
ones we don't care about.

01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:34.370
They don't really do
anything when you bond.

01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:39.130
It's all about the other
ones, like for example,

01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:42.120
one of these p's.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:43.260
That's it.

01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.000
That's the solution
to the Schrodinger

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.620
equation for the carbon dimer.

01:12:46.620 --> 01:12:50.160
And that's where
that p-type orbital--

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:53.070
that's where the electron
in that level sits.

01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:54.330
And this is no longer an atom.

01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:55.830
You can do it for
the carbon atom,

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:58.320
and see the p orbitals
and the s orbitals,

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.780
but now when you
make a molecule,

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:04.830
things get more complicated,
and more and more complicated.

01:13:04.830 --> 01:13:07.440
So that'll be the tool we
use for our molecule things,

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.000
assuming it actually works.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.370
And if anyone has any
questions, email me.

01:13:14.370 --> 01:13:18.830
And remember, class next
Tuesday, but not next Thursday.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.510
PROFESSOR: So let's get started.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.160
So I'm going to lecture today,
Professor Zweback's away.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.180
And I just wanted to
say a couple of things,

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.140
just in case you
haven't noticed.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.950
We posted the
solutions for P-set 11.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.410
And then also later
in the week, we'll

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.920
post the solutions for the
extra problems that came along

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.330
with P-set 11, so you
can look at those.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.220
And also, there's two
past exams with solutions

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.220
also on the website now.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.110
So you can start
going through those.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.020
And also, there's a
formula sheet there.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.900
And if you've got
suggestions for things

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.983
that you think should be
on there that aren't, let

00:00:57.983 --> 00:01:01.810
us know and they probably
can be put on there.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.477
So I want to turn
back to what we

00:01:03.477 --> 00:01:05.810
were doing at the end of last
lecture, which was talking

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.850
about the spin-orbit coupling.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.240
And so this is a contribution
to our Hamiltonian

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.310
that looks like
spin of the electron

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.930
dotted into the angular
momentum that the electron has

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.310
around the proton in
the hydrogen atom.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.320
And so because of
this term we had

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.600
to change the complete set
of commuting observables

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.220
that we wanted to talk about.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.400
So we have now this
full Hamiltonian

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.570
that includes this piece that
has the Se dot L term in it.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.870
We have L squared, we
have the spin squared.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.480
But because of this piece,
Lz, which was previously

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.519
one of the quantum numbers we
used to classify things by,

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:48.310
that doesn't commute
with this term, right?

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.600
So here we have to
throw that one away.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.230
Similarly, we have
this throw away

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.210
the z component of
the electron spin.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.800
That doesn't commute
with this either.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.750
And what we replace
those by is actually

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.169
the J squared and
the Z component of J.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:13.582
So J is the vector sum
of the angular momentum

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:14.790
and the spin of the electron.

00:02:17.367 --> 00:02:18.575
And this is very interesting.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.230
This term does
something interesting.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.870
So if we look at--
let me go up here.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.469
If we remember the
hydrogen states

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:37.010
when we don't have
this term, there's

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.950
a state that has n
equals 2 and l equals 1.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.595
And you can think of
that as three states.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.360
And then we've got to
tensor that with the spin,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.400
so the spin of the electron
could be spin up or spin down.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.630
So there's a spin a half,
so this is two states.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.210
And so you've got a
total of six states

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.790
you're going to talk about.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.237
And now what we have
to do is classify these

00:03:10.237 --> 00:03:12.320
according to the quantum
numbers that are actually

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.360
preserved by the system.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.630
So we can't use Lz or Sz.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.330
We have to use J squared and Jz.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:29.150
So we've got a J
equals 3/2 multiplet--

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.680
and that's four states--
plus a J equals 1/2.

00:03:42.442 --> 00:03:44.400
And you can see the number
of states works out.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.180
We've got 3 times 2
is equal to 4 plus 2.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:56.150
And so this L dot S term takes
these original six states,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.190
which without this
interaction degenerate,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.770
and it splits them
into the four states

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:10.340
up here, and then
two states down here.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.050
The J equals 1/2, J equals 3/2.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.470
And we also worked
out the splittings.

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.620
If I do this, this is
plus h bar squared over 2.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.710
And this is minus h bar squared.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.340
So this gives you a splitting.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.630
Now this is not the only thing
that happens in hydrogen,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.680
because you probably all
know that the proton itself

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:41.650
has spin.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.580
The proton has a spin
1/2 particle, just

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.190
like the electron.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.890
It's even more
complicated because it's

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.760
a composite object.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:56.010
But that leads to additional
splittings in hydrogen.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.740
And so these ones,
this one here is

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.609
called the defined structure.

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:02.900
Or we can also talk about
the type hyperfine structure.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.180
So this is going to be a small
effect on top of this one.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.180
So we have the proton
that's spin 1/2,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.555
we have the electron
spin a half,

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:30.350
and then we have the relative
orbital angular momentum.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:39.070
And so the total
angular momentum,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:46.640
which is J, which is going to
be the sum of L plus the spin

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.480
of the electron plus the spin of
the proton, this is conserved.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.510
And the thing we were
talking about here

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.090
is actually not conserved.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.250
So once you worry about
the spin of the proton

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.370
you've got to look at the
total angular momentum.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.930
And that's what
will be conserved.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.200
And so our complete set
of commuting observables

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.810
is going to be a four
Hamiltonian, which we'll get to

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:23.000
in a moment, L squared
the spin squareds

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.800
of the proton and the
electron, and then J squared,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.850
and finally Jz is
the things that we're

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:33.666
going to end up
classifying states by.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.600
So we originally
thought about these two

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.790
here, and did a
coupling between those.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:45.970
It's pretty natural to
assume that there maybe

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.460
couplings between the
angular momentum and the spin

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.895
of the proton, which there are.

00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:53.270
But also there's going to be
a coupling between the spins

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.692
of the electron and the proton.

00:06:54.692 --> 00:06:57.150
And that's the one we're going
to talk about at the moment.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:03.200
The other one is there but we
won't go over it in any detail.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.770
So the proton and the electron
both spin 1/2 particles,

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:19.970
and they both have
magnetic dipole moments,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.610
which are proportional
to their spin.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.090
And so it's really a coupling
between these moments that

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.400
tells us what the effect of
this interaction is going to be.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.880
So we have the mu
of the electron

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.790
is equal to e over
me-- minus me--

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.900
times the spin of the electron.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.940
And mu of the proton is,
let me just write it as gp.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:07.550
And gp happens to have
the value of about 5.6.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.410
And this is actually
kind of interesting.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.320
So if you look at
the formula up here,

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.990
really I could have written this
as a g over 2, with g being 2.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.259
So for the electron, the g
factor is very close to 2.

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:23.050
This is because the
electron is essentially

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.120
a fundamental particle,
with no substructure.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.940
But the proton, which is
made up of quarks and gluons

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.770
flying around inside some
region, has a lot of structure.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:42.190
And so this is really
indicative of it

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.450
being a composite particle.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.410
Because a fundamental
spin 1/2 particle

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.040
should have this g being 2.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.420
So we've got these
two dipole moments.

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:01.970
And one way to
think about this is

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:04.360
you've got this
dipole of the proton.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.770
We're going to think
about the proton having

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.160
a little dipole charge--
sorry, dipole magnetic moment--

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.670
and this produces
a magnetic field.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.560
And the electron is sitting
in that magnetic field.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.290
And its spin can
couple to the field.

00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:23.851
So we're going to
have a Hamiltonian,

00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:26.040
a hyperfine
Hamiltonian, that looks

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.530
like minus mu of
the electron dotted

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:37.460
into a magnetic field produced
by the proton, which is going

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.840
to depend on r, on
where the electron is.

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.850
And you can simplify
this as just

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.930
e over m spin of
the electron dotted

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.600
into this B of the proton.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.890
So we need to know what
this dipole field is.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.730
And for that you really have
to go back to electromagnetism.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.780
And you've probably
seen this before.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.640
But let me just write it down,
and we won't derive it here.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.240
But let's go down here.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.030
This has a kind of
complicated form.

00:10:48.956 --> 00:10:50.580
So there's this piece,
and then there's

00:10:50.580 --> 00:11:03.330
another piece that looks like
8 pi over 3c squared mu p times

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.600
the delta function
at the origin.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.070
And so you think
about the dipole field

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:15.010
arising from a spinning
charge distribution here.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:18.010
So we've got a magnetic
dipole moment pointing up.

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:22.710
This produces a field
like this, a dipole type

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.930
field going this way.

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:26.630
So this is our B.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:30.430
And then inside here,
you should really

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.160
think of taking the limit as
this thing goes to 0 size.

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.710
And so in order to get the
right field in the middle,

00:11:37.710 --> 00:11:39.153
you need to have this term here.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:00.007
And so if you want to
see this being derived

00:12:00.007 --> 00:12:01.090
you can look in Griffiths.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:03.170
That does the
derivation of this.

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.320
But we will skip that.

00:12:10.222 --> 00:12:11.180
So we've got the field.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.160
And now we can put it
into our Hamiltonian.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.010
So it's mu e.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:30.670
So I could replace my
mu's with the spins.

00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:32.270
So I get some
factor out the front

00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:42.870
that looks like ge squared
over 2 Me Mp c squared.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:13:08.170
And then I get 1
over r cubed plus--

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.335
So just plugging those in we
get this Hamiltonian here.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:31.650
And let me just
simplify a little bit.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:35.520
Let's just call this thing q.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.150
And so this Hamiltonian
is going to be given by q.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:45.810
And I can write it as the i-th
component of the electron spin,

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:49.490
the j-th component
of the proton spin,

00:13:49.490 --> 00:14:17.850
dotted into r hat i hat
j minus-- So just taking

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.210
the common factors of the
spins components out the front.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.319
So if we've got
this, we want to ask

00:14:26.319 --> 00:14:28.360
what it's going to do to
the energy of the ground

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.320
state of hydrogen.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.280
So we're going to take
matrix elements of this

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.830
between the hydrogen
wave functions.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.767
So does anyone have
questions so far?

00:14:40.767 --> 00:14:41.267
Yes.

00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:43.022
AUDIENCE: Can you use
r as a [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:43.022 --> 00:14:43.980
PROFESSOR: Right right.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.310
So these are unit vectors
in the r direction.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.220
And this r is the length
of the vector, r vector.

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.160
The usual thing.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.490
So what we're going
to try and evaluate

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:02.815
is the expectation value.

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:18.220
So we're going to do this.

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.880
Because going back to the
start of last lecture,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.702
this is going to be
a small correction.

00:15:23.702 --> 00:15:25.910
And so we can work out its
contribution to the energy

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.300
by using the original
wave functions,

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.560
but just calculating
its matrix elements.

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:43.320
So we're going to
calculate-- and let me just

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.650
give this a name.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.370
This can be--

00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:26.220
So this is q, and
the ground state

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.580
has no angular dependents.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.320
So in fact, for
the ground state,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.891
I can just write this is
a function of r squared.

00:16:32.891 --> 00:16:35.250
For overtly excited
states I can't do that.

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.589
But for the ground
state that works.

00:16:37.589 --> 00:16:39.630
And then we have, so we've
got the wave function.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:44.170
And then in between them we have
to put this stuff over here.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:45.440
So let's put the there.

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:09.528
So one of these terms is
very easy to evaluate.

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.069
With this [INAUDIBLE]
function I just

00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:14.339
get the wave function
at the origin.

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.960
And the second term
is actually also

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.855
relatively easy to evaluate.

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:40.780
Who can tell me what this
integral over all three

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.030
directions of just
one direction?

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.200
What's that?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.100
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.130
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:51.380
And you can argue that by just
asking, well what can it be?

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.525
It's got to carry an
index, because there's

00:17:54.525 --> 00:17:56.494
an index on this
side of the equation.

00:17:56.494 --> 00:17:58.660
And there's no other vectors
around in this problem.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:18:02.440
So the only thing
it can be is 0.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:11.460
So if I do integral d3r of
ri rj, what can that be?

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:15.720
Sorry?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.130
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.380
PROFESSOR: 1?

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.110
No.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.530
So it's got two indices.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.280
So the thing on this
side of the equation

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.962
also has to have two indices.

00:18:25.962 --> 00:18:26.940
AUDIENCE: Delta ij?

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.630
PROFESSOR: Delta ij, very good.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:32.300
So the only thing that can
carry two indices is delta ij.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:34.090
And then there might
be some number here.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:48.010
And it actually
turns out that you

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.720
can do an even more
complicated integral.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:58.370
We can look at integral d3r
of ri rj sum f of r squared.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.150
And that is also
just some number,

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:05.550
which depends on what
f is, times delta ij.

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:12.160
And if you go along these lines
and actually look at this,

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.370
the difference between
the integral of this piece

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:18.400
and the integral of this piece
is actually a factor of 1/3.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.760
And so this actually
integrates to 0.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.570
So when I integrate
over this one,

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.090
I get something times delta ij.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.610
And that something
is actually 1/3.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:41.310
And so this term and this
term cancel in the integral.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:43.950
And so you just get the
delta function contributions.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:51.540
So you get some number
times Sei S delta ij.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:54.365
So it becomes Se dotted into Sp.

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.590
8 pi over 3.

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:09.090
And then it's psi
100 at the origin.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:18.900
So this we know, we've already
computed these radial wave

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.260
functions, and saw at
the origin this one

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:28.220
is actually 1 over pi
times the Bohr constant.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.270
And if you plug-in what Q is,
and what the Bohr constant is,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.540
you can just find out that
this whole thing ends up

00:20:38.540 --> 00:21:01.570
looking like 4/3
this gp and this

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:07.100
we can call delta e hyperfine.

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.010
So you end up with
a very simple thing.

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:11.390
And it's just proportional
to the dot product of the two

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.890
spins.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:26.500
So you've seen, essentially, you
saw this term in your homework.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.100
So we just assume that this
thing here came out of nowhere

00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:33.850
and was just some
number times Se dot Sp,

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.740
and this was a contribution
to your Hamiltonian.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.420
But now we actually know
where that comes from.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:48.250
And interestingly, this thing
here, this whole thing, it's

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.760
still an operator because
it's got these spins in it.

00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:01.580
And that's-- put a star next
to that because it's important.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:07.940
So now we need to ask, well what
are the real states of hydrogen

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.784
so they're where
we've got two spins?

00:22:09.784 --> 00:22:11.700
The spin of the proton,
they could be aligned,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.460
or they could be anti-aligned.

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.000
Oh, sorry.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.770
We have a question up there.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.040
AUDIENCE: Is that
np over np, or mu u?

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.490
PROFESSOR: No, me, mass.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.364
Mass of the electron
over mass of the proton.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:34.660
So you have to remember
that the spins of the proton

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.335
and the electron to can parallel
or they can be anti-parallel.

00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:40.090
Or they can be both down.

00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:43.780
And so we have to go
back and work out-- we

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:47.340
have to realize that
because of these terms

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:53.290
the z components of those spins
are not good quantum numbers.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.400
The only z component
that appears in our list

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:59.375
is Jz, so the total z
component of angular momentum.

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:06.620
So we need to go back and
do what you-- you probably

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.440
have done this to the P-set.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.080
But let's just do
it very quickly.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:17.310
We'll take those
two spin 1/2 things

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:23.020
and so let's make this
J1 and this is J2.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:32.970
And we're going to have J.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.520
So if I've got these two spins
I can make various things.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:45.770
I can write down-- And
if I've done this than

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.405
I should also write that the
m, the m quantum number that

00:23:49.405 --> 00:23:50.780
goes with the J
quantum number is

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.650
going to be equal to m1 plus m2.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:57.780
So this state here, because both
of the spins are pointing up,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.490
this is an m equals 1 state.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.650
And then we can also have
something like 1/2, 1/2.

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.090
You could have these two states.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.740
So they both have m equals 0.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:38.470
And then there's an m equals
minus 1, which is 1/2 this guy.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:45.500
So since this has m
equals 1, and 1/2 cross

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:51.770
1/2 is going to give us a
spin 0 multiplet and a spin 1

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:56.180
multiplet, because
it's got m equals 1,

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.950
this has to be J
equals 1 as well.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:01.190
And this one has
to be J equals 1.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:03.970
But the two states
in the middle,

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.830
we don't know what those are.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.300
There's going to
be a J equals 1,

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.110
m equals 0 state,
which is going to be

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.350
some linear combination
of these two.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:20.955
So let's just go over here.

00:25:20.955 --> 00:25:22.060
We don't need any of this.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:31.290
And we need to work out what
the linear combination is.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:34.740
So something to
remember is this.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.451
The J plus or minus acting on
Jm is this funny square root

00:25:39.451 --> 00:25:39.950
thing.

00:25:52.111 --> 00:25:54.110
So these are the raising
and lowering operators.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.346
They take us from one state
to the one with a different m

00:25:57.346 --> 00:25:57.845
value.

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.130
And so we can use
that to start with.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.925
We could basically take
J minus on our state.

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:12.960
And according to
this formula, this

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:23.160
will give us the square root
of 1 times 2 minus m is 1.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.030
And this should be 0, right?

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:38.490
I think I've got this
sign up the wrong way.

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.460
I think this is minus plus.

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:46.950
No, sorry, that's right.

00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:49.980
It should be-- I'm
doing the J minus

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:57.300
so I have 1 times 1 minus--
yeah, right, so it's this.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:03.370
So this is square root
2 times Jm minus 1.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:10.150
But we also know that J minus
a is equal to J1 minus plus J2

00:27:10.150 --> 00:27:17.310
minus because J is just the
vector sum of the two J's.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:26.230
So we can ask what J
minus on the state is.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:30.440
But this state we can write in
terms of the tensor product.

00:27:38.612 --> 00:27:45.220
So this is equal to J1 minus 1.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.140
If we use this formula
for lowering something

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:18.100
with spin 1/2 we get 1/2 times
3/2 minus 1/2 times minus 1/2,

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.360
which is actually 1
under that square root.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:28.740
And so this actually equals
1/2 minus 1/2 tensor 1/2, 1/2.

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:45.520
So these two things are equal.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.220
And so that tells us, in
fact, that the 1, 0 state,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.331
which is what's over
here-- oh, sorry.

00:28:54.331 --> 00:28:55.350
Oh, why did I do that?

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:59.610
This should be J
equals 1 and M equals

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:03.600
what it was, minus 1, this.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.830
So the 1, 0 state, if we
bring that 1 over root 2

00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:26.860
on the other side
is this combination.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:28.995
So it's one linear combination
of those two pieces.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.510
We also want the other one.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:36.990
So we've got three
of our states.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:38.540
The fourth state
is then, of course,

00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:44.480
the other linear combination
of the two states over there.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:49.050
And so that's going to be our
J equals 0, M equals 0 state.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:30:01.070
So this state is going to be
orthogonal to the one we've

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.450
just written here.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.480
And so this is pretty
easy to work out.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.000
Since there's only
two terms, all we

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.840
do is change the
sign of one of them

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:11.705
and it becomes orthogonal,
because these states here

00:30:11.705 --> 00:30:12.560
are normalized.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:20.602
So this becomes
1/2, 1/2 tensor--

00:30:20.602 --> 00:30:24.070
let me just write it
in the same way that--

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.125
1/2 minus 1/2 minus--

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:42.410
And so our four states, so
we can condense our notation

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:49.340
so we can say that this state
we can just label as this.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:57.710
And we can just label
as a down arrow.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:11.240
And then something like we can
label as just up down, just

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:14.140
to make everything compact.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.230
You just have to remember
that this is referring

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.605
to the first spin,
this is always

00:31:17.605 --> 00:31:19.760
referring to the second spin.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:21.500
And so then we can
write our multiplets.

00:31:24.105 --> 00:31:25.840
J equals 1 has three states.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:28.720
It has up, up.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:37.540
It has up, down plus down, up.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:41.200
And it has down, down.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.830
So those are our three
states that have J equals 1.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:48.320
And then we have
J equals 0, which

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:57.861
just has 1 over square root
2 up, down minus down, up.

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:03.050
And so the two spins
in our hydrogen

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:05.270
atom, the spin of the
proton and the electron,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:10.020
can combine to be a J equals
1 or a J equals 0 system.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.600
And since we're talking about
the ground state of hydrogen,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:15.680
it has 0 angular momentum.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.610
And so I'm really just
talking about J total, here.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.490
So if we now have this
Hamiltonian, which is still

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:33.540
an operator in
spin-- we've dealt

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:36.860
with the spacial dependence
of the wave functions,

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:39.210
but it's still an
operator in spin--

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:42.090
we can now evaluate this.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:51.840
So we can take its expectation
value in either the J equals 1

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.940
multiplet or the J
equals 0 multiplet.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.380
So let's just
write it out again.

00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:04.610
So we have h hyperfine 1, 0, 0.

00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:12.039
This is equal to some delta E
HF spin of the electron dotted

00:33:12.039 --> 00:33:13.205
into the spin of the proton.

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:20.260
We can rewrite this using
something we did last time.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:31.520
We can write this as J
squared minus Se squared

00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:36.730
minus Sp squared, with
the 1/2 out the front.

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:42.790
So here, because l equals 0
because we're in the ground

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:48.634
state, then J equals Se plus Sp.

00:33:48.634 --> 00:33:51.030
And so J squared
is going to give us

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:55.860
Se squared, Sp squared,
and then the dot product.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.910
So great.

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.650
So what is this, the spin
squared of the electron?

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:11.880
What's the eigenvalue
of J squared, always?

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:16.170
J, J plus 1 times h bar squared.

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:18.376
And what is J for the electron?

00:34:18.376 --> 00:34:19.079
1/2.

00:34:19.079 --> 00:34:21.302
And what about the proton?

00:34:21.302 --> 00:34:22.218
AUDIENCE: 1/2 as well.

00:34:22.218 --> 00:34:22.843
PROFESSOR: 1/2.

00:34:22.843 --> 00:34:25.949
So we've got 1/2 times
1/2 plus 1, so 3/2.

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:28.330
So this gives us minus 3/4.

00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:30.790
This gives us minus 3/4.

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:35.399
So this just looks
like delta e HF

00:34:35.399 --> 00:34:44.989
over 2 J squared minus
3/2 h bar squared.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:45.489
OK?

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.420
Anyone lost doing that?

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:50.587
Or is that OK?

00:34:50.587 --> 00:34:51.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.980
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:58.150
AUDIENCE: So, when you
define delta e [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:58.150 --> 00:35:00.564
over there, that exudes energy?

00:35:00.564 --> 00:35:01.730
PROFESSOR: Oh, you're right.

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:02.840
You're very right.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.471
I've messed up.

00:35:03.471 --> 00:35:03.970
I've--

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:08.750
PROFESSOR: Let me see.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:15.400
Yeah, really I have
an h bar squared here.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.460
I think I should have had an h
bar squared over there as well.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:27.545
Yeah.

00:35:27.545 --> 00:35:32.180
That should be over
h bar squared here.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.110
Thank you.

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:36.396
OK so--

00:35:36.396 --> 00:35:38.622
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:38.622 --> 00:35:39.330
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.016
AUDIENCE: When does
it get [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:43.016 --> 00:35:44.640
PROFESSOR: That was
just in the algebra

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:48.820
going from this expression,
writing it in terms of alpha,

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:49.560
things like that.

00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.850
So it's just some algebra.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.585
OK, anything else?

00:35:56.585 --> 00:35:57.085
No?

00:35:57.085 --> 00:35:57.585
Good.

00:35:57.585 --> 00:36:02.330
OK so now we can easily
evaluate these things.

00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:17.040
We can now take J
equals 1 and some M--

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:22.650
and this is for M equals all
three states here-- and just

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:24.310
evaluate this.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.250
And all that means is
we have this J squared

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:29.170
operator acting on
this state here.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.680
And this gives us h bar
squared 1 times 1 plus 1,

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.730
or 2h bar squared.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:42.390
So this will give us
delta e hyperfine over 2.

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:45.010
And then we've got, let's
pull the-- sorry there's still

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:51.290
and h bar squared here,
and an h bar squared there.

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:54.130
But now we can evaluate.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.060
The h bar squared
here cancels that one,

00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:02.750
and we get a 1 times
a 1 plus 1 minus 3/2.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:05.730
And that's just one
quarter, which is--

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:27.050
And similarly we can take
the J equals 0 state,

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:33.880
and this one gives us
delta e hyperfine over 2.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.515
And then it's 0
time 1 minus 3/2.

00:37:38.515 --> 00:37:43.180
And so that equals
minus 3/4 EHF.

00:37:48.206 --> 00:37:49.580
So what we're
doing is evaluating

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.151
these in these
particular J states.

00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:53.400
And now we end up with
something that's just a number.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.690
It's no longer an operator.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.650
It's an energy that
we can measure.

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:58.400
Yeah?

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.400
AUDIENCE: So, this
expectation value

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:04.817
h hyperfine 1, 0, 0,
is still an operator.

00:38:04.817 --> 00:38:06.900
Is that because we only
took the expectation value

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.900
over the angular [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.060
PROFESSOR: We took over
the spacial wave function.

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:13.780
We did the r integral, right?

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.480
But we didn't--

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:15.355
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:15.355 --> 00:38:16.831
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

00:38:16.831 --> 00:38:17.330
Yeah.

00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:22.935
So this is actually a
really important system.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:35.880
So let's just draw the
energy level diagram here.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.800
And here we have four states.

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.860
We have the spin
1/2 times spin 1/2.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.230
So 2 times 2 states.

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:45.210
So we get a triplet
and a singlet.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:47.040
And what this hyperfine
splitting does

00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:53.070
is take those four states and
split the triplet up here,

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:56.270
and split the singlet down here.

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.792
And this gap we
can see is-- oops,

00:38:59.792 --> 00:39:03.380
so this should be a delta HF.

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:08.150
So this gap is delta E HF.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.245
So it's 1/4 and minus 3/4.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:19.070
And if you plug
numbers in, delta E HF,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:26.330
this actually ends up being
5.9 times 10 to the minus 6

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:32.620
electron volts, which
is a pretty small scale.

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.590
So you should be comparing
that to the binding energy

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:39.550
of the ground state of hydrogen
of 13.6 electron volts.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.750
So this is a very small effect.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:44.890
And you can really think
about the relative size.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:52.550
So the Bohr energy, so
that 13.6, formally this

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:58.060
goes like, alpha squared
times Me c squared.

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:06.200
Then last time we talked about
the S coupling, so the spin

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:10.625
orbit, or fine structure.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:19.162
And so this one we found went
like alpha to the fourth Me C

00:40:19.162 --> 00:40:20.660
squared.

00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:23.180
So smaller than
the binding energy

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:28.070
by a factor of 1 over 137
squared, or about 20,000.

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:29.800
And then this one
that we're talking

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:39.210
about here, the hyperfine,
this, if you look over here,

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.660
this is going like
alpha to the fourth Me C

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:46.780
squared times an additional
factor of Me over Mp.

00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.820
And the mass of the proton
is about 2,000 times

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:53.240
the mass of the electron.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.710
And so this again
is-- oh, sorry.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.320
This is alpha to the fourth.

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:03.210
So this is suppressed by
about another factor of 2,000.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:05.270
You can go further.

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.440
There are further
corrections to this

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.620
in something called
the Lamb shift, which

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.740
we won't say
anything else about.

00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.700
This goes like alpha to
the fifth Me C squared.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:18.260
And there's a whole host of
higher order corrections.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.520
People actually calculate
these energy levels

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.530
to very high precision.

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:25.650
But we won't do any more.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:33.850
So this transition
here is actually

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.200
astrophysically
extremely important.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.170
So if we think about something
sitting in the state here,

00:41:39.170 --> 00:41:43.890
it can decay down to the ground
state by emitting a photon.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:51.765
So we can decay from J equals
1 to J equals 0 by a photon.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:01.030
And that photon will
have a wavelength

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.830
that corresponds exactly
to this energy difference.

00:42:04.830 --> 00:42:07.230
And so that wavelength
is going to be,

00:42:07.230 --> 00:42:10.970
we can write it as c
over the frequency,

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:18.040
or hc-- oh, hc not h bar c--
hc over this delta e hyperfine.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:21.510
If you plug numbers
into this you

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:29.660
find out that this is
approximately 21.1 centimeters.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:38.540
And the frequency
is 1,420 megahertz.

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:40.880
And so right in
the middle-- well,

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.740
at the end-- of the
FM band in radio.

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.400
So theses are radio waves.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:52.750
So the size of this wavelength
is firstly important

00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:55.690
because it's large compared
to the size of dust

00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:56.910
in the universe.

00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:58.640
So dust is little stuff.

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.230
So this is essentially
goes straight through dust.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.860
So these photons will go
straight through dust.

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:10.910
The other important thing
is that you probably

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.170
know that there's a cosmic
microwave background

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:17.490
radiation in the universe,
that's essentially very

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:18.710
close to constant everywhere.

00:43:28.181 --> 00:43:29.680
And so we have,
essentially, we have

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:36.070
a temperature of 2.7 Kelvin.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:43.760
That corresponds to photons
with an energy kT, which

00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:48.790
is about 0.2 times 10 to
the minus 3 electron volts.

00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:51.830
So milli electron volts.

00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:56.550
But if you compare this
number to what we have here,

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:00.250
this cosmic background
microwave radiation

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:03.570
can excite hydrogen
from here up to here.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.555
There's enough energy
for one of those photons

00:44:05.555 --> 00:44:07.380
to come along, knock
the hydrogen atom,

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:09.270
and excite it up to here.

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:11.940
And then it will
decay and will emit

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:18.110
this beautiful 21
centimeter line,

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:19.680
which will go
through all the dust.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.721
And so we can actually see the
universe in this 21 centimeter

00:44:22.721 --> 00:44:23.220
line.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:31.490
Even more remarkable is,
we can't calculate this

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.360
at the moment, but you
can show that the lifetime

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:42.470
for this transition to happen
is about 10 to the 7 years.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:49.740
So we can never
measure that in a lab.

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:53.985
But because these
hydrogen atoms can

00:44:53.985 --> 00:44:55.360
be wandering around
the universe,

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:58.870
not interacting for that
long, then they can emit.

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:01.620
And so we can see that.

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:05.120
This was first
observed in about 1951,

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.340
and is the first
way that we actually

00:45:07.340 --> 00:45:12.130
saw that the galaxy
had spiral shaped arms.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:13.700
So it's pretty important.

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.120
And another nice
thing about this

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:19.020
is if you think about
another galaxy--

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.570
so let me just draw
another galaxy, a spiral

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:25.580
galaxy somewhere
else, like this.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:29.750
Let's have us over here looking
at this galaxy from side on.

00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.660
This galaxy is rotating.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:34.560
So this one's moving this way,
this one to moving this way.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.870
There's hydrogen over
here and over here.

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.170
And so we get these
photons coming over here,

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.840
and photons coming
to us from there.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.933
But what's going to be
different about these?

00:45:43.933 --> 00:45:44.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:45.810
PROFESSOR: Their
rate shifted, right?

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:46.770
The Doppler shifted.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:51.502
So this is my 21
centimeter photon.

00:45:51.502 --> 00:45:52.710
But they get Doppler shifted.

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:54.500
And so we can measure
the difference

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.190
in the frequencies of those.

00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:58.725
What does that tell us?

00:45:58.725 --> 00:46:00.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:03.710
PROFESSOR: How fast this
galaxy is spinning, right?

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.090
And so one very
interesting thing

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:08.050
you find from that is if
you look at the galaxy

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.820
and count how many
stars are in it,

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.130
and essentially
work out how massive

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:15.910
that galaxy is, the
speed of rotation

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.750
here is actually-- that you
measure from these hydrogen

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.480
lines-- is that
it's actually faster

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:26.740
than the escape
velocity of the matter.

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.930
And so if all that was there
was the visible matter, then

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:32.630
the thing would just fall apart.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.421
And so this actually
tells you that there's

00:46:34.421 --> 00:46:37.650
dark matter that
doesn't interact

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:43.860
with visible light, that's
kind of all over here.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.740
So that's kind of a
pretty interesting thing.

00:46:48.580 --> 00:46:53.450
So that, I think, yeah.

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.074
So any questions about that?

00:46:55.074 --> 00:46:56.740
We're going to move
on to another topic.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:00.270
Yep?

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.853
AUDIENCE: You said
earlier [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:01.853 --> 00:47:02.820
it's 10 to the 7 years.

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:05.907
Does that mean it
takes an average of 10

00:47:05.907 --> 00:47:09.792
to the 7 years for the cosmic
microwave background energy

00:47:09.792 --> 00:47:13.450
to shift back [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:13.450 --> 00:47:15.600
PROFESSOR: No, it's
really, if I just

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.487
took hydrogen in this state,
and took a sample of it,

00:47:18.487 --> 00:47:20.320
that's how long it would
take for half of it

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.240
to have gone and made the decay.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.125
So it can happen much faster.

00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:30.090
And there's a lot of
it in the universe.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.730
So there's many more
than 10 to the 7 atoms

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:34.900
of hydrogen in the universe.

00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:37.800
So we see more than one of
these things every year.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.870
So if you were just
looking at one of them

00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:42.794
you would have to
wait a long time.

00:47:42.794 --> 00:47:45.335
AUDIENCE: But the thing about
the cosmic microwave background

00:47:45.335 --> 00:47:49.220
is to go from [INAUDIBLE] from
0 to 0 up to get [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:51.282
PROFESSOR: Right so I
mean the energy is large

00:47:51.282 --> 00:47:51.990
compared to that.

00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:54.709
So it will typically knock you
up into an even higher state.

00:47:54.709 --> 00:47:56.250
And then you will
kind of decay down.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:59.000
But then this last decay
is-- because this lifetime

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.500
is very long, the width of this
line is also very, very narrow.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:10.510
So now let's talk more about
adding angular momenta.

00:48:13.235 --> 00:48:14.855
Oh, maybe I should
have left that up.

00:48:14.855 --> 00:48:15.355
Too late.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:35.060
So we're going to do this
in a more general sense.

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:38.050
So we're going to
take J1, some spin

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:51.520
J1 that has states J1, M1,
with M1 equals minus J up to J.

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.680
And so we're sort of
talking about something

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:56.600
like the electron in
the hydrogen atom.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.967
And so that's not in any
particular orbital angular

00:48:59.967 --> 00:49:00.466
momentum.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:05.450
So we can talk about
that the Hilbert space

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:06.600
that this thing lives in.

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:15.710
So we can think about particle
1 with angular momentum J1.

00:49:15.710 --> 00:49:20.430
And this is basically
spanned by the states

00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:25.940
J1, M1 of these [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:32.640
We can take another
system with another J2,

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:41.198
and this is going to have
states J2, M2, with M2-- that

00:49:41.198 --> 00:49:44.800
should be J1's there.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.600
And that would similarly
talk about some Hilbert space

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.110
of some fixed angular momentum.

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:54.110
If we want to talk about
the electron in a hydrogen

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.690
atom, where it doesn't have a
fixed angular momentum, what we

00:49:56.690 --> 00:50:00.140
really want to talk about
is the Hilbert space H1,

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.470
which is the sum over J1
of these Hilbert spaces.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.870
And so this is talking
about-- this Hilbert space

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:12.610
contains every
state the electron

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.920
can have in a hydrogen atom.

00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.350
It can have all the
different angular momenta.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:21.430
And similarly we
could do that for J2.

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:29.850
We can define J, which is J1
plus J2, as you might guess.

00:50:29.850 --> 00:50:35.440
And really this you should
think of as J1 tensor

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:45.290
the identity plus the identity
tensor J2, where this one is

00:50:45.290 --> 00:50:47.370
acting on things in
this Hilbert space,

00:50:47.370 --> 00:50:50.170
and the 1 here is acting on
things in this Hilbert space.

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:55.830
And similarly there's
an H2, J2 that

00:50:55.830 --> 00:50:59.090
goes along with these guys.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.690
And so this
operator, this big J,

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:10.660
is something that
acts on vectors

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:21.835
in things in this
tensor product space.

00:51:24.730 --> 00:51:28.654
Actually I should
label this with a J1.

00:51:28.654 --> 00:51:30.880
It also acts on things
in the full space,

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.070
but we can talk
just about that one.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:48.140
So now we might
want to construct

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:49.330
a basis for this space.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:57.710
And we conversely construct
an uncoupled basis

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:01.230
which is just take the basis
elements of each of the spaces

00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:03.700
and multiply them.

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:10.000
So we would have J1, J2, M1, M2.

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:20.240
We'd have the states here.

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:24.285
And if we just ask
what our various--

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:43.230
J1 just gives us h bar
squared J, J plus 1.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:53:01.560
And this one gives us h bar M1
h bar squared times our state.

00:53:08.690 --> 00:53:11.420
And so we can think
about all of these.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:13.347
And this is what we
label our state with.

00:53:13.347 --> 00:53:15.180
And that's because these
form a complete set

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.221
of commuting observables.

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.820
And we'll just call
this the A set.

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:38.090
We can also talk
about our operator J

00:53:38.090 --> 00:53:39.620
and use that to
define our basis.

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:49.690
And let's just be
a little explicit

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.760
about what J squared
is going to be.

00:53:51.760 --> 00:54:01.620
So this is J1 tensor
identity plus 1 tensor J2.

00:54:06.004 --> 00:54:07.590
And the same thing here.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:19.530
If you expand this out you
get J1 squared tensor identity

00:54:19.530 --> 00:54:26.380
plus 1 tensor J2 squared
plus the dot product, which

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:34.020
we can write as the
sum of J1k tensor J2k.

00:54:37.880 --> 00:54:42.030
And because of this
piece here, J squared

00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:45.857
doesn't commute with
J1z, for example.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:55.410
So we can't add this
operator to our list

00:54:55.410 --> 00:54:56.600
of operators over there.

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:07.262
And similarly J2z J
squared is not equal to 0.

00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:08.970
So if we want to talk
about this operator

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.740
we have to throw
both of those away.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:22.290
But there is an operator
total Jz that commutes with J

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:23.060
squared.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:27.320
And it also commutes with
J1 squared and J2 squared.

00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:32.470
And so we can have
another complete set

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:35.110
of commuting
observables B that's

00:55:35.110 --> 00:55:43.490
equal to J1 squared, J2
squared, J squared, and Jz.

00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:58.630
And so if there are observables
then the natural basis

00:55:58.630 --> 00:56:01.540
is to label them by
the eigenvalues here.

00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:20.230
So we're going to have a
J1, a J2, then a J and an M.

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:23.050
And so this is
the coupled basis.

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:27.550
Now both of these
bases are equally good.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.940
They both span the full space.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.180
They're both
orthogonal, orthonormal.

00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:47.810
And so we can actually
write one basis

00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:50.110
into in terms of the other one.

00:56:50.110 --> 00:56:52.284
And that's the generic
problem that we

00:56:52.284 --> 00:56:53.700
are trying to do
when we're trying

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.500
to write what we did
over here before,

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:58.070
when we did spin
1/2 cross spin 1/2.

00:56:58.070 --> 00:57:01.530
We're trying to write
those products states

00:57:01.530 --> 00:57:03.530
in terms of the coupled basis.

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.350
Well, they're both
orthonormal basis.

00:57:27.590 --> 00:57:31.830
So I can expand J1, J2.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:44.470
Well actually, maybe I'll
say one more thing first.

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:49.850
So being orthonormal means that,
for example, sum over J1, J2--

00:58:03.375 --> 00:58:04.700
This is 1, right?

00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:08.920
You can resolve the identity
in terms of these states.

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:17.000
And this is the identity
on this Hilbert space.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.100
I can also think about
the identity just

00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:25.190
on this smaller Hilbert space,
where the J1 and J2 are fixed.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:39.905
And so I can actually write
it's the identity operator.

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:56.750
So because every
state in this space

00:58:56.750 --> 00:59:00.130
has J1 equal to some fixed
value and J2 equal to some fixed

00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:03.090
value, then an
identity in that thing

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:07.240
is just somewhere over the M's,
because they're the only things

00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.570
there.

00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:17.420
So using this, because I
know that the state J1, J2,

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:21.280
Jm has some fixed
value of J1 and J2,

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:23.160
I can write this as a sum.

00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:30.275
I can use this form
of the identity.

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:50.010
So I've written my coupled basis
in terms of the uncoupled basis

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:50.980
here.

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:53.110
And these are just coefficients.

00:59:53.110 --> 01:00:02.005
These are called
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:07.710
They're just numbers like square
root 2 and things like this.

01:00:07.710 --> 01:00:11.095
And I tell you how to
do this decomposition.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:21.415
So they have various properties.

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.810
Firstly, sometimes
you also see them

01:00:26.810 --> 01:00:41.120
written as C of
J1J2J colon M1M2M

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.230
and various other notations.

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:45.631
So basically things
with six indices

01:00:45.631 --> 01:00:47.130
are probably going
to be these guys.

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:54.280
So they have various properties.

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:11.830
The first property
is they vanish

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:19.210
if M is not equal to M1 plus M2.

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.185
And this is actually
very easy to prove.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:32.570
So remember that Jz is just
going to be J1z plus J2z.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:42.895
So as an operator I can
write Jz minus J1z minus J2z.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.205
And what is that operator?

01:01:53.054 --> 01:01:54.355
It's just 0, right?

01:01:57.119 --> 01:01:58.035
This is equal to that.

01:01:58.035 --> 01:01:59.300
So this is 0.

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:03.010
So I can put this 0 anywhere
I want and I'll still get 0.

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:09.100
So let's put this between--
so this is 0-- put it

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:15.610
between J1, J2, Jm on this side.

01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:17.510
So a coupled state here.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.140
And on this side I'll put it
between the uncoupled state,

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:22.920
J1, J2, M1, M2.

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:32.520
So this state is an
eigenstate of Jz.

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:36.620
And this state is an
eigenstate of J1z and J2z.

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:40.600
So I can act to
the right with Jz,

01:02:40.600 --> 01:02:44.100
and act to the left
with these J1z and J2z,

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.595
and they have mission operators.

01:02:46.595 --> 01:02:50.830
And I know because this is
0, this whole thing is 0.

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:53.030
So then act this
one on these guys

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:56.040
and these two back this way.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.737
And so you see that
gives me h bar.

01:03:00.737 --> 01:03:02.320
And then I get this
one acting on here

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.925
gives me M. And J1 acting
on here gives me M1.

01:03:23.285 --> 01:03:29.820
And if M is not equal to M1
plus M2, then this term isn't 0.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:33.997
But the whole thing is
so that has to be 0.

01:03:33.997 --> 01:03:36.310
So that's QED.

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:29.760
The second property is that--
So they only allow values of J

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.660
fall in this range here.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:36.590
And each J occurs once.

01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:43.640
Now one way to
think about this is

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.800
to think of these
things as vectors.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.550
So you have vector J1, and
then from the point of this

01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:52.785
you can have vector J2.

01:04:52.785 --> 01:04:55.690
But it can go into an
arbitrary direction.

01:04:55.690 --> 01:05:00.400
So it can go up here,
or it can go like this.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.570
These are meant to
be the same length.

01:05:02.570 --> 01:05:04.430
And I can come all
the way down here.

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:10.390
But I can could only
sit on integer points.

01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:12.090
And so this is kind of J2.

01:05:12.090 --> 01:05:15.660
And so the length of this thing
here would be the length of J1

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.700
plus the length of J2.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.870
So it would be this.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.460
And then the length of up
to here would be this one.

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:25.810
And then all of the other
ones are in between.

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:29.690
But you can also just
look at the multiplicities

01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:30.840
of the different states.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:37.510
So if we look at the
uncoupled basis--

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:42.242
so the first state,
which was J equals J1,

01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:47.820
there are two J1 plus
1 states, because it

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:52.480
can have all of the M values
from J1 down to minus J1.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:57.600
And the other one can
have two J2 plus 1 states.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.780
So that's the total number of
states that I expect to have.

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:05.070
So now let's assume
this is correct

01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:09.120
and ask what the N coupled is.

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:18.591
So this would be the sum over
J equals mod J1 minus J2 up

01:06:18.591 --> 01:06:23.900
to J1 plus J2 of 2J plus 1.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:29.405
And let's assume that J1 is
greater than or equal to J2,

01:06:29.405 --> 01:06:34.880
just to stop writing
absolute values all the time.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:39.860
So we can write this as
the difference of two sums,

01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:47.700
J equals 0 to J1 of--
J1 plus J2-- of 2J

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:52.130
plus 1 minus the
sum of J equals 0

01:06:52.130 --> 01:07:00.650
to J equals J1 minus J2
minus 1 of 2J plus 1.

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:07.680
And if you go through-- so
this is just N,N plus 1 over 2

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.070
for each of these things.

01:07:10.070 --> 01:07:30.639
You end up with, well,
you end up with this.

01:07:30.639 --> 01:07:31.930
You end up with the same thing.

01:07:31.930 --> 01:07:33.705
And so this is at
least consistent

01:07:33.705 --> 01:07:36.730
that the number of
states that we have

01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:38.370
is consistent with
choosing this.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.010
One other thing we can do
is look at the top state,

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:50.135
and just see if that works.

01:07:53.040 --> 01:07:54.855
See if that has the
right properties.

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:09.008
So because we know that the
J1, J2, J equals J1 plus J2,

01:08:09.008 --> 01:08:11.240
M equals J1 plus J2.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:16.140
So the maximal state, the
only way we can make this

01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:25.600
is to take J1, J2, M1
equals J1, M2 equals J2.

01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:29.939
Our spins are completely aligned
in the total up direction.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:30.594
Yeah?

01:08:30.594 --> 01:08:33.010
AUDIENCE: Sir, would you be
able to write a little larger?

01:08:33.010 --> 01:08:34.560
PROFESSOR: Yes, sorry.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.420
OK, yeah.

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.670
That's why I like a big chalk.

01:08:36.670 --> 01:08:39.844
But we've run out of
big chalk, so I'll try.

01:08:44.450 --> 01:08:50.439
So we know, also,
that J squared is

01:08:50.439 --> 01:08:55.125
equal to J1 squared plus J2
squared plus the dot product.

01:09:00.779 --> 01:09:06.300
We can write that out as
J1 squared plus J2 squared

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:22.531
plus 2J1z J2z plus J1 plus J2
minus plus J1 minus J2 plus.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:30.569
And then we can ask what does
J squared on this state give?

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:46.039
And this is J1, J2, J1
plus J2, J1 plus J2.

01:09:48.913 --> 01:09:53.490
So J squared, so we know
what that should be.

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:58.940
That should return J1 plus J2
times J1 plus J2 plus 1 times

01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:02.140
h bar squared, because J
is the good quantum number.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:04.260
But let's let it
act on this piece.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:10.300
So this equals J1
squared plus J2

01:10:10.300 --> 01:10:25.140
squared plus 2J1z J2z plus J1
plus J2 minus plus J1 minus J2

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:32.406
plus acting on J1, J2, J1, J2.

01:10:32.406 --> 01:10:35.430
So this state here.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:37.410
So we know how that acts.

01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:39.520
So this one gives
us-- everything

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.290
gives us an h bar squared.

01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:46.390
This gives us J1 J1
plus 1, for this term,

01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:54.510
plus J2 J2 plus 1
for the second term.

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:57.970
Each of these gives us
the M quantum numbers.

01:10:57.970 --> 01:10:59.450
But that's J1 J2.

01:10:59.450 --> 01:11:05.930
So this is plus 2J1, J2.

01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:08.700
And now what does this one do?

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.661
J1 plus on this state.

01:11:10.661 --> 01:11:11.452
AUDIENCE: Kills it.

01:11:11.452 --> 01:11:12.577
PROFESSOR: Kills it, right.

01:11:12.577 --> 01:11:16.200
Because it's trying to
raise the M component of 1,

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:17.800
and it's already maximal.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.800
And this one, J2
plus, also kills it.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:25.250
So you get plus 0 plus
0 times the state.

01:11:29.460 --> 01:11:33.590
So if you rearrange all
of this you actually

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:44.300
find you can write
this as J1 plus J2, J1

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:52.030
plus J2 plus 1 times the
state, which is what you want.

01:11:55.400 --> 01:12:00.980
So the J squared operator acting
in the coupled basis gives--

01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:02.700
well, acting in
the uncoupled basis

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:04.658
gives you what you expect
in the coupled basis.

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:15.505
So now I need a big blackboard.

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:23.400
So let's do an example of
multiplying two things.

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.280
So let's write out a multiplet.

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:28.440
So we're going to
take J1, and we're

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.950
going to have J1
bigger than J2 here.

01:12:31.950 --> 01:12:38.130
So we've got J1
J1, J1 J1 minus 1.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:53.420
And then somewhere down here
I've got J1 and 2J2 minus J1.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:58.110
And then all the way
down to J1 minus J1.

01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:05.925
So this has two
J1 plus 1 states.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.660
And I'm going to tensor
that was another multiplet,

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.350
with my J2 multiplet, which
is going to be smaller.

01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:17.910
So I'm going to have J2 J2.

01:13:23.929 --> 01:13:25.220
Oh, maybe I'll put one more in.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:32.220
And down here we've
got J2 comma minus J2.

01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:40.175
And so here we have
two J2 plus 1 states.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:54.400
And importantly,
this left hand side

01:13:54.400 --> 01:14:03.775
has two J1 minus J2 more states
than the right hand side.

01:14:06.820 --> 01:14:11.830
Just counting those states
that's pretty obvious.

01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:14.840
So now let's start
multiplying these things,

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:22.680
and forming states of particular
values of M, the total M.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:29.730
So if we say we want M equals
J1 plus J2 what can we do?

01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:30.750
How can we make that?

01:14:35.590 --> 01:14:38.190
So we have to take the
top state in each case.

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:41.740
Because if I take this one
and I take this M value,

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.209
I can't get up to this, right?

01:14:43.209 --> 01:14:44.750
So there's only one
way to make this.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.370
So I'm going to draw
a diagram of this.

01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:54.120
We're going to have
a one state there.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:15:00.425
The next M value, J1 plus J2
minus 1, how can I make that?

01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:05.640
So I can start with
this state, and I

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:09.696
will multiply it
by this one, right?

01:15:09.696 --> 01:15:11.590
Or, what else can I do?

01:15:14.178 --> 01:15:15.678
AUDIENCE: Start
with the second down

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.810
on the left and
tensor with the top?

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:18.810
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:19.986
So I take those two.

01:15:19.986 --> 01:15:20.985
So there are two states.

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:29.320
And those two states are
just two linear combinations.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:33.165
So let me draw two dots
here, I can form two states.

01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:40.565
Keep going-- minus 2,
I get three states.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:51.470
And let me try and draw lines
here to guide this stuff.

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.910
OK, I'm not going to keep going.

01:15:57.910 --> 01:16:02.660
But at some point
we get-- what's

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.650
the largest number of
states of a given M

01:16:04.650 --> 01:16:07.536
I can make going to be?

01:16:07.536 --> 01:16:08.630
Can anyone see that?

01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.458
AUDIENCE: 2J2 plus 1?

01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:15.840
PROFESSOR: 2J2 plus
2, right, because I've

01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:18.820
got 2J2 plus 1 states here.

01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:21.210
And I'm taking one of
these plus one of these

01:16:21.210 --> 01:16:30.510
will give me-- so down here I'll
have an M equals-- what is it--

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:32.342
J1 minus J2.

01:16:32.342 --> 01:16:37.530
And here I have
2J2 plus 1 states.

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:41.320
And so let me kind of draw
some of these states in.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.735
And then dot, dot, dot.

01:16:42.735 --> 01:16:49.170
And then over here we
end up with this guy.

01:16:49.170 --> 01:16:51.955
So if I go down to the
next one, how many states?

01:16:56.630 --> 01:17:02.910
So to form those states I
was taking this top state

01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.280
with the bottom state here.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.640
That gives me J1
minus J2, right?

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.590
Or I was taking the second state
here with the second to bottom

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:11.200
state here, and so forth.

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.910
And then all the way up to here.

01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:20.020
Now if I then start shifting
things down in this side,

01:17:20.020 --> 01:17:22.950
but leave exactly the
same things over there,

01:17:22.950 --> 01:17:25.250
then I'll lower J by 1.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:29.030
And I'll keep doing it
until I hit the bottom.

01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:32.860
And because there's
this number of states

01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:35.906
more in the right hand side than
the left hand side-- hang on,

01:17:35.906 --> 01:17:37.030
let me just write this one.

01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:45.980
OK, we might need to
go onto the next board.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:47.740
So this keeps on
going until I get

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:53.750
to M equals-- I don't
remember the number-- M

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:58.780
equals J2 minus J1.

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:01.715
And there are 2J plus 2
plus 1 states of this.

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:14.560
And then once I do
that, then I start

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.810
having fewer and fewer states.

01:18:15.810 --> 01:18:17.190
Because I've gone
basically moving out

01:18:17.190 --> 01:18:18.398
the bottom of this multiplet.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:30.950
And so here we have, this is
2 J1 minus J2 plus 1 rows.

01:18:33.522 --> 01:18:34.730
And then I start contracting.

01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:44.700
So the next one, M equals
J2 minus J1 minus 1

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:46.035
has two J2 states.

01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:54.820
So then we can keep going.

01:18:58.090 --> 01:19:01.410
And this is meant to continue
this diagram up here.

01:19:01.410 --> 01:19:03.660
So then we keep going
down, down, down.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:11.600
And then we'd have M
equals minus J1 plus 1.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.545
And how many states can
I make that have that?

01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:24.460
So I need to take this one,
and I could take the-- oh,

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:25.930
where is it?

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:27.220
Sorry, not this.

01:19:27.220 --> 01:19:28.380
This is not what I mean.

01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:32.620
Minus J1 minus J2 plus 1.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:34.220
That's more obvious, right?

01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:35.170
So there's two states.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:42.120
And so this picture
has kind of-- this line

01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:43.340
starts coming in.

01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:45.140
And now I've got
my two states here.

01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:47.430
I have the next one,
I've got three states.

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:53.950
And then finally, M equals minus
J1 minus J2, I have one state.

01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:54.900
And so I get this.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.620
And so you actually-- oh,
that was not very well drawn.

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:07.160
So if you look how many states
there are in this first column,

01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:10.460
how many is going to be there?

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:16.050
So it goes from plus J1 plus
J2 to minus J1 minus J2.

01:20:16.050 --> 01:20:23.860
So there's two J1 plus
J2 plus 1 states there.

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:30.660
And here there is two
J1 plus J2 minus 1

01:20:30.660 --> 01:20:32.850
plus 1 states in this guy.

01:20:32.850 --> 01:20:36.730
And so this is a J
equals J1 plus J2.

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:42.650
This one is J equals
J1 plus J2 minus 1.

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:46.630
And if you are careful you'd
find that this one here,

01:20:46.630 --> 01:20:50.170
the last one here, this
has this many states in it,

01:20:50.170 --> 01:20:53.030
two J minus 1 plus 1 states.

01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:59.224
So this is a J
equals J1 minus J2.

01:20:59.224 --> 01:21:02.130
And to be completely
correct, we put

01:21:02.130 --> 01:21:04.530
an absolute value in case
J2 is bigger than J1.

01:21:07.710 --> 01:21:11.955
So this is our full multiplet
structure of this system.

01:21:11.955 --> 01:21:15.480
So all of the states
in this column

01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.945
will transform into each
other under rotations,

01:21:17.945 --> 01:21:18.820
and things like this.

01:21:18.820 --> 01:21:21.910
And same for each column, they
all form separate multiplets.

01:21:26.930 --> 01:21:36.000
So just some last
things before we finish.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.780
So another property
of Clebsch-Gordan

01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:49.330
coefficients we can
choose them to be real.

01:21:56.962 --> 01:22:05.580
They satisfy a
recursion relation

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.430
but don't have a
nice, closed form.

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.250
I think this is in Griffiths.

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:26.390
It gives you what this
recursion relation is.

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:30.230
I think it does, at
least many books do.

01:22:30.230 --> 01:22:36.515
And also, they're tabulated
in lots of places.

01:22:40.930 --> 01:22:42.400
So if you need to
know the values,

01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:43.680
you can just go
and look them up,

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.888
rather than trying to
calculate them all necessarily.

01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:52.720
And I think that's all
we've got time for.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:54.380
So are there any
questions about that?

01:22:56.994 --> 01:22:58.410
Any questions about
anything else?

01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:01.630
OK, great.

01:23:01.630 --> 01:23:05.190
So we will see you on
Wednesday for the last lecture.

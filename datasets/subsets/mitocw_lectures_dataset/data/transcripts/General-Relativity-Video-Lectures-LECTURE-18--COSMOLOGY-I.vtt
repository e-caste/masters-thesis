00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.080
SCOTT HUGHES: All right.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.840
So at this point we're
going to switch gears.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.030
Everything that we have done
over the past several lectures

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.970
has been in service
of the approach

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.100
to solving the Einstein
field equations in which we

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.510
assume a small perturbation
around an exact background.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.570
Most of it was spent looking at
perturbations around flat space

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.100
time.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.380
A little bit in the
last lecture we touched

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.510
on some of the mathematics
and some of the analysis

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.530
when you curve--

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.440
you expand around some
non-specified curved

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.640
background.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.280
I didn't tell you where that
curve background comes from.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.710
Today we'll be--
this lecture will

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.480
be the first one
in which we begin

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.820
thinking about different forms
of different kinds of solutions

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.340
that arise from
different principles.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.560
We're going to begin this
by studying cosmology.

00:01:03.464 --> 00:01:06.027
It's the large-scale
structure of the universe.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.810
So from the standpoint of--

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.270
from the standpoint of
the calculational toolkit

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.950
that we will be
using, this is going

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.060
to be the first
example of a spacetime

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.310
that we construct using
a symmetry argument.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.350
We are not going to
make any assumptions

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.970
that anything is weak or small
or any kind of approximation

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.770
can be--

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.900
any kind of an approximation
can be applied.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.610
What we're going to do is ask
ourselves, suppose spacetime--

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.020
at least spacetime on some
particular very large scales--

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.720
is restricted by
various symmetries.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.040
So we will apply various
restrictions to the equations

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:30.150
and to the spacetime
by the assumption

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.356
that certain symmetric
symmetries must hold.

00:02:33.356 --> 00:02:34.720
Let me reword this.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.470
By demanding that
certain symmetries hold.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.640
Doing so will
significantly reduce

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.630
the complicated non-linear
dynamics of the field equations

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.770
of general relativity.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.170
This will allow us to
reduce those complicated

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.362
generic equations into
something that is tractable.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.300
So let me describe--
whoops-- let's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.963
me give a little bit of
background to this discussion.

00:03:29.963 --> 00:03:31.380
Let me get some
better chalk, too.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.335
So as background,
I'm going to give

00:03:38.335 --> 00:03:40.210
a little bit of a synopsis
of some stuff that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.580
is described very nicely
in the textbook by Carroll.

00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.010
So for background,
part of what we're

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.690
going to consider
as we move into this

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.190
is a notion of what are called
maximally symmetric spaces.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.580
So I urge you to read
Section 3.9 of Carroll

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.610
for extensive
discussion of this.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.029
But the key concept of this
is that a maximally symmetric

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.990
space is a space that
has the largest number--

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.780
so let's say MSS,
maximally symmetric space,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:38.120
has the largest number of
allowed Killing vectors.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.170
If your space has
n dimensions, it

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.030
has n times n plus 1 over
2 such Killing vectors.

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.320
And recall, if you
do a lead derivative

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.140
of the metric along the
Killing vector, you get 0, OK?

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.560
So it's that these n
times m plus 1 Killing

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.590
vectors all define
ways in which, as you

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.240
sort of flow along
these vectors,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.960
spacetime is left unchanged.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:20.000
Intuitively, what these
do is define a spacetime

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.215
that is maximally homogeneous--

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:24.590
I shouldn't say
spacetime yet, we

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.870
haven't specified the
nature of this manifold.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.900
So this defines a space that
is maximally homogeneous.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.480
And homogeneous
means that just--

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.760
it has uniform properties
in all locations.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.460
And it is maximally isotopic.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.520
Which is a way of
saying essentially

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.400
that it looks the same
in all directions.

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:35.780
In the kind of spacetimes
that we are familiar with,

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.690
something-- a spacetime
that is highly isotropic

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.020
is one that is
invariant with respect

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.040
to rotations and boosts,
and one that is homogeneous

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.968
is something that is invariant
with respect to translations.

00:06:48.968 --> 00:06:50.135
So let me give two examples.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:05.930
In Euclidean space, that
is a maximally symmetric

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:17.310
three-dimensional space, n
times n plus 1 over 2 equals 6.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.950
And those 6 Killing
vectors in Euclidean space

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:26.879
correspond to 3 rotations
and 3 translations.

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:42.370
Minkowski flat
spacetime: n equals 4.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:48.730
n times n plus 1 over
2 is equal to 10.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:08:01.407
I have 3 rotations, 3
translations, and 4 boosts, OK?

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:09.550
The requirement that your
space satisfy these properties,

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.190
it leads to a condition
that the Riemann tensor

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:16.510
must be Lorentz-invariant
within the local Lorentz frame.

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.630
So for these two examples
that I talked about,

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.309
the Riemann tensor
actually vanishes,

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:41.640
and 0 is certainly
Lorentz-invariant,

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.820
so there's no problem there.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.150
But as I start thinking
about more general classes

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.000
of spacetimes, which I'm going
to consider to be examples

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.910
of massively
symmetric spaces, they

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.730
might not have vanishing
Riemann tensors.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.980
But the Riemann tensors,
in order to be massively

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.430
symmetric, if I go into
a freely-falling frame,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.720
that has to look--

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.630
everything has to look
Lorentz-invariant.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:14.220
This leads to a condition that
my Riemann tensor must take--

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.140
it is constrained to take
one particular simple form.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:37.753
It must be R over n times n
minus 1 times metric like so.

00:09:41.537 --> 00:09:44.290
This is-- so Carroll goes
through this in some detail.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.480
Essentially what's
going on here is

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.730
this is the only way in
which I am guaranteed

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.400
to create a tensor that
is Lorentz-invariant

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.110
in a local Lorentz frame.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:54.490
So I go to my
local Lorentz frame

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:56.930
and I must have a form
it looks like this,

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.270
and this is a way of putting
all my various quantities

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.490
on my metric tensors
together in such a way

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:07.210
that I recover the symmetries
of the Riemann tensor,

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.467
and is my number of dimensions.

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.150
Because it will
prove useful, let

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.940
me generate the Ricci tensor
and the Ricci scalar from this.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:34.470
So R mu nu is going to be
R over n times m minus 1.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:38.240
I'm taking the trace on
indices alpha and beta.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.398
If I trace on this guy, I get n.

00:10:41.398 --> 00:10:43.440
The trace in the metric
always just gives me back

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.860
the number of dimensions.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:50.820
And when I trace on
alpha and beta here,

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.190
I basically just contract
these two indices,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:11:08.760
and so I get the metric
back over n times g mu nu.

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.350
Take a further trace
and you can see

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.210
that that R that
went into this thing

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.730
is indeed nothing more
than the Ricci curvature.

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:16.577
Excuse me, the scalar
Ricci curvature.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.500
OK?

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.830
You can construct the
Einstein tensor out of this,

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.220
and what you see is that
the Einstein tensor must

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.110
be proportional to the metric.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.140
And in fact, there are--

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.580
the only solutions for
the Einstein tensor that--

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.630
the only solution is the
Einstein field equations

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:51.200
in which the Einstein tensor is
proportional to the metric are

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.860
either flat spacetime or
a cosmological constant.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.850
So empty space,
empty flat spacetime

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:01.700
and cosmological constant
are the only maximally

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.740
symmetric four-dimensional
spacetimes.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:10.130
That does not necessarily
describe our universe.

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:18.510
So our universe, how am I
going to tie all this together?

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.510
We begin with the
observation that our universe

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:24.210
is, in fact,
homogeneous and isotopic

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:26.400
on large spatial scales.

00:12:52.700 --> 00:13:00.680
I emphasize spatial because
the spacetime of our universe

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.480
is not homogeneous, OK?

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.847
In fact, the past
of our universe

00:13:04.847 --> 00:13:06.305
is very different
from the present.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.040
Because light travels
at a finite time, when

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.900
we observe two
large distances, we

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.270
are looking back into
the distant past.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.540
And we see that the universe
is a lot denser in the past

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:36.280
than it is today.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.410
It remains the case,
though, that it is still

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.240
homogeneous and
isotropic spatially,

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.700
at least on large scales.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.530
So we are going
to take advantage

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.110
of these notions of
maximally symmetric spaces

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:53.890
to define a spacetime that is
maximally symmetric spatially,

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:56.950
but is not so symmetric
with respect to time, OK?

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.910
So we'll get to that
in just a few moments.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.390
There is a wiggle word in here.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:03.490
I said that our
universe, by observation,

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:07.840
is homogeneous and isotropic
on large spatial scales.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:08.740
What does large mean?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.320
Well the very largest scales
that we can observe of all--

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.280
so that when we go back and
we probe sort of the largest

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:24.310
coherent structure that can
be observed in our universe,

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:28.270
we have to go all the way
back to a time which is

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.090
approximately
13-point-something or another--

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.790
I forget the exact
number, but let's say

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.200
about 13.7 billion years ago,
and we see the cosmic microwave

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.170
background.

00:14:58.783 --> 00:15:00.200
So the cosmic
microwave background

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.950
describes what our universe
looked like 13.7 billion years

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.390
ago or so, and what you
see is that this guy is

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:22.235
homogeneous and isotropic to
about a part in 100,000, OK?

00:15:22.235 --> 00:15:23.610
With a lot of
interesting physics

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:26.510
in that deviation from--

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.290
that sort of part in
100,000 deviation,

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:31.600
but that's a topic
for a different class.

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.410
We then sort of imagine
you move forward in time,

00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:36.520
you look on-- so that
tells you about the largest

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.630
scales in the earliest times.

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.920
Look at the universe
on smaller scales.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.923
I mean, clearly you
look in this room, OK?

00:15:43.923 --> 00:15:45.840
I'm standing here, there's
a table over there,

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.700
this is not homogeneous
and not isotropic,

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.620
things look quite different.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:58.360
What we start to see is things
deviate from homogeneity

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:21.650
and isotropy on scales that are
on the order of several tens

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.300
of megaparsecs in size, OK?

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:26.990
Parsec, for those of you
who are not astrophysicists,

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:29.330
is a unit of measure.

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:33.930
It's approximately
3.2 light years.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.200
So once you get
down to boxes that

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.190
are on the orders of 50 million
light years or so on a side,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:44.110
you start to see deviations
from homogeneity and isotropy.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.507
And this is caused by
gravitational clumping.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.090
These are things
like galaxy clusters.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.470
So when I talk about
cosmology and I

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:06.990
want to describe the universe
as large-scale structure,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.490
I am going to be
working on defining

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.660
a description of spacetime
that averages out

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:19.369
over small things like
clusters of galaxies, OK?

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:23.420
So this is sort of a fun lecture
in that sense, in that anything

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:25.579
larger than an
agglomeration of a couple

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:27.170
dozen or a couple
hundred galaxies,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.712
I'm going to treat
that like a point.

00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:41.490
So here's what I am going to
choose for my spacetime metric.

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.710
This is where you start to see
the power of assuming a given

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:47.210
symmetry.

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.770
So the line element,
I'm going to write it

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:08.410
as minus dt squared
plus some function R

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:18.310
squared of t gamma ij dx i dx j.

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:24.960
The function R of t
I've written down here.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.168
It's one variant of-- there's
a couple functions that

00:18:27.168 --> 00:18:28.293
are going to get this name.

00:18:28.293 --> 00:18:29.590
We call this the scale factor.

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:36.440
Caution, it's the same capital
R we used for the Ricci scalar,

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.140
it's not the Ricci scalar.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.890
Just a little bit of
unfortunate notation,

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:43.130
but it should be clear
from context which is which

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.410
when they come up.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:55.160
I have chosen gtt equals
minus 1 and gti equals 0.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.180
Remember from our discussion
of linearized theory

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:05.110
around a flat background,
that the spacetime-- the 10

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:10.350
independent functions of my
spacetime metric, of those 10,

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:12.540
four of them were
things that I could

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.850
specify by choosing a gauge.

00:19:14.850 --> 00:19:18.870
Well here, I have specified four
functions pretty much by fiat.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.800
Think of this as defining the
gauge that I am working in, OK?

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.900
In a very similar way, I have
chosen a coordinate system

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:29.340
by specifying gtt to be
minus 1 and gti to be 0.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.530
This means that I am
working in what are

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:34.260
called co-moving coordinates.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:55.810
So if I am an observer who
is at rest in the spacetime

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:02.110
so that I would define
my four velocity like so,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:04.750
I will be essentially co
moving with the spacetime.

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:06.367
Whatever the spacetime
is doing, I'm

00:20:06.367 --> 00:20:08.200
just going to sort of
homologously track it.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:36.420
It's worth noting-- so those of
you who think about astronomy,

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.060
astrophysics, and
observational cosmology,

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.420
the earth is not co-moving, OK?

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.250
We build our telescopes
on the surface

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.110
of the Earth which rotates.

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.320
The Earth itself
orbits around the Sun.

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.387
The Sun is in a solar system.

00:20:52.387 --> 00:20:54.720
Or excuse me-- the Sun at the
center of our solar system

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:57.300
is itself orbiting our galaxy.

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.420
And our galaxy is
actually falling

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.460
into a large cluster of galaxies
called the Virgo Cluster.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:09.360
This basically means that when
we are making cosmologically

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.390
interesting measurements, we
have to correct for the fact

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:16.140
that we make measurements using
a four velocity that is not

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.150
a co-moving four velocity.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:19.650
This actually shows
up in the fact

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.120
that when one
makes measurements,

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.078
one of the most impressive
places that shows up

00:21:23.078 --> 00:21:25.650
is that when you measure the
cosmic microwave background,

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.380
it has what we call
a dipole isotropy.

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:32.730
And that dipole is just
essentially a Doppler shift

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:36.300
that is due to the fact that
when we make our measurements,

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:41.980
we are moving with respect to
the co-moving reference frame.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.670
All right.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:45.140
So that's the metric that
we're going to use here.

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.410
Setting gtt and
gti like so means

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.860
I have chosen these
co-moving coordinate systems.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:58.820
I'm going to take
gamma ij, I'm going

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:12.410
to take this to be
maximally symmetric, OK?

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:16.950
So this is my statement
that at any moment of time,

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.720
space is maximally symmetric.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.540
So a few words on the
units, a few things

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.810
that I'm going to set up here.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:34.940
So my coordinate, I'm going to
take my xi to be dimensionless,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.800
and all notions of length--

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:45.950
all length scales
and the problem

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:53.860
are going to be absorbed
into this factor R of t.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:00.200
We're going to see that the
overall scale of the universe

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.330
is going to depend on the
dynamics of that function

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.310
R of t.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:08.660
So let's imagine
that on a given--

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:10.790
at some given
moment of time, you

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:14.030
want to understand the
curvature associated

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.070
with that constant time slice.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:34.530
So the Riemann tensor that we
build from our spatial metric,

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:38.930
I'm going to write this as 3 R--

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.600
and I'm doing purely
spatial things,

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:45.120
so I'm going to use Latin
letters for my indices.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.360
It's going to equal
to some number k--

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.670
not to be confused
with the index k.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:55.477
It's unfortunate,
but there's only so

00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:56.560
many letters to work with.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.500
That looks like so.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:19.650
And if I take a trace to make
my Ricci curvature, I get this,

00:24:19.650 --> 00:24:24.510
and your Ricci scalar will
turn out to be equal to 6k.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:26.670
We won't actually need
that, but just so you

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:28.440
can establish what
that k actually means.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.385
It's simply related to
the Ricci curvature.

00:24:30.385 --> 00:24:33.170
Oops, that should
have a 3 on it.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:37.110
Ricci curvature of that
particular instant in time.

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:48.980
Now I'm going to require
my coordinate system

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.790
to reflect the fact
that space is isotopic.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.150
So if it's isotropic,
it must look the same

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:59.210
in all directions, and in
a three-dimensional space,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.160
anything that is the
same in all directions

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.089
must be spherically symmetric.

00:25:19.226 --> 00:25:31.965
And so what this means is that
when I compute gamma ij dx i dx

00:25:31.965 --> 00:25:41.050
j, it must be equal to
some function of radius.

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.540
The bar on that radius
just reminds you this

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.580
is meant to be a dimensionless
notion of radius.

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:46.750
Remember, all length
scales are going

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:48.417
to be absorbed into
the function capital

00:25:48.417 --> 00:25:56.226
R. It's R squared d omega.

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:08.580
And my angular sector
is just related

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:14.660
to circle coordinate
angles the usual way.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:28.600
So it's convenient for
us to put this f of R--

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:35.423
I can rewrite this as an
exponential function, OK?

00:26:35.423 --> 00:26:37.590
Just think of this as the
definition of the function

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:39.350
beta.

00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:42.920
The reason why this is
handy is that suppose

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:48.650
I now take gamma ij, I
compute the three-dimensional

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:52.160
Christoffel symbols, I compute
my three-dimensional Riemann,

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.770
ignoring for a moment
that my Riemann is meant

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:56.480
to be maximally symmetric, OK?

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.700
I'm just going to
say, I know the recipe

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.340
for how to make
Riemann from a metric.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:02.407
I will do that.

00:27:02.407 --> 00:27:04.115
I will then make Ricci
from that Riemann.

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:20.725
When you do this,
what you find is

00:27:20.725 --> 00:27:23.100
that-- let's just look at the
Rr component of this thing.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.220
This turns out to be 2 over
R times a regular derivative

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.420
of beta, OK?

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:34.910
It's just a little bit
of tensor manipulation

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.400
to do that using some of the
tools, the mathematical tools

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.660
I'm going to post in
the 8.962 website,

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.210
you can verify this yourself.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:28:00.730
If I compute Ricci from the
maximally symmetric assumption,

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:13.180
what I find is that this is
equal to 2k times gamma, which

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.460
is itself exponent of 2 beta.

00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:25.440
Let's equate these
and solve for beta.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:58.162
So one side I've got 2
over r bar dr bar of eta.

00:28:58.162 --> 00:29:03.200
On the near side I
have 2k and gamma r bar

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:09.320
r bar is itself e to the 2 beta.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.075
Cancel, cancel.

00:29:11.075 --> 00:29:13.670
A little bit of algebra.

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:15.240
First let's write it this way.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.570
Let's move this to
the other side...

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:26.240
e to the minus 2 beta
is equal to this.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.590
Let us make the assumption-- so
we have a choice of a boundary

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:31.970
condition.

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:37.250
Let's put beta equals
0 at r bar equals 0.

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.190
This is basically
saying that on my--

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.780
so r bar is sort of the origin.

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.322
We're just sort of
saying that things

00:29:43.322 --> 00:29:47.720
look like a flat spacetime
in the vicinity of the origin

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.220
of the coordinates
we're using here,

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.470
that's a fine
assumption to make.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:30:02.250
Doing so, we can easily
integrate this guy up,

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.500
and here's what we get.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.540
So with this, we now
have a full line element.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:36.380
So there's a few unknown
quantities in here.

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.240
What is k?

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.180
What is R?

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:46.640
So far I have only talked about
the geometry of this spacetime.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:50.000
We haven't yet connected
this-- any of the dynamics

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.120
of the spacetime to a source.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.930
It is when we hook
this up to a source

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:57.097
that we're going to learn
something about these two.

00:30:57.097 --> 00:30:58.400
So hold that thought for now.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.380
This essentially has
just said that here

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:05.060
is what my maximally spatially
symmetric spacetime looks like,

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.730
allowing for there to be a
difference between the past

00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:09.770
and the present.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:17.640
Before I move on, so I can't
tell you what k is yet,

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:19.920
but I can make the
following observation which

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:24.963
allows me to restrict
what values of k

00:31:24.963 --> 00:31:25.880
I need to worry about.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:58.870
Suppose I take k and I replace
it with k prime equal alpha k.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.870
But in doing so,
I define R tilde

00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:10.060
to be square root of alpha--

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.730
yeah.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:21.030
Square root of
alpha times R bar.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:36.670
And I also require that
my overall scale factor

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.650
look like the original
scale factor divided

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.170
by square root of alpha.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.850
Rewriting my spacetime, my line
element in terms of k prime

00:32:45.850 --> 00:33:20.090
and the tilde R into-- the
two tilde R's, I get this.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:24.200
Basically, that transformation
leaves the line element

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:28.390
completely irrelevant to me.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:30.030
That was completely
the wrong word.

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:35.610
That re-prioritization of k
and R and the two different R's

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:39.060
here, that leaves the line
element completely invariant.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.920
It is unchanged when I do this.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:48.413
So what this tells
me is-- by the way,

00:33:48.413 --> 00:33:50.830
alpha has to be a positive
number so that the square roots

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:51.910
make sense there.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:58.060
It tells me that the
normalization associated with k

00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:05.460
can be absorbed into
my scale factor.

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:15.870
And so what it suggests
we ought to do is just--

00:34:15.870 --> 00:34:18.210
you don't need to
worry about whether k

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:23.250
is equal to 15 or pi or
negative the 38th root of e

00:34:23.250 --> 00:34:24.540
or anything silly like that.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:34.659
The only three values
of k that matter for us

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:39.190
are whether it is
negative 1, 0, or 1.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:42.750
This stands for all
negative values of k,

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:49.320
0 as a set onto itself, and
all positive values of k, OK?

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:53.328
So we will use this to
say, great, the thing which

00:34:53.328 --> 00:34:54.870
I'm going to care
about, once I start

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.360
looking at the physics
associated with this,

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.590
is whether--

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.800
let's go back over to
this version of it--

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.630
I'm going to care about
whether k is negative 1, 0, 1,

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:10.170
and I want to understand
how my scale factor behaves.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.900
So before I start hooking
this up to my source

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:25.650
and doing a little bit
of physics, many of you

00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:27.660
are going to do something
involving cosmology

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:30.480
at some point in your
lives, and so it's

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:34.950
useful to introduce a few
other bits of notation that

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:42.928
are commonly used here,
as well as to describe

00:35:42.928 --> 00:35:45.220
some important terminology
that comes up at this point.

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.650
So here's some common
notation and terminology.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:21.770
Let us define a
radial coordinate chi

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:25.910
via the following definition--

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:32.330
d chi will be equal to d R
bar over square root of 1

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:37.350
minus kR bar squared.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.500
Now remember, we just
decided that k can only

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:41.510
take on one of three
interesting values.

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:46.130
I can immediately
integrate this up,

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.840
and I will find that my
R bar is equal to sine

00:36:50.840 --> 00:37:00.250
of chi of k equals plus 1 is
equal to chi of k equal 0.

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:08.160
And it's the sinh of
chi of k equals minus 1.

00:37:15.115 --> 00:37:17.800
So let's take a
look at what this

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:23.005
means with these sort of
three possible choices.

00:37:23.005 --> 00:37:26.320
The three possible
values that k can take.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.820
What is our line
element looks like?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.050
So let's look at k
equals plus 1 first.

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:47.360
I get minus dt squared R square
root of t d chi squared plus--

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:57.650
I'm going to use
the fact that R bar,

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:04.160
this describes a spacetime in
which every spacial slice is

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.020
what is called a 3-sphere, OK?

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:09.020
You're all nicely familiar
with the 2-sphere.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:12.110
So a 2-sphere is the
three-dimensional surface

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:16.090
in which you pick a point
and every point that is,

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.340
let's say, a unit radius
away from that point that,

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:23.550
defines a 2-sphere in
three-dimensional space.

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.560
So this defines the space--

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.590
the spatial
characteristics of pick

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:31.670
a point in
four-dimensional space

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:35.360
and ask for all of the points
that are a unit distance away

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.670
from it in three dimensions,
that is a 3-sphere.

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:56.910
Notice that my 3-sphere
has a maximum--

00:38:56.910 --> 00:39:00.330
there's a maximum distance
associated with it, OK?

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.970
So there's no bounds on chi, OK?

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:04.950
Chi can go from 0 to infinity.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:06.840
But this one's
periodic, isn't it?

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.690
So as chi reaches pi over 2,
the separation between any two

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.310
points on that
single slice, they've

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.550
reached their maximum value, and
as chi continues to increase,

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.680
the distance gets
smaller again, OK?

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.230
And eventually, when
chi gets up to pi,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.120
you come back to
where you started.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:28.733
We call this a closed universe.

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.150
This is something
where if it were

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:33.300
possible to step out of
time and just run around

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.050
on a spacial slice, you would
find that it is a finite size.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:40.650
The best you could
do is run around

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:44.660
on that three-dimensional sphere
in four-dimensional space.

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.290
Let's do k equals 0 next.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:34.580
If I do k equals 0,
there's my line element.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:38.170
Each spacial slice is
simply Euclidean space.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:52.660
So this is often
described as flat space.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:01.670
A significant word of caution.

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:04.730
When you talk to a
cosmologist, they will often

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.778
talk about how the best--

00:41:06.778 --> 00:41:09.320
we're going to talk about sort
of the observational situation

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.410
in the next lecture that
I record a little bit.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:15.460
Our evidence actually
suggests that this

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.210
is what our universe
looks like right now.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:21.530
We're in a k equal 0
universe in which space--

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.120
each spatial slice is flat.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.920
That does not mean
spacetime is flat, OK?

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.540
So when they say
that it's flat, that

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:31.280
is referring to
the geometry only

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:34.020
of the spatial slices in this
co-moving coordinate system.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:59.580
k equals minus 1, you get a
form that looks like this.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.830
This describes the
geometry of a hyperbole.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:20.120
We call this an
open spatial slice.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:23.018
So notice for both
choices 2 and 3,

00:42:23.018 --> 00:42:24.560
if you could sort
of step out of time

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:28.280
and explore the full geometry
of that spatial slice,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.480
it goes on forever, OK?

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:31.950
Again, there's really
no boundary on that chi

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:34.037
as near as we can tell,
and so that spatial slide

00:42:34.037 --> 00:42:35.120
can just kind of go, whee!

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.190
And take off forever.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.330
This one sort of goes to large
distances a little slower

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.170
than this one does.

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:44.270
This hyperbolic
function means that this

00:42:44.270 --> 00:42:48.500
is really bloody large, OK?

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:54.800
So both of these tend
to imply a universe that

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.040
is sort of spatially unbounded.

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:04.142
The closed universe, because
each slice is a 3-sphere,

00:43:04.142 --> 00:43:05.100
it's a different story.

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:14.070
So another bit of notation
which you should be aware of--

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.320
and I unfortunately
am going to want

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.230
to sort of flip back and forth
between the notation I've

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.157
been using so far and this
one I'm about to introduce.

00:43:28.887 --> 00:43:31.470
It can be a little bit annoying
when you're first learning it,

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.710
but just keep track of
context, it's not that hard.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:38.520
So what we're going
to do is let's

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:41.440
choose a particular value
of the scale factor,

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:43.500
and we will normalize
things to that.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:44:04.540
So what I'm going to do is
define some particular value

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:10.570
of k such that the scale factor
there I will call it R sub 0.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:17.800
And as we'll see, a particularly
useful choice for this

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:20.323
is to choose the
value right now, OK?

00:44:20.323 --> 00:44:22.740
What we're doing, then, is
we're kind of norm-- what we're

00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:25.073
going to see in a moment is
this means we're normalizing

00:44:25.073 --> 00:44:27.880
all the scales associated
with our universe

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:30.180
to where they are right now.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:30.680
OK.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:37.240
Having done this, I'm
going to define a of t

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:43.923
to be R of t divided
by this special value.

00:44:43.923 --> 00:44:45.340
For dimensional
reasons, I'm going

00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:49.750
to need to put this into
my radial coordinate.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.180
So notice, what's
going on here is

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.300
that my R will now have
dimensions associated with it,

00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:00.655
and so essentially everything
is just being scaled by that R0.

00:45:00.655 --> 00:45:03.030
And this is the bit where it
gets a tiny bit unfortunate,

00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:09.995
you sort of lose the beauty
of k only having three values.

00:45:09.995 --> 00:45:11.745
So I'm going to replace
that with a kappa.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:16.920
This is unfortunately a
little bit hard to read,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.310
so whenever I make it sort
of with my messy cursive,

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.870
it will be k; whenever it
looks a little bit more

00:45:21.870 --> 00:45:23.600
like a printed thing,
it will be kappa.

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:32.730
And so kappa is k
divided by R0 squared.

00:45:32.730 --> 00:45:53.150
And when you do that, your
line element becomes this.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.490
OK?

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.750
So that's a form that we're
going to use a little bit.

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:08.177
What's a little bit annoying
about it is just that my--

00:46:08.177 --> 00:46:10.010
the kappa that appears
in there doesn't just

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.190
come as a set of one of
these parts of three,

00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:15.660
but basically if kappa
is a negative number,

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:19.010
then you know k must be minus 1;
kappa equals 0 corresponds to k

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:22.360
equals 0; if kappa is a positive
number, then k equals plus 1.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.860
This form where we're using
this sort of dimensionless scale

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:28.970
factor a is particularly useful.

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.680
If you look at this,
this is telling you

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:43.150
that with the choice that R0
defines a scale factor now,

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:47.860
this means a now equals 1.

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:50.470
And so this gives us a
nice dimensionless factor

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:54.760
by which we can compare
all of our spatial scales

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.800
at different moments in
the universe to the size

00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:57.550
that they are now.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.950
OK.

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:04.890
Everything I have
said so far has really

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:06.990
been just discussing
the geometry

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.970
that I'm going to
use to describe

00:47:08.970 --> 00:47:13.060
the large-scale
structure of spacetime.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.150
I haven't said
anything about what

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.570
happens when I solve the
Einstein field equations

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.210
and connect this
geometry to physics.

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:27.680
So what we need to do
is choose a source.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.560
And so what we're
going to do is we

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.010
will do what is sort of the
default choice in many analyses

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:34.190
in general relativity.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:38.170
We will choose our source
to be a perfect fluid.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.180
What's nice about this
is that it automatically

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:57.390
satisfies the requirements
of isotropy and homogeneity.

00:47:57.390 --> 00:48:03.930
At least it does so if
the fluid is at rest

00:48:03.930 --> 00:48:05.627
in co-moving coordinates.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.560
So let's fill this in:
t mu nu with everything

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:42.850
in the downstairs position looks
like rho plus P mu nu mu nu

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.000
plus Pg mu nu.

00:48:49.122 --> 00:48:53.430
And this becomes in my
co-moving coordinate system.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.820
So then it looks like this, OK?

00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:06.080
A handy fact to
have, this is going

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:09.418
to be quite useful for
a calculation or two

00:49:09.418 --> 00:49:10.710
that we do a little bit later--

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:16.180
actually, not just a minute
later, almost right away.

00:49:37.610 --> 00:49:43.175
This looks like a diagonal
of all this stuff, OK?

00:49:46.640 --> 00:49:47.490
All right.

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:53.110
So what we want to do is use
this stress energy tensor

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:54.260
as the right-hand side.

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:57.670
So we've worked out
our Ricci tensor.

00:49:57.670 --> 00:50:01.180
With a little bit of work, we
can make the Einstein tensor,

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.490
couple it to this guy, we
can set up our differential

00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:07.090
equations, and we can solve
for the free functions that

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.190
specify the spacetime.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:13.420
Before doing this, always a good
sanity check, remind yourself,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.718
your fluid has to satisfy
local energy conservation.

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:22.360
Actually, let's just do the 0.

00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:25.120
So this is energy and
momentum conservation,

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:30.339
we set that equal to 0, this
is local energy conservation.

00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:51.210
Expanding out these
derivatives, what you

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:53.190
find is that this turns into--

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:12.280
so it looks like this.

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.960
And plugging in-- so
using the spacetime--

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.660
by the way, I made a
small mistake earlier.

00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:34.870
I should have told you
that this spacetime,

00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:40.080
this is now called the
Robertson-Walker spacetime.

00:51:50.522 --> 00:51:52.730
So this was actually first
written down in the 1920s,

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:54.620
and Robertson and Walker
developed this basically

00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.328
just as I have done
it here, just arguing

00:51:56.328 --> 00:51:58.160
on the basis of looking
for something that

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.800
is as symmetric as possible with
respect to space if not time,

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.702
and they came out with
that line element.

00:52:05.702 --> 00:52:07.660
My apologies, I didn't
mention that beforehand.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:09.077
This is my third
lecture in a row,

00:52:09.077 --> 00:52:10.370
I'm getting a little bit tired.

00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.130
So if I take that
Robertson-Walker metric,

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:17.610
plug it into here to
evaluate all these,

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:19.860
this gives me a
remarkably simple form.

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:45.195
So rho is the pressure
of my perfect fluid--

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:47.070
excuse me, the density
of my perfect fluid, P

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:50.870
is the pressure of my perfect
fluid, a is my scale factor.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:01.030
If you like, you can put the
factor of R0 back in there,

00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:07.700
and an equivalent way of
writing this, which I think

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:10.910
is very useful for giving some
physical insight as to what

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:11.570
this means--

00:53:30.266 --> 00:53:31.980
so put that R back in.

00:53:48.708 --> 00:53:51.360
OK, so let's look at
what this is saying.

00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:54.990
R cubed is modulo
numerical factor,

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.140
that is the volume
of a spacial slice.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.380
And so this is saying,
the rate of change

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.670
of energy in a volume--

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:14.740
so a volume describing
my spatial slice

00:54:14.740 --> 00:54:20.260
is equal to negative pressure
times the rate of change

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:21.340
of that volume.

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:36.790
I hope this looks familiar.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:41.080
This, in somewhat more
convoluted notation,

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.330
is negative dp--

00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:47.450
du equals negative P dv.

00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:49.686
It's just the first
law of thermodynamics.

00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.410
All right.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:56.980
So this relationship,
whether written in this form

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.810
or in that form, is
something that we

00:54:58.810 --> 00:55:00.310
will exploit moving forward.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:10.047
Let's now solve the
Einstein field equations.

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:34.640
So we'll begin with g mu
nu equals 8 pi g t mu nu.

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:37.040
The equations that
are traditionally

00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:42.300
used to describe cosmology are
a little bit more naturally

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:42.800
written.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.330
If I change this into the form
that uses the Ricci tensor--

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:54.240
so let me rewrite this as R
mu nu equals 8 pi g t mu nu.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.220
OK?

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:03.850
So this is equivalent where
t is just the usual trace

00:56:03.850 --> 00:56:06.890
of the stress energy tensor.

00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:10.330
And what you find,
there are two--

00:56:10.330 --> 00:56:14.890
if you just look at the 0, 0
components of this equation,

00:56:14.890 --> 00:56:30.890
it tells you the acceleration of
the scale factor a divided by a

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:31.490
is--

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:38.930
it is simply related to
the density and 3 times

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:41.100
the pressure.

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.850
If you evaluate Rii--

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:45.907
in other words, any--

00:56:45.907 --> 00:56:47.490
this is-- there's
no sum implied here,

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:54.070
just take any spatial
component of this guy,

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:56.570
and add on R0,0 because
it's a valid equation,

00:56:56.570 --> 00:57:11.820
it helps you to
clear out some stuff,

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:15.570
you get the following
relationship between the rate

00:57:15.570 --> 00:57:20.100
of change to the scale factor,
the density, and remember,

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:24.010
kappa is your rescaled k.

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:28.540
So I'm going to call
this equation F1,

00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:32.020
I'm going to call this one F2.

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.680
These are known as the
Friedmann equations.

00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:47.250
When one uses them to solve
to describe your line element,

00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:59.480
you get
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker

00:57:59.480 --> 00:57:59.980
metrics.

00:58:17.408 --> 00:58:18.950
So just a little
bit of nomenclature.

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:21.860
Robertson-Walker tells
you about the geometry,

00:58:21.860 --> 00:58:25.640
you then equate these
guys to a source,

00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:29.640
and that gives you
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker line

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:30.140
elements.

00:58:37.340 --> 00:58:39.678
One other bit of
information-- so

00:58:39.678 --> 00:58:41.720
let's introduce a little
bit of terminology here.

00:58:54.300 --> 00:59:02.580
So a dot over a, this tells
me how the overall length

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.370
scale associated with
my spatial slices

00:59:05.370 --> 00:59:07.020
is evolving as a
function of time.

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:16.542
This is denoted H and it's
known as the Hubble parameter.

00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:30.950
H0 is the value of
H that we measure

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:35.180
in our universe corresponding
to its expansion right now, OK?

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:39.050
And the notes that I have
scanned and placed online

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:42.020
claim a best value
for this of 73

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:45.650
plus or minus 3 kilometers
per second per megaparsec.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:47.360
These notes were
originally hand written

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.390
about 11 or 12 years ago, that
number is already out of date,

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:51.750
OK?

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:55.790
If you went to Adam
Reese's colloquium

00:59:55.790 --> 00:59:59.223
shortly before MIT went
into its COVID shutdown,

00:59:59.223 --> 01:00:00.890
you will have seen
that there's actually

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:02.848
little bit of controversy
about this right now.

01:00:02.848 --> 01:00:04.760
So our best measurements
of this thing,

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:08.578
indeed, they are clustering
around 72 or 73 in these units,

01:00:08.578 --> 01:00:11.120
but they're inconsistent with
some other measures by which we

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:15.200
can infer to be the-- what the
Hubble parameter should be.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.310
And it's a very--

01:00:18.767 --> 01:00:19.850
very interesting problems.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.530
Unclear sort of--
it sort of smells

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:22.970
like something might
be a little bit off

01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:25.387
in our cosmological models,
but we're not quite there yet.

01:00:25.387 --> 01:00:27.470
Let's consider-- let's
proceed with sort

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:29.780
of the standard picture,
and just bear in mind

01:00:29.780 --> 01:00:32.300
that this is an evolving field.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:41.600
The one thing I will note
is that H has the dimensions

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.910
of inverse time, OK?

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.680
The way one actually
measures it.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.770
So the dimensions in which most
astronomers quote its value,

01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:51.590
it looks like a velocity over
a length, which is, of course,

01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:53.360
also an inverse time.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.830
And that is because objects
that are at rest with respect

01:00:57.830 --> 01:01:00.860
to the-- that are at rest in
these co-moving coordinates,

01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:06.050
as this fluid is meant to be,
if the universe is expanding,

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:08.810
we see them moving away from us.

01:01:08.810 --> 01:01:10.790
OK, I'm going to make
a few definitions.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:29.390
Let us define rho crit to
be 3H squared over 8 pi j.

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:38.520
So the way I got
that was take F1--

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:42.900
imagine kappa is equal to 0,
just ignore kappa for a second.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.109
Left-hand side as H
squared, solve for rho, OK?

01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:15.098
Notice, rho quit-- rho crit is a
parameter that you can measure.

01:02:15.098 --> 01:02:16.640
You can measure the
Hubble parameter,

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.015
I'll describe to you how that
is done in my next lecture,

01:02:19.015 --> 01:02:21.390
but it's a number
that can be measured.

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:25.070
And then 3 and 8 pi
are just exact numbers,

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.962
g is a fundamental constant.

01:02:26.962 --> 01:02:28.670
So that's something
that can be measured.

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:40.750
Let's define omega to be any
density divided by rho crit.

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:43.805
Putting all these together, I
can rewrite the first Friedmann

01:02:43.805 --> 01:02:44.305
equation.

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:59.840
This guy can be written as omega
minus 1 equals kappa over H

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.230
squared a squared.

01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:08.950
Now notice, H and a,
they are real numbers.

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:14.060
H squared and a squared
are positive definite.

01:03:14.060 --> 01:03:19.580
We at last can now see how
the large-scale distribution

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.920
of matter in our
universe allows us

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:26.150
to constrain one of
the parameters that

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:29.420
sets our Robertson-Walker
line element.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:35.150
If omega is less than 1--

01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:41.350
in other words, if rho
is less than rho crit,

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:46.960
then it must be the case
that kappa is negative,

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.243
k equals minus 1, and we
have an open universe.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:00.090
If a omega equals 1
such that rho is exactly

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:07.350
equal to rho crit, kappa
must equal 0, k must equal 0,

01:04:07.350 --> 01:04:10.432
and we have a Euclidean
spatially flat universe.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:23.250
If omega is greater than
1, kappa is greater than 1,

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:28.496
k equals 1, and we
have a closed universe.

01:04:36.473 --> 01:04:38.223
Clean up my handwriting
a little bit here.

01:04:52.027 --> 01:04:54.220
OK, this is really interesting.

01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:59.760
This is telling us
if we can determine

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.710
whether the density of
stuff in our universe

01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:11.170
exceeds, is equal to, or is
less than that critical value,

01:05:11.170 --> 01:05:12.990
we know something
pretty profound

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:16.500
about the spatial
geometry of our universe.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:20.620
Either it's finite,
sort of simply infinite,

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:23.025
or ridiculously infinite.

01:05:25.382 --> 01:05:27.840
Let me do a few more things
before I conclude this lecture.

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:47.000
First, this isn't that
important for our purposes,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.305
but it's something that some
of you students will see.

01:05:50.305 --> 01:05:51.805
A little bit of
notational trickery.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.980
It's not uncommon
in the literature

01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:01.440
to see people define what's
called a curvature density.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:11.180
And what this is,
is you just combine

01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.880
factors of kappa, g, and the
scale factor in such a way

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.060
that this has the
dimensions of density.

01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:26.690
You can then find an omega
associated with curvature

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:32.150
to be rho with curvature
over the critical density.

01:06:32.150 --> 01:06:37.650
And when you do this, F1,
the first Friedmann equation,

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:45.540
becomes simply omega plus
omega curvature equals 1, OK?

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.910
Just bear in mind, that
is not really a density,

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:49.390
it's just a concept--

01:06:49.390 --> 01:06:52.110
it's a useful auxiliary concept.

01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:55.180
This is often for certain
kinds of calculations,

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.750
a nice constraint
to bear in mind, OK?

01:06:58.750 --> 01:07:01.290
People are very interested
in understanding

01:07:01.290 --> 01:07:04.620
the geometry of our
universe, and this

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:12.090
is a way of formulating it that
sort of puts the term involving

01:07:12.090 --> 01:07:15.600
the k parameter or the kappa
parameter on the same footing

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.180
as other densities that
contribute to the energy

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.555
budget of our universe.

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:28.650
OK.

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:32.910
So the equations that
we are working with here

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:34.380
involve these--

01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:41.300
it involves the pressure
and density here.

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.350
I haven't said too
much about them so far.

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:48.070
If I want to make
further progress,

01:07:48.070 --> 01:07:50.210
I've got to know a little
bit about the matter that

01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:51.639
fills my universe.

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:09.480
So to make more progress,
I need to choose

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:12.355
what is called an
equation of state that

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:14.480
relates the pressure and
the density to each other.

01:08:23.649 --> 01:08:27.819
What I really need is to
know that my pressure is

01:08:27.819 --> 01:08:30.550
some function of
the density, OK?

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:33.279
This can be written down for
just about all kinds of matter

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:35.170
that we care about.

01:08:35.170 --> 01:08:49.970
In cosmology, one
usually take and assumes

01:08:49.970 --> 01:08:55.029
that the pressure is a linear
function-- it's just linearly

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.340
related to the energy density.

01:08:57.340 --> 01:09:00.899
Let me emphasize that as
a very restrictive form.

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:02.899
When we finish cosmology,
one of the next things

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:05.080
we're going to talk about
are spherically symmetric

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.420
compact objects--

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:10.580
stars-- and we want to
describe them as a fluid,

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:13.149
and we'll need an equation of
state to make progress there,

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.565
we do not use a form
like that for stars.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:22.330
As we'll see, though, for
the kind of matter that

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:25.823
dominates the behavior of our
universe on the largest scales,

01:09:25.823 --> 01:09:27.490
this is actually a
very reasonable form.

01:09:31.359 --> 01:09:33.819
So if I were to write
down my thoughts on that,

01:09:33.819 --> 01:09:39.399
I would say
restrictive but useful

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:41.859
on the large scales
appropriate to cosmology.

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:57.950
Pardon me just one moment.

01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:08.668
Let's imagine
that-- yeah, sorry.

01:10:08.668 --> 01:10:10.460
Let's imagine that I
have a universe that's

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:14.660
dominated by a single species
of some kind of stuff, OK?

01:10:14.660 --> 01:10:16.490
So in reality, what
you will generally

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:19.168
have is a universe
in which there

01:10:19.168 --> 01:10:20.710
are several different
things present.

01:10:20.710 --> 01:10:22.730
So you might have
a W corresponding

01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:26.742
to one form of matter, another W
for a different form of matter,

01:10:26.742 --> 01:10:28.700
and you'll sort of have
a superposition of them

01:10:28.700 --> 01:10:32.400
all present at one given moment.

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:47.110
So to start, start by
imagining a universe dominated

01:10:47.110 --> 01:11:01.520
by a particular what I
will call a species rho i,

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.970
and the pressure will
be related to this

01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:08.770
by a particular W for whatever
that rho happens to be.

01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:21.620
So before I even hook this up
to the Friedmann equations,

01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:26.540
let's require that this
form of matter respects

01:11:26.540 --> 01:11:29.250
stress energy conservation.

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:31.028
OK, so the equation
I just wrote,

01:11:31.028 --> 01:11:33.070
let me rewrite that in a
slightly different form.

01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:35.305
I can divide both
sides by R0 cubed.

01:11:51.664 --> 01:11:53.780
OK, that looks like so.

01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.040
Now it's not too hard to show
using this assumed form here--

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:07.000
so if I plug in that
my p is Wi rho i,

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.790
in a line or two of algebra,
you can turn this into--

01:12:22.350 --> 01:12:28.625
and using-- well, I
didn't even really do

01:12:28.625 --> 01:12:30.250
anything that
sophisticated, I can just

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:32.560
integrate up both sides.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:36.550
And what you see is
that rho normalized

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:38.770
to some initial time,
some initial value.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.360
It is very simply related to the
behavior of the scale factor.

01:12:54.198 --> 01:12:55.150
OK?

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:57.330
But if you like, you
can set a0 equal to 1,

01:12:57.330 --> 01:13:00.330
if you make that your stuff
now, and this gives you

01:13:00.330 --> 01:13:02.640
a simple relationship
that allows

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:06.390
you to see how matter behaves
as the large-scale structure

01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:08.010
of the universe changes.

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:10.810
Let's look at a couple
examples of how this behaves.

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:48.655
So I'm going to call my
first category matter.

01:13:51.874 --> 01:13:53.970
OK, that's pretty broad.

01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:57.100
When a cosmologist speaks
of matter, generally what

01:13:57.100 --> 01:14:02.260
they are thinking of, this is
stuff for which W equals 0.

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:06.690
So this is something
that is pressureless.

01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:10.320
And we talked about pressureless
stuff very early in this class.

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:11.945
This is what we call dust.

01:14:15.423 --> 01:14:17.340
So what we're talking
about here is a universe

01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:21.330
that is filled with dust,
which seems kind of stupid

01:14:21.330 --> 01:14:22.560
at first approximation, OK?

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.290
Our universe sure as hell
doesn't look like dust.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:27.982
But bear in mind, what we
really mean about this is,

01:14:27.982 --> 01:14:29.190
go back to this pressureless.

01:14:29.190 --> 01:14:30.960
We're just referring
to something

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:36.480
that is sufficiently
non-interactive, that when

01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.750
particles basically do not
interact with each other.

01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:43.330
Our typical dust
particle is going

01:14:43.330 --> 01:14:48.250
to actually be something
on the scale of a galaxy.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:54.660
On cosmological scales,
matter-matter interactions

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:58.120
are, in fact, quite weak.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:00.663
So this is a very,
very good description.

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:11.470
Sort of imagine the
universe is kind

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.870
of a gas of galaxies
and galaxy clusters,

01:15:13.870 --> 01:15:17.140
it's a pressureless gas of
galaxy and galaxy clusters.

01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.270
When you put all this
together-- so let's

01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:22.900
take a look at this form here.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:29.830
The density of matter looks like
I'm going to set a0 equal to 1,

01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:38.600
it looks like the density
now times a to the minus 3.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:39.100
OK?

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.475
What I've done is
I've just taken

01:15:40.475 --> 01:15:45.070
that evolution law there and
I have plugged in Wi equals 0.

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:55.580
What this is basically saying is
that the conservation of stress

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:59.760
energy demands that the--

01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.970
excuse me-- that the
density of this matter

01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:11.170
changes in such a way that
the number of dust particles

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:23.600
is constant, but their density
varies as a to the minus 3.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.490
a sets all of my length scales.

01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:27.050
If I make the
universe twice as big,

01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:29.180
the density will
be 1/8 as large.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.310
Your second species of matter
that your cosmologist often

01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:39.190
likes to worry-- or
second species of stuff

01:16:39.190 --> 01:16:42.560
that your cosmologist likes
to worry about is radiation.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.680
Here, just go back to Stat Mech.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:50.350
If you have a gas of photons,
it exerts photon pressure,

01:16:50.350 --> 01:16:51.880
and that is of the form--

01:16:54.990 --> 01:17:01.730
the radiation pressure is
1/3 of the energy density.

01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:04.170
Factors of speed of light
are being omitted here.

01:17:04.170 --> 01:17:07.796
So this corresponds
to a law in which--

01:17:07.796 --> 01:17:09.210
here, let me put it this way.

01:17:09.210 --> 01:17:10.400
I should've make this an m.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.460
So this is my i
equals m for matter.

01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:17.190
So my W for radiation is 1/3.

01:17:17.190 --> 01:17:21.950
And what you find in
this case is that rho

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:25.430
of radiation scales
with the scale

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:29.210
factor to the fourth power.

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:31.070
What's going on here?

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:33.590
Well let's imagine that
the scale factor increases

01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:36.500
by a factor of 2, OK?

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.720
Imagine that the number of
photons is not changing.

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.720
So what this is
basically saying is,

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:44.270
OK, I get my factor
of 8 corresponding

01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:47.110
to the volume increasing
by a factor of 8,

01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:50.210
but I have an additional factor
of 2, where's that coming from?

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.140
Well remember, that's
an energy density.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.310
So this is saying that not only
is the density being diluted

01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:58.670
by the volume growing,
but each packet of energy

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:03.380
is also getting smaller as the
universe increases in size.

01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.230
Each quantum of
radiation is redshifting.

01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:31.690
It's redshifting with
a scale factor a.

01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:37.690
We are going to revisit
that in the next lecture.

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:39.150
That's an important
point and we're

01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:49.060
going to re-derive that result
somewhat more rigorously as we

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:51.970
began exploring how it is that
we can observational it probe

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:54.118
the properties of our universe.

01:18:57.190 --> 01:19:00.760
Just for fun, there's
another form of--

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.620
there's another kind
of perfect fluid

01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:06.650
that cosmologists
worry about, and that's

01:19:06.650 --> 01:19:07.760
the cosmological constant.

01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:21.710
So a cosmological
constant has pressure

01:19:21.710 --> 01:19:26.880
equal to minus the density.

01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.890
This corresponds to
an equation of state

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:33.540
parameter W equal to minus 1.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.100
If I go to my form here, I
plug in W equals minus 1,

01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:48.855
rho goes as a to the
0th power, a constant.

01:19:53.232 --> 01:19:55.190
Well, it is a cosmological
constant, after all,

01:19:55.190 --> 01:19:57.970
so that shouldn't
be too surprising.

01:19:57.970 --> 01:20:01.170
This is a very interesting
one because it is basically

01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:07.430
telling us that the amount
of energy in spacial slices--

01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:08.970
the energy density
does not change.

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:12.288
The amount of energy
appears to be Increasing.

01:20:12.288 --> 01:20:14.580
Now bear in mind, it's hard
to define the total energy,

01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.670
we cannot really in a covariant
way add up energy at various

01:20:17.670 --> 01:20:19.440
different kinds of points.

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:21.967
Local energy is still
being conserved,

01:20:21.967 --> 01:20:24.300
but there's no question that
this guy is a little weird.

01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:32.440
So one of the next
things that we want to do

01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:36.970
is take this stuff, run it
through Einstein's equations.

01:20:36.970 --> 01:20:38.680
Einstein's equations,
of course, give us

01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.540
the Friedmann equations.

01:20:40.540 --> 01:20:43.420
And solve to see what the
expansion the universe

01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:43.960
looks like.

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:48.040
We saw already that if the
density of the universe

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:51.640
relative the critical density
is either higher, the same,

01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:54.880
or lower, that tells us about
the value of this k parameter,

01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:56.650
or rather, the kappa parameter.

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:01.480
We haven't yet seen how to
solve for the scale factor a.

01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:07.430
However, we have the
two Friedmann equations,

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:12.860
and if nothing else, write them
down, write out your stuff,

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:15.620
you got yourself a
system of equations,

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:19.370
Odin gave us
mathematica-- attack.

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:21.590
To give you some intuition
as to what you end up

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:24.970
seeing when you look at
these kind of solutions,

01:21:24.970 --> 01:21:26.845
let me look at the
simplest kind of universes

01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:28.820
that we can solve this way.

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:33.710
So let's examine what I will
call a monospecies universe--

01:21:33.710 --> 01:21:36.650
in other words, a universe
that only contains

01:21:36.650 --> 01:21:40.060
one of these forms of matter
that I have described here,

01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:42.560
one of these sources of stress
energy that I described here.

01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:51.370
And for simplicity, I'm going
to take it to be spatially flat.

01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:02.340
Neither of these two
conditions are true in general,

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.700
but they are--

01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:05.760
they're fine for us
to wrap our heads

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:09.310
around what the characteristics
of the solutions look like.

01:22:09.310 --> 01:22:20.240
So in this limit, Friedmann 1
becomes a dot over a squared

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:26.930
equals 8 pi g rho over 3.

01:22:26.930 --> 01:22:33.800
I can borrow this form that
I've got here to write this as 8

01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:40.280
pi over 3 rho at some
particular moment times scale

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.600
factor to the minus n.

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:45.230
So what I'm doing here
is I'm assuming a0 now.

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:48.260
My a right now is 1,
and I'm defining n

01:22:48.260 --> 01:23:01.265
to be 3 times 1 plus W.

01:23:01.265 --> 01:23:02.640
This is easy enough
to solve for.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:19.530
OK.

01:23:19.530 --> 01:23:20.450
Take the square root.

01:23:26.630 --> 01:23:28.382
What you find is--

01:23:28.382 --> 01:23:29.840
I'm going to just
sort of-- there's

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:32.510
a constant you guys can work
out on your own if you like.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:42.960
a dot must be proportional
to a 1 minus n over 2,

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:50.190
or a is proportional
to t to the 2 over n.

01:23:57.360 --> 01:23:59.250
n equals 0 is a
special case that we'll

01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.092
talk about in just a moment.

01:24:01.092 --> 01:24:02.550
If we are dealing
with what we call

01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:13.620
a matter-dominated
universe, well,

01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:17.820
in this sort of monospecies,
spatially flat form,

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:21.070
this would have W
equal 0, n equals

01:24:21.070 --> 01:24:28.110
3, and a scale factor that
grows as t to the 2/3 power.

01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:31.530
A matter-dominated universe
is one that expands,

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:34.050
but it expands with
this kind of a loss.

01:24:34.050 --> 01:24:37.120
So it slows down with time.

01:24:37.120 --> 01:24:50.140
A radiation-dominated
universe, W equals 1/3, n

01:24:50.140 --> 01:25:02.720
equals 4, that is a
universe that expands

01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:03.720
as the square root of t.

01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:10.760
What about my
cosmological constant?

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:11.260
Ah.

01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:12.385
OK, well that's a problem--

01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:19.050
n equals 0, and my solution
doesn't work for that one.

01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:38.350
So what you do is just--

01:25:38.350 --> 01:25:44.762
let's just go back to
our F or W equations.

01:25:44.762 --> 01:25:46.220
Or rather, our
Friedmann equations.

01:25:46.220 --> 01:25:48.980
Let's write F1 down again.

01:25:48.980 --> 01:25:54.410
I have a dot over
a equals 8 pi--

01:25:54.410 --> 01:26:02.075
whoops-- 8 pi g rho over 3,
and this is now a constant.

01:26:08.460 --> 01:26:11.310
Rho equals rho 0
because it's a constant.

01:26:11.310 --> 01:26:13.980
I can rewrite this in terms
of the cosmological constant

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:16.070
lambda.

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:20.020
And so another way
to write this is--

01:26:20.020 --> 01:26:22.840
sorry about that-- a dot
a-- a dot over a squared

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:30.420
equals this, which
equals lambda over 3.

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:43.715
So this leads to an
exponential solution.

01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:52.590
Now our real universe is
not as simple as these three

01:26:52.590 --> 01:26:55.440
illustrative cases that
I have put in here just

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:57.660
to illustrate what the
extremes look like, OK?

01:26:57.660 --> 01:27:01.110
We are not a
monospecies universe,

01:27:01.110 --> 01:27:05.370
we have a mixture of matter,
we have a mixture of radiation,

01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:07.770
we appear to have
something that smells

01:27:07.770 --> 01:27:09.660
a lot like a
cosmological constant,

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:14.580
although the jury is still out
if one is being perfectly fair.

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.410
Work is ongoing.

01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:20.830
What you need to do in general
is sort of model things.

01:27:20.830 --> 01:27:24.790
You try to make models of
the universe that correspond

01:27:24.790 --> 01:27:28.540
to different mixtures of
things that can go into it,

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:32.770
and then you go through
and ask yourself,

01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:36.280
do the observables that emerge
in this universe match what

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.860
we see?

01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:40.660
Generally you will
see sort of trends

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:42.580
that are similar to
this that emerge, right?

01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:44.500
There might be a particular
epoch where matter

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.730
is more important,
there might be

01:27:45.730 --> 01:27:47.500
an epoch where radiation
is more important,

01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:49.750
there might be an epoch where
cosmological constant is

01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:50.540
more important.

01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.810
And so you might see sort
of you know transitions

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:55.210
between these things where
it's mostly a square root t

01:27:55.210 --> 01:27:58.240
expansion, and then
something happens

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:00.598
and the radiation
becomes less important,

01:28:00.598 --> 01:28:03.140
there's an intermediate regime
where both are playing a role,

01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:04.180
and then matter
becomes important

01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:06.550
and it kicks over to a t to
the 2/3 kind of expansion

01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:09.550
when it becomes
matter-dominated.

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.830
You don't want to assume
the universe is flat,

01:28:11.830 --> 01:28:14.530
you need to do your analysis,
including a non-zero flatness

01:28:14.530 --> 01:28:16.655
parameter in there, which
makes things a little bit

01:28:16.655 --> 01:28:17.560
complicated.

01:28:17.560 --> 01:28:20.560
So in the next
lecture, I am going

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.470
to talk a little bit about
how one extracts observables

01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:24.670
from these spacetimes.

01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:31.450
How is it that we are able
to actually go into an FRW

01:28:31.450 --> 01:28:35.145
universe and measure
things-- what can we measure,

01:28:35.145 --> 01:28:36.520
how can we use
those measurements

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:39.280
to learn about the energy
budget of our universe

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:42.880
and formulate cosmology as
an observational and physical

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.200
science?

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:47.640
And with that, I will
end this lecture.

00:00:20.797 --> 00:00:22.380
EARLL MURMAN: So
let's just take stock

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.360
a little bit on why we're
going to do this next module.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.210
Did you guys have some troubles
with supply chain management

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.775
in your factories on this
last round of simulation?

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:33.510
AUDIENCE: We did.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.440
EARLL MURMAN: We did.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.150
And how about the
suppliers down there?

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.730
Did you have a lot of
visibility of what was going on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.930
with your customers?

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.580
AUDIENCE: For all I know,
they're building houses.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.300
EARLL MURMAN: They're
building houses.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.175
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:43.863
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:45.030
AUDIENCE: And not very well.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.947
EARLL MURMAN: And we
heard yesterday from Jeff

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:50.430
at Gorton's, about how
critical his supply

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.770
chain was in the
transformation of Gorton's

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.450
to a lean enterprise.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.420
And we heard also, a little bit
at Aspect Medical about supply

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.230
chain.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.760
So supply chain is a
really critical area

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.700
of a lean transformation.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.270
And here's just a quote,
that 7% of the companies

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.488
today are effectively
managing their supply chain.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.030
Now, that's a little
bit out of date.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.890
It's 2003.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.750
But only 7%.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.350
But they're 73% more profitable
than the other manufacturers.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.810
So who are some of the companies
you think about, you might

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.810
think about, that are
well-known for good supply chain

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.320
management?

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.950
AUDIENCE: Dell.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.430
EARLL MURMAN: Dell.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.210
AUDIENCE: Walmart.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.870
EARLL MURMAN: Walmart.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.320
AUDIENCE: UPS.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.028
AUDIENCE: Toyota.

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:32.570
EARLL MURMAN: UPS,
Toyota, OK, exactly.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.040
OK, so here's our
objectives for this module.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.415
At the end of this
module, you'll

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.500
be able to recognize the
importance of suppliers

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.250
in the enterprise.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.160
I think you probably know
that, going into the module.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.310
We're going to talk about
the four key attributes

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.080
of a lean supply chain.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.660
One of them is aligning the
design, the product design,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.420
or whatever your area is
with the supply chain.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.450
There needs to be
an alignment there.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.360
One is having the suppliers
participate in your material

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.320
flow.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.880
I saw someone for
the supplier table

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.650
coming up here,
delivering parts.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.340
That's participation in this
material flow; Having them

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.440
actually involved in the
design and development

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.850
of your product; and then
the information flow.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.180
And so then, also,
most organizations

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.360
have a legacy supply chain
that they have to transform.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.352
Aspect Medical was lucky.

00:02:21.352 --> 00:02:22.060
It was a startup.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.712
But we heard from
Jeff, for example.

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:24.670
The company's been in--

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.830
Jeff, 1889?

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.770
AUDIENCE: 1849.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.020
EARLL MURMAN: 1849--

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.830
OK, they had a legacy supply
chain they had to deal with.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.890
This picture
diagrammatically shows

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.985
how suppliers interact with
both the product development

00:02:39.985 --> 00:02:40.830
and production.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:45.060
So remember, the customer is the
one that specifies the value.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.155
And then the role of
product development,

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:48.530
or engineering,
which Annalisa is

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.420
going to talk about
this afternoon,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.480
is really to develop a
design which, when produced,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.760
meets those customer
expectations.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.090
OK?

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.760
And one of the things that
happens in a lean supply chain

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.183
is to get those
suppliers involved early,

00:03:02.183 --> 00:03:03.600
not think of them
as something you

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.560
add on at the end
of your design,

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.280
but to get them working
with you during the design.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.520
And in the aerospace area,
typically, 60% to 80%

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.130
of the product value,
that is, the dollar

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.650
value of the product, is
outsourced to the suppliers.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.900
And now, we saw that
yesterday at Aspect Medical.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.480
They didn't give us the
numbers, I don't believe,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.490
but they don't make anything.

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.110
They assemble things.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.220
OK?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.160
John Coolidge said that
they're a final assembler.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.410
So a lot of the value
of that product,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.690
they buy from suppliers.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.200
So suppliers are absolutely
critical to their success.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.173
Then, when it gets
to production--

00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:39.590
and Annalisa is
going to talk more

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.590
about the interaction of product
development and production,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.630
where the value is
created and delivered back

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.820
to the customers-- you
want to have your suppliers

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.068
as partners.

00:03:48.068 --> 00:03:49.610
So you have to think
of the suppliers

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.260
as part of your enterprise.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.350
And we call that the
extended enterprise.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.050
So today, you want to
think about those guys

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:59.480
at the back table as
part of your enterprise.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.300
They're not somebody you just
send orders to and get parts

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.860
from.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.820
OK, now what does a
supply chain look like?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.390
Well, here is a generic
picture, starting

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.890
with the end user, customer,
the prime, all the way

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.570
down to some raw
material supplier.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.445
And usually, these are
in tiers-- first tier,

00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:19.130
second tier, and
third tier suppliers.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.860
And as you move down
the supply chain,

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.900
each tier represents
a smaller proportion

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.800
of the mean business.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.190
But they're very critical.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.310
So let's just get
a little example.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.643
We have an interesting group
here, a very diverse group.

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:31.340
So let me call on some people.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.410
And tell us a little
bit about where

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.720
you fit in in your supply chain
and how far up and down you

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.220
can see.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.410
So Tam, you're with Intel.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.560
OK, where in Intel
do you fit in this?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.308
Are you a prime, or are
you a supplier to a prime?

00:04:50.308 --> 00:04:51.710
AUDIENCE: I'm not really sure.

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.080
I worked at [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.480
So I would say I [INAUDIBLE]
the facility that's prior to

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:02.110
and lean part of [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.252
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so a couple of
things here-- first of all, Tam

00:05:06.252 --> 00:05:07.960
is in product development,
and he doesn't

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.220
know what his supply chain is.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:10.100
Right?

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.930
OK?

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.970
Is that what I hear?

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:13.990
Who's your end customer?

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.270
Do you know?

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.410
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so that's
not the end customer.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.880
But you have a manufacturing--
that's your customer,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.630
is the manufacturing facility.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.730
And what are they making?

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.813
AUDIENCE: Powder products.

00:05:28.813 --> 00:05:29.855
EARLL MURMAN: A product--

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:30.940
AUDIENCE: Or end products.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.565
EARLL MURMAN: And
are they then selling

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.996
that to Hewlett-Packard,
or somebody?

00:05:34.996 --> 00:05:37.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:38.662 --> 00:05:39.370
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.640
And so they go to some
customer from Intel.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:47.153
And then eventually, some
end user, like Donna?

00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:47.997
AUDIENCE: Lynn.

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:48.830
EARLL MURMAN: Sorry.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.690
Lynn-- she's using her computer.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:51.590
She's the end user.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.427
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:54.260
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so
let's pick a different.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.038
Luis-- Luis, you're
with the US Air Force.

00:05:57.038 --> 00:05:57.830
AUDIENCE: Yes, sir.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.760
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.810
Now where are you in
this supply chain here?

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.010
AUDIENCE: Well,
we're a developer.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.573
So we would be a customer.

00:06:10.573 --> 00:06:11.990
EARLL MURMAN: You'd
be a customer.

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.490
OK.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.560
And who might be the end
user of what you develop?

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.485
AUDIENCE: The Space Wing,
the 45th Space Wing.

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:18.860
EARLL MURMAN: Oh,
the Space Wing.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.300
AUDIENCE: The 45th Space Wing.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.120
EARLL MURMAN: OK, Space Wing.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.800
OK.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.850
And sitting where you sit
as a customer, how far

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:30.220
down the supply chain do
you interact with people?

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.540
AUDIENCE: Not very far down,
because we have a contractor

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.100
that does all that for us.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.620
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so
your contractor's is

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.570
Lockheed or Northrop Grumman?

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.783
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so you
interact with a contractor, who

00:06:43.783 --> 00:06:45.080
interacts with the suppliers.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.890
OK.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.917
Now Carlos, you're with Cargo?

00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:48.500
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.827
EARLL MURMAN: OK,
and in Mexico, right?

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:51.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.137
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so do
you do food products?

00:06:56.137 --> 00:06:56.720
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.550
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so where would
you be in this supply chain?

00:07:02.203 --> 00:07:04.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] are
on the prime manufacturers

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:04.750
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.333
EARLL MURMAN: OK,
so you're the prime.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.940
And who might be your customers?

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:12.415
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:12.415 --> 00:07:12.830
EARLL MURMAN: Huh?

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.770
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.050
And then, how far
down the supply chain

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:18.300
do you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.300
AUDIENCE: We're the last,
the last [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.900
EARLL MURMAN: You
see all the way

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.358
down the supply
chain [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:23.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.490
EARLL MURMAN: OK, I'd like
to call one more group here.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:26.510
And I don't know
much about it at all,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.260
someone from the
Veteran's Administration.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:30.923
So Doug?

00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:33.340
Yeah, you're working with
health care and stuff like that.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.260
AUDIENCE: Yes, I'm
basically at the end user.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.095
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:07:36.095 --> 00:07:37.720
AUDIENCE: I work in
the lab department.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:38.595
EARLL MURMAN: Oh, OK.

00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:41.830
AUDIENCE: So I'm
actually a customer.

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.460
And I provide results
to the physicians.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:51.320
And I interact with
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.700
EARLL MURMAN: OK, cool.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.300
OK.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.810
So you can see that these
are just different examples

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:57.530
of supply chain.

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.740
Now, one of the
things that comes out

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:02.660
a little bit in
this little exercise

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.850
we did, but is really
a very true thing,

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:08.300
is that most people in
a non-lean supply chain

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:12.070
don't have much visibility up
or downstream in that supply

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.570
chain.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.170
And so what they get
is what we call-- they

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.220
get the orders over the wall.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.652
So you might give an
order for reagents,

00:08:19.652 --> 00:08:21.110
and they don't even
know it's going

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.235
to come until, all of a
sudden, it arrives, if it's

00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:25.170
a non-lean supply chain.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.543
So there's a lack of visibility.

00:08:27.543 --> 00:08:29.960
If you're in the supply chain,
there's not much visibility

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.820
upstream or downstream,
what's happening,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:34.580
until all of a sudden, you
get something, a request,

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.783
and you have to react to it.

00:08:35.783 --> 00:08:38.450
And that's kind of what you have
at the back of the table there.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:42.350
You don't have much visibility
of what's happening up here.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.790
And so that means you're
in a very response mode.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:47.690
OK.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.720
So now let's do a
little exercise.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.620
Here are some attributes
of supply chains.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:59.430
And what we want you to do is
gather around your easel charts

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.320
and discuss these a little bit.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.145
And write down, which
of these attributes

00:09:05.145 --> 00:09:08.535
do you identify with what you
might think as a lean supply

00:09:08.535 --> 00:09:11.460
chain, realizing we haven't
really covered that topic yet?

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.310
But this is part of how
we're going to go about it.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:16.080
And talk a little bit
about what you think

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.110
might be the top three
priorities for a lean supply

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:20.610
chain.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.350
So let's just say,
for example, you

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.950
picked all these as representing
a lean supply chain and not

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:26.760
those.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.430
Which of these are the
three most important,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:31.810
do you think, to have
a lean supply chain?

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.950
So let's spend about
10 minutes doing that,

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.090
around your easel charts.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.880
And then we're going to see what
we collectively come up with,

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.940
a lean supply chain.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.440
OK?

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.165
AUDIENCE: Should we
invite our suppliers now?

00:09:42.165 --> 00:09:43.590
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, you
can invite your suppliers

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:44.070
if you'd like.

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.570
Sure.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.760
That sounds like
a good practice.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.280
OK.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.770
So let's see.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.310
Let me call on
the table up here,

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.490
table in the northeast
corner, northwest

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.780
corner of the building.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.050
What are your top
characteristics

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.280
of a lean supply chain?

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.080
And why did you pick them?

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.763
Someone want to give
us that briefing?

00:10:10.763 --> 00:10:11.930
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:14.245
AUDIENCE: The
first one we picked

00:10:14.245 --> 00:10:15.335
was responsive and agile.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.790
We need our supplier to give
us what we need, when we need,

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.300
and in a timely
manner, so that we

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:26.440
can make those [INAUDIBLE]
quota enterprise approach,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:27.450
so the end to end.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:30.200
So just knowing what the
other processes means we

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.940
don't end up with
national [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.200
And then we had [INAUDIBLE] with
collaboration and continuous

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.930
[INAUDIBLE] activities with
the supplier customers-- again,

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.480
just partnering
with our suppliers

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.498
and not just [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:45.498 --> 00:10:46.290
EARLL MURMAN: Good.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.690
OK.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.660
Good choices, good choice
and good priorities.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.800
How about back here?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.177
AUDIENCE: We did collaboration
and supplier commitment

00:10:55.177 --> 00:10:57.510
with long-term relationship,
which probably go together.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.770
Because if you're going to
have a long-term relationship,

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.240
you're going to work together.

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.448
EARLL MURMAN: Good rationale.

00:11:01.448 --> 00:11:04.080
AUDIENCE: Visibility of demand,
so you can see what's coming;

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.407
and just continually improving.

00:11:05.407 --> 00:11:06.990
EARLL MURMAN:
Continuous improvement--

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.045
OK, good.

00:11:08.045 --> 00:11:10.670
And you had some others up there
that you put a lower priority.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.378
AUDIENCE: I mean, the
enterprise approach

00:11:12.378 --> 00:11:14.970
made sense, of looking
at the whole envelope.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:20.220
And build to order, so
that your activities

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.670
are driven by the customer
requests and the responses.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.930
EARLL MURMAN: OK, good.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:27.720
OK, let's take one more.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.730
And then how about up here
with all the colored dots.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.910
It looks to me like you
did the multi-voting.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.882
That's good.

00:11:33.882 --> 00:11:35.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.520
Someone want to
tell us about that?

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.040
We say that this
customer is just good.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.918
When we came to the queue that
[INAUDIBLE] continuous grouping

00:11:47.918 --> 00:11:52.370
was [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.050
Together, it's collaboration
and the holistic enterprise

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:56.550
approach.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.620
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so we're
seeing some commonality here.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.370
Let's see, let me just
look at the others.

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:08.470
I see the same things on
the remaining ones here.

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.410
OK, so I think you
guys got pretty much--

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.910
very good.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.820
You're already beginning to
identify what a lean supply

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.473
chain is, before you even have
heard about it, so to speak,

00:12:18.473 --> 00:12:20.390
which is part of the
purpose of this exercise.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.682
Another thing we see is the
priorities are a little bit

00:12:22.682 --> 00:12:23.740
different between tables.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.420
And this reflects what
happens in the real world,

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.110
is that different organizations
might have different priorities

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.610
as to what they think is most
important in a particular time

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.788
with their supply chain,
for whatever reason

00:12:37.788 --> 00:12:38.830
you picked at your table.

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.715
But maybe they're
having difficulty

00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:42.090
with collaboration,
or something,

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.040
so collaboration is going
to be more important

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.415
right now in
getting their supply

00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:47.400
chain lean than something else.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:50.182
The only thing I would add--
that the build to order,

00:12:50.182 --> 00:12:52.140
I understand why you put
it there as a response

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:53.280
to the customer.

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.520
But that's actually a way of
describing a non-lean supply

00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.380
chain, where you
ship orders, and they

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.120
send you back materials.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.100
But you don't really
engage them at all

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.583
in the design of the product.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.750
You just send them an order,
and they send it back--

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.260
kind of send me the blueprint
and send me back the parts,

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.850
and let's negotiate on
price, type of thing.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:16.710
So the ones that are identified
here as a lean supply chain are

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.550
collaboration-- you got
that; responsive and agile--

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.115
you got that; based on
product characteristics--

00:13:23.115 --> 00:13:24.990
I don't think we had
anybody come up on that,

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:27.780
but we're going to talk
about that in a minute;

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.270
enterprise approach;
a commitment

00:13:30.270 --> 00:13:34.120
to a long-term relationship;
a visibility of demand,

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:36.720
which was getting over
that brick wall barrier;

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.800
and the continuous improvement.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.615
So we're on the same page.

00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:43.240
OK, so let's move on now to the
second main learning objective.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.650
So you can now recognize the
attributes of a lean supply

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:46.150
chain--

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.230
I mean, the main attributes.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:53.450
Here are the four we're
going to talk about.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.290
And the first one is
alignment with the product

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:57.860
characteristics.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.160
And this may be a
little bit theoretical,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.890
but you can think
of it, in theory,

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.120
of two ends of the extremes.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.880
One is you have a push
system, where somebody builds

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:12.546
parts and sends them to you.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:19.168
They build their parts,
thinking about some demand that

00:14:19.168 --> 00:14:19.960
might be out there.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.970
And then they're
ready to send them

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.770
when somebody makes an order.

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:25.970
And the other extreme would
be a pull supply chain,

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:28.053
where they don't build
anything until you ask them

00:14:28.053 --> 00:14:33.970
for that, in some way respond
to the customer demand.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.010
And in some sense,
supply chains are

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:37.810
a combination of push and pull.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:41.560
These are theoretical concepts
at the end of a spectrum.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:48.400
But a push supply chain might
be most prevalent in a commodity

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:54.040
area, where you're maybe still
in the economies of scale

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:54.820
mentality.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.198
Let's build as many
as we can and ship

00:14:57.198 --> 00:14:58.240
to the demand that comes.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:02.330
In a mature environment, that
probably works pretty well.

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:03.190
OK.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.960
So paperclips-- we're going to
use some paper clips tomorrow

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.130
on one of the exercises.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.368
People making paper clips--

00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:13.660
they kind of know about what
the demand is going to be.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.702
It doesn't change that
rapidly, so they can maybe

00:15:15.702 --> 00:15:17.710
do a push supply
chain type thing.

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:21.010
Where a pull supply chain, you
have some specialized part,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:22.780
at the other extreme.

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:25.270
We're going to show you,
in a little bit, an example

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.720
from Lockheed Martin, where
one ship set a year of tubes

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.342
for an Atlas V
rocket, they don't

00:15:31.342 --> 00:15:32.800
want to make those
tubes until they

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.950
know that the rocket's
about ready to be re-sent.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.740
So the point is that your
product may be made up

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.820
of different components.

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.250
And the supply chains
that go with those

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.710
may be managed
somewhat differently.

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:46.160
One size doesn't fit all.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:48.660
So that's what it means
to align your product--

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:52.370
your supply chain with the
product characteristics.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:57.950
OK, supplier participation in
material flow and logistics--

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:00.260
just-in-time deliveries--
I think everybody's

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:02.760
pretty much familiar with
that, that that's really

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.702
an output of the Toyota
production system and all.

00:16:05.702 --> 00:16:07.160
And of course, the
crucial thing is

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.952
that the parts have to
show up when needed,

00:16:08.952 --> 00:16:12.800
because just-in-time parts go
right to the assembly line.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.750
And so if they don't
show up when needed,

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.690
then everything
else gets impacted.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.330
On the other hand, the advantage
is there's no inventory.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.780
And if there are any issues that
come up on quality type things,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.340
you can correct them right away.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:33.947
OK, so just-in-time deliveries;
kitting for point-of-use--

00:16:33.947 --> 00:16:35.780
we talked about that a
little bit yesterday.

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:39.660
And let's put that off, because
the next example shows that.

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.220
Vendor-managed inventory-- this
is where the inventory, instead

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:49.700
of being owned by the customer,
is taken care of by the vendor.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.301
Let me give you an
example of that.

00:16:52.301 --> 00:16:57.710
So JDAM is a Joint
Direct Attack Munition.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:59.420
We have a picture of
it coming up later.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.640
It's made in East St. Louis.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.980
And one of the parts for
that is made in California.

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.733
I think it's a tail
cone, or something.

00:17:07.733 --> 00:17:09.150
And when I went
through this plant

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.520
in East St. Louis,
Missouri, there's

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:15.030
a video camera on the
ceiling in the loading

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:17.200
dock, where they receive parts.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.930
So what's that video camera for?

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:21.329
Well, the supplier
in California is

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:25.020
looking at what the inventory
is there in East St. Louis

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:27.180
and seeing when it's time
for them to ship more.

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:32.520
So they're managing the
inventory of that product.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.740
And third party logistics--
this is, instead

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.860
of that organization shipping,
or the receiving organization

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:41.400
shipping, they
delegate that to FedEx.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.890
And FedEx, they hire FedEx
to handle all the shipping.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.850
And so UPS and FedEx and those
big companies, like Atlas Air--

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.062
do you guys do that?

00:17:51.062 --> 00:17:55.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
we have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:55.185 --> 00:17:56.852
EARLL MURMAN: Pull
their elements, yeah.

00:17:56.852 --> 00:18:06.167
So there's a big business in
these third-party logistics.

00:18:06.167 --> 00:18:07.500
So let's look at an example now.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.292
And think about these
on this next example,

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:11.220
and how many of them do we see?

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.670
OK, so this is the Atlas V.
The Atlas V is a large launch

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.230
vehicle.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.000
The Atlas V and the Delta IV
are the largest launch vehicles.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.710
These are big rockets.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:21.900
OK?

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:24.360
And they receive
tubes, when they

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.920
have to put together a rocket,
and what they call a ship set.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.920
They call that a ship set.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.590
And a ship set of
tubes cost $180,000.

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:38.630
And now, how do they come?

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:42.230
Well, in the old way, they
came as separate parts.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.950
A ship set has 199 parts in it.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:48.410
And they came all in
their own packing boxes,

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:51.380
separately, wrapped
up in foam, and stuff.

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.518
And you've got all this waste
and lots of stuff coming in.

00:18:54.518 --> 00:18:55.310
That's the old way.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.930
The new way is they
come in this kit.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:03.613
And everything, all 199 parts,
with these five major tubes--

00:19:03.613 --> 00:19:05.030
they have the
connectors and all--

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:06.290
come as a kit.

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.660
And they not only come
with the hardware,

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:10.265
but the tools to assemble them.

00:19:10.265 --> 00:19:12.140
And usually, the
instructions that go with it

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.408
are right with that.

00:19:13.408 --> 00:19:15.950
So there were some [INAUDIBLE]
cards yesterday about kitting.

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:17.370
And this is what
kitting is about.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.290
OK?

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:26.080
And now, they make about one
or two of these rockets a year,

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:27.740
or a small number.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.885
So they keep their
suppliers informed when

00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:31.010
they're going to need that.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.490
And all this is managed as one.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.160
So they don't ship these until--

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.240
this is a pull system.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.797
They don't ship
it until they know

00:19:39.797 --> 00:19:42.380
that they're going to need it,
because it's an expensive thing

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.030
to have in inventory.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:54.930
And all this 199 parts is one
record in their MRP system.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:58.350
instead of 199 different parts
they're checking, following,

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.540
they follow one--

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:05.940
so the great reduction in costs,
handling costs, and carrying

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.530
costs in cycle time.

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.780
So some of those things we
saw on the previous slide--

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:14.610
kitting, vendor-managed
inventory, pull system,

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:18.700
you see in situations like this.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.827
OK, let's now turn to
supplier involvement

00:20:20.827 --> 00:20:21.910
in design and development.

00:20:21.910 --> 00:20:24.327
And oh, by the way, this is a
little bit of a segue slide,

00:20:24.327 --> 00:20:27.460
because this is this JDAM
munition I mentioned before.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.340
And the JDAM part is it's
a retrofitted tailcone

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.520
on a otherwise dumb bomb.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.960
And it turns into a smart bomb.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.530
It has a receiver in it
and GPS system, and so on.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:44.440
And all of this, by the
way, comes in a kit.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.650
Here's what it looks like.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:46.697
OK?

00:20:46.697 --> 00:20:47.530
So that's a kitting.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:53.230
But more importantly, here,
when the JDAM was developed,

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.880
it was done very uniquely.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.090
This is an Air
Force procurement.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.790
And when they formed
the proposal team

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.980
to bid on it, a
competitor proposal team,

00:21:02.980 --> 00:21:04.760
they had McDonnell
Douglas, at that time,

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.640
and Lockheed bidding.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.140
That proposal team actually
had the key suppliers on it.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:14.080
And it also had an Air
Force representative

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.220
on the proposal team.

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.080
They were proposing
to the Air Force,

00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.218
but there was an Air Force
representative on it.

00:21:19.218 --> 00:21:21.760
The Air Force representative
was not on for business reasons.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.343
The Air Force
representative was on so

00:21:23.343 --> 00:21:26.470
that the designers understood
the requirements of the Air

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:28.800
Force.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.860
So they understood
the requirements.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.870
They had what they
call gold congruency.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:36.603
All the members of
this team knew what

00:21:36.603 --> 00:21:37.770
they were trying to achieve.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:41.430
They were trying to achieve
the winning bid that satisfied

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.070
the Air Force customer needs.

00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:44.280
OK?

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.860
That was what drove
all their decisions.

00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.700
And so they understood what the
costs, the requirements were.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.640
Now, what did they do?

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.660
They got the designers,
and the subcontractors

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.170
were involved in the design.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:01.770
And this turned out,
that in the process,

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.990
the subcontractors had to
rearrange their expected work

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.680
share.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.030
Some subcontractors gave up
a portion and others gained.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:14.990
So actually, if you think about
it from a narrow point of view,

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:18.410
you're giving up some business,
so that you can gain some.

00:22:18.410 --> 00:22:22.080
But they knew that that was
important to win the contract.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.690
And so they
reallocated work share.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:27.440
Specifically, they had some
partitioned electronics

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:28.310
on separate boards.

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:30.310
And they realized, that
if they integrated those

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.630
on the same board, they could
greatly reduce the costs,

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:34.400
and so on.

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.650
And the result was,
where they originally

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:40.250
thought this unit was going
to cost $68,000 per unit,

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.190
in the end, it cost
$15,000 per unit.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.860
And Boeing now--

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:47.500
McDonnell Douglas
was bought by Boeing.

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.750
Boeing is making these things.

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.433
That's the plant
in East St. Louis.

00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:51.350
And everybody's happy.

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:52.642
Boeing is making lots of money.

00:22:52.642 --> 00:22:54.920
The Air Force is getting
lots of supplies.

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:56.930
But look how much
cost reduction they

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.820
had by getting those
designers involved

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.670
in the development,
subcontractors involved

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:04.260
in the development and design.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.930
OK, then the fourth attribute
is the seamless flow

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:08.990
of information.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.597
And this is a busy
picture, which

00:23:10.597 --> 00:23:11.680
we don't want to read all.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.770
But the point is that
we got here the system

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.020
integrator, the Aspect Medical.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.630
And we have over
here the supplier.

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:21.520
And in a non-lean
supply chain, what

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:26.888
would happen is, over here, an
engineering of the supplier,

00:23:26.888 --> 00:23:27.930
they may have a question.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.262
They would go up to
their sales department.

00:23:31.262 --> 00:23:32.970
That would come over
here to procurement.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.940
It would come down
here to get answered--

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:39.660
lots of vertical
communication paths.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.250
What you want in a
lean supply chain

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.130
is a lot of horizontal
communication paths.

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:46.890
And you need to align it with
the level of the organization.

00:23:46.890 --> 00:23:49.890
So you would like engineers
talking with engineers.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:53.610
Now, sometimes we give this
talk at a government procurement

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.110
audience.

00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:55.700
They say, oh, that's illegal.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.100
Can't do that.

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.845
It may be, but that
means it's also not lean.

00:23:59.845 --> 00:24:00.345
OK?

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.410
Those things can be changed.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.460
OK?

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.190
But you have to have
some clear guidelines

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:09.810
about what's
communicated, who has

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.670
responsibility to communicate.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:13.920
But you want these
people on the phone

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.100
and on email contact,
sharing information,

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.430
to have a flexible,
responsive supplier.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.530
OK, so we've got a lot
of information flow.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:26.138
Common databases-- you want to
be accessing the same database.

00:24:26.138 --> 00:24:28.680
You want to have members on the
same integrated product team.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.420
We'll talk about that tomorrow.

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.760
You want to be exchanging
technical data at this level,

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.420
not going up and down, and
some other things here,

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.532
which we won't go into.

00:24:38.532 --> 00:24:39.990
But clearly, that's
a different way

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:44.220
of doing business from
an environment where you

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.310
have a non-lean supply chain.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:51.120
OK, another example of smooth
information flow is Exostar.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.780
Exostar is a company,
an organization,

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.770
which manages the interactions
between major aerospace

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:00.780
companies and their suppliers.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:03.390
So it's like a hub
in the supply chain.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:09.480
They have 34,000
participants in this system.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.610
And it's all electronic.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.740
So suppose Boeing wants to buy
some kind of, say, actuators.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.750
Instead of going to all
the actuator companies,

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:22.080
they go through Exostar, who
manages that transaction.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:26.850
And it's all very paperless.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:29.840
And it's just been
a huge savings.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.120
And here are some results
from Rolls Royce, which

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.980
is one of the members,
some of the metrics

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:42.090
that go with their
participation in Exostar.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.390
Instead of having several
thousand suppliers,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.570
they deal with several
hundred; reduction

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:51.000
of cost of goods
purchased of up to 20%,

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.600
because of this integrated
supplier management;

00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:58.020
system inventory
levels down 80%;

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.630
error reduction down,
because they're not manually

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:03.240
entering in a lot of
data; reduced cycle times

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.810
as much as 80%; basically,
elimination of paper;

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.850
and improved relations,
who have benefited

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:13.910
from this reduced
transaction costs.

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:18.290
OK, so now let's move to the
last topic of the module.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:20.828
And that is, how do you improve
the existing supply chains?

00:26:20.828 --> 00:26:22.620
Well, we already heard
from Jeff yesterday.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.240
You work with your suppliers.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.030
OK?

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:28.040
You look at your value stream.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.520
You try to find out, who
are your critical suppliers?

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.620
You want to work with them.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.450
So who's on the critical paths?

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:39.238
Where are the high-cost items or
the long-lead items, and so on?

00:26:39.238 --> 00:26:41.030
And Jeff just couldn't
have said it better.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.753
Yesterday, he said,
when they started

00:26:42.753 --> 00:26:44.420
their lean transformation,
they went out

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.003
and let their suppliers
know that they

00:26:46.003 --> 00:26:47.115
weren't dropping them.

00:26:47.115 --> 00:26:49.240
They were just going to
deal with them differently.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.450
OK?

00:26:50.450 --> 00:26:57.925
If the supplier is ready to
become a lean organization--

00:26:57.925 --> 00:26:59.230
now, they may not be ready yet.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:00.855
They may not have
the right management,

00:27:00.855 --> 00:27:02.273
or they may not be educated.

00:27:02.273 --> 00:27:03.940
They might not have
taken a Lean Academy

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.920
and learned the
importance of this.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.810
Then they've got to
do some prep work.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:10.040
But if they're lean-ready,
then they can go out.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.480
And the prime will actually
work with the supplier.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.000
They'll go out, and they'll
run Kaizen events with them.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.190
They might lend
them a lean expert

00:27:18.190 --> 00:27:19.690
to be on site for a while.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.130
They might invite them to
their training programs.

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:25.060
We taught one of these
Lean Academies at Raytheon,

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.290
up the road-- not Raytheon--

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.200
Textron Systems, up the road,
here in Wilmington, Delaware.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.140
A couple of years ago, Hugh
and I and Jackie taught that.

00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:35.163
And they invited their
suppliers to the class.

00:27:35.163 --> 00:27:37.330
They had about five suppliers,
some from California,

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.250
some from Colorado.

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:40.840
They build their relationship.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.350
They understand what the
value-stream mapping,

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:46.100
that value stream is.

00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:49.960
They come up with their plans
to develop a lean strategy

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.840
in that organization.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.480
And they have some mutual
workshops and Kaizen events

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.450
and a kind of a continuous
improvement cycle.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.730
So this is the way
a lean organization

00:28:00.730 --> 00:28:01.780
works with its suppliers.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.380
It helps them.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.433
It invests in them.

00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:06.850
Actually, we have
some people here

00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:08.260
from the Veterans
Administration.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.802
Rockwell Collins,
which we've already

00:28:09.802 --> 00:28:12.820
talked about in
this Lean Academy,

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:14.950
starting to see that
some of their major costs

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:16.930
were their health care
for their employees

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:18.520
in the Cedar Rapids area.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:21.730
So they started working with
the Cedar Rapids hospitals

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:23.050
to help them become lean.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.550
Because they knew,
in the long term,

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.930
it was going to benefit them.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:29.740
And they loan their lean
experts to Mercy Hospital

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.700
in Cedar Rapids.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:34.600
And they're doing gratings now.

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:39.230
OK, here's one example from
Boeing about Hicksville Machine

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.950
Works on Long Island and some
of the benefits that came out.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.180
And these benefits that
Hicksville came from Boeing,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:49.538
they're going to use
with other customers.

00:28:49.538 --> 00:28:51.830
Boeing invested in it, and
they'll use other customers.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:54.450
That's OK, because
everybody's going to win.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.010
So those are
typical type things.

00:28:57.010 --> 00:29:00.790
Now, as you do this, you start
treating your supply base

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.290
more strategically.

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.460
Instead of a supply base being
all the same, you're strategic.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.800
So certain ones you have
strategic alliances with,

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:13.510
these might be really
critical partners.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.510
For instance, Rockwell Collins
has a strategic alliance

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:19.870
with Boeing, because
they build flight decks.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.600
Your suppliers--
you'll certify them,

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:25.898
so that-- say a gold
supplier is very reliable.

00:29:25.898 --> 00:29:27.940
You might not do any
inspection on something that

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:29.190
comes in from a gold supplier.

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:31.495
It just goes directly
online, because you

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:34.585
know that they have their
processes under control,

00:29:34.585 --> 00:29:36.460
and that they've inspected
it before it left,

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:38.890
and taken the quality
responsibility.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.510
Where, someone who
is on probation

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:41.680
might be just the opposite.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.555
You're not having good
performance from them,

00:29:43.555 --> 00:29:45.160
so you have a lot
of quality control.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.250
Then you might have your
people out in their--

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:50.810
they might be having troubles
with their production system.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:53.520
And so you're sending help
out there to help them.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.050
OK, strategically support--
important suppliers

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.480
might have, say, some
particular kind of materials,

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.210
some titanium, or something,
that maybe there's

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.430
only one supply for.

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:06.010
So that one, you want
to treat strategically.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:08.240
These are the commodity items--

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.458
a core.

00:30:10.458 --> 00:30:12.250
And then these are the
ones you get rid of.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:13.630
They're just not performing.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.020
So supply chain management
is a core competency

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.320
of a lean organization.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:21.930
OK, where are we
going in the future?

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.750
The old approach is
the build-to-order.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.583
The customer sends an
order to the prime.

00:30:27.583 --> 00:30:29.250
The prime sends it
back to the customer.

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.042
The prime puts it down
to the subcontractor

00:30:31.042 --> 00:30:32.790
or the subcontract--

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:35.160
so a lot of interfaces,
rigid interfaces,

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.730
lack of communication,
distrustful relationships.

00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:41.910
The prime beats up
on their supplier--

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.820
get your costs down,
that type of thing.

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:49.140
Current lean is much
more collaborative

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.510
with sharing a lot
of information.

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:53.670
So you might invite
your suppliers in

00:30:53.670 --> 00:30:57.070
and give them your sales
forecasts, your business plans.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:31:00.893
That's very proprietary
information for most companies.

00:31:00.893 --> 00:31:02.310
But if it's an
important supplier,

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:04.350
you want them to know
what the visibility is.

00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:06.210
Emerging lean is
like with the JDAM,

00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.940
where you actually form
almost like a company

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:10.020
for that project.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.570
And you open up your
proprietary databases

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.090
for design and development.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:18.970
And there's some examples
in our book about that.

00:31:18.970 --> 00:31:20.500
OK, so wrap up--

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.150
suppliers are critical to
the lean enterprise success.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.790
Supply chains need to be
understood and designed

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.190
to meet the needs
of the product.

00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:32.080
Legacy supply chains
can be improved

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:34.960
through win-win customer
supplier teamwork.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.850
And it's a core competency
of a lean organization.

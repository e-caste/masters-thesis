00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:08.580
PROFESSOR: Suppose you define
now, one state called phi 1

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.040
as a dagger acting on phi 0.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.380
You could not define
any interesting state

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.730
with a acting on phi 0
because a kills phi 0,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.540
so you try phi 0 like this.

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.870
Now you could ask, OK,
what energy does it have?

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.470
Is it an energy eigenstate?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.520
Well it is an energy eigenstate
if it's a number eigenstate.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.880
And we can see if it's a
number eigenstate by acting

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.500
with the number operator.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:53.900
So N phi 1 is equal
to N a dagger phi 0.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.400
OK.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.030
Here comes trick.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.149
Maybe it's too much to even
call it a trick, number one.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.570
This thing you look
at it and you say,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.920
I want to sort of simplify
this, learn something about it.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.770
If this is supposed to be
an eigenstate of N hat,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.110
I have to make it
happen somehow.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.820
Now n hat kills phi 0.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:43.620
So if I would have a term a
dagger times N hat near phi 0,

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.830
it would be 0.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.310
So I claim, and this
is a step that I

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.430
want you to be able
to do also quickly,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.270
that I can replace this by
the commutator of these two

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:02.680
operators.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.220
The product is replaced
by the commutators.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.510
Why?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.449
Aren't products simpler
than commutators?

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.170
No.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.900
We have formulas
for commutators.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.200
And products are, in
general, more complicated.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.920
And why is this correct?

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.270
And you say, well, it is correct
because this has two terms.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.550
The term I want
minus a dagger N hat.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:38.450
But the term a dagger N hat is
0 because N hat kills phi 0.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.410
So I can do that because
this is N dagger a hat, which

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:54.290
is what I had, minus a
hat dagger N on phi 0.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.090
And this term is 0.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.170
So you would have put
a 2 here or a 3 here,

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.010
or any number even.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.680
But the right one to
put is the commutators.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.750
So that's this.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.930
And now this commutator
is already known.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.940
That's why we computed it.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.380
It's just a dagger.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.370
So this is a dagger phi 0,
and that's what we call phi 1.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.690
So N hat on phi 1 is phi 1.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.660
N hat has eigenvalue 1 on phi 1.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.530
So N is equal to 1.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.760
That's the eigenvalue.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.740
It is an eigenstate.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.770
It is an energy eigenstate.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.730
In fact how much
energy, E, is h bar

00:03:47.730 --> 00:04:00.380
omega times N, which is 1, plus
1/2, which is 3/2 h bar omega?

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.885
And look what this is.

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:06.500
This is the reason this is
called a creation operator.

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.420
Because by acting on the ground
state, what people sometimes

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.530
call the vacuum, the
lowest energy state,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:19.130
the vacuum is called the
lowest energy state, by acting

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.890
on the vacuum you get a state.

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.814
I mean, you've created
a state, therefore.

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.070
How is this concretely done?

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.970
Remember you had
phi 0 of x, what

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:39.060
it is, and a dagger over there
is x minus ip over m omega.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.390
So this is x minus--

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.060
or minus h bar
over m omega d dx.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.710
So you can act on it.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.840
It may be a little messy.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.080
But that's it.

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.910
It's a very closed
form expression.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:06.110
Now, phi 0 was defined, the
ground state such that it's

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.710
a normalized state.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.080
This means the integral of
phi 0 multiplied with phi 0

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.790
over x is 1.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.980
That's how we had
the ground state.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.160
You could ask, if I've
defined phi 1 this way,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.450
is simply normalized?

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.290
So I'll try it.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:29.340
And now you could say, oh, this
is going to be a nightmare.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.610
Normalizing phi 0
is difficult. Now I

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.620
have to act with a
dagger, which means act

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.010
with x, take derivatives.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.600
It's going to grow twice as big.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.960
Then I'm going to have to
square it and integrate it.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.040
It looks very bad.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.000
The good thing is those with
these a's and a daggers,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.560
you have to compute
anything, pretty much.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.690
See how we do it.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:01.580
I want to know how much
is phi 1 with phi 1.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.690
Is it 1?

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.330
And it's normalized or not?

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:13.125
Then I say, look, phi 1 is a
dagger phi 0, a dagger phi 0.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.570
So far so good.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.990
But I just know
things about phi 0.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.100
So let's clear up one phi 0.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.180
At least I can move
the a dagger as an a.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:39.855
So this is phi 0
a a dagger phi 0.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.840
Can I finish the
computation in this line?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.470
Yes, I think we can.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.120
Phi 0.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.460
a with a dagger,
same story as before.

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.520
a would kill phi 0.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.140
So you can replace
that by a commutator.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.486
Commutator of a
with a dagger phi 0.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.170
But the commutator of
a with a dagger is 1,

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.200
so this is phi 0 phi
0 and it's equal to 1.

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:27.390
Yes, it is properly normalized.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.570
So that's the nice thing
about these a's and a daggers.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.750
Just start moving them around.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.270
You have to get practice.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.530
Where should you move it?

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.940
Where should you put it?

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.120
When you replay something by
a commutator, when you don't.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.920
It's a matter of practice.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.400
There's no other way.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.060
You have to do a lot
of these commutators

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.130
to get a feeling
of how they work

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:56.310
and what you're supposed to do.

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.750
Let's do another state.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.590
Let's try to do phi 2.

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.010
I'll put a prime because
I'm not sure this is going

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.390
to work out exactly right.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:14.590
And this time, I'll put an a
dagger a dagger on the vacuum.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.930
Two a daggers, two creation
operators on the vacuum.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:33.159
And now I want to see if
this is an energy eigenstate.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:39.080
Well, this is a dagger
squared on the vacuum.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:43.630
So let's ask, is N hat--

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:47.240
is phi 2 prime an
eigenstate of N hat?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:56.890
Well I would have N hat on
a dagger squared on phi 0.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.390
Again, by now you know, I should
replace this by a commutator

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:08.110
because N hat kills the phi
0, so N hat with a dagger

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.400
squared phi 0.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.880
And that commutator
has been done.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:22.890
It's two times a
hat dagger squared,

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:31.620
two times a dagger squared
on phi 0, which is 2 phi 2.

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:33.900
That's what we call
the state phi 2 prime.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:34.420
I'm sorry.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.160
So again, it is an
energy eigenstate.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.350
Is it normalized?

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:54.160
Well, let's try it.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:10:01.450
Phi 2 prime phi 2 prime is
equal to a dagger a dagger.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:02.820
Let me not put the hats.

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.050
I'm getting tired of them.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.620
a dagger a dagger phi 0.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.980
Now I move all of them.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.180
This a dagger becomes
an a, the next a dagger

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.290
becomes an a here.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:30.580
So this is phi 0 a a a
dagger a dagger phi 0.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:33.270
Wow, this looks a
little more complicated.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:40.280
Because we don't want to
calculate that thing, really.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.745
We definitely don't want
to start writing x and p's.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.090
But, you know, you decide.

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:52.100
Take it one at a time.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.570
This a is here and wants
to act on this thing.

00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:58.580
And then this other
a will, but let's

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:04.190
just concentrate on the
first a that wants to act.

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:09.230
a would kill phi 0, so we
can replace this whole thing

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.240
by a commutator.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.460
So this is phi 0.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.400
The first a is still there,
but the second, we'll

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:22.701
replace it by the
commutator, this commutator.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:34.620
I've replaced this product, the
product of a times this thing,

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.410
by the commutator of
those two operators.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:43.390
And then I say, oh
look, you've done that.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:49.440
a with a dagger to the k
is k a dagger k minus 1.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.850
So I'll write it here.

00:11:53.850 --> 00:12:00.232
This will be a
factor of 2 phi 0 a.

00:12:00.232 --> 00:12:04.370
And this is supposed to be
now a dagger to one power

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:08.080
less, so it's just
a dagger phi 0.

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:20.870
So this is supposed
to be 2a dagger.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:23.090
So that's what I did.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:27.560
And again, this a
wants to act on phi 0

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.030
and it's just
blocked by a dagger,

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.690
but you can replace
it by a commutator.

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:39.610
a with a dagger phi 0.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:45.790
And this is therefore a 1,
so this whole result is a 2.

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:52.990
So this phi 2 prime, yes, it
is the next excited state.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.340
Two creation operators
on the ground state.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.190
Energy and eigenvalues too.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:03.020
You had N equal zero
eigenvalue for the ground state

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:07.900
1 for phi 1, 2 for phi 2 prime.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.390
But it's not
properly normalized.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.370
Well, if the normalization gives
you 2, then you should define

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:20.320
phi 2 as 1 over the
square root of 2

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.405
a dagger a dagger on phi 0.

00:13:28.522 --> 00:13:29.959
And that's proper.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.790
So it's time to go general.

00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:49.090
The n-th excited state, we
claim is given by an a dagger

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:57.850
a dagger, n of them, acting on
phi 0 with a coefficient 1 over

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:00.030
square root of--

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.510
we might think it's
n, but it's actually,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:08.195
you can't tell at this far--
this one is n factorial.

00:14:08.195 --> 00:14:09.070
That's what you need.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.650
That is the state.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:19.040
And what is the
number of this state?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.660
What is the number
eigenvalue on phi n?

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.810
Well, it is 1 over square
root of n factorial.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:43.360
The number acting on the a
daggers, the n of them, phi 0.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.550
You can replace
by the commutator,

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.280
which then is 2 times already.

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:57.595
So it's N commutator with a
dagger to the little n phi 0

00:14:57.595 --> 00:15:00.820
times 1 over square root of n.

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.760
And how much is this commutator?

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.500
Over there.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:12.550
This is N times a
dagger to the n phi 0.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:15.370
So between these
three factors, you're

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:19.640
still getting n phi to the n.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.860
So the number for this
state is little n.

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.590
It is an energy eigenstate.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:32.190
The N eigenvalue is little n.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:37.260
And the energy is h bar omega.

00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:46.100
The eigenvalue of N hat,
which is little n plus 1/2.

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:56.310
So it is the energy
eigenstate of number little n.

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:00.060
This is the definition.

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:04.850
And the last thing you may want
to check is the normalization.

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:09.420
Let me almost check it here.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:10.410
No, I will check it.

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.320
Let's say I think this
is a full derivation.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.430
Phi n with phi n would
be two factors of those,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:27.510
so I would have 1 over n
factorial a dagger a dagger,

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:34.190
n of them on phi 0, a
dagger a dagger, n of them

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:37.100
again on phi 0.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:41.490
So then that's equal to
1 over n factorial phi

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:57.120
0 a a, lots of a's, n of them,
n a daggers, phi 0, like that.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.860
That's what it is.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.760
We had to move all
the a daggers that

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.319
were acting on the left
input of the integral,

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:12.040
or the inner product,
all the way to the right.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.300
And that's it.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.690
So now comes this step.

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:25.410
And I think you can
see why it's working.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.460
Think of moving the
first a all the way here.

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:33.210
Well, you can replace the
first a with a commutator.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:38.490
But that a with lots of a
daggers, with n a daggers,

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:42.040
would give you a
factor of n, with n

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.340
a daggers will give you a factor
of n times one a dagger less.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:51.460
So to move the first a,
there are n a daggers

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:56.080
and you get one factor
of n from this a.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:01.270
But for the next a, there's
now n minus 1 a daggers,

00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:06.250
so this time you get a factor
of n minus 1 when you move it.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:10.330
From the next one, there's going
to be n minus 2 a daggers, so n

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.680
minus 2.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.840
All of them all the way up to
one, cancels this n factorial,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.300
and that's equal to 1.

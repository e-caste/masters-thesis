WEBVTT

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.700
Okay, the best way to go
about learning all of this

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.120
is to make a picture.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.960
So, we'll work with a
device you've seen before:

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.670
The inside of a music box.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.330
We'll be looking at
getting the right exposure;

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.560
that is capturing
the right amount

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.120
of light from your
device or sample

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.860
onto your camera setting
with your 105 lens.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.320
So let's do this step-wise.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.140
I've previously installed the
software specific to my camera.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.500
So I'll open it up.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010
I keep my dock on the left.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.920
I'll click on it, and,
lo and behold [LAUGHS],

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.470
I get a message that
no camera is detected.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.160
[laugh] So now what?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.870
I'm afraid I do this
a little too often,

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
something I want to alert
you to and then I forget.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.060
Yes, I think it's a good idea
to turn your camera on for all

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.140
this to work.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.700
So I'll do that.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.590
Turn the camera on
and so here we go.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.020
Our software opens up
and we see the screen

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.120
which finally gives me
the way to set exposure

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.680
settings to adjust the shutter
speed and aperture setting.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.970
But first we're going to
go to another screen --

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.270
at least in this software '
giving me the ability to set

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.440
the ISO number.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.360
I'll set it to the
lowest possible number

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.840
the cameral offers
so that we get

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.200
the finest picture possible.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.039
And that's what we'll do
here: We'll set it to 200.

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.660
Now that number tells
the sensor how sensitive

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.039
it should be while letting in
the light from your material.

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.970
The higher you set the ISO
number, for example, 6400,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.910
the more sensitive
you make your sensor.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.250
In low-light conditions,
that could be the way to go,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.780
but remember we have
control over our setup,

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.990
and, in principal, should
be able to add as much light

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.410
as we need.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.560
But there is a problem when
you set your ISO number high:

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.978
The sensor becomes so
sensitive that it picks up

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:14.280
noise, electronic signals from
the circuitry in your camera.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.850
The noise appears as graininess.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.579
It's not digital information
from your subject.

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.250
And it's not what we want.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.560
Take a look at the difference
between these two images.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.000
One is set at 200 ISO,
pretty low number,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.940
compared the other set at 6400.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.190
The graininess of the 6400
ISO image is not what we want.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.230
And by the way, I hope you
are viewing these images

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.270
on a computer or a tablet.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.090
I'm not sure you'll
be able to pick up

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.890
the differences on a phone.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.340
It's really significant.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.420
In this software, we have to
go back to the first screen

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.079
to set the aperture,
which we'll do now.

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.050
We're going to set it at F/32.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.510
For our purposes, we want as
much as possible in focus.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.310
And notice down here that we
see F/32 indicated as well.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.710
Okay, now we set
the shutter speed

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.060
which we decide while looking
at the exposure readout.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.290
We're aiming for the
readout to indicate 0,

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.710
smack in the middle.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.100
Notice it here in
the readout: not

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.190
under exposed, nor overexposed.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.870
The exposure readout
is in fact very

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.750
similar to what you would
see in your viewfinder, just

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.460
easier to see, in my opinion.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.610
And here's where
the tripod comes in.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.920
You might have to set the
shutter speed at maybe a half

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.520
a second, for example.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.970
Now I don't know about
you, but if I hand-held

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.140
the camera in that very
slow shutter speed,

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.250
the image would just not
be sharp when I blow it up.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.240
See these two images,
one while I partially

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.220
hand-held, leaning the
camera on the tripod,

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.470
and the other with the camera
securely mounted on the tripod.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.270
Quite a difference.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.090
You'll have the luxury of
shooting at slow shutter speeds

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.430
without the worry of a quivering
camera if you use a tripod.

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:17.180
Okay, so I have set the ISO,
the aperture, and shutter speed,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.459
and we will now click
on Live View, which

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.860
is another great thing
about the software.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.290
We can see two things.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.420
First, we see if we have to
make adjustments in composition,

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.810
to see if it's
straight, perhaps.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.830
We also see the image with the
aperture setting we've set.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.880
We see what is in focus.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.600
Okay, we're ready to take the
picture and we click on Shoot.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.360
The image is immediately
captured on the camera

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.280
and now watch while
the image immediately

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.090
downloads onto the computer.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.010
Pretty fast!

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.810
Much faster these days
than it used to download.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.030
And here, too, even with
this small thumbnail,

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.300
you can see if the exposure
is pretty much on target

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.160
and if your
composition is right.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.160
Again, if the image
seems crooked,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.320
you can go back and forth
and fix it in Live View

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.730
to make it work.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.400
So let's review
the reasons why you

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.490
should consider using software
to adjust your exposure

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.070
setting.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.220
First, you can easily see
your exposure settings.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.000
Second, you can immediately
see if your settings are right.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.110
Third, you can adjust
your composition

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.380
in Real Time and Live View.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.310
And, that view is the aperture
you've set, showing you what is

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.080
and what is not in focus.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.240
And fourth, you can
store the image directly

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.980
onto your computer without
worrying about storage

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.030
room on a camera card.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.710
But again, if you choose
not to use a software,

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.770
all your exposure settings
can be made in your camera.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.220
Just read your manual.

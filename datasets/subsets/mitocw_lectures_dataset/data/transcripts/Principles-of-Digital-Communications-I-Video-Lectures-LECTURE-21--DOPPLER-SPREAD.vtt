00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.350
PROFESSOR: We've just started
talking about wireless

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.290
communication.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.230
We spent a lot of time talking
about how do you communicate,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.690
essentially on wire lines, where
essentially the only

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.510
problem is white
Gaussian noise.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.230
Namely, you transmit a signal,
noise gets added to it, you

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.080
receive the sum of the
transmitted signal plus noise

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.160
and all of the going from
base band to pass band.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.300
All of that stuff is all messy
analytically, but essentially

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.470
all that's happening is that
you're going from --

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.470
you take a signal, you move up
to pass band, you add noise,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.210
you move back to base band,
in which case you get the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.610
original transmitted signal
plus the noise

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.000
moved back to --

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.610
move back --

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.770
moved to base band.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.700
So what we wound up
with there was a

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.150
relatively simple situation.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.480
Wireless communication
is not so simple.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.030
As you all know, if you use a
cell phone, and I'm sure most

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.630
of you do, because of something
called fading --

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.870
what we want to understand is
where this fading comes from,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.990
how it arises and some of the
things you might do about it.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.350
One of the things you should
recognize right at the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.250
beginning -- and we won't
spend much time

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.380
talking about it --

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.490
is if you happen to be trying
to use a cellular phone and

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.830
there's a big wall, which is
perfectly reflecting right in

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.400
front of you and the base
station you're trying to

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.020
communicate with is on the
other side of that wall,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.070
you're not going
to get through.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.960
In other words, there are some
situations where no matter how

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.240
you design a cellular phone,
you just can't get any

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.790
communication.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.650
It's part of life.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.130
What we want to do, however, is
to make sure that when you

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.890
can get communication,
you will get

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.290
it as well as possible.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.330
You will prolong the period, but
you're still communicating

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.060
while the channel's getting
worse and worse --

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.150
and part of the way to do that
is to understand what it is in

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.950
the physical mechanisms that's
making the problem difficult.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.780
OK, so to start out with this,
we'll start out kind of easy.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.620
We'll assume an input, which is
just a cosine of 2 pi ft at

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.100
some ficed antenna --

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.610
and this is radiating outwards
and the electric field --

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.640
anywhere in free space, if you
go a long distance away.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.740
If you go a very short distance
from the antenna, if

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.590
you study electromagnetism,
you know that all sorts of

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.520
crazy things are going on.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.830
When you get very far away,
there's something called the

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.330
far field and essentially what
happens is that all of these

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.000
disturbances close in just sort
of disappear and very far

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.830
away what's happening is that
the field strength --

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.090
and this is true for the
magnetic field also,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.710
which is just in --

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.990
if the electric field is
this way, the magnetic

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.390
field is that way.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.870
They're both propogating
outwards and they're going

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.730
down as 1 over r, just like
when we deal with linear

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.720
systems, we never talk about
voltage and current anymore.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.270
This is why we use a square
root of minus 1

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.700
at this point --

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.120
because after you learn about
voltage and current, you don't

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.640
have to talk about
them anymore.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.030
You just deal with one of them
for the function that exists

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.440
someplace and the other
one just follows

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.120
along from the impedance.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.950
Same thing happens for
electric fields

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.240
and magnetic fields.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:21.240
You don't have to bother about
both of them, unless you're

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.770
really trying to solve Maxwell's
field equations,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.700
which is a very challenging
endeavor.

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.670
I admire any of you
who can do this.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.900
I used to be able to do it many,
many years ago and I've

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.900
given up on it because I decided
that's for younger

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.150
people than me.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.840
This far field has a very
simple kind of behavior,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.810
because what happens is it has
to go down as 1 over r.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.450
How do you know it has to
go down as 1 over r?

00:04:53.450 --> 00:05:00.090
Namely, the distance away from
this radiating antenna.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.480
If you look at a sphere, which
is very, very far away from

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.220
the radiating antenna, all you
find is this field that's

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.750
radiating outwards and you look
at how much energy is

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.150
radiating outwards.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.470
The energy which is radiating
outwards, there's no place to

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.930
lose it because we're
transmitting just an open

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.490
space now -- or at least that's
what we're imagining at

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.080
this point.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.940
So we're transmitting
out in open space.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.270
Energy doesn't get beaten up
any place so it just keeps

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.890
going out until it disappears
out of the outer edges of the

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.870
known universe.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.440
It travels out there with
the speed of light.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.380
That's what Maxwell's laws
say if you solve them.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.840
Since this sphere has an area
which is proportional to r

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.190
squared, the only thing that can
be happening in this wave,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.710
which is propogating outward
spherically, is it has to be

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.920
going down as 1 over r, because
that's the only way

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.640
for the power to balance out.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:13.210
You can't be creating power out
in this free space and you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.410
can't be losing power.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.280
Whatever you're sending is just
radiating outwards, so we

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.450
have to have this 1 over r
dependence any time you're

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.160
dealing with free space.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.410
The other thing that's happening
is we have an

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.860
antenna pattern.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.240
The antenna pattern is a
function of two angles.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.670
We'll think of theta as being
the angle around this way and

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.230
psi as being the
angle this way.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.310
If you like to think
of angles in some

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.380
other way, be my guest.

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.520
The only thing is, when we're
radiating outwards through

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.330
this sphere, if the antenna is
directional, it's going to be

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:52.770
radiating more in some
directions than it is in other

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:57.330
directions and this simply
takes that into account.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.120
I'm not going to pay any
attention to this at all.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.530
It just exists and it's there.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.080
For people who design antennas,
that's an important

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.840
issue: How do you make
antennas which are

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.410
directional, which will shine
their energy in one direction

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:13.210
rather than another?

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.930
We're not going to go
into that at all.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.290
We're just representing the
fact that it's there.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:23.740
This is just a factor which
says, how much loss do you

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.940
have in the antenna and how much
of the power that you're

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.450
radiating goes in each one of
these directions and how does

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.660
it depend on the frequency that
you're transmitting at?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:36.480
Antennas are sometimes
designed to be rather

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.530
frequency dependent,
so they're tuned

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.120
to a certain frequency.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.700
They work very well at that
frequency and on other

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.170
frequencies, they
just go to pot.

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:50.090
The other part of this equation
is that if I send a

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.060
signal, as it radiates outward,
it's going to be

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.210
radiating outward at
the speed of light.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:02.980
Therefore, whatever I receive is
going to be delayed by the

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:07.700
distance that I am away divided
by the speed of light.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.980
So this equation is something
you don't really have to know

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.530
any electromagnetics
to derive.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:17.010
If you want to find out what
this term is, yes, you'd need

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:18.620
some electromagnetics.

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.390
All this is saying is the power
has to be going down as

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:25.880
1 over r and you have a
propogation delay, which has

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:30.430
to be going as r divided
by the speed of light.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:36.600
Now, if we look at what
happens when we put a

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.670
receiving antenna out at some
distance r away from the

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:50.360
transmitting antenna and in this
direction theta and psi,

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.030
that receiving antenna is
going to distort this

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:59.970
electromagnetic wave locally
around the receiving antenna,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:04.160
but it's not going to distort
the whole thing.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.780
In other words, its power
is radiating outwards.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.090
It doesn't know anything about
this little receiving antenna

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:15.060
until it gets close to it, then
the electromagnetic wave

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.110
gets distorted somewhat.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.090
The only thing that's happening
because of this

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:26.140
receiving antenna is that
there's some added antenna

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.290
pattern due to the receiving
antenna -- namely, some added

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:38.090
attenuation which multiplies
by the attentuation in the

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.260
source antenna.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:43.150
You have both the source antenna
pattern, the receiving

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.290
antenna pattern.

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:45.590
We put the two together.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:49.100
We call that alpha and we don't
bother about it anymore

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.030
except recognizing that
it might change

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.420
with frequency also.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.980
Then we have this propagation
delay between transmitting

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:05.650
antenna and receiving antenna If
you're transmitting in free

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:11.150
space from one antenna to
another antenna, this is what

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.830
happens, with some arbitrary
pattern here for the two

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.340
antennas, which depends on
whether they radiate

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.810
spherically or whether
they radiate in

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.270
some sort of direction.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.760
That's the received wave form.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:41.060
That said, if you look at it,
at the received field --

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.970
this is supposed to be
valid for any --

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.220
oh, sorry.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.810
Yes, that would help.

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:02.260
This equation is supposed to be
valid for any frequency we

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.400
want to transmit at, at
any time, and if we're

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.940
transmitting two signals, both
together, the response is

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.980
going to be the sum of the
response to one signal and a

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.400
response to the other signal.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.670
In other words, Maxwell's laws
are linear and therefore the

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:21.490
response that you get when you
solve Maxwell's laws --

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:23.730
I've never solved Maxwell's
laws for anything this

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:27.670
complicated and probably
none of you had either.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:34.770
You might have, but anyway, they
are linear and therefore,

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:39.300
in fact, what's going on is that
this gives you a system

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:46.640
function which says what the
response is to any given input

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.090
that you might want
to transmit.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.260
It says the response --

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.860
at frequency f to a sinusoidal
input, which is what we were

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.800
assuming before.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.140
We were assuming that we
transmitted cosine 2 pi ft.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.100
The system function is just this
antenna pattern times e

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.780
to the minus 2 pi i times f
times the distance away

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:11.840
divided by c divided by r.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.870
Namely, this takes into account
the propogation delay.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.150
The only thing it doesn't
take into account is

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.190
what the input is.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.900
The received field is then the
real part of the system

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.950
function times what we already
assume that we were going to

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.550
be transmitting.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.410
Namely, the real part --
e to the 2 pi i ft.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.660
So at this point, what we're
doing is taking into account

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:41.720
the fact that the solution to
Maxwell's equations is going

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:46.190
to be linear and therefore we
can just add up what happens

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:50.160
for each frequency of input.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:55.160
What you notice from looking at
that is that when we have a

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:59.170
fixed transmitting antenna, a
fixed receiving antenna and

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:02.890
free space between them, we are
right back to the problem

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.350
that we started with.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.965
Namely, white Gaussian noise on
a channel, because nothing

00:13:07.965 --> 00:13:09.430
is varying with time.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:11.360
There isn't any fading.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.380
Nothing interesting
is going on.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.680
This is sort of like the case
of microwave towers.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.820
Microwave towers are set up and
they have nice directional

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:25.280
antennas, nice horns which are
blowing at each other.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.320
Nothing changes except every
once in awhile is a rainstorm

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.830
or something and the
communication goes to pot.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.220
Usually, you're just
transmitting as if it was

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.650
white Gaussian noise and you
usually view microwave towers

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.710
sending microwave as being
almost equivalent to wire line

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:44.980
communication.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.650
So there's nothing very
interesting there.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:59.700
Now if the receiving antenna
starts to move --

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:03.140
at this point, we are
transmitting from a fixed

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:04.850
sending antenna.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:09.690
We have a receiving antenna,
which for example, is in a car

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.570
where somebody's running along,
driving a car with

00:14:12.570 --> 00:14:15.280
their feet and talking on
two cellular phones at

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.020
the same time --

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:21.880
and the car's driving along
at 100 miles an hour and

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.340
something's going to
happen soon, but it

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.830
hasn't happened yet.

00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:30.530
At this point what we're
interested in is not the

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.200
response of some fixed place r,
but what we're interested

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.620
in is the electromagnetic
field in the absence of

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.930
receiver at this point,
which is moving.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:48.640
We're interested in the
electromagnetic field at a

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.830
point r 0 plus v2, where v is
the velocity of this vehicle.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.010
We'll assume for the time being
that the vehicle is

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.680
going directly away from the
transmitting antenna.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.110
If it's going at some angle,
it just changes these

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.410
equations a little bit.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.660
And the electric field there,
before we put the car in the

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.605
car changes all of the field
patterns, but just changes it

00:15:16.605 --> 00:15:18.020
in a local way again.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:20.680
Just like when we put the
receiving end antenna in a

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:24.230
fixed location, it changed all
the local field equation, but

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:27.150
it didn't change anything
globally.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:30.500
Again, what we have
when we put in the

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.290
receiving antenna --

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.690
is now the electric field
at a point r, which is

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:37.950
varying with time.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:39.710
There's a time dependence
with this now.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.730
1 over r 0 plus v.t.

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.360
times the real part of this
antenna pattern -- which we'll

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.440
assume remains fixed -- times e
to the 2 pi if times t minus

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.270
r 0 plus vt over c.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:16:01.950
This is for a velocity away
from the antenna.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.450
That's just what this same
equation says, but we can now

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:10.920
interpret this nicely if we take
the vt over c and combine

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:16.680
it with the ft here and then we
get something which looks

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.790
like this antenna
pattern again --

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:27.900
e to the 2 pi i f times 1
minus v over c times t.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:35.580
This v over c here is
just this term here.

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:39.050
It's coming down to there.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.650
Nothing mysterious has happened
here, but what you

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:45.000
see is this well known
phenomenon

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.600
called Doppler shift.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.890
If you throw some screaming
person over a cliff, what

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.740
you'll hear coming back to you
is a scream in velocity much

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:01.980
smaller than the actual scream
that the person is actually

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.580
transmitting to you.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:04.700
You're all familiar with this.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.900
You're familiar with having
planes fly overhead and when

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.500
you hear them coming towards
you, you hear a

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.860
higher pitched sound.

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:16.060
When it passes by you -- this
is a nicer example than

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.190
throwing somebody over
a cliff, obviously --

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:23.360
and you then hear a lower
frequency sound as the plane

00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:26.180
starts moving away from you.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.180
This Doppler shift is a well
known phenomena as far as

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.910
sound is concerned.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:36.470
The same phenomena exists with
electromagnetic radiation.

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.660
And there's nothing more
to it than just this --

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.460
it's just that as you are
transmitting from here to a

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:48.480
point which is moving away, it
keeps taking longer for the

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.900
electromagnetic wave to get out
to there than it takes to

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:55.430
get here, so if you look at the
wave fronts going along,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:59.560
the peak of the wave as it
travels along, the peak of the

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.790
wave takes a little longer to
get out here than it took to

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.540
get here, which means that
from the viewpoint of the

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.530
receiver, it looks like the
receive frequency is much

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:14.390
smaller than it was when
it was actually being

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.530
transmitted.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.320
We get this thing called
the Doppler shift.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.340
Just to get some idea of the
magnitude of this Doppler

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:27.390
shift, what you're interested in
is the speed of the vehicle

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:29.060
divided by the speed of light.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:38.110
That's the relative
change in the

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:42.040
frequency that you observe.

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.210
The situation here is quite
different than it is in sound.

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:47.470
Sound travels rather slowly.

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.040
Light travels pretty fast and
therefore, you need a really

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.430
rapidly speeding vehicle to make
this be any appreciable

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.960
fraction of one.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:01.620
So it looks like this is
a very small effect.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:07.930
The trouble is, what you are
multiplying this effect by is

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.620
the carrier frequency,
which can be up in

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:13.410
the gigahertz range.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.880
To look at it another way, we
are looking at situations

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:22.070
where the wavelength is small
fractions of the meter.

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:26.270
What this equation says is that
any time this receiving

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:31.820
vehicle moves by one wavelength,
namely a small

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:39.750
fraction of a meter, the crest
of this wave goes from maximum

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.520
down to minimum back up
to maximum again.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:47.180
In other words, in a quarter
wavelength, it will go from

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.470
maximum down to zero.

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:56.090
What you are observing at this
carrier frequency is very,

00:19:56.090 --> 00:20:02.430
very different and it keeps
changing rather rapidly.

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.610
All these other terms are
just junk, of course.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:09.070
This f times r 0 over c --

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.430
all that is is just a fixed
phase difference, so we don't

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:14.350
care about that.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:17.350
This is just some fixed term.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:21.260
This quantity here is changing
with t also.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.630
If we're thinking of a distance
away, it's several

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:30.730
kilometers and we're thinking of
the amount of time for this

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:35.490
to become an appreciable
fraction of one.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:38.990
For this to becoming an
appreciable fraction of this,

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:41.130
that's a pretty long time.

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:45.170
The amount of time for this to
change appreciably is seconds

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:46.720
or minutes.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.000
The amount of time for this to
go through a wavelength change

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.250
is milliseconds.

00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:58.850
So despite the fact that you
see this sitting in an

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:03.160
important place down there,
this is not important.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:07.260
Everything that goes on as far
as fading is concerned is tied

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.040
up with that term there.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.290
This is important.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.460
So we now have a system
which is linear.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.320
We still have the linear field
equation, but it's not time

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.950
invariant anymore.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.490
It's changing with time.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:31.340
The response is changing
with time.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.070
You send an exponential,
what you received.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.590
If you have a linear time
invariant system, when you

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:39.570
send an exponential of frequency
f, you receive an

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:41.680
exponential with frequency f.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.890
The only thing that a linear
time invariant system can do

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:49.060
is change the phase of that
signal and change the

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:50.340
amplitude of it.

00:21:50.340 --> 00:21:53.270
Can't do anything more
complicated than that.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:56.740
That's why we love to study it;
because it's so simple.

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:58.640
Now we have something more.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.820
We have a system that can also
change the frequency of what's

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.450
getting received.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:07.120
This small change down here --

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.960
and of course, if obstacles get
in the way or something

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.850
then there's this huge shadowing
difference and all

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.820
those important things,
but you can't do

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.670
anything about that.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.640
You can do something about
this, which is why we're

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:20.890
focusing on that.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.770
Let's go to the next example.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:32.740
Incidentally, that example
is no problem at all for

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.660
communication.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.790
I'll show you why
in a little bit.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.220
You can get around that problem
very, very easily and

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:40.100
I'll show you why.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:43.140
This is a problem you can't
get around so easily.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.520
Here we have a vehicle, which
is travelling, say, at 60

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.520
kilometers an hour.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.640
Person's talking on his two
cell phones, has his eyes

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.140
closed because something
surprising is happening,

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.840
there's this big reflecting wall
right in front of him and

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:01.160
he doesn't see it at all, so
he's speeding into this wall.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.820
We're going to analyze
this problem right

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.650
before he hits the wall.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:07.170
We have two paths here.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.820
We have one path which is the
path from here out to the

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:16.940
vehicle, which has a
length, r of t --

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.940
this is the distance away from
the sending antenna to the

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.400
receiving antenna.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.530
We have another path which has
a length d, then it gets

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:29.580
reflected and this distances
is d minus r of t.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.000
The total length --

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.870
and you're adding up this length
with this length -- is

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.450
2d minus r of t.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.680
The reason is -- do I have
an extra picture there?

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.520
No, I didn't make my extra
pretty picture.

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.570
The reason is that one way to
deal with electromagnetic

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:55.870
radiation is when you see a
wall, the thing that happens

00:23:55.870 --> 00:24:03.600
is that you get a reflection
which is coming back this way.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:10.020
The reflection has a strength
which is equal to the

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.280
radiation that you would get if
there weren't any wall --

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:16.980
uhhuh except, of course, that
you've changed directions.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.100
In other words, this wall has
generated a new plane wave

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:26.210
which is going backwards, which
is just enough to make

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:30.070
the electric field strength on
this wall equal to zero,

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:33.190
because we're assuming a
perfectly reflecting wall.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:37.280
You can satisfy Maxwell's
equations by having this

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.160
incoming electromagnetic wave.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.950
You would like to have an
outgoing electromagnetic wave,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.430
but you can't do that because
there's no way for the wave to

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:46.670
get through it.

00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.960
The only way you can do it is to
generate a new wave, which

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:54.560
is moving backwards, which
cancels out the incoming wave

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.560
right at this point.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:10.160
We really have a path here of
length 2d minus r of t and as

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:15.060
a result of that, the electric
wave has two components.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.750
One is the component we were
dealing with before where

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:23.080
there's this Doppler shift
because this is moving away

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:26.050
from the sending antenna.

00:25:26.050 --> 00:25:28.240
The other term --

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.280
in fact, we are moving closer
to the wall and the distance

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:35.460
in this path is getting shorter
and shorter as doom

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.820
approaches.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.630
Here we have a positive
Doppler shift.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:43.500
Here we have a negative Doppler
shift and we have

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.060
these junk terms
in both places.

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.030
One is fr 0 over c.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:51.930
One is 2d minus rc over c.

00:25:51.930 --> 00:25:54.280
Here we have r0 plus vt.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:58.180
Here we have 2d minus
r0 zero minus v.t..

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:04.620
As we said before, this term and
this term are not changing

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.110
very rapidly.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.740
It makes it a little easier to
analyze this if we say, let's

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.770
suppose that this is
equal to this.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.700
In other words, we'd like to
look at this right before the

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.240
car strikes the wall.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.810
That also is where this
approximation is best because

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.340
for those of you who have
studied electromagnetism, you

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.830
know that if a plane wave
impinges on a wall, funny

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.900
things happen.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.390
If you look very far away from
the wall, you will find this

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:42.360
electromagnetic wave, which
looks like a plane wave if the

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.750
wall is distant from
the source.

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.270
So this electromagnetic wave
coming in, there's this wall

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:53.190
in here and what happens to the
electromagnetic radiation

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.080
is outside of the wall that's
going to go out

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.730
past the wall --

00:26:57.730 --> 00:27:00.350
and because of Maxwell's
equations, it just sort of

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:03.320
gathers together beyond
the wall and it

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.640
sort of comes together.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:10.080
What you find is a disturbance,
which is just

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.900
around the wall.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.790
Far away from the wall, you get
the same electromagnetic

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.400
radiation that you had before
and close to the wall you have

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.240
this disturbance.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:25.690
If you look at the
situation --

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:33.930
here it is.

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:37.240
If you look at what happens here
and the wall is not big

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.980
enough, if the wall is very
small, this reflection is

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:45.520
really going to look like what
happens when you have an

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.960
electromagnetic wave hitting
the wall and the wall then

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.470
re-radiates an electromagnetic
wave, which very far away,

00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:57.640
this wall just looks like
a point source.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:03.040
What you have is instead of a
1 over r, 1 over 2r minus 1

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:08.050
over 2d minus r attenuation,
you have a 1 over d

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:13.680
attenuation multiplied by a 1
over d minus r attenuation.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.540
If you didn't get all
of that, fine.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:17.150
Doesn't make any difference.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:24.320
The point that I'm trying to
make is that this analysis is

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.430
really limited to the case where
there the wall is rather

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:31.380
small, where the wall is very
large, because otherwise you

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.340
won't have just this plane
wave radiation effect.

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:48.250
What we wind up with these two
terms instead of one term.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.020
If I throw away all of the phase
terms and I assume that

00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:54.410
the denominators are equal --

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:59.440
I'm going through this for
some sort of reason --

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:03.660
I wind up with two sinusoids:
e to the blah

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.350
and e to blah plus.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:13.060
When I take the real part of the
sum of two sinusoids, and

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:18.190
I look in all of the high school
books I can think of

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:21.560
about elementary geometry and
playing around with sine

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.500
waves, what I find is that this
collapses into 2 alpha

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.840
times the sine of 2 pi
ftv over c times the

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.600
sine of 2 pi ft.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.720
In other words, it collapses
into a sinusoidal term, which

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.710
is the major part of this term,
ft, and the major part

00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:43.490
of this term.

00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:46.960
In other words, I can cancel
out the terms here that are

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.100
the same as the terms here.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.930
When I cancel out those
same terms, that's the

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:54.790
term that comes out.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.280
When I look at the other terms,
I get an e to the minus

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.490
vc over t and an e to the
plus vc over to t.

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:05.280
When we look at e to the minus
vc over to t and e to the plus

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:09.110
vc over t, even I know how
to deal with that.

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:13.130
It looks like either a cosine
term or sine term, depending

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.420
on whether the sines
in the same or

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:17.750
the sines are different.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:29.635
What we have at that point is
this sinusoid is really a

00:30:29.635 --> 00:30:33.650
sinusoid at the carrier that
we're transmitting at.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:38.960
This term here is really
something which expands and

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.660
contracts slowly.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.070
So it's a beat, which says that
if you're transmitting

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:56.170
from this source at this
receiver, what you're hearing

00:30:56.170 --> 00:31:02.070
is something which contracts,
expands, then contracts, then

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.410
expands again.

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.890
There's nothing you can do about
that problem either.

00:31:06.890 --> 00:31:11.440
There's just no energy there
part of the time.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:18.440
This sine term here is running
along, sort of changing from

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.360
maximum to minimum at a few
milliseconds time period.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.280
If you have this vehicle
traveling at 60

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:36.000
kilometers per hour --

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.330
you just work out the numbers
there with the velocity of

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.060
light and all of that stuff.

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:43.700
You find that you really can't
communicate over your

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:47.690
cellphone in that situation,
because of these peak

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.200
frequencies.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.210
It's too fast.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:32:01.550
It's too slow to ignore and ride
over it and it's too fast

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.410
to be able to get
all of your data

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:05.950
transmitted before it happens.

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.990
It sort of is a catastrophe.

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.510
So that's what happens because
of Doppler shift.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.710
You get a response which is
periodically fading at the

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.960
Doppler frequency.

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.875
This is called multipath
fading or fast fading.

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:23.540
It's called fast fading because
it happens so fast.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.240
It's called multipath fading
because it happens because of

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.030
multiple paths, which each
have lengths which are

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:35.980
changing relative
to each other.

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:44.590
Let's go back and look at the
thing we had before, where we

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:46.050
just had a moving antenna.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:53.230
Here you have a Doppler
shift also.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.860
Why doesn't it bother you?

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:01.060
Here you have this Doppler shift
and you're transmitting,

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:05.560
let's say, a gigahertz and what
the receiver is getting

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.640
is the gighertz minus --

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:14.260
perhaps a kilohertz
or something.

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.690
So why isn't that a problem?

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:26.640
If I demodulate at the carrier
frequency, I'm sort of in bad

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:29.490
luck because I have a
signal then which is

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:30.890
changing very rapidly.

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:36.130
I have something which looks
like a time varying system.

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:37.380
But what's going to happen?

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.840
If I use the same kind of
frequency recovery system that

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:46.910
we talked about earlier, that
frequency recovery system has

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:51.400
all the time in the world to
track that frequency which is

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:54.670
one gigahertz minus
a kilohertz.

00:33:54.670 --> 00:33:59.190
It can track it perfectly, which
says so what happens is

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:02.240
we start out with a signal.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.400
We move it up in frequency
by one gigahertz.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.890
The Doppler shift moves it
down by a kilohertz.

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:13.260
We track that frequency, then
we move it down again by a

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.880
gigahertz minus a kilohertz and
everything works fine and

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.060
nobody even knows that there's
any Doppler shift there.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.830
So the problem is not
Doppler shift.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:26.700
The problem is multiple Doppler
shifts which are at

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:30.940
different speeds relative
to each other.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.570
That's an important point and we
will come back to it as we

00:34:34.570 --> 00:34:35.820
move along.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.130
If you put all of those phases
that we neglected in the

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:47.030
analysis that we just went
through, this is the equation

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:49.000
that arises.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.790
I write this down not because
it's important, but because

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:56.060
the notes -- this is
in lecture 20 --

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.310
have an error.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.700
In the sine term, it fails to
put an i in, which should be

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:10.250
there and this is the correct
term and that is off like

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.360
ninety degrees.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.470
If you write this down, you will
then see what's going on.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.920
Equation 7 in the notes has
an e to the 2 pi f.t.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:23.730
minus f.d.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:30.090
over c, which is not
the right thing.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.210
As we said, the fading is due
to Doppler spread between

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:35.370
different paths.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:39.070
The single Doppler shift does
not bother us at all.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:43.500
If you have a vehicle which
is traveling away from the

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:48.390
sending antenna and you have
some kind of reflector, which

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.410
is not something you're running
into, but which is a

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:55.290
reflector above, a reflector
below or something like that,

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.300
the thing which is going to
happen is that both of those

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:01.940
paths then are going to have
roughly the same Doppler shift

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.850
in them and if they both have
roughly the same Doppler

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:10.230
shift, it's not going to be this
kind of beat cancellation

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.850
that we have here, which
is something you really

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:14.100
can't get rid of.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.550
The other thing that this points
out again is that this

00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:25.770
variation is going to be in
terms of minutes or seconds

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:29.100
and anything you're doing to
track the signal is going to

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.570
be adequate for that until you
get to the point where there

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.410
just isn't enough energy anymore
and then of course you

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.130
have to move to a different
base station

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:38.380
or something else.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:48.100
Want go through one more example
of electromagnetism

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:50.720
because it's so surprising -- at
least, it was surprising to

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:53.630
me when I found this out.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.840
If you have a sending antenna
-- think of this as a base

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.100
station, which is high
up at about maybe

00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:03.130
15 meters or something.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:08.750
It's sending to some receive
antenna, which is at some

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:10.510
height above the ground --

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.250
usually quite a bit smaller.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:18.020
Suppose there is some more or
less partly reflecting plane,

00:37:18.020 --> 00:37:20.560
like a road.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:24.940
Here we have a vehicle which is
travelling along a road and

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.680
we have ascending antenna, which
is also close to the

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:33.030
road, which is sending the
signal so we have two paths,

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:36.200
one which is the direct path
from sending antenna to

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.710
receive antenna.

00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:42.130
The other is a reflecting path
which goes down here and comes

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:44.780
back up again.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:48.120
The rather surprising thing
here, the thing that I

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.660
couldn't believe when I saw it,
because it contradicted

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:56.340
all of my intuition, is that
when r gets quite big, the

00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.860
difference between these two
path lengths goes to 0.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:05.610
Is that surprising
to anybody else?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:14.390
Anybody awake enough
to be surprised?

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.690
This difference in path length
here really goes

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:20.430
down as 1 over r.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.800
That's an easy geometric
problem to solve.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:27.630
You just write down what this
length is and the sum of these

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:30.380
two lengths and you will find
when you do it that the

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:34.280
difference is proportional
to 1 over r.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:38.370
What happens then is that as
r gets big, these two path

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:41.810
lengths get closer and
closer together.

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.540
As they get closer and closer
together, eventually they're

00:38:44.540 --> 00:38:48.000
much closer than one wavelength
to each other.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.290
When they're much closer than
one wavelength to each other,

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:58.140
the thing that happens is that
we get a reflection in the

00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.990
electric field here, so.

00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:02.520
This field and this field
are going to be

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:04.640
canceling each other.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.540
They'll be canceling each other,
except for this phase

00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:11.000
difference which is proportional
to 1 over r, and

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.820
the phase difference which is
proportional to 1 over r is

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.640
the only thing that gives us
any power here at all.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.810
As we move further and further
away, that phase difference

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:25.500
goes down as 1 over r, which
means what's happening is the

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.920
overall electric field that you
receive here, instead of

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.620
going down as 1 over r, which
it would in free space, is

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.460
going down as 1 over
r squared.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:41.970
Since it's going down as 1 over
r squared, it means that

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:46.600
the power that we're receiving
is proportional to 1 over r

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.210
4th instead of 1
over r squared.

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:53.430
The analysis of this is not
particularly important.

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:57.550
Why it is that surfaces such as
macadam reflects so well is

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:00.370
not particularly important
to us either.

00:40:00.370 --> 00:40:10.630
The point is that when you look
at all the problems of

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:17.460
electromagnetic radiation, in
actual situations, you find

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:21.000
some situations which behave
like this, you find some

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.920
situations which behave
like this nice plane

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:28.500
wave and free space.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.640
You find other things where in
fact the radiation goes down

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.010
as 1 over r 6th, rather than 1
over r squared, so that we

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:44.790
wind up with each path has its
own particular kind of

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.870
attenuation in with path lengths
and it's kind of hard

00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:52.640
to figure out what
all of those are.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:55.890
Then you go on and say that
things are even worse than

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.450
this because sometimes you're
communicating through a wall

00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:03.960
which is only partly absorbing
and if you're transmitting

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:08.720
through a wall which is partly
absorbing, then the

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:13.790
attenuation is exponential
in the width of the wall.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:17.180
You have a lot of different
paths, all of which are very

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:21.760
messy electromagnetic radiation
problems and all of

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:27.730
which have attenuations which
range from 1 over r squared to

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.470
1 over r 6th, sometimes with an
exponential thrown in for

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:36.300
good measure, which says that if
you really try to find the

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:41.040
electromagnetic field at a
wireless cell phone, you're in

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.840
very deep trouble.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:47.060
It's certainly not something
that your cellular phone is

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.050
going to solve for you and it's
certainly not something

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.540
that you're going to have
solved ahead of time and

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.310
program into your cellular phone
or into the base station

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.200
or anything else.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.130
The question is, what
do we do about this?

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.960
One thing is, we're not going to
study these electromagnetic

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:13.010
phenomena any further because
it's a losing game.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:15.280
If the thing that you're
interested in is finding out

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:19.170
where to place base stations,
all of this kind of analysis

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.250
is useful and you can go much
further with it and you should

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:24.060
go much further with it.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:28.000
If your interest is in, how do
you build third or fourth or

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.960
fifth or 20th generation
wireless systems?

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:36.400
All the electromagnetics that
you study is only going to

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:39.920
give you gross ideas of what
kind of phenomena you

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.280
have to deal with.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:44.000
We already have some idea of the
kind of phenomena we have

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:44.690
to deal with.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.940
We have to deal with paths
which have different

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.610
attenuations on them, which
have different propogation

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.350
delays on them, and all of
these multiple paths are

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:01.040
things that we have to somehow
deal with without analyzing

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.270
them in detail.

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.010
The question is, how
do we do this?

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:15.140
Everything that we've done so
far is called rate tracing.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.940
In fact, even with all the
complexity that we're dealing

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:22.320
with now, we have highly
oversimplified it.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.610
Each of these paths that we have
is going to give rise to

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:27.290
an attenuation.

00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:32.360
We'll now call the attenuation
beta of j of t and a

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.280
propogation delay, which we'll
call passive j of t and the

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:40.690
propogation delay is just what
we get by assuming that a

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:46.020
plane wave is going from source
to destination and we

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:49.230
add up the distance from
source to reflector to

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:54.660
destination and that gives us
this propogation delay.

00:43:54.660 --> 00:43:58.710
These are going to vary with
time, but in our rate tracing

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:00.600
approximation, we've assumed
that they're

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.460
independent of frequency.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.045
I originally assumed that the
antenna pattern was a function

00:44:05.045 --> 00:44:06.160
of frequency.

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.960
We didn't want to say
anything about that.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.500
So we have a total of
capital J paths.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:16.670
we put in an input of cosine 2
pi ft, what's going to come

00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:22.710
out is an electromagnetic
radiation, which is a sum of

00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:27.920
these different attenuation
factors times e to the 2 pi ft

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:30.830
minus this propogation delay.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.510
Everything you can do
with ray tracing is

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:38.600
included in this formula.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.780
What you might be able to do
in a wireless system is you

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.720
might, by looking at the
received wave form and knowing

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.630
things about the transmitted
wave form, you might be able

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.190
to figure out what these
attenuation factors are and

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.290
what these propogation
delay factors are.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:59.740
Just like when we tried to do
frequency recovery, we can

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:02.420
find out what the transmitted
frequency was.

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.460
We can play the same sorts of
games here, but they're harder

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:09.300
and we'll talk about
that later.

00:45:09.300 --> 00:45:13.650
If you ever hear the term rake
receiver, a rake receiver is a

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:17.800
receiver that in fact measures
all this stuff and responds to

00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:23.450
it and we'll talk about that
probably next Monday.

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:26.040
If we want to look at that the
reflecting wall just as an

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.500
example of what this formula
means: beta 1 of t, namely for

00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:33.180
the direct path.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:36.840
We have an attenuation, which
is the magnitude of the

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:41.550
antenna patterns divided
by r0 plus vt.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:46.150
For the attenuation on the
return path from the wall,

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:48.350
it's the same alpha.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:49.790
Why is it the same alpha?

00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:52.100
Because we assumed it was the
same alpha to make things

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.600
simple for ourselves
-- divided by 2d

00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:58.330
minus r0 minus vt.

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:03.280
If you look at these propogation
delay terms, the

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:09.900
propogation delay terms are r0
plus vt divided by c and this

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:12.450
gives us the Doppler shift that
we're interested in here.

00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.520
We're also going to have an
extra term here, which is

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.200
really caused by the phase
change at the transmitting

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:23.830
antenna and the phase change at
the receiving antenna and a

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:26.600
phase change at a reflector,
if there's any there.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.980
We have the same sort of term
at both of these places.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.580
The reason that I talk about
that is if you look at the

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:38.260
electromagnetic wave that you
received for this reflecting

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.690
wall problem that we've talked
about a good deal, the second

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:47.320
term is there with a negative
sign rather than a plus sign.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:51.080
Here, everything is put
in with plus signs.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:56.220
You can create negative signs
by phase changes of pi.

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:59.790
So the assumption is, we put
in a phase change of pi as

00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:02.830
part of this term here.

00:47:02.830 --> 00:47:06.860
So all of these terms can be
expressed in this general

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.110
forum here.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:15.800
As we said before, you only
have two choices with a

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:17.660
cellular system.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.810
You cannot solve the
electromagnetic field problem

00:47:21.810 --> 00:47:23.480
at the cell phone.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:26.250
The person using the cell phone
is not going to do it.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.120
The cell phone is not
going to do it.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.890
The base station is not going to
do it and you're not going

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:34.630
to store all those changes
because these radiations

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:39.160
change remarkably within a
period of just small fractions

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:41.070
of one meter.

00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:46.230
You have a coverage here, which
in fact, is at least

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:51.780
area coverage of one kilometer
times one kilometer.

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:55.180
Then the reflectors are going
to be moving also, so you

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:57.620
can't deal with them
very easily either.

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.890
It's a hopeless problem,
to try to solve the

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:05.520
electromagnetic problem and
store it some place.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.920
Electromagnetism helps us to
limit the range and likelihood

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:13.320
of choices, but it doesn't
help in actual detection.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.560
So we're now going to deal with
the kind of thing we just

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:21.680
talked about, which is this sort
of general expression for

00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:26.680
electric field in terms of
attenuation factors and phase

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:31.880
changes, as opposed to
anything which is

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.150
wh much more detailed.

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:41.130
We're going to define a channel
system function as

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.905
just this sum of these
attenuation terms times phase

00:48:45.905 --> 00:48:47.230
change terms.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:51.000
The reason that we're doing this
is that if we put in an

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:59.530
input -- e to the 2 pi ift,
then what we get is this

00:48:59.530 --> 00:49:04.510
system function here -- times x
of t, which is e to the 2 pi

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.860
ift, so we get this
quantity here.

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.640
Here's the minus
2 pi if tau --

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:18.380
that's that term coming down
there and here is the e to the

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.970
2 pi ift coming down here.

00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:30.210
So all of this term and this
term are both included in this

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:31.700
system response term.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:38.335
This is linear also, so we know
what the response is to

00:49:38.335 --> 00:49:40.380
an exponential that we put in.

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:42.490
I'm cheating you a little
bit here by going

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:48.540
from real to complex.

00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:53.890
And the notes do that a little
more carefully, but we ought

00:49:53.890 --> 00:49:56.150
to be used to that now.

00:49:56.150 --> 00:50:01.800
If I put in an input, x hat of
f e to the 2 pi ift df and

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:02.800
integrate it.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:06.240
In other words, if I put in an
arbitrary input, which I

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.900
represent in terms of its
Fourier transform, I now know

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.980
what the response is to
every x-hat of f.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:16.340
It's given by this
response here.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.360
So I just integrate over that
and I find that the response y

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:26.680
of t to an arbitrary input now
is the integral of x-hat of f,

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:31.360
h-hat of ft, e to the
2 pi ift df --

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:35.590
namely, the same game
that we always play.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:40.320
Namely, that's just the system
analysis way of looking at

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:44.950
arbitrary systems in terms of
their Fourier transforms.

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:51.370
So the output y of t is just
this integral here.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:51:00.200
Important point: When you look
at this, this says this is the

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:03.700
same as any old linear time
invariant system.

00:51:03.700 --> 00:51:07.060
This is not a linear time
invariant system.

00:51:07.060 --> 00:51:11.650
If you try to take the Fourier
transform of this to get y-hat

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:18.880
of f, you're not going to get
x-hat of f times h-hat of f.

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:22.820
Namely, this is not
equal to that.

00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.490
Why isn't it equal to it?

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:29.550
First reason is, try to take the
Fourier transform of this

00:51:29.550 --> 00:51:32.640
and see what you get over here
and when you deal with the

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:36.750
fact that there's a t in here,
you will find that there's

00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:38.630
nothing you can do.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.200
You'll find you're stuck.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:45.570
So you can't derive this
equation here.

00:51:45.570 --> 00:51:52.360
Next, argument is this quantity
here is not a

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.510
function of t.

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:58.730
This quantity here is
a function of t.

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:02.880
You can't have a quality between
something which is not

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.530
a function of t and something
else which is a function of t.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.930
It just can't happen.

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.960
The final argument is, if you
look at what's happening here,

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:16.070
when you put in a single
frequency -- when you put in x

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:21.510
of t equals e to the 2 pi
ift, what comes out?

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:24.880
In terms of this reflecting wall
example, the thing that

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.040
came out was not one sinusoid,
but two sinusoids.

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.190
One sinusoid a little bit above
the carrier, the other

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.990
sinusoid a little bit
below the carrier.

00:52:34.990 --> 00:52:38.950
In other words, because of
Doppler shifts, when you put

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:43.960
in a sinusoid, what comes out
is not a sinusoid, but a

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.500
modulated sinusoid.

00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:50.960
It's something spread out over
a region of frequencies.

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.590
So one of your favorite tools
for dealing with linear time

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:57.960
invariant systems is
no longer adequate.

00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.990
Doesn't work.

00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:02.860
Just make a mark of that,
because every time you see a

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:06.610
problem like this, everytime I
see it, the first thing I try

00:53:06.610 --> 00:53:11.190
to do is go through that most
familiar and most favorite

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:15.320
form of linear system analysis,
which is the Fourier

00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:19.550
transform of convolution, is the
same as multiplication in

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:20.680
the frequency domain.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:22.560
You cannot do that anymore.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:26.680
However, convolution still work,
so that's the next thing

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:27.930
we want to look at.

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:35.960
So the thing that we have is
the output of the system is

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.590
now going to be this integral
over frequency --

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:43.660
x-hat of f times the frequency
response function for the

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.300
linear but time varying
system, times

00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:47.550
e to the 2 pi ift.

00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:54.670
This is what we derived on the
last page, on the last slide.

00:53:54.670 --> 00:54:00.730
It is the thing which just
automatically happens here.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:04.530
If I let h of tau and t be the
inverse Fourier transform of

00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:06.810
h-hat of ft --

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:12.020
and here what I'm doing is I'm
regarding t as a parameter.

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:15.970
So this is a function of tau now
and this is a function of

00:54:15.970 --> 00:54:20.240
tau for a given t, I can take
the Fourier transform of this.

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.420
Take the Fourier transform of
any old thing at all, so long

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:25.380
as it's L2.

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.150
I will sort of half-pretend
it's L2.

00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:30.590
We'll worry about that later.

00:54:30.590 --> 00:54:35.260
So this is the Fourier
transform of this.

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:39.020
So then, the thing that happens
is that y of t is

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:44.280
going to be equal to this
quantity here, except in place

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.060
of the system function, h and f
of t, for a particular value

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.130
of t, I'm going to put in this
inverse Fourier transform.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:56.200
So it'll be h of tau and
t, e to the minus 2

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.130
pi i of tau d tau.

00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:07.080
This integral here is just
h-hat of f and t.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:14.210
If I take this quantity here
and I move this term inside

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:16.960
and I interchange orders
of integration --

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.940
incidentally, when we're dealing
with wireless, we're

00:55:19.940 --> 00:55:23.040
going to forget about all of the
nice things that we know

00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.830
about L2 functions.

00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:27.890
There's just too much new stuff
that's going on here to

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:30.410
worry about that.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:35.240
So what you want to do is just
take Fourier transforms like

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.460
while, interchange orders of
integration, interchange

00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:42.790
everything you want to and
simply forgot about all the

00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:45.340
mathematical problems
that might arise.

00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:48.280
After you understand this, at
that point, go back and

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.660
straighten out the mathematical
issues.

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.320
This in fact is the way we deal
with any problem, or the

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.850
way you should deal
with any problem.

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:59.870
You don't bring the mathematics
in unless it's

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:01.380
going to help you solve
the problem.

00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:05.370
You don't bring it in to
frustrate yourselves.

00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:10.060
So the thing we're going to do
now is to interchange these

00:56:10.060 --> 00:56:11.220
orders of integration.

00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:16.360
We're going to integrate over
tau on the outside and f on

00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.100
the inside.

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:20.020
So we're going to bring the
function of tau outside.

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.190
This is an integral in tau.

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:25.810
The function of f is going to go
on the inside. we have e to

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.620
the 2 pi ft --

00:56:28.620 --> 00:56:30.630
that's this quantity here.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:39.170
We have this term there.

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:43.130
When we look at this, we see
something very nice because

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:46.660
this is in fact just the
Fourier transform of

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:50.030
x of t minus tau.

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:53.740
When we take that out, what we
get is the integral of x of t

00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:58.570
minus tau times h of
tau and t be tau.

00:56:58.570 --> 00:57:03.450
In other words, this is time
varying convolution.

00:57:03.450 --> 00:57:07.970
Nice, simple equation,
makes a lot of sense.

00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:15.430
It says you have this impulse
response here. h of tau and t

00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:21.140
now can be interpreted as the
response at time t to an

00:57:21.140 --> 00:57:24.250
impulse tau seconds earlier.

00:57:24.250 --> 00:57:27.410
If you have a system which is
changing very, very very,

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:32.340
slowly, then this is essentially
just a function of

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:38.330
tau and it's the usual impulse
response that you're familiar

00:57:38.330 --> 00:57:42.430
with -- namely, this convolution
equation gives you

00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:50.870
the response at time t to an
impulse tau seconds early.

00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:54.600
Now we just have something which
says this is a linear

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:58.790
time varying filter and in all
the cases, we're interested in

00:57:58.790 --> 00:58:02.480
this linear time varying filter,
changes its impulse

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.830
response very slowly
as time changes.

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:09.850
Relatively fast change
with tau, relatively

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:11.500
slow change with t.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.650
So this is very similar to
linear time invariant

00:58:16.650 --> 00:58:17.820
convolution.

00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:21.490
Channel behaves like a slowly
time varying filter and that's

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:22.780
the bottom line of this.

00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:31.940
For these ray tracing models we
were looking at, the system

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:39.240
function is a sum of terms at
the sum of attenuations times

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.900
phase change terms.

00:58:41.900 --> 00:58:45.250
If we take the inverse Fourier
transform of this --

00:58:45.250 --> 00:58:50.170
remember, we're taking the
inverse Fourier transform on f

00:58:50.170 --> 00:58:51.740
and putting in a tau.

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:55.150
So we're taking this inverse
Fourier transform for a

00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:57.920
particular t.

00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.990
We have a function
of f and of t.

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:04.390
We take the inverse Fourier
transform with respect to the

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.290
f and get a tau here.

00:59:06.290 --> 00:59:09.970
This then becomes this
quantity here.

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:11.960
How do I interpret that?

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:15.330
If I look at a single term
here, what is it?

00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:19.450
A single term here is just
an attentuation factor, a

00:59:19.450 --> 00:59:22.420
constant times a sinusoid.

00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:25.800
At a particular value of
t, this is just the

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.710
constant here also.

00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:32.280
So for a particular t, all
I have is a sinusoid.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.170
What's the inverse Fourier
transform of a sinusoid?

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:39.360
I told you all along that it
doesn't exist, but for the

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.190
time being we will assume that
it's what you learned early,

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.230
that the inverse Foruier
transform of the sinusoid is

00:59:46.230 --> 00:59:49.050
an impulse.

00:59:49.050 --> 00:59:52.230
So here we are with
our impulse there.

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:59.570
This says that the response at
time t to an impulse at tau is

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:05.370
going to be zero unless tau
is equal to one of these

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:07.460
propogation delay terms.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.580
In other words, I have a system
where I'm putting in an

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.250
input and this input comes in.

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:18.620
The response to the input is
a number of different path

01:00:18.620 --> 01:00:22.980
delays and at each path delay,
what I'm going to get out of

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.470
the system is just a delayed
and attenuated version

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:28.530
of what I put in.

01:00:28.530 --> 01:00:33.650
Namely, the system isn't a
function of frequency at all.

01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:36.130
That's what I get through
using ray tracing.

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:38.080
I mean, it's one of
the consequences

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.380
of using ray tracing.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:44.080
So what I wind up with is a
system function which is a

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.490
string of impulses and the
output then, the convolution

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:51.600
of this with that --

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.920
you're probably better at
working with impulses than I

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.240
am -- and it's y of t is just
the sum of these attenuation

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:04.970
terms times x of t at these
various delays.

01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:09.030
So what we're doing is we're
putting in an arbitrary input.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:13.030
What's coming out is that
attenuated input coming out at

01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:15.150
various different times,
due to these

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:16.560
various different paths.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.540
I get various paths that are
delaying the input by

01:01:19.540 --> 01:01:22.620
different amounts and out
that delayed input

01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.360
comes at various times.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.280
This is a nice sanity check
because if you think about it,

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.620
that's exactly what ought
to come out of here.

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.250
On the other hand, you ought to
wonder about this impulsive

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:39.520
impulse response, because that
clearly doesn't make any sense

01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:40.570
physically.

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:43.620
So what's going on here?

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:48.830
The thing that's going on is
that when we started, we said,

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:54.510
if we're putting in a narrow
band input, we don't care

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:58.730
about the frequency response
because the frequency response

01:01:58.730 --> 01:02:02.810
on these different paths cannot
change very quickly and

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:06.710
therefore, we're just going
to have a fixed frequency

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.420
response term.

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:11.340
Then we've worked with that
thing which is not a function

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:17.460
of frequency and then finally
we get down here, where in

01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:20.430
fact, what we're doing is
looking at the output.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:24.400
Due to a bunch of delayed input
terms, if this input

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:25.800
term here --

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:28.890
if x of t is in fact the
narrow band term --

01:02:28.890 --> 01:02:30.910
I guess the way to see
that as to look at --

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:35.080
where do I look at it?

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.770
I want to look at this
expression here.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.040
If I have a narrow
band or maybe --

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:52.320
I guess this one
is better here.

01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:53.790
Let's look at this expression.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:02.340
If my input is in fact narrow
band, it's only going to be

01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:06.250
non zero over a small range
of frequencies.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:09.830
If it's only non zero over a
small range of frequencies, I

01:03:09.830 --> 01:03:13.000
don't care what this is, except
over that small range

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.340
of frequencies.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.020
All of this gets filtered out.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.380
In other words, this filters
out this, opposite of the

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.400
usual case.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.530
So I don't care about what this
is at different frequency

01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:28.400
ranges and therefore, we simply
have the consequences

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:31.300
of this, which is something that
you see in linear system

01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.580
theory all the time.

01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:35.540
We've sort of ruled out impulses
and sine waves

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.010
because they don't carry
information, but in terms of

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:41.840
looking at things as
intermediate points and going

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:44.570
through filters and things like
that, they're perfectly

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.630
fine

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:50.570
So here, for simplicity, we
assume that these channel

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:54.800
filters really do
not have any --

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.260
don't respond to frequency
changes, whereas in fact they

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.800
do, and all we're doing is
modelling them in certain

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.970
frequency bands, which, when
we get all done, is what

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:14.010
really gets rid of all our
problems, due to this sort of

01:04:14.010 --> 01:04:18.160
input because this input is
smooth now and therefore, the

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.790
output is smooth also.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.310
The next thing I want to spend
a little bit of time on and

01:04:29.310 --> 01:04:33.230
we'll come back to it next time
is, how do you deal with

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:36.290
all of this at baseband?

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:41.830
I should warn you here that the
notes don't do a terribly

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:44.090
good job of this.

01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:48.580
They have all of the results
that you need.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.010
They don't seem to put
them in a very nice,

01:04:51.010 --> 01:04:52.260
well organized fashion.

01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:54.130
I'm not sure there is a
nice, well organized

01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:57.090
fashion to put them in.

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:59.270
But anyway there's a lot of
stuff going on when you try to

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:03.690
move this down from pass
band down to baseband.

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.620
I will try to change the notes a
little bit to make it clear,

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:10.690
but I'm not sure that I can.

01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:14.190
The kind of system that we're
looking at now is our usual

01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:18.310
QAM type system, which can
be generalized somewhat.

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:20.750
We have a binary input
coming in.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:22.850
We have a baseband encoder.

01:05:22.850 --> 01:05:27.080
That baseband encoder is
creating baseband signals,

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.360
which are being added together
to give us a baseband complex

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.230
input to the channel.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:36.890
This is being frequency
modulated up to some function,

01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:41.390
x of t, which is just the real
part of ut times e to the 2 pi

01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:44.280
if of ct as usual.

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:51.740
So we now have a real part of
this signal here, modulated up

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.630
by the carrier frequency.

01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:56.870
This is going through what we'll
now regard as a time

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.860
varying channel filter.

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.740
We talked a little bit about
channel filters before when we

01:06:02.740 --> 01:06:07.900
were talking about Nyquist
theory, because we said in

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.920
general, you want to take your
input, you want to pass it

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.160
through a pulse p of t.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.370
That goes through another
filter, which is some h of t

01:06:18.370 --> 01:06:21.140
and that goes into another
filter, which is at the

01:06:21.140 --> 01:06:25.390
receiver, which is q of t and
you want the product of t and

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:28.290
you want the convolution of all
of those to satisfy the

01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:30.110
Nyquist criteria.

01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.970
So we're back with that in
spades because now this is

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:37.180
varying with t also.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.600
So this goes through
this channel

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:43.010
filter, up at pass band.

01:06:43.010 --> 01:06:46.480
The channel filter up at pass
band, we've seen that one of

01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:49.350
the things that it can be viewed
as doing is putting

01:06:49.350 --> 01:06:53.200
Doppler shift into this input.

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.600
So what comes in at some
frequency f is now going to be

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:02.710
coming through here at some
slightly different frequency.

01:07:02.710 --> 01:07:05.730
We then add white noise to it.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:09.790
We then get y of t out, which
has now been shifted around

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.520
and smudged in frequency
a little bit.

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:15.100
We go through a frequency
demodulation.

01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:18.390
We get down frequency
to modulation by

01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:20.450
this carrier frequency.

01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:28.420
We get down to v of t, which
is now a baseband complex

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:31.770
function again, which is
supposed to be the same as

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:35.370
this except for the white
Gaussian noise and except for

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:39.200
the fact we've gone through this
filtering operation here.

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.780
Then we want to do base band
detection at this point.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:46.680
What we would like to do and
what will make life a little

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.190
easier for ourselves because
we all got sick of this

01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:54.510
business of looking at filters
at baseband and also looking

01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:58.470
at filters at pass band, we
would like to be able to take

01:07:58.470 --> 01:08:02.680
some baseband equivalent
of this filter here.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.780
So what we're going to do
is look at the baseband

01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:06.080
equivalent.

01:08:09.050 --> 01:08:12.930
The system function at baseband
corresponding to this

01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:17.760
system at carrier frequency
will just be this response

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.370
moved down by s of t.

01:08:20.370 --> 01:08:23.630
In other words, when you take
what comes out of here, you

01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:30.270
multiply it, and you shift it
down in frequency by s sub c,

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:34.615
what happens is that this gets
shifted down in frequency by s

01:08:34.615 --> 01:08:39.770
sub c and this channel filter
gets shifted down in frequency

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:43.620
by f of c and therefore, what
happens is the effect of

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:48.320
passing y of t through
a base band filter --

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:54.586
h-hat of f plus fc and t or
0 for f, less than or

01:08:54.586 --> 01:08:56.420
equal to minus fc.

01:08:56.420 --> 01:09:01.030
So far, this is all kind of
straightforward and not too

01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:02.280
mysterious.

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:13.290
So you wind up then in --

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:17.010
and this is pure analogy to
what we did before --

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:23.210
the output is then going to be
the integral of this Fourier

01:09:23.210 --> 01:09:26.560
transform of the input.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:31.433
The system function for the
baseband filter times e to the

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.530
2 pi ift df.

01:09:33.530 --> 01:09:37.280
Same equation as we had before,
but before we did it

01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.350
at pass band and now we're
doing it at baseband .

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:49.290
For the ray tracing model that
we looked at, this function

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:55.420
here down at baseband is going
to be the same as it was at

01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:01.280
pass band, except in place of
the 2 pi i tau jft, we now

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.840
have f plus the carrier
frequency times tau jft.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.020
So when we take the inverse
Fourier transform of this,

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.240
we're given parameter t.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.320
What we're going to wind up with
is this quantity here.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:22.380
This is the same as we had
before, with the difference

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:26.820
that now we're stuck with this
carrier frequency times

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:31.450
propogation delay, which
is occurring in time t.

01:10:31.450 --> 01:10:36.520
We still have the same delta
functions here and the output

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:39.210
v of t is the same time variant

01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:43.570
convolution as we had before.

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:46.680
I'm doing this much too
fast for you to follow

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.530
this in real time.

01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:51.160
What I'm saying is, this is
exactly the same thing as we

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:56.630
did before and the only thing
new that happens is now this

01:10:56.630 --> 01:11:02.110
carrier frequency term is coming
in here on this term.

01:11:02.110 --> 01:11:06.330
If we're using the ray tracing
model then, v of t is equal to

01:11:06.330 --> 01:11:08.860
this quantity here.

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:13.530
The reason I write this down is
that this shows you quite

01:11:13.530 --> 01:11:18.970
simply what's going on in terms
of the Doppler shift,

01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:23.480
because these terms here, these
delay terms are changing

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.470
with Doppler shift and now we're
going to see exactly

01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:28.720
what they do to us.

01:11:36.010 --> 01:11:38.250
So we're going to represent
the propogation

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:40.070
delay on each path.

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:43.840
That's tau j of t, which is
tau j prime, which is the

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:49.960
propogation delay of time zero
minus the Doppler shift times

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:52.460
t divided by f.

01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:56.720
This is just Doppler shift,
which is a frequency term, and

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.770
it's increasing linearly.

01:11:59.770 --> 01:12:04.030
The propogation delay is
increasing linearly with t.

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:14.960
The Doppler shift is a shift in
frequency and, as I think

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.030
we saw before, you need a 1 over
f to compensate for this

01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.770
Doppler shift.

01:12:19.770 --> 01:12:23.010
Namely, this is in
terms of hertz.

01:12:23.010 --> 01:12:24.710
This is in terms of hertz.

01:12:24.710 --> 01:12:26.300
This is in terms of time.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.280
This is in terms of time.

01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.020
So you need this frequency here
to be dimensionally right

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.790
at any rate.

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:36.580
If we're using narrow band
communication, then v of t is

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.290
just going to be this difference
here, which is just

01:12:40.290 --> 01:12:46.180
the last equation with the
Doppler shift put into it.

01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:52.600
So all of this says that when
we're now looking at things at

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:57.060
base band instead of a pass
band, what has happened is

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.750
that this term has been added.

01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.280
Before, we just had these delay
terms here and we had

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.330
these attenuation terms.

01:13:07.330 --> 01:13:12.090
Now what's happening is because
we are modulating up

01:13:12.090 --> 01:13:16.885
with carrier frequency s sub c,
we then get a Doppler shift

01:13:16.885 --> 01:13:19.140
that moves us down
a little bit.

01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:21.730
We're then moving
down by s sub c.

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:25.090
What we wind up with is
something which is off by that

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.290
Doppler shift.

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:30.180
If we only had a single
term, we wouldn't be

01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:31.940
demodulating by s sub c.

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:35.180
We'd be demodulating by
something which would get rid

01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.780
of this term for us.

01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:39.840
Then all we'd have is just
some arbitrary phase term

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.300
here, because this
isn't important.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:43.350
This is just a phase term.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:46.960
This is the term which
is important.

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.276
The reason for going through
all of this --

01:13:49.276 --> 01:13:52.780
and I'm going to come back
to this next time --

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:57.510
is that when you use frequency
recovery at the receiver and

01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:02.420
you always use frequency
recovery at the receiver,

01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:05.270
what's going to happen is you're
not going to shift

01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:07.500
down by s of c.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:13.000
You're going to shift down s of
c, plus some average value

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.940
of Doppler shift.

01:14:14.940 --> 01:14:18.020
If they have a bunch of terms,
each with different Doppler

01:14:18.020 --> 01:14:23.330
shifts in them, when you try to
measure how much Doppler --

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:26.540
when you try to measure what
the received carrier is,

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.950
you're going to be frustrated
by all of these different

01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:29.910
Doppler shifts.

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:32.760
You're going to come up with
some average value in your

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.510
frequency circuit, which means
that in place of this

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:40.890
quantity, you will get something
which replaces each

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:45.820
of these D sub j's by not the
actual Doppler shift, but by

01:14:45.820 --> 01:14:48.300
how far this Doppler shift
is away from the

01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:50.680
main Doppler shift.

01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:55.010
So these terms here, which are
the things that make this

01:14:55.010 --> 01:15:00.090
system function in here change
with time, are in fact

01:15:00.090 --> 01:15:04.390
changing according to how far
away each of these Doppler

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:07.770
shifts are from the main Doppler
shift, which means

01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:11.400
that the amount of time this
system function in here is

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:18.770
going to remain stable depends
on how much the Doppler shifts

01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:22.060
vary from each other on
these different paths.

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:24.840
In other words, the important
thing is the Doppler spread

01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.580
between the biggest Doppler
shifts and the smallest

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.200
Doppler shifts.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:32.930
That Doppler spread is going to
determine how long you've

01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:36.700
got something that looks like a
linear time invariant system

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:40.530
function which says that every
once in awhile, if you're

01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:44.390
trying to measure what's going
on at the channel, at

01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:47.050
intervals of time approximately
one over two

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:49.760
times the Doppler spread, you're
going to have to change

01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:52.050
those measurements.

01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:55.900
So whether you can make cellular
telephony work or not

01:15:55.900 --> 01:16:00.150
depends on whether you can make
measurements at a speed

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:04.830
which is equal to one over two
times the Doppler spread.

01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:07.930
I'm going to do more about
that next time.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:10.890
I don't expect you to
understand it now.

01:16:10.890 --> 01:16:15.350
Maybe after you read about it
and we talk about it more,

01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:16.600
because in fact that's --

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.980
if you look at this question of
Doppler spread and what its

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:28.910
effect is on how long a system
looks like it's time

01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:32.630
invariant, this is one of
the key parameters to

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:36.110
understanding how any
kind of wireless

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:37.360
system is going to work.

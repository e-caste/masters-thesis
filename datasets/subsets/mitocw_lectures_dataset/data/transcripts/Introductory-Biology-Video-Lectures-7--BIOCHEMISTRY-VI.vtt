00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Just very quickly,
I mentioned to you the other day

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that article about Romney making a
policy statement about embryonic

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
stem cell research and said here
were sort of examples of issues we

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
were thinking about in this course
that would come into your ordinary

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
life.  Here's on today's Globe
there's, ìKennedy rips Romney over

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
stem cell policy.
This debate is continuing.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's on the front page of today's
Boston Globe.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We have two people neither of whom
probably have the background in

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
biology, that you guys are going to
have by the time you finish this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
course, having to grapple with these
very serious scientific issues that

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
have all kinds of implications.
Here's another thing.  This was in

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
yesterday's newspaper.
This was on, I think, the second

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
page of the Boston Globe.
It's about a curator over at

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Harvard at The Museum of Comparative
Zoology that got all these different

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
birds, some of whom are
extinct and something.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And now the curator,
instead of just having them there as

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
a sort of collection and that's all
it is, is getting DNA out of these

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
specimens and working back and
looking at gaining new insights from

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
animals that aren't found on this
planet anymore.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And this was one was from,
I didn't want to show you this on

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Valentine's Day particularly,
but this is critical.  I don't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
subscribe to The New York Times but
for some reason one appeared on my

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
porch on Saturday morning.
I opened up the first page,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
ìRare and aggressive HIV reported in
New York.î  I'll be talking to you

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
about the HIV-1 virus which is the
virus that ends up destroying some

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of your major defender cells in the
immune system.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And then people die of AIDS which
is sort of all the other stuff that

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
then happens.  And it was terribly
scary when it first showed up.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
There was no treatment for it.
It's like that in most of the Third

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
World and people die if they get it.
I lost a close friend to it after

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it first came up.
Then they came up with these various

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
cocktails of different inhibitors.
And the idea was instead of just

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
having a single drug target where it
would be easy for the virus to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
mutate and, as I'll tell you,
the HIV virus mutates like crazy.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Instead they'd use multiple targets
and that's why they do it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And sort of then the chances of it
getting a mutation,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you multiply all these low
probabilities of getting a mutation

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and would hope it would never happen.
It's happened.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There in New York is a version of
HIV-1 that is resistant to

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
everything.  If that spreads,
which it probably will, it will be

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
just like what happened with all the
bacteria and antibiotics.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It works for a little while,
natural mutation and natural

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
selection, something will happen,
the organism or the virus will

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
change so that it's no longer
resistant.  So,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
you know, for the moment,
as always, you know, make sure you

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
never expose yourself to AIDS.
This would take us back just like

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to before any of these things
were inhibited.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And the same thing goes right now.
There are strains of mycobacterium

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
tuberculosis that are resistant to
every known antibiotic.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you get tuberculosis with that
thing it's like you were living 200

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
years ago.  They cannot do anything
for you.  They'd put you in a

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
sanatorium but you cannot be cured.
This is worse.  You know, this is

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
awful.  This one kills you.
So just be careful.  This is just

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the tip, but what always happens
when you have antibiotics or drug

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
treatments eventually natural
selection mutation will probably

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
produce a variant.
And this looks like it is happening.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I don't know, I hope not,
but I'm afraid this won't be the end

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
of this one.  OK.
So some of you, I've read some of

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the comments.  I'm not terribly
surprised that some of you think why

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is he telling me all this.
God, there was a lot of work for

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
tremendously confusing,
there were all these chemical

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
structures, I didn't really get it
all.  It seemed that somehow out of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
this the cell got to two molecules
of ATP.  Why are we wasting all the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
time?  Why am I wasting all this
time telling you about how to get

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
two molecules of ATP?
This is basically what we were doing.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We were looking at glucose,
which is C6H12O6, going through this

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000
process which pathway is of ten
enzymatic steps.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And what ends up coming out at the
other end is two pyruvates.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And the net yield of that is two
ATP plus two molecules of this weird

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
thing called NADH.
Now, I think most of you,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
although a few of you still don't
seem to have gotten it,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
the reason you need to make ATP out
of ADP and inorganic phosphate is it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
stores energy.
It's, you know,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
like having electricity in your
house or batteries in your

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
flashlight or in your iPod or
whatever it is.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You've got to have energy in order
to do stuff.  And cells need it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And the major sort of energy
currency they use is ATP.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And they put most of it by squeezing
together a phosphate up to an ATP

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
making this bond that's stable,
unless there's an enzyme that'll

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
break it open,
but there's energy stored in it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And they'll drop downhill and you
can use that energy to drive other

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
reactions.  So for life to happen it
had to somehow figure out how to get

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
energy in a form that it could use
to do all the biosynthesis that's

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
necessary for life to go on.
NADH, I showed you the molecule,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
you got a structure.
The cell makes some number of

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
molecules of that.
It's around.  And what happened,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
it comes in, it helped some of these
processes go.  It ends up,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
it's sort of like a banking system
for electrons.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If it gets NADH it's got electrons
stuck on it.  There are only a

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
limited number of molecules of NADH
in a cell, so if you make all the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
NAD molecules into NADH then you
have nowhere else to put electrons

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and everything comes to a grinding
halt.  Because I was talking about

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
redox reactions.
If you're taking electrons off

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
somewhere they've got to go
somewhere else.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And the cell uses NADH as kind of
almost a currency for passing

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
electrons around in just the same
way it uses ATP as a currency for

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
carrying energy around from one form
or another.  Now,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the problem was and why this was so
important is this apparently,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
as I said, we're basically looking
at an evolutionary fossil of some

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
sort because every organism on earth
uses, or virtually every organism on

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
earth uses glycolysis.
It's in our cytoplasm of our cells.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's in the cytoplasm of bacteria.
It's in the cytoplasm of archaea.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It apparently evolved so long ago
that every form of life on earth,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
you know, depends on this, anything
that can metabolize a sugar molecule

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
pretty much.  And so it looks
complicated.  It is.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Maybe you could have designed,
I'd like to tell you that it's two

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
reactions and you make two ATPs and
it's all simple.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Life isn't often simple.
It's often very complicated.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It wasn't done by a team of design
engineers in Building 10 designing

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
it.  It was done by something that
happened with random selection.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And when something finally worked
apparently it got fixed in evolution

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
even if it looks clunky.
I think the other way to look at it

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
is to say isn't that,
I feel a sort of sense of wonder at

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
this point, and granted I've had a
lot of years working in the field,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that something that complicated
could work out and take this

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
molecule of glucose and make it into
two molecules of ATP that can then

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
be used to allow the cell
to do synthesize.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
As in I'll show you,
there's a better way you could use

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
this much more efficiently,
18 times more efficiently if we do

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
respiration, which we'll talk about
today, but that needs oxygen.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And when life started 3.8 billion
years ago or so there was no oxygen

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
so it wasn't an option.
The initial organisms had to make

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
due with what they found and this is
what developed.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So ATP can go off and be used for
lots of things.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The problem, if there's no oxygen
around, as I said there are a

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
limited number of molecules of ATP.
So to make that glycolysis go

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
you're taking some electrons off and
doing the oxidation steps,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
you're reducing NADH.  And if you
want that to go as a cycle you've

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
got to somehow regenerate the NAD+
so you can go through another cycle

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and make more ATP.
So there were two variants that I

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
told you about.
If you don't have oxygen around,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
one of these variants yields to
lactate, and so the net yield of

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:42.000
this is two ATP.
Because what happens in this part

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
is it uses up two molecules of NADH
changing the two molecules of

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
pyruvate to two molecules of lactate,
so that gets rid of this,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and the net yield of the whole thing
is two molecules of ATP.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
The other way to do it is the way
yeast does it.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It makes two molecules of CO2 plus
two molecules of ethanol.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I think when I wrote that on
the board I showed you that there

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
was acetaldehyde.
We had two molecules of that going

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to two molecules of ethanol.
And I think I forgot to write on

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the board that it used up two
molecules of NADH because that's

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
important.  So that's what this
whole thing is about.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
It achieves the same thing.
And the net yield of this one is two

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
ATPs as well.  So I'm going to talk
about photosynthesis at the latter

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
part of the lecture,
but if you maybe recall the initial

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
sort of thing I called ìrelease oneî
came up here about 3.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
billion years ago.  Later on an
improved version came along that

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
started to generate oxygen.
Now, it took billions of years for

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
us to get to our present level of
oxygen, but when oxygen became

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
available in the atmosphere then
there was a new option

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
for making energy.
And that was instead of taking this

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
NADH and, remember,
there are about 50 kcals per mole of

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
energy in there,
it's just being thrown away.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It's not being used at all.  But if
there's oxygen around there's a new

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and better system,
which you know as respiration,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
it's a word you've heard.  You know
we breathe oxygen.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
We need to breathe oxygen because
we're using the oxygen to make

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
energy.  And I'll tell you again.
You don't have to know all the

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
details.
But there's a biochemical cycle

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
called a citric acid cycle.
And it goes together with another

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:46.000
process that's known as oxidative
phosphorylation.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And so this is if we have oxygen

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
what we end up with at the end of
the day instead of these products is

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.000
six molecules of CO2 plus
six molecules of water.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But more importantly 36 molecules of
ATP.  So respiration is tremendously

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:23.000
better at capturing energy from a
glucose molecule.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But this, I'll show you,
is a later arriving development in

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
evolution.
It had to be because it required

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
oxygen in the atmosphere.
And so even though we only get two

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
molecules out of ATP.
We all do it.  And the other thing

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
it generates is pyruvate.
And, as you'll see, this process

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
takes those pyruvates.
That's the starting material for

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
this part over here.
OK?  I hope this is making a bit

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
more sense as to why you've got to
keep your eye on the big picture or

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
all you're going to see is a whole
lot of structures and chemical

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
transformations that don't
make any sense.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
This is all about making ATP and
energy.  And, as we'll see later on,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
photosynthesis.  In cases it can be
something to do with making reducing

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
power for biosynthesis.
So in order to understand this,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
though, I have to introduce you to
another way of thinking about energy.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Some of you still seem to be
struggling with the idea that you

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
can store energy in a chemical bond,
but I think from the comments the

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
majority of you have that.
If you're having trouble,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000
ask your TA or look in sections and
stuff.  But the insight to how this

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
part came, even though this process,
what underlies this was invented

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
about roughly 3.
billion years ago,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
scientists didn't begin to even get
a glimmer of how this worked until

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
about 1961 when there was a
scientist named Peter Mitchell who

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
got a Nobel Prize for the
insight that he had.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And what he recognized was there
were sort of three forms of energy

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000
that are interconvertable.
The energy of a chemical bond.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And I keep telling you this, that
ATP, if we hydrolyze that it goes to

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
ATP plus inorganic phosphate.
The delta G prime zero is about

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
minus 7 kilocalories per mole,
but under physiological conditions

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
it works out that each ATP gets you
about 12 kilocalories per mole

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
because life doesn't happen under
these standard conditions.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So that's one form of energy we've
been talking a lot about.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
There's another form of energy,
which you probably know intuitively,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and that is if you have a high
concentration of some compound on a

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
side of a sort of impermeable
barrier and a low concentration on

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
the other side,
high concentration of sugar,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
low concentration of sugar.
If you give the system a chance it

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
will come to equilibrium.
So the concentrated stuff will flow

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
downhill until you're concentrated
on both sides.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000
There's energy that you could get
out of that.  So there's energy

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
basically stored in a concentration
gradient.  There's another form

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
which should probably be familiar
certainly to some of you,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and that's the idea you can store
energy in an electrical gradient.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
If you have some kind of impermeable
barrier and we have a lot of charges

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
on one side and less charges on the
other side then there's a polarity,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
there's an electrical gradient, and
that's a form of stored energy.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Now, it happens that a membrane is
impermeable, as I've told you,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
to most things.  So you can get a
high concentration of something on

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
one side and a low concentration on
the other and controlled by a

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
protein imbedded in it,
whether those ever get a chance to

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
come across.  The same idea applies
for an electrical gradient.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And in particular of interest to
biology are hydrogen ions.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So if we have a situation like this
where we have more hydrogen ions on

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
one side of a membrane than another
then we have an electrical gradient,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000
we have a polarity.  And so this is
the membrane.  And so all

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:35.000
cells then have --

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And the way it works is this is the
outside of the cell and this is the

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
inside of the cell,
so more pluses on the outside,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
hydrogen ions on the outside than
the inside.  And it's about 70

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
millivolts.  It may not sound that
impressive, right?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Another way to look at it,
though, is the membrane is about

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
three nanometers.
So if you say,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
well, OK, what's the electrical
gradient across that?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
It's about 200,000 volts per
centimeter.  And high tension lines

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
are, you know,
more like that per mile or something

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
like that.  So although it seems
modest because the membranes,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
you've got have a very, very
powerful electrical gradient in all

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
cells.  And so this is
a form of energy.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And I think this was proposed in
1961.  Textbooks often say it was

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
adopted in the early 70s.
I went to a post-doc at Berkley in

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
1975 and people were still having
arguments about whether this really

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
was the way, was this really
something that was used in nature?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
It is.  And I think one of the most
dramatic demonstrations that a

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
proton gradient can be a source of
energy comes from this sort of thing.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I'd showed you how this bacteria,
these are E. coli swimming around

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
with these rotary motors that spin
10,000 to 100,000 RPM driving

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
those flagella.
I showed you the picture of the

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
inner membrane of E.
coli.  And I mentioned it has a

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
double membrane.
This is sort of a protective layer.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
You'll see, a little bit later in
the lecture, some double membranes

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
again.  And here's the motor with
the big propeller,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
the flagella sticking out from it.
And the way this thing, and I

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
showed you, I guess,
this picture and then this textbook

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
diagram.
What drives this motor are protons

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
flowing from the outside of the cell
through here, through the proteins

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
in here, through channels in them.
And that's what provides the torque

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
for the motor.
That's what drives it.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
It's not ATP or anything.
It's protons on the outside and

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
inside.  And there's a very dramatic
demonstration that's sort of like

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Friday night horror films,
[if you will?], where people found a

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
way of popping an E.
coli open so that all of the

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
cytoplasm ran out and then
it would reseal.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So what you've got is sort of an E.
coli that is just a shell, just the

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
membranes and the proteins imbedded
in it, and it just sits there at

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
neutral pH.  If you now acidify the
medium what's happened is you've

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
created a proton gradient because
there are now more protons on the

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
outside.  And this is just the same
picture I showed you before.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But what happens if you do that
experiment is the bacteria start

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
swimming.  They don't have any
insides or anything but you have

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
created artificially a proton
gradient and it drives the motor and

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000
they start swimming.
It's sort of like ìdead man walkingî

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
or something at a bacteria level.
I think it's a really dramatic

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
demonstration of how you can use the
energy of a proton gradient to make

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
energy.  So the principle that
underlies how respiration works and

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
photosynthesis works is that you
take advantage of this combination

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
of concentration and electrical
gradient.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And it's known as the chemi --

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
-- osmotic hypothesis.
Because here you have an electrical

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
gradient because of the charges.
You also have a concentration

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
gradient because you've got more
hydrogen ions on this side.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So you cannot really separate them.
They're kind of coupled.  But the

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
idea is that life uses this proton
gradient in order to make energy and

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
do some of these energy
transactions.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
So here's the sort of principle of
how it's done.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
You have a membrane like this,
then we have a protein, and now

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
we're not going to see all the alpha
helices and beta sheets.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
It'll be one of those things we
talked about that spans the membrane.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
The membrane,
as you might guess from what you

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
know about it,
is impermeable to hydrogen ions.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
So what this protein does that's
imbedded in the membrane,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
it's a proton pump.
And if you provide it with energy in

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
some form what it does is it takes a
hydrogen ion that's on the inside

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
and it makes it into a hydrogen ion
on the outside.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
There's no chemical transformation
of the proton.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
It's just gone from one side of the
membrane to the other.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
It's almost like recharging a
battery or something if you want to

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
think about it perhaps in
that kind of way.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And then the second stage is once
the proton gradient is established

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:42.000
and you have now many more H+s on
the outside than on the inside then

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:52.000
there is another protein that lets
the proton flow.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:02.000
The proton flows down to gradient
and therefore is able to come back

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
inside the cell.
Now, if that's all there was to it

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
we wouldn't have achieved anything.
We would have wasted energy, pump

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
something out,
pump something back.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000
But this molecule has an
interesting property,

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
and that is the ability of the
proton to flow down the gradient

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000
obligatorily requires ATP plus
inorganic phosphate.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
And as the proton comes down this
energy gradient there's enough

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
energy given off by that the cell is
able to capture it and use that

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
energy to synthesize a molecule of
ATP.  Got it?  So you produce some

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
energy like from the light in
photosynthesis that we'll see in a

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
minute, other ways of doing it,
and then get it outside.  Once

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
you've got the gradient
now you can make ATP.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000
And, actually,
one of the completely remarkable

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.000
discoveries of structural biology,
this is known as an ATP synthase.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000
It's a protein.
It's an enzyme.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:21.000
These are the kinds of things we've
been talking about.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
This is also a protein.
You see all the different things

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
proteins do.
So this ATP synthase,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
which uses this energy of the proton
gradient to make ATP,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
its structure has been worked out
and at a level,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
here's part of the crystal structure.
You can probably see some alpha

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
helices beta sheets.
Here's a textbook diagram of it

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
showing, it's upside down I'm
showing, but here's a proton on the

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
inside flowing across.
And what's remarkable is it turns

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
out that this ATP synthase is
structurally related to the protein

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
that's at the heart of that rotary
motor that drives the flagella.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And, in fact, remember,
I think I showed you where you could

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
stick the flagella to a cover slip
and the bacteria twirled around so

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000
you could actually see they were
rotating?  So people did sort of the

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
equivalent thing,
they managed to stick this ATP

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
synthase.  And you couldn't see that
the top part was turning,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
but they used some tricky stuff
we'll talk about with antibodies and

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
there's something to attach a long
filamentous molecule.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
It's the polymer of proton called
actin.  That's the same stuff we

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
find in our muscles.
And it made it long enough.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
You could see that when this thing
was working that it was twirling

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:40.000
around.  And so evolution took this
same basic sort of piece of protein

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
machinery.  And in one case it used
it to capture the energy of a proton

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
gradient and make ATP.
And in another case it used it to

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
drive this propeller,
if you will.  And here's sort of a

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
simple diagram.
So as the proton flows kind of what

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
happens is the inner part of this
thing sort of goes click, click.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
And every time it does it
synthesizes an ATP.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
And it sort of takes that energy to
push together the ADP and the

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
inorganic phosphate overcoming that
activation energy and getting them

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
close enough that you're able to get
that bond.  It's a truly remarkable

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
thing.  This is a somewhat hard
concept to grasp,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I understand, but if you can
understand this endocrine

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
variability between energy in the
form of a combined concentration of

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
electrical gradient and ATP,
and nature goes back and back and

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
forth, it's absolutely
fundamental to life.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
If we didn't have this stuff going
on we couldn't do it.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
You know, as I say with glycolysis,
I wish it was simpler, but this is

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
the way nature did it,
this is the way we are,

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
and [what I know about?] biology
this is how it goes.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000
And I wouldn't be doing it justice
if I didn't tell you some of the

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
details.  You're MIT students.
You should be able to, I hope,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
some of how the world actually works
at this kind of level.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
OK.  Now, with that kind of
background, I think

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
we can kind of --
Pretty quickly I can help you begin

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000
to see what happens here.
Now, remember the problem up there

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000
with glycolysis?
It started when there was no oxygen,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
and therefore it generated these
NADHs.  They weren't any good.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
You had to just get rid of them so
you took the pyruvate,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
organisms learned how to put them to
make lactate or ethanol and carbon

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
dioxide, but if there's oxygen
around then there's another

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
possibility.
And that is you can combine these

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:40.000
molecules with oxygen.
So if we take two NADH plus two

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:47.000
hydrogen ions plus a molecule of
oxygen what we get is two waters.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
And I think I can show you what's
going on there kind of simply.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:01.000
What NADH was, we got a pair of
electrons here and a hydrogen ion.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Well, if we took that,
what's that?  I think you'd

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
recognize it as a molecule of
hydrogen gas.  So if you take NADH

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000
and oxygen, what the cell is really
essentially doing,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
it's taking hydrogen gas plus oxygen
and it's giving two waters.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
So it's basically burning hydrogen.
And I think most of you know what

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
would happen if I had a mixture of
hydrogen and oxygen up here and

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
chucked a match at it or something.
We'd have a massive explosion.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
And, in fact, that's why there are
50 kilocalories of energy released

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
when that happens.
And so on an energy sort of diagram,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
these free energy diagrams where we
had the two NADH here plus the

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
molecule of oxygen,
and down here we have the two

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
molecules of water,
there is this.  If that happened in

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:00.000
one step it would be a huge
amount of energy.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
No cell or organism on earth has
figured out how to do that in one

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
step.  And I think some of the
textbooks liken it to sort of say it

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
would be like setting a stick of
dynamite off in the cell.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
And this is where one of these
things that seemed probably like a

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
kind of uninteresting thermodynamic
property, to some extent,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
becomes to be really important in
understanding biology.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
And that is the fact that remember
I said this drop in energy from

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
reactants to products was a
thermodynamic property?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
It didn't matter whether like you
skied straight down the hill or you

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
came down in a series of little
things, you still got the same

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
amount of energy release going from
here down to there.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
So that's, in essence,
what the cell does, is it takes this

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
energy and it breaks it into little
packages that it's able to manage in

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
a chemical way.
And so instead of coming down,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
and once it comes down in a series
of steps, and every time it flows

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
partway down hill it
does something.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
And what it does is it passes two
electrons to some kind of carrier.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And then the two electrons flow
downhill a little bit to another one

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
and then to another one.
And what happens when these

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
electrons are flowing downhill,
though, is that they drive that

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
proton pump.  So a proton pump takes
the proton from being on the outside

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000
to the inside.
And when the two electrons drop

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
down to the next level another H+
goes from out to H+ in, again here.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:49.000
And if you understood what I said

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000
before, what the cell can now do is
it can make three ATPs by using that

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
ATP synthesis,
and now taking advantage of those

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
three pump proteins and making them
into three ATPs.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:11.000
And then at the end of the day what
happens then is these two electrons

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
get together with two hydrogen ions
plus I'll show it as a half of an

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
oxygen here to give you water.
And what's happening up here is,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.000
in essence, the molecule of sugar,
C6H1206 is being burned with six

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.000
molecules of water plus this to give
you six molecules of C02 plus six

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:50.000
molecules of ATP so that the cell is
essentially achieving the same kind

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
of thing by this process as if it
had burned it in oxygen.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000
There's that much potential energy
released.  And the total amount of

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000
this change in the d-prime zero is
something out of the order of I

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:22.000
think it's minus 686 kilocalories
per mole.  It's able to capture

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:30.000
respiration.  It captures about 60%
of that energy as ATP.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:38.000
This process of fermentation,
this is what these processes that

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:46.000
happen in the absence of oxygen are
known as fermentation.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:54.000
As you can see, there much less
efficient.  It gets more like 3.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:01.000
% of the energy captured as ATP.
So you can see when oxygen arose in

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
the environment what a huge boom it
was to life because you could get a

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
lot more energy for the same amount
of starting material.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
There is one thing, though,
that the cell has to do.  In order

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
to do this it has to do some more
chemistry because it has to take

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
those pyruvates and it has to
somehow run them through this thing

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
that I'm called the citric acid
cycle and oxidative

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
phosphorylation.
Well, the oxidative phosphorylation

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
is basically this chain I've
diagramed for you here in a

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
schematic way.
And that's about the level you'll

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
have to understand it.
I mean physically it's going to be

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
a bunch of proteins stuck in the
membrane, and as the electrons get

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
passed along they pump a proton as
this pathway occurs.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
But the other thing the cells have
to do is they have to take those two

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
pyruvates and they have to burn them
all the way down to C02 and water.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000
And what's happening,
if you remember that chain of

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
oxidations, the carbons are being
successfully oxidized all the way up

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
to carbon dioxide.
You cannot be anymore oxidized than

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
that if you're carbon.
What that must mean is something

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
else is getting reduced.
And what gets reduced, where the

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
electrons go is NADHs.
So once oxygen became available in

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
the atmosphere then the name of the
game was to take those two pyruvates

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
and to somehow burn them all the way
down to here, and therefore generate

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
as much NADH as possible.
And if you can make some ATPs along

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
the way well and good.
So there had to be a whole other

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
set of chemical reactions that's
every bit as complicated as

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
glycolysis that emerged in nature,
that carried out that job.  And this

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
time I'm not going to take you
through all of the chemical

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
structures.  You can look at it in
your textbook and stuff,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
but what I really want you to kind
of take is to keep your eye on the

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
number of carbons.
If you look at the structure of

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000
pyruvate you'll see that it's three
carbons, and it was this.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Here's the keto group and an acidic
group.  So this is almost carbon

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:21.000
dioxide.  It's just one oxidative
step away.  So what happens in this

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
cycle is that first the carbon
dioxide is removed and this

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.000
makes an acetate.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
In essence it's actually joined to
something right here.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000
And then this feeds into this thing
called the citric acid cycle.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And what it is, as I said, is it's
a set of chemical reactions that are

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
designed to take this pyruvate and
burn it all the way to carbon

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
dioxide and water,
and to generate as many NADHs and

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
ATPs as it can along the way.
And, again, I wish it were simpler.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
It would be really nice if it just
did it straight from acetate,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
but instead you'll see, if you look
at the TCA cycle,

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
the C4 compound.  And this gets
joined together to give us C6

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
compound.  And then it oxidizes one
of these carbons to give a carbon

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
dioxide.  Now you're down to the C5.
It does it again, another molecule

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
of C02, you're at C4.
And then it takes this C4 carbon

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
skeleton, puts it through some
transformations that enables this

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
cycle to go all over again.
So basically the C4 thing just goes

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:42.000
through the cycle.
It's a carrier that takes this C2

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
right here, lets it be processed to
give two molecules of C02.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
In that process it generates more
NADH, a bit of ATP,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
and a kind of reduced carrier that
you can think of for the moment

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
largely equivalently to NADH.
OK.  Now, the entity in our cells

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:15.000
that carries out this process
of respiration --

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Of respiration.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
So the citric acid cycle and the
mitochondria is not actually in our

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
cytoplasm, which is perhaps
surprising, but all the enzymes for

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
glycolysis are.
So remember my simple diagram of the

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
eukaryotic cell one the first day?
We had the nucleus which is a

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
membrane compartment that has the
DNA inside it,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
and we'll have more to say about
that in the next lecture of so,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.000
but then there were some organelles.
And one of them I said was the

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
mitochondrion.
And I also said in the first

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
lecture that there's pretty good
evidence now that the mitochondrion

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
arose by some earlier progenitor or
ancestor of a eukaryotic cell

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
capturing some kind of bacterium.
It's actually one that's sort of

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.000
kind of related to E.
coli.  It had double membranes.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
And the mitochondria actually still
have some of their own DNA,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
but this is where all the energy,
all the enzymes for the citric acid

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:32.000
cycle --

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
-- and oxidative phosphorylation are
found in the inside of the

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
mitochondrion,
instead of something that probably

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:47.000
used to be a free-living bacterium.
In contrast, the enzymes for

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
glycolysis are in what's called the
cytoplasm of the cell,

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
which is sort of the main part of
the insides of the cell.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000
So you see even here this sort of
evolutionary history that I kind of

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
put out across the board.
The enzymes for glycolysis arose so

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
early in evolution they're in the
cytoplasm of virtually every

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
organism on earth.
Eukaryotic cells manage to figure

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:14.000
out how to get 18 times more energy
for a molecule of sugar,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
but in order to do it they kind of
had to cheat.  They took a bacterium

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
and figured out how to do it,
put it inside our own cells, and

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000
then it's able to run now,
it's become a part of our cell and

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
it's where all the process
takes place.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And if you look at a structure of a
mitochondrion it's actually got two

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
membranes.  You just saw a picture
of that, an E.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
coli.  And it's sort of involuted a
little bit like this.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And so this is an outer membrane of
a mitochondrion.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.000
So I'm basically taking this and
blowing it up.  So this

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000
is a mitochondrion.
And the in and the out,

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
in this case there's an inner
membrane.  This is where the proton

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
pump is located.
This is where the ATP synthesis is

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
located.  And when a mitochondrion
is working what it's doing is it's

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
pumping hydrogen ions from its
inside, which is more or less the

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
equivalent of its cytoplasm,
it's whatever used to be the

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
cytoplasm of the original bacterium,
outside into the space between the

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
inner and outer membranes.
And then it generates ATP by flowing

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
back down.  OK.
So there are a couple of sort of

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
things that affect your life that
come out of this.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
One of them is understanding the
ìfreshman fiveî or ìfreshman

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
fifteenî or whatever it is.
You come to college and all of a

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
sudden you put on a lot of weight.
Sometimes you can figure it out

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
because you ate a lot of Ben &
Jerry's or a lot of chocolate bars

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
or something and didn't
do as much exercise.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Another one of you said,
gee, now I understand why I'm not

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
putting on any weight.
I do water polo, and I guess I must

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
be burning up everything I eat as
energy.  And you're right,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
but now I can show you at a
molecular level what's happening.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
So what happens, your body,
everything is regulated,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
and it can tell if it needs,
cells in your body can tell if it

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000
needs energy.  If it needs energy
and you eat sugar it runs right

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
through here and it makes ATP.
But if you've eaten enough and the

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
things that monitor your body say
that you've got enough ATP then it

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
doesn't keep this process going.
Instead what it does is it stops it

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000
and says instead we're going to put
something away for a rainy day,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
which you could see makes a lot of
sense in evolution.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
You know, if things are good you
just kill the mammoth and you can

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
all eat well for a while
or something.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
It would make sense for your body to
be able to pack stuff away.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
So what it does is it intercepts
the process at this level,

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000
at this C2 level.  The pyruvate gets
to here, and instead of being run

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
through this in ATP this acetate or
acetyl moiety which is a C2 gets run

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
through a cycle of successive two
carbon additions.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.000
And what comes out of that are
fatty acids.  It also takes

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:43.000
three phosphor --

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
-- glyceraldehyde.
You might remember that.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
That's one of the products stuck in
the middle of that glycolytic

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
pathway.  So this is a three carbon
compound.  It makes it into glycerol

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000
which is a three carbon compound.
And if you look back when we talked

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:07.000
about lipids a couple of lectures
ago you'll realize what happens if

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:12.000
you combine fatty acids with
glycerol then you've got fats.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
And, in essence, I mean that's what
happens.  We put on weight if we eat

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
more than we're burning.
Our bodies say, OK, I've got as

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
much ATP as we need.
I'm going to take some of that ATP

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
and use it in this kind of way.
Just a second here.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
I'm going to see --

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
So there's another thing that
happens, a physiological thing that

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.000
we experience.
Well, we seem to be stuck at the

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
moment.  I won't worry about it.
I've run some marathons.  I don't

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
know.  A few of you may have.
If not almost all of you have heard

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
about ìhitting the wallî.
And it happens generally around 21,

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
22, 23 miles.
It depends on the condition you're

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
doing.  And physiologically I have
experienced, this is amazing,

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
I understand why they call it
hitting the wall.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
You're running along and you think,
boy, I'm tired but I'm doing OK.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
And in a space of a quarter of mile
it's like you banged into a brick

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
wall.  And you can sort of keep
yourself going but it's a profound

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
physiological change.
And what has happened at that point

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
is you've run out of sugar to burn.
Now, I've told you, you can take

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
sugars and you can polymerize
them into glycogen.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
That's one of those polymers with
alpha 1,4 linkages.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000
That's a sugar storage molecule.
So if you start running, you

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
carbo-load, you try and get as much
sugar into glycogen as you possibly

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
can.  You start running the marathon.
Your body starts taking that

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
glycogen and breaking it down into
sugars.  It runs it through that

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
process.  What happens when you hit
the wall as a human body is most

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
human bodies are designed so that
you run out of sugar.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
You just cannot carbo-load enough
to do 26 miles.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
You can get through 20 or something
there.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000
And when you run out of that what
happens then is your body can no

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
longer burn sugar so it switched to
burning fatty acids.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.000
And that's less efficient and you
really feel it.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
If any of you have done long
endurance things or triathlons or

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
anything you've experienced that
change.  The final thing,

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
just to close for the lecture for
today, is one thing you can

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
appreciate.  Yeast is somebody that
can do both of these things,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
right?  It can either grow
anaeorbically.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
And it makes C02 plus ethanol.
Or it can grow aerobically.  And

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:44.000
this gives it two ATPs per glucose
and this gives it 36 ATPs per

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
glucose.  So if you were a yeast,
you would have to somehow regulate

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:59.000
the rate of glycolysis depending on
whether there was oxygen

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
around or not.
And it's very tricky and neat way it

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
happens.  There's an enzyme,
that wouldn't surprise you, that has

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:19.000
an active site for one of the key
steps in the pathway where it's

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:26.000
going from fructose-1-phosphate,
fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000
-diphosphate.
That's one of the intermediate steps

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
in glycolysis.
It's the enzyme that turns out to

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
be rate-limiting.
You can control passage of

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
something through a pathway by just
making one step rate-limiting.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
So this has a place for the
fructose 6 phosphate plus ATP to

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
bind, and it catalyzes the formation
of the fructose-1,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
-diphosphate.  But that enzyme has
to work at different rates depending

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
on whether the cell is
aerobic or anaerobic.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:11.000
So what it does is there's a second
binding site over here.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.000
And if it binds ATP, this speeds up,
excuse me, slows down the rate

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000
that's catalyzed over here.
And that's what you'd expect.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:32.000
If it's got enough ATP it doesn't
need to run glycolysis as fast.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And it also binds AMP or ADP, and
that speeds up the rate.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
So the yeast are able to monitor,
to sort of have a control on how

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
fast sugar flows through this
glycolytic pathway.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
And what they're really doing is
they're monitoring do I have enough

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
ATP or not?  And so if they're
running with respiration,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
making lots of stuff, they don't
need to do glycolysis as fast.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.000
If they're anaerobic they have to
run it 18 times as fast to get the

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
same amount of energy.
OK?  We'll begin the next lecture

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
with photosynthesis and then we're
going to get into a bunch of

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
molecular biology.  OK?

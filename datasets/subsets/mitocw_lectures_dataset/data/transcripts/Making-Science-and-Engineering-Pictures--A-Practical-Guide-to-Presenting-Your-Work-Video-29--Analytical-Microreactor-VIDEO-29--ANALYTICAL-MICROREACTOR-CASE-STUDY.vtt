00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.690
Most of the time we
don't have the luxury

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.010
of showing the various
points of view,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.900
so we have to find the
right point of view

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.190
when we are submitting to
journals or presentations.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.620
So here's an image that I
made of a microreactor that

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.470
studies a particular reaction.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.010
It was important to show how
this microreactor was connected

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.680
to the analytic
pieces, and so here's

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.390
another point of view
showing the pieces connected

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.320
to the background.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.980
So I worked a little
more on this; was there

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.420
a way to show the microreactor
with the background

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.260
pieces at an angle?

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.590
This was OK.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.840
I wanted to see a little
more of the front of it,

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.820
and so I went to
try for this one.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.850
Notice, something
isn't quite right.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.140
I hope you are
getting more and more

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.170
particular with your own images.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.390
You see something up
here in the corner.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.640
That's this shadow.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.080
We don't want that.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.170
So by moving the camera
just a little more

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.740
to a different angle,
we get a cleaner image.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.860
I wanted to play around a little
bit with the microreactor,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.990
this particular one, on its
own, and then what I did

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.760
was I duplicated it, put a
digital background on it.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.110
I thought it would be
kind of interesting.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.630
Maybe it could be used
for an introduction slide.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.225
Bottom line is the
researchers never used it.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.759
So went back to the
clear documentary

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.830
image, which hopefully really
shows what is going on here,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.900
and, indeed, we did get
it published as a cover

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.570
and, also, of course,
in the figure.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.910
This is the best point of view
for this particular device.

JONATHAN GRUBER:
Today we're going

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.600
to move on to another topic I've
kept hinting at all semester,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.030
but it's finally here.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:18.620
Which is to think
more explicitly

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.230
about equity, or fairness.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.440
So our discussions this semester
have been almost solely couched

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.300
in language of efficiency.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.780
We talk about maximizing
social welfare,

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.900
we talk about the total size of
the triangle and the squares.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.510
But we don't actually
talk about who gets what.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.050
We very much stayed away
from equity concerns

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.120
and focused just on
efficiency concerns.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.960
The problem is, that doesn't
lead us very far in life,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.610
because you can have
many outcomes that

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.450
are equally efficient, but have
different equity consequences.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.750
The best example, of course,
is perfect competition

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.810
versus a perfectly priced
discriminating monopolist.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.610
Remember, under
perfect competition,

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.530
you maximize welfare.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.810
But a perfectly priced
discriminating monopolist

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.627
also maximizes welfare.

00:01:05.627 --> 00:01:07.210
The difference is,
in the latter case,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.200
the monopolist gets all the
surplus, when the former case,

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.403
it's shared between
producers and consumers.

00:01:13.403 --> 00:01:14.820
So it's sort of
weird to say we're

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.760
indifferent between those two
outcomes-- to one where Apple

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.500
gets all our money,
and one where

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.960
Apple gets some of our money
and we get some of our money.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.750
Seems strange to say
we're indifferent

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.730
between those outcomes.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.650
So now, in subsets,
that's the easy case.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.630
So we're talking about
equity efficiency.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.260
In some sense, the
easy case is the case

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.677
where there's two equally
efficient outcomes,

00:01:43.677 --> 00:01:45.510
and they have different
equity consequences.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.340
That's a rare case.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.850
The more common case is what
we call the equity efficiency

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.580
trade-off.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.370
Which is that by making
distributions more equal,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.880
we are going to
induce inefficiencies.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.880
That the act of making
distribution more equal

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.460
is going to introduce
inefficiencies in the system.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.199
And that's where things
get really interesting.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.500
OK?

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.858
So in other words-- so the
best way to think about this,

00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:16.150
I find most helpful, is due
to a famous economist named

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.780
Arthur Okun, and his thought
example of the leaky bucket.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.445
Okun's thought example was
the following-- imagine

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:27.320
that the way the government
distributed money

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.820
from the rich the
poor was literally

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.880
they went to the rich, had the
rich put money in a bucket,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.390
and they carried it and dumped
out in front of the poor.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.060
Imagine that's the way
distribution happened.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.780
Well, in that
world, if I told you

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.510
that every dollar a rich
person put in the bucket got

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.090
carried along and got
handed to a poor person--

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.310
so Bill Gates' dollar became
a homeless guy's dollar--

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.627
probably most of us
would think that was OK.

00:02:51.627 --> 00:02:53.210
I think the vast
majority of Americans

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.960
would say, yeah,
probably the homeless guy

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.040
could use $1 more
than Bill Gates could.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.850
But now, imagine that there
was a leak in the bucket.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.015
Imagine Bill Gates
put 100 pennies in,

00:03:04.015 --> 00:03:06.140
but along the way to the
poor person it leaked out,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.140
and so we dumped it in
front of the poor person,

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.090
it was less than 100.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.490
Now, then the question
is, how much leakage?

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.950
Well, if the leakage was
one penny out of 100,

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.850
you probably wouldn't
change your mind.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.320
Would it change your mind if
it was 20 pennies out of 100?

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.350
50 pennies out of 100?

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.043
What if it was 100
pennies out of 100?

00:03:23.043 --> 00:03:24.460
What if taking $1
from Bill Gates,

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.798
by the time it got to the
poor person, it was all gone?

00:03:26.798 --> 00:03:28.590
At what point would
you say, you know what?

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.370
I don't think that's
a good idea anymore.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.770
And really, that's a great way
of thinking about the equity

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.640
efficiency trade-off--
how much efficiency

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.565
are you willing to give up to
redistribute from rich to poor?

00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:42.440
And the efficiency you
give up is represented

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.648
by the leakage in the bucket.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.020
Now, what we're
going to do with this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.570
in this lecture and
next Monday's lecture,

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.910
is we're going to discuss
this equity efficiency

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.540
trade-off in four steps.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.060
The first step is going to
be talking about valuation--

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.950
that is taking the difficult
step we've already taken so far

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.190
and asking, how does society
feel about some people

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.360
versus other people?

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.430
So far, we've just thought
of one generic person,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.138
and they're represented
by total surplus.

00:04:13.138 --> 00:04:15.055
But in fact, we have a
distribution of people,

00:04:15.055 --> 00:04:17.190
and how do economists think
about taking money away

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.260
from person A and
giving to person B.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.970
That's a new topic for us.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.360
The second thing we're
going to talk about

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.988
is what do we know about
the facts on inequality?

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:34.530
What do we know
about what's actually

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.220
happened to the distribution
of resources in the US

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.085
at a point in time,
and over time?

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:42.710
The third thing is,
we're going to talk

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.210
about the sources of leakage.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.900
That is, why does the
bucket leak in practice?

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.780
Why do we typically think
there is an equity efficiency

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:52.140
trade-off?

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.850
Why can't we just take the
dollar from the rich guy

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.170
and give it to the poor guy?

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.230
What caused the leakage?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.120
And then finally, we're going
to talk about some examples

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.687
of transfer mechanisms.

00:05:05.687 --> 00:05:07.270
We're going to talk
about what society

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:10.570
does in practice to
transfer from rich to poor

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.320
and how it works, and what the
ultimate leakage looks like.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.085
So that's going to be our
goal in the next two lectures.

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:20.210
It's going to be think
about this equity efficiency

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.380
trade-off.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.370
So to start that goal, we have
to start with this first issue

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.440
of choosing the social optimum.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.180
That is, how do we
evaluate transfers

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.530
from one party to another party?

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.670
And so to rank outcomes,
what we're going to do is use

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.130
the same thing we always do
when we want to think about

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.060
trade-offs--

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.310
which is, we're going to do
a constrained maximization

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.565
exercise.

00:05:52.565 --> 00:05:54.940
When I want to think about
your trade-off between cookies

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.368
and pizza, I did a
constrained optimization

00:05:57.368 --> 00:05:59.410
of your utility functions,
subject to your budget

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:00.215
constraint.

00:06:00.215 --> 00:06:02.590
When, now I want to think
about your trade-off between me

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.480
and Patricia, now instead, we're
going to a different utility

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.980
function.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.430
In fact, we're going to use
what we call a social welfare

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.900
function.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.490
A social welfare
function basically

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.860
society's utility function.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.290
How does society value
different individuals?

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.670
So loosely speaking,
social welfare function

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.880
is some function of utility
of person 1, common utility

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.770
of person 2, common, dot, dot,
dot, comma utility of person

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.010
350 million, if it's the US.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.260
So it's some
aggregation function.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.320
Just like we mathematically
aggregate your taste

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.330
for pizza and cookies.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.490
Now we're going to
mathematically aggregate

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.520
all society's utility to get
a social welfare function.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:50.720
So for example,
consider figure 21-1.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.390
Let's think of society as only
two people, Homer and Ned--

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:55.723
let's imagine that's all of
society, because once again,

00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:58.630
it's always these two by
two examples are easy.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.180
What we've drawn here are
what's called isowelfare curves.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:08.330
What these are, are basically
society's indifference curves.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.600
Just like if these x and
y-axis are pizza and cookies,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.210
I would draw a difference curve
between pizza and cookies.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.690
Now drawing society
as a difference curve

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.400
between Homer and Ned.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.200
So in other words,
what this says

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:25.730
is that society's indifferent
between Homer having U1 super

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:30.200
H, and Ned having U1 super
N, versus the Homer having

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.750
U2 two super H and
Ned having U2 super N.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.410
Those are combinations
of resources across which

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.738
society is indifferent.

00:07:38.738 --> 00:07:40.530
And much like any other
indifference curve,

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.910
further out is better.

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.340
We'd all prefer both Homer
and Ned to have more--

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.020
more is better.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.810
So that's easy-- the further
out the isowelfare curve goes,

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.040
the happier you are.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.890
And a long isowelfare
curve are allocations

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.847
of resource across individuals
among which we're indifferent.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.520
Now, the question is, that's
all well and easy to graph

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.020
as a theoretical proposition.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.510
But in practice, what does
a social welfare function

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.350
look like?

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:09.410
Utility functions, I just
wrote down a usually function,

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.970
and you took it as--

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.110
I wrote down square root,
we worked with that.

00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:14.990
But there were some
properties we wrote down

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.837
that gave us a sense of what
utility functions look like.

00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:19.670
Social welfare functions
are much more open,

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:21.080
because they don't
come from introspection

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:22.370
about your preferences.

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.190
They come from introspection
about society's preferences,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:26.270
which are much harder.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:28.850
So what we do here is we
talk about some typical forms

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.030
of social welfare functions
that we use in economics.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:35.240
The most common form
is what's called

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.419
utilitarian social
welfare function--

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:42.350
utilitarian social
welfare function.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.600
This is due to the
philosopher Jeremy Bentham--

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.717
if you ever visit
University College London--

00:08:46.717 --> 00:08:48.800
actually, if you did until
about 15 years ago, you

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.320
could see Jeremy Bentham's
head, it was on display.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.790
He was a famous
philosopher there.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.373
But apparently, students would
take it out, use it for soccer.

00:08:55.373 --> 00:08:57.800
So they took it off display,
you can't see it anymore.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.320
But he's a famous
philosopher, and he came up

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.680
with the idea of utilitarianism.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.500
And basically utilitarianism
is, it simply says,

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.640
the social welfare function is
simply the linear aggregation

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.260
of every individual's utility.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.810
So social welfare
function is simply,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:20.270
U1 plus U2 plus U3 plus--

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:22.635
plus U 350 million.

00:09:22.635 --> 00:09:24.010
So the US social
welfare function

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.510
is literally, we just measure
everyone's utility, add it up,

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:28.970
and that's the social
welfare function.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.662
And in subsets, it's a
natural starting point.

00:09:31.662 --> 00:09:33.620
Right, you just say,
look, it's just a linear--

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.770
it's like having a
linear utility function.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.470
It's a linear utility function.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.680
Now, let's be clear--

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.560
what this says is that
I don't care any more

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.910
about anybody in society.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.400
So I don't care any more
or less about Bill Gates

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.150
and the homeless guy.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.530
I treat them--

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:54.800
I'm indifferent between them.

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.140
But does this mean
I wouldn't want

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:01.070
to transfer money from Bill
Gates the homeless guy?

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.568
In fact, I still would want
to transfer-- and why--

00:10:03.568 --> 00:10:04.610
depending on the leakage.

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.314
Why?

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:08.490
AUDIENCE: Because of the
condition of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.240
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:10.590
I care about the
utility the same,

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.500
but the next dollar's not
worth anything to Bill Gates.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.280
It's worth a lot to
the homeless guy.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.988
So a utilitarian social
welfare function,

00:10:15.988 --> 00:10:17.447
which is a natural
starting point--

00:10:17.447 --> 00:10:19.440
I don't think it's
particularly liberal, it's

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.020
a natural starting point,
you're just adding them up--

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.630
ends up with a very, in
substance, redistributive

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.120
conclusion, which
is that you want

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.100
to attribute from rich to poor.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.910
Indeed, what the optimum with
utilitarian social welfare

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:36.120
function is that you
want to redistribute

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.910
until marginal
utilities are equal.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.720
So this social function
calls for fairly radical

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.040
redistribution.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.660
This says, you want
to redistribute

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.033
until utilities are equal.

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:49.700
Marginal utilities
are equal, I'm sorry.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.174
Yeah?

00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:55.210
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
is constant [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
once again, you're right,

00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:59.210
I mean, you just add
people and subtract people.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.540
Wouldn't be a problem.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:02.415
But for now, let's just
assume the copulation

00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:04.730
is because you've got
one given society.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.740
OK, so if two people,
it's just Ned and Homer,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:07.710
just add them up.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.380
All it says is, as Ned is
more resources than Homer,

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:11.670
we're going redistribute.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.900
Indeed, with this function,
if we make the assumption

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.500
that total social
resources are fixed,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:24.520
that society has a fixed budget
constraint that can't change,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.110
then what does
this function imply

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.400
would be the optimal
distribution of income?

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.130
So ignoring the fact that people
might work less or more hard--

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.463
ignore that, imagine it's
just the total amount of money

00:11:34.463 --> 00:11:35.250
a society has.

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.500
If that's your social
welfare function,

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.632
what's the optimal
distribution of income?

00:11:40.632 --> 00:11:41.132
Yeah?

00:11:41.132 --> 00:11:43.632
AUDIENCE: Are we assuming that
makes everyone equally happy?

00:11:43.632 --> 00:11:45.120
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes, everyone--

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.240
good point, fixed resources are
identical utility functions.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.150
Great point.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.255
Yeah, exactly, great catch.

00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:53.630
If it's a fixed
bundle of income,

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.730
and everyone has identical
utility functions,

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:58.500
then we simply want everyone to
have the same amount of money.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.330
Why?

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:02.840
Because giving someone $1
would make them less happy

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.330
than taking away from someone
else would make them sad.

00:12:05.330 --> 00:12:07.247
It's all about diminishing
margin of utility--

00:12:07.247 --> 00:12:09.030
just like we talked
about last time.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:11.750
So now, that might not
be true, for example--

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.060
does anybody know who
Scrooge McDuck is?

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.880
Scrooge McDuck?

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.710
Raise your hand if you
know Scrooge McDuck.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:18.490
OK, not bad.

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:19.570
Scrooge McDuck is
this comic character

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.100
from when I was a kid
who used to like to dive

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:22.232
and swim in his money.

00:12:22.232 --> 00:12:23.690
Now, he clearly
had a higher margin

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.810
of utility of the
next dollar than I do.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.820
OK, so if Scrooge McDuck
really likes money,

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.340
we might want to let Scrooge
McDuck have some extra money.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.010
But if utility
functions are identical,

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.270
and social resources are fixed,
this is one equal distribution

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:34.900
income.

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.570
That's really radical.

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.360
That's beyond what any
country in the world does--

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.190
a perfect equal
distribution of income.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.190
But it comes naturally out
of this fairly plain vanilla

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.690
social welfare function.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:49.470
Quite a striking finding, right?

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.530
Now, but in fact,
if we think of this

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:54.750
as sort of our starting point--

00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:56.190
Bentham was actually
conservative,

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:58.270
this is typically viewed as a
conservative starting point,

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.420
even though it has a
very liberal conclusion.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.700
The more liberal
extreme is what we

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:08.040
call a Rawlsian social welfare
function, due to philosopher

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.290
James, I think, Rawls,
who was at Harvard--

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.070
Philip John Rawls, I'm sorry.

00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:19.010
He said the goal of society
is to maximize the well-being

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.530
of its worst-off member.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:24.200
So Rawlsian social
welfare function

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:29.940
is the minimum of U1 comma
U2 comma dot, dot, dot.

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.560
In other words,
all you care about

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.860
is the worst-off
person in society.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:37.400
OK, so Rawlsian social
welfare function would say,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.710
all we care about is the
worst-off person in society.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.680
Now, unless you
think this is crazy,

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.360
let's think about where
Rawls came at this from.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.075
Rawls came at this
from the concept

00:13:49.075 --> 00:13:51.440
that he called the
veil of ignorance.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.672
Which he said, look,
before you were born,

00:13:54.672 --> 00:13:56.630
you know nothing about
what you're going to be.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.522
You could be born to rich
or poor, healthy, sick,

00:13:59.522 --> 00:14:00.230
you have no idea.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.990
You're just a little embryo.

00:14:02.990 --> 00:14:04.490
From that perspective,
he said, what

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:08.210
you would want is to make sure
that you're going to be OK.

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.790
And so from that
perspective, society

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:11.373
should want to
minimize the well-being

00:14:11.373 --> 00:14:13.220
of the worst-off member.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.320
That was his rationalization.

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.882
But this has really
radical implications.

00:14:17.882 --> 00:14:20.090
Not only does this say, we
want an equal distribution

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:22.610
of income, this says,
we would destroy

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.477
any amount of money of the rich
to give some money to the poor.

00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:28.310
So imagine what this
says, if I could take--

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:31.010
if everyone's distribution of
income was equal in this class,

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.870
let's say our society,
except Patricia

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.460
has $40,000 more than everyone
else, then what that would say

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.160
is, we would happily take
$40,000 away from Patricia

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.610
and give $1 to me.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:46.860
Because I'm, like everyone
else, the worst-off member.

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.430
But let's say I'm $1 less than
the rest of you, make it easy.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.597
So you all the same amount
of money, I have $1 less,

00:14:51.597 --> 00:14:53.870
she has $40,000 more.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.620
Rawlsian would say,
we'd happily take away

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.530
her $40,000 to give me $1.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:14:59.970
It doesn't make a
whole lot of sense.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.200
But it's one sort of
extreme, and it's basically

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.090
this notion of--

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.560
it's in some sense, Rawlsian.

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.350
Think of an extremely
risk-averse embryo,

00:15:07.350 --> 00:15:08.400
gives you the Rawlsian.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.140
The idea that, I don't know
what my income is going to be,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.945
but I want to make
sure I'm not poor.

00:15:11.945 --> 00:15:14.070
Then I would want sort of
a Rawlsian social welfare

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:15.240
function.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.470
So that's sort of
a liberal extreme.

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.850
Now, there's two
other views, which

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.740
are harder to write
down mathematically--

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:29.790
at least in the context of
1401, but are important.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.040
Let's take the most
conservative extreme.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.170
So if Rawlsian is the
most liberal extreme,

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:37.820
the most conservative
extreme would be the Nozick--

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:42.030
Nozickian argument-- it's not
really social welfare function.

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:47.850
His argument is that we should
never redistribute income.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.700
We should only
redistribute opportunities.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.633
In other words, once everyone
has equal opportunities,

00:15:53.633 --> 00:15:55.050
then we just roll
the dice and let

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.210
things lay in where they may.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.927
So here's an example.

00:15:58.927 --> 00:16:01.260
Let's say all of us are born
with the same opportunities

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:04.080
in life, and we end
up where we are today.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:07.770
And let's say that you
guys are willing to pay me

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:10.218
$10 every lecture
to hear me lecture.

00:16:10.218 --> 00:16:12.260
Well, if that's true, at
the end of the semester.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.670
I have a lot more
money than you.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.170
Nozick would say,
well, why should I

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.670
be taxed and given to you?

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.520
That makes no sense.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.300
You voluntarily payed me.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:22.800
Why should LeBron James, we're
voluntarily paying to see him

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:25.440
play, why should he then
be taxed on the money we

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.190
voluntarily gave him?

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.690
So Nozick's views,
as long as we all

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.450
start with the equality of
opportunity, let the dice roll.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.730
If someone has more
talents and skills,

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.290
and people want to pay
them, then let them keep it.

00:16:37.290 --> 00:16:42.180
So basically, Nozick's idea
is to essentially equalize

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:44.470
opportunity, and letting the
dice land where they may.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:46.675
Yeah?

00:16:46.675 --> 00:16:49.680
AUDIENCE: Is this
just like opportunity

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.903
that can be regulated?

00:16:50.903 --> 00:16:54.344
Or is it-- I was
thinking that [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:54.344 --> 00:16:58.022
might mean like [INAUDIBLE]
doesn't have equal opportunity.

00:16:58.022 --> 00:16:58.980
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.170
So there's two problems
with the Nozickian view.

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.060
One is, what is opportunity?

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.109
What is equal opportunity mean?

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.089
And the answer is, it's
not clear-- there's

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.359
genetic equal opportunity.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:11.240
There's the fact that
if I'm born in poverty,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.160
I go to lower quality
schools, so I don't really

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.243
have an equal opportunity.

00:17:14.243 --> 00:17:16.490
I went to a ritzy public
high school in New Jersey,

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:18.109
because my parents
were well-off.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:20.849
Like someone who went to high
school in some poor town of New

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:22.849
Jersey didn't have the
same opportunities I did.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:26.720
So the first problem with this
argument is that, in some sense

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.490
it's impossible to
equalize opportunity.

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:31.460
And so it starts
with a false premise.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.640
The second problem with this
argument is it ignores luck.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.350
It ignores luck.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:43.260
Which is that in fact, if you
look at why some people are

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:45.810
rich and some people are poor,
even with equal opportunities,

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.842
a lot of it's not skill
or talent, it's luck.

00:17:48.842 --> 00:17:50.800
They were in the right
place at the right time,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.147
had the right parents who gave
them the right inheritance.

00:17:55.147 --> 00:17:56.980
They met the right
person in business school

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:59.700
and that person brought
them into their company.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:00.200
It's luck.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.490
Indeed, if you try to
explain differences in income

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.760
by any measure of skill we have,
you can never explain even half

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:08.830
of the difference in
income across people.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.510
A lot of it appears to be luck.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.910
Well, in that case,
we would then not

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:16.135
want to let lucky people be
richer than unlucky people.

00:18:16.135 --> 00:18:17.760
That doesn't really
seem to make sense.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.140
So I want skilled people
richer than unskilled people,

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.300
but it seems like we
might redistribute

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:24.010
against from the
lucky to the unlucky.

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:28.380
So that's the other problem
with the Nozickian notion.

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:32.970
And then finally, the fourth
approach, the fourth approach

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:38.670
is a totally alternative
view, which we

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:44.380
call commodity egalitarianism.

00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:46.090
Commodity egalitarianism.

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:52.080
This view is simply
saying, look,

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.020
who cares how much money
I have relative to you?

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.212
All that matters, that you
can live a decent life.

00:18:59.212 --> 00:19:00.940
So this says is
what matters is not

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.540
relative income but
absolute resources.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.610
What matters is making
sure everyone in society

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.240
has food and
shelter, and I would

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.100
argue health care, et cetera.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.710
A set of base things
everyone should have.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:18.130
And then above that, who cares?

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.350
So in substance,
commodity egalitarianism

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.970
is a mix of Rawls and Nozick.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:24.540
It cares about the
minimum, saying

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.530
we've got to make
sure everyone has

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:26.697
a decent standard of living.

00:19:26.697 --> 00:19:29.130
But above that,
let's roll the dice.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:31.380
As long as we're providing
a decent standard of living

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.630
for everyone, that if someone
can make a lot of money,

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:36.050
let's let them.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.930
So this is a very
interesting view.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.350
And it basically talks
about the view of

00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:45.932
should we give people
money or stuff?

00:19:45.932 --> 00:19:47.990
In the sense of commodity
egalitarianism view,

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:49.475
says, look, let's
worry less about money

00:19:49.475 --> 00:19:50.300
and more about stuff.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.050
Let's make sure everybody
has enough stuff

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.760
to live a decent life.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.310
And then we'll roll
the dice from there.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.260
So let me start--

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.830
if I was not clear enough at
all, none of these are right.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.930
These are all alternative views.

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:05.498
It is harder to
write down to make

00:20:05.498 --> 00:20:07.290
an assumption about
social welfare function

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.790
than it is about a
utility function.

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:10.350
We have less
parameters to draw on.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.117
But the point is, these are
all different ways of thinking

00:20:13.117 --> 00:20:13.950
about the trade-off.

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:16.050
We can't avoid thinking
about the trade-off.

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:18.330
That's why, once again,
we're the dismal science--

00:20:18.330 --> 00:20:19.410
because nothing's free.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:20.490
We can't avoid thinking
about the trade-off.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.237
We have to think
about redistribution.

00:20:22.237 --> 00:20:23.820
And these give us
different frameworks

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.040
for thinking about that.

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.590
Questions about that?

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:28.880
Yeah?

00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.020
AUDIENCE: What-- for the
Nozickian and the other one,

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.620
what happens if there are
individuals that just don't--

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.860
they always make
the wrong decision.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.420
They'll spend all their
money irresponsibly,

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:45.670
and therefore, they can't
have a producing [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:45.670 --> 00:20:47.212
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, I mean, that's

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:48.440
a very interesting question.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.025
So I think Nozick--

00:20:50.025 --> 00:20:52.400
I mean, I don't know, I don't
know how hard-hearted a guy

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.357
Nozick is--

00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:55.440
but if you took the Nozickian
view to the extreme,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.648
as long as that person had
an equal opportunity, then

00:20:57.648 --> 00:20:59.323
they should just die.

00:20:59.323 --> 00:21:00.990
You know, they had
an equal opportunity,

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.917
if they made a series of bad
decisions, why should we care?

00:21:04.917 --> 00:21:06.500
Now, that's obviously
an extreme view,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.110
but I think that would
be the view there.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.540
Whereas, commodity
egalitarianism would say, look,

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.600
let's at least make sure that,
despite their bad decisions,

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.350
they don't starve.

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:17.267
But we don't want to
make them rich if they're

00:21:17.267 --> 00:21:18.398
making bad decisions.

00:21:18.398 --> 00:21:20.440
So let's just set a minimum
and get them to that,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.900
and then let things
go from there.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:24.420
Yeah?

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.105
AUDIENCE: Is that where the
idea of basic income comes from?

00:21:27.605 --> 00:21:28.330
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a great segue to what

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.760
I want to talk about next.

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.430
Which is, let's
actually talk about--

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:34.403
turn these into practice,
and measuring inequality.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.610
And I'm going to back to
your basic income point

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.750
in a couple of minutes.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.220
So let's talk about actually
measuring inequality.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.690
And the reason
we're going to talk

00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.065
about this, because
it highlights

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:50.365
how important this issue is.

00:21:50.365 --> 00:21:51.740
So let's go to
some facts-- these

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:56.010
are from my textbook from 1441.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:57.465
So go to Figure 21-2.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.110
Ignore the last row for second,
focus on the first five rows.

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:07.290
What the first five
rows show is the percent

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:11.550
of income received by each
quintile, or each fifth,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.680
of the income distribution.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.590
In other words, each
row is 20% of people.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:18.980
So the first row is the
poorest 20% of people,

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.290
the next row is the second
poorest 20% of people,

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.080
and so on.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.780
The numbers in each
cell are the share

00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:27.505
of income held by that quintile.

00:22:27.505 --> 00:22:29.380
In other words, if the
distribution of income

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.977
was totally equal, every one
of these numbers would be 20.

00:22:31.977 --> 00:22:33.810
If distribution of
income was totally equal,

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:35.237
every quintile would have 20.

00:22:35.237 --> 00:22:37.320
But in fact, that's never
been true in any society

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:38.773
ever in history--

00:22:38.773 --> 00:22:40.690
the richest always have
more than the poorest.

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.440
We have no perfect
distribution of income.

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.920
And you see that if
you look at in 1967,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.460
when these data first
are reliably collected,

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:50.950
you see that the highest
20% of individuals

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.140
had about 10 times as
much as the lowest 20%.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:59.780
That there was a
lot of inequality.

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.720
Now, if you roll
forward till about 1980,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.060
that gap was shrinking.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.970
So you saw that the highest
20% share was about fixed,

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.000
but the lowest 20% was rising.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.620
But then, if you
look since 1980,

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.220
that gap has widened enormously.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.680
To the point now
where the 2013 is

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.140
the latest here, but the
facts haven't really changed--

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:24.710
the richest 20% of Americans
earn more than half the income

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:25.790
in America.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.100
And the poorest 20%
earn only about 3%

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:29.690
of the income in America.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:34.790
So inequality has widened
massively in the US.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.450
How does that put us
in international terms?

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:41.330
And I'm sorry, and the last row
was the share of the top 5%--

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:42.680
this is particular striking.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.165
In fact, go to the
next page-- this

00:23:44.165 --> 00:23:46.748
is a graph of the share
of the top 1% of income

00:23:46.748 --> 00:23:47.540
holders in America.

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.900
So this is the share of
income held by the 1% richest

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:51.980
Americans.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.220
You can see that in the
early 20th century, that

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:57.170
was pretty high, almost 20%.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:00.500
It then fell down about
10% by the early 1970s.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.650
It's now up-- and by the
latest date, up to about 25%.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:06.210
It's higher than it was at
the beginning of 20th century.

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:08.870
So the 1% of richest
Americans have about 25%

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.760
of the income earned in society.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.280
So it's extremely unequal
income distribution.

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.870
Once again, not
saying bad or good--

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:16.203
I'm making a positive statement.

00:24:16.203 --> 00:24:18.140
Unequal is irrefutable.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:19.887
Bad or good, we'll get to.

00:24:19.887 --> 00:24:22.220
But it's irrefutable a very
unequal income distribution.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:25.370
It's also irrefutable, we have
a much more unequal distribution

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.330
of income than the
rest of the world.

00:24:27.330 --> 00:24:30.350
So Figure 21-4, we compare
the facts for the US

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.762
to the rest of
the OECD, which is

00:24:31.762 --> 00:24:32.970
a set of developed economies.

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.134
Yeah?

00:24:34.134 --> 00:24:36.707
AUDIENCE: Is this before
or after income tax?

00:24:36.707 --> 00:24:38.290
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's a great point.

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.300
This all before tax, before tax.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.230
But if anything,
if you add taxes,

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.820
it makes us look even worse
relative to other countries,

00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:46.500
because our tax are
less progressive

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.570
than other countries.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.680
This is before tax
and before transfers.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:52.980
So if you look at other--

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.990
so this list is
a lot of numbers.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:56.500
Look at the bottom line.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:00.300
The bottom line is the average
across all non-US countries

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:02.970
of the share of income held
by each part of the income

00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:04.170
distribution.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.780
And the next to bottom line,
and the bottom line is the US.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.500
So we say the bottom 10%
of income distribution,

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:13.530
on average across these
countries, has 3% of income.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.130
Indeed, nowhere
except for Mexico

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:20.820
is the number lower
than the 1.6% in the US.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:24.000
Likewise, you look at the
top 10% of income earners,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.520
on average across
these countries,

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.290
they earn 25% of the income.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:30.000
In the US, it's 30%.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.090
And indeed, nowhere is the
number higher than in--

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:35.670
except in Mexico and Turkey.

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:39.910
So we are the most unequal
country, except for Mexico,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.010
on this list.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:46.190
Once again, not saying good
or bad, just saying the facts.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:49.990
We're going to come to how
we think about good or bad.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:51.910
So those are the facts
about inequality.

00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:53.680
But as the question
here pointed out,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.200
it's not clear we
care about inequality.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.520
Indeed, in a standard
economic framework,

00:25:58.520 --> 00:25:59.770
I don't care about inequality.

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:02.440
My utility is a function
of my consumption, not

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.307
your consumption.

00:26:04.307 --> 00:26:06.890
Sustainable economic framework,
I don't care about inequality,

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:08.990
I just care about what I have.

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.980
And that speaks more to the
commodity egalitarianism view.

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.640
Which is, how are we doing in
making sure people have enough

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.350
to live?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.660
And to do that, we
say, we move from--

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.760
so when we talk
about inequality,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:33.620
inequality is a measure
of relative distribution.

00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:37.770
Want to move to something which
is the measure of absolute--

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:41.850
absolute income, and that's
what we call the poverty line.

00:26:44.675 --> 00:26:46.300
The poverty line in
the US is a measure

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:49.920
of absolute deprivation--

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:54.330
what share of Americans are
earning less than some minimum

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:56.740
standard they need to live?

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.930
Now, you can immediately
see the problem.

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.020
With inequality, it's
unit free, right?

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.935
I simply compare
dollars to dollars.

00:27:03.935 --> 00:27:06.310
Once I start going here, I
have to make a judgment, which

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.870
is, what is deprivation?

00:27:07.870 --> 00:27:09.850
What do you need to live?

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:13.002
So in substance, this
makes more sense--

00:27:13.002 --> 00:27:14.710
absolutely makes more
sense, in substance

00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:15.910
it makes more sense
to think about,

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:17.285
do people have
enough to live on?

00:27:17.285 --> 00:27:18.880
But it is more
difficult, because you

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.560
have to draw a judgment
about what it is.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.290
So the judgment we've drawn is
what's called the poverty line.

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:26.830
The poverty line was
invented by a civil servant

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:29.632
in the 1960s, Molly Orshansky.

00:27:29.632 --> 00:27:31.840
She said, well, what does
it take to live in America?

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:34.132
She said, well, the typical
person spends about a third

00:27:34.132 --> 00:27:37.280
of their budget on
food in the 1960s.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.960
So let's cost out the cost of
a nutritionally adequate bundle

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.190
of food, multiplied by it three,
and call that the poverty line.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.830
She did that, and that's
still the poverty line.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:50.310
All we've done is taken that
and updated it by inflation.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:52.690
Remember, we talked about
the CPI, the inflation rate?

00:27:52.690 --> 00:27:54.940
All we've done is taken Molly
Orshansky's poverty line

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.290
and updated it by
inflation ever since.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.500
And what do we get?

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.380
Well, if you look
at table 21-5, this

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.810
shows you the poverty
line in the US today.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.330
It varies by family size,
because you need more resources

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.380
with a bigger family.

00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:10.770
But not one to one, because
of economies of scale

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:12.023
in the household.

00:28:12.023 --> 00:28:13.440
You don't need
twice as much money

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.940
to have a household
with two people,

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.070
because you still only
need one living unit,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.687
you can share
cookware, you only have

00:28:19.687 --> 00:28:21.270
to heat-- heating
for two people isn't

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:23.728
much more expensive than heating
for one person, et cetera.

00:28:23.728 --> 00:28:26.400
So there's economies of
scale within the household.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.230
So the poverty line
does not go up--

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:29.700
does not double
with every person,

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.300
does not double you go from one
to two-- it less than doubles.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.890
And you could see this scale--

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.260
essentially we say that--

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.900
this is 2015, so
it's higher now--

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:42.180
but basically says
that one person

00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:45.660
with income below $11,170
is living in poverty.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.390
And a family of four,
it's about $24,250.

00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:54.190
So it basically says, a
family below $25,000--

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:59.170
a family of four below
$25,000, is living in poverty.

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:04.010
Now is that the right number?

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.050
Well-- yeah?

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.487
AUDIENCE: Is it different
based on where in the country

00:29:06.487 --> 00:29:07.050
you live?

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:08.410
JONATHAN GRUBER: There's a
number of reasons it might not

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.370
be the right number.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.843
First of all, it does not differ
based on where in the country

00:29:10.843 --> 00:29:11.343
you live.

00:29:11.343 --> 00:29:14.410
So if you are-- you guys don't
know because you're sheltered--

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.080
but if you right now
tried to take $25,000

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.510
and go live in Boston,
there's no way.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:21.453
I mean, it's just,
like, impossible.

00:29:21.453 --> 00:29:22.870
Whereas, in rural
Mississippi, you

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:25.230
can probably do OK on $25,000.

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.640
But it doesn't vary by area.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:31.685
It doesn't vary-- also the
poverty line calculation is all

00:29:31.685 --> 00:29:33.310
messed up now, because
when she did it,

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.050
food was a third of
people's budgets.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:36.880
It's now more like 20%
of people's budgets.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.140
It's fallen enormously.

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.870
And the other elements that
poor people have to pay,

00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:43.480
notably housing and medical
care, have gone up much faster.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.370
The poverty line hasn't
accounted for that.

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.250
So in fact, there's
lots of reasons

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:49.930
that this line is problematic.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.540
Nonetheless, it's very
hard to change it.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.870
Indeed, I was in the US
government for 14 months,

00:29:55.870 --> 00:30:00.010
and I only went to one
super duper secret meeting.

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.770
I went to a lot of meetings with
the president, stuff like that.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.480
But one time, my secretary
said, there's a meeting,

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:06.022
and I can't tell
you what it's about,

00:30:06.022 --> 00:30:07.900
and I can't even
tell you where it is.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.275
When the time comes, they will
come get you and bring you

00:30:10.275 --> 00:30:10.960
there.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.060
I was like, Jesus,
it's nuclear war.

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.597
Like, what the hell?

00:30:14.597 --> 00:30:16.930
So they brought me to this
room, we're all in this room.

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:17.620
I'm like, what's going on?

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:20.320
They're like, we need to discuss
revising the poverty line.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.670
I'm like, what?

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.530
Well, why is it super secret?

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.670
Because the US today distributes
more than a $1 trillion a year

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:29.660
based on the poverty line.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:33.650
So any changes you make is going
to create winners and losers.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.760
And the losers are
going to be really mad.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.010
And as a result, it's been
incredibly hard to change

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.795
the poverty line.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:41.170
Because for example,
let's say we

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:43.600
change it to recognize the
fact that it should be higher

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.920
in New York than Mississippi.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.503
Well, that means New
Yorkers would win

00:30:46.503 --> 00:30:47.950
and Mississippians would lose.

00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.150
Bad news, politically.

00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.180
New Yorkers would be
happy, Mississippians

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.600
would be sad, but because of
diminishing marginal utility,

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.160
and the laws of politics,
the guys who are sad

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:56.240
make more noise than
the guys who are happy.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:57.865
So it's very, very
hard to change this,

00:30:57.865 --> 00:31:00.190
despite its
problematic features.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:02.265
Nonetheless, it's still
a useful benchmark.

00:31:02.265 --> 00:31:03.890
It is useful that
it's fixed over time,

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:05.682
because it allows us
to essentially see how

00:31:05.682 --> 00:31:07.150
things have evolved over time.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.360
And we can see that
in Figure 21-6.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.340
This shows the poverty
rate over time.

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:19.070
And it shows it for
everybody, that's the red.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.220
It shows it for the
elderly, that's the blue.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:24.380
For kids, that's the green.

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.230
And for non-elderly
adults, that's the yellow.

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.980
So what do we see?

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.063
We see a couple of things.

00:31:29.063 --> 00:31:32.360
First of all, for every
group, poverty fell enormously

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.370
during the 1960s.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.280
That's the so-called
war on poverty,

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.720
which used a number
of social programs

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:42.650
that lowered poverty
enormously during the 1960s.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.020
For the elderly,
it kept going down.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.450
And the elderly went from
the most impoverished group

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:50.440
in society to the least.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.230
For kids, it bounced back up.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.230
And now kid poverty
rates are nearly as high

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.310
as they were back
in the early 1960s.

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:01.850
For the rest of folks, it sort
of went down then flattened.

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.010
Yeah?

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.502
AUDIENCE: How do you determined
how much wealth a kid has?

00:32:05.502 --> 00:32:07.710
JONATHAN GRUBER: It's based
on their family's income.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:08.820
This is not wealth, it's income.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.200
It's based on
their-- so basically,

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.242
when asked does a kid live
in poverty, it's like,

00:32:12.242 --> 00:32:15.840
do they live in a household
that's below the poverty line?

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.340
So the bottom line is--

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:19.192
think of it as
families with kids,

00:32:19.192 --> 00:32:20.650
is another way to
think about this.

00:32:20.650 --> 00:32:22.860
The bottom line is,
essentially, poverty

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.120
hasn't done a whole lot.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:28.507
We haven't done a whole lot on
poverty in the last 50 years.

00:32:28.507 --> 00:32:30.840
We sort of lowered a lot in
the '60s, and then it's been

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.740
bounced up and down, but
it's been pretty flat--

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.480
is the result there.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.963
Now, the bottom line is--

00:32:39.963 --> 00:32:41.380
now my take, now
I'm going to draw

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.200
a judgment-- my take is, along
either of these dimensions,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.790
we don't look so hot.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.800
We're the most unequal
nation the world.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.210
And we have-- still, if
you look at all people,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.030
we have 15% of our people
living below some standard

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.070
of absolute deprivation.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.590
Literally saying, we are
accepting that 15% of people

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.180
America cannot afford to live.

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:07.260
We are accepting that,
including more than 20% of kids.

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.420
So I don't think
we're doing that well.

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:13.444
But in some sense, this is
even the most-- yeah, go ahead.

00:33:13.444 --> 00:33:17.200
AUDIENCE: 18 to 64 people,
are those single people?

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.603
Because I imagine
kids would fall into--

00:33:19.603 --> 00:33:22.020
JONATHAN GRUBER: I mean, that's
like the average of all 18

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.510
to 64, including those
that have kids and don't.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:27.610
So like a child at the age of
64, that would come down more.

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:30.020
It's just the average.

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:32.750
Now, this is a striking set
of facts, but not to my mind

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:34.090
the most striking.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.432
Probably the most striking
fact that probably-- probably

00:33:36.432 --> 00:33:38.390
the fact that has seen
the most influence on me

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:43.198
in the last 10 years is
shown in Figure 21-7.

00:33:43.198 --> 00:33:45.740
This is a figure put together
in the wake of the Freddie Gray

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.587
riots in Baltimore.

00:33:46.587 --> 00:33:48.170
You may have heard
about those, that's

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.320
when a prisoner was beat to
death in the back of a police

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.430
van.

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:55.670
And he was from the
area of Sandtown--

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.580
Sandtown, Winchester,
which is a super bad area.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.920
Think The Wire-- if you've
seen The Wire, super bad area

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.770
of Baltimore.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.159
About 3 miles away is an
area called Roland Park,

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:11.340
which is a very rich area.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:16.590
The average life expectancy
in Roland Park is 84 years.

00:34:16.590 --> 00:34:18.670
That's above the US average.

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:20.219
That's pretty good.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:23.580
The average life
expectancy 3 miles away

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:28.460
is 67 years, which
is below North Korea.

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.659
And what it was around
World War II in the US.

00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:36.860
3 miles, and we got
a 17-year difference

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.210
in the average life expectancy.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.350
What's going on?

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.270
Well, what you'd expect.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:43.980
People are way poor.

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:47.219
In Sandtown, the average
income is $107,000--

00:34:47.219 --> 00:34:49.320
I'm sorry, Roland
Park is $107,000,

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:51.630
and Sandtown is $24,000--
the average income is

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:53.850
below the poverty line.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:57.240
In Roland Park, 2.5% of
kids live in poverty.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:01.520
In Sandtown, it's 55% of kids.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.018
So basically, you have
incredible inequality

00:35:05.018 --> 00:35:05.810
in short distances.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:07.670
To me, this is striking,
because it really

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:11.600
brings home inequality
by putting it

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.640
in such sort of close
geographic terms.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.260
So we have a lot of inequality.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.330
There's no question.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:20.100
And it certainly motivates--

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.510
I think it's hard to
look at facts like this,

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.240
regardless of your
political stripe,

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.273
and not worry, not
at least worry,

00:35:27.273 --> 00:35:29.940
and consider the fact that there
may be some role for government

00:35:29.940 --> 00:35:32.390
redistribution.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:35.900
But that's not the
end of the discussion.

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:39.470
This in some sense-- think
of this part of the lecture

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.820
as the benefits of
government redistribution.

00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.528
The benefits of
government redistribution

00:35:43.528 --> 00:35:46.100
is we have incredible
inequality, incredible poverty,

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.678
all around the country.

00:35:47.678 --> 00:35:49.220
Now, we have to
come-- but of course,

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.870
in economics, nothing free.

00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:54.500
Now we have to come to the
costs of redistribution.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.270
The benefits are clear.

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.890
What about the costs?

00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:02.060
And so now we have to
talk about the efficiency

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.120
costs, or the leakage.

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:12.960
Efficiency costs--
costs of redistribution.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.120
Or in other words, how
big is the leakage?

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:19.075
So going back to Okun, I hope
that these figures inspire

00:36:19.075 --> 00:36:21.450
you to think we out to be
putting some money into buckets

00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.280
and giving it to poor people.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.230
But now the question
is, should we?

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:26.280
What if it all leaks out?

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.960
How leaky is the bucket?

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.810
And that's what we
need to talk about now.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:36.130
And basically, leakages in the
bucket come from three sources.

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:40.390
The first and least important
source is administrative costs.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.122
Literally got to pay
someone to carry the bucket.

00:36:43.122 --> 00:36:45.080
So if you put a dollar
in and carry the bucket,

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.320
he's going to take
some money out

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.862
for the right of
carrying the bucket.

00:36:47.862 --> 00:36:50.070
That's small, but non-trivial.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:53.050
Maybe low single digits.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:58.780
The second source of leakage
is the efficiency costs

00:36:58.780 --> 00:36:59.290
of taxation.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:10.390
If you tax people and
take their money away,

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.195
they may work less hard.

00:37:13.195 --> 00:37:15.320
Think about the extreme
case, where I'm at to say--

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.550
I'm going to go back to
the utilitarian world,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:19.520
I'm going to tell everyone,
we're going to equalize income.

00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:22.400
That means that everyone,
no matter what they make,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.910
example, the same
amount of money.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.035
Why would you work?

00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:27.910
I mean, you guys would,
because you're tools.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:33.250
But why would
regular people work?

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.240
They wouldn't.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.080
Because no matter
what you do, you

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:36.370
end up with the same income.

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:37.840
It's 100% tax.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.950
So why would you work?

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:40.030
And that's extreme,
but the point

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:41.655
is, the extreme
example makes the point

00:37:41.655 --> 00:37:43.300
that when you tax
people, there's

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.800
potential efficiency
costs, in terms

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.910
of them earning less income.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:55.020
The third issue is the
efficiency costs of transfers.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:03.410
Which is when you
give people money,

00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:06.310
and when you give people
money, they may also work less.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.510
So not only might I work
less when you tax me,

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:10.430
I might work less if
you give me money.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.490
Why should I go to work if
you're sending me a check?

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:15.560
So not only would equal
distribution of income

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.080
lead me to work less
because I'm being taxed,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.470
leading me to work less
because I'm getting money.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.260
So why should I bother working?

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:22.400
As long as leisure is a
normal good, remember?

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.000
I don't want to work.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.850
So if you're just sending me
money, why would I go to work?

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:31.130
So to see this, we
can sort of summarize

00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:33.300
this with one example.

00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:37.280
So let's go to Figure 21-8,
and I want to walk through--

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.710
it's a fairly complicated
example-- let's walk through--

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:43.040
this a simple illustration
of a tax and transfer scheme

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.010
of the type we have in America.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:51.890
We start in this example with an
individual earning $20 an hour.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:54.270
So the slope of this line
is negative $20 an hour.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:56.550
This person can work--

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:59.050
and remember, we don't model
work, we model leisure.

00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:00.280
I almost made the mistake.

00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:02.490
Remember, we don't model
the bad, we model the good.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.010
We don't model labor,
we model leisure.

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.715
Let's say that the max leisure
you can take is 2,000 hours.

00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:11.590
So you can either take
2,000 hours of leisure

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:15.930
and consume nothing, or
you could take no leisure

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:17.310
and consume 40,000.

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:20.510
Let's say consumption is income,
no savings in this model.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:24.910
So you earn $20 an hour, you
consume your whole income,

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.830
and you can take up to
2,000 hours of leisure.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:32.400
So your budget constraint is the
dark line running from 40,000

00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.210
on the y-axis,
2,000 on the x-axis.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.940
Now, let's say that
we're going to put in,

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:42.100
into this budget constraint,
we're going to add two things.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.210
The first is a transfer
program to the poor.

00:39:45.210 --> 00:39:47.240
We're worried about poverty.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.990
So we're going to have
a new program, that

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:54.615
says that every American
gets at least $10,000.

00:39:54.615 --> 00:39:57.270
Everybody gets $10,000.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:01.440
But as their income goes up,
we're going to take that away.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:04.288
So we're going to say, since
we have a transfer program,

00:40:04.288 --> 00:40:06.330
the transfer program is
going to be of the form--

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:11.900
the transfer you get
is the max of 0 comma

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:15.790
10,000 minus your income.

00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:17.120
That's our transfer program.

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:20.130
So if your income is
0, you get 10,000.

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:21.880
If your income is
10,000, you get zero.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.850
We're just making sure
everybody gets $10,000.

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:25.850
We don't care about people
having more and that,

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:26.700
so we're going take it away.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.242
We're going to say, look, want
to make sure you have $10,000,

00:40:29.242 --> 00:40:31.910
but above that, we
don't care about you.

00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:33.570
So if you're someone
earning $100,000,

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.130
this program's irrelevant.

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:37.570
If you're someone
earning $5,000,

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:42.320
we'll give you another $5,000
to get you up to $10,000.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.060
So that's based on
a transfer program.

00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:45.920
This is typically the
way welfare programs

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:47.895
work around the world.

00:40:47.895 --> 00:40:49.270
Essentially, they
give you money,

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:51.550
but then they take it
away as you get richer,

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:54.670
to make sure the money is
targeted to the poorest people.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.050
So that's our transfer program.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:59.290
That's the first thing
it's going to do.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:01.470
The second thing-- we've
got a transfer program,

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:03.180
but we've got to pay for this.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.003
To pay for this, we
have to have a tax.

00:41:05.003 --> 00:41:06.420
Now, let's say we
only want to tax

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.620
the rich-- you don't
want to tax the poor,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.078
you want to give
money to the poor.

00:41:09.078 --> 00:41:12.540
So let's say our tax program
is of the following form--

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.460
anyone making more
than $20,000 per year

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.570
pays a 20% tax rate on
the income above $20,000.

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:23.130
So no one's taxed on
the first $20,000.

00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:25.610
But on every dollar
above $20,000,

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.320
you pay $0.20 to the government.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.240
It's what's called
a marginal tax.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.500
You have a marginal
tax rate of 20%.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.500
What does marginal mean?

00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:39.050
It means you only pay
on the next dollar.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:44.730
So it's a marginal tax
rate of 20% above $20k.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:48.380
OK, so once you earn $20k,
of $20k, you pay nothing.

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:51.650
Once you've earned $20k,
on every dollar above $20k,

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:53.750
you face a marginal
tax rate of 20%.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:58.210
You pay $0.20 of every
dollar of the government.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:00.288
So that is our tax program.

00:42:00.288 --> 00:42:01.330
Now, look at the diagram.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:03.205
Do people understand
how these programs work?

00:42:03.205 --> 00:42:04.300
Forgetting the diagram.

00:42:04.300 --> 00:42:05.516
Yeah, Manny?

00:42:05.516 --> 00:42:07.910
AUDIENCE: In other
countries, is there

00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:11.480
any other data to show how this
affects the number of hours

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:12.040
people work?

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:14.950
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
exactly what we're getting to.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:16.300
That's our concern, right?

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.550
Is that that's my point here,
is that this might lower

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.778
how many hours people work.

00:42:19.778 --> 00:42:20.820
And let's talk about why.

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.112
But the question about the
logistics of these programs,

00:42:23.112 --> 00:42:23.860
first.

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.860
Let's talk about how it
affect the hours worked.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:29.820
Let's go to the diagram.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:31.770
Let's go to the diagram.

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:33.990
Let's consider several
different people.

00:42:33.990 --> 00:42:40.230
Start with person
A. Person A earned--

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.720
before this program
was in place,

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.510
they would have chosen to be a
high leisure, low consumption

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.295
person.

00:42:47.295 --> 00:42:51.100
When this program's in place
we tell them, look, person A,

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:56.230
you can get more of both, more
leisure and more consumption,

00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:58.440
all you have to do is quit.

00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.670
Stop working.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.360
You move from
point A to point D.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.880
You get more leisure
and more consumption.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.800
So that naturally happens.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.280
So everyone earning less than
$10,000, immediately quits.

00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.320
Once again, assuming
leisure is the normal good.

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.410
Immediately quits because look,
once you're below $10,000,

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:16.970
it's 100% tax rate.

00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:18.710
Why work?

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:22.017
So anyone who would have earned
less than $10,000 doesn't work.

00:43:22.017 --> 00:43:24.350
Because you're just going to
give back to the government

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:26.210
anyway, why do you care?

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:28.130
That's person A.
What about person B?

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.690
Person B earns
more than $10,000.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:35.200
But note, their
indifference curve

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.948
crosses below the new
budget constraint.

00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.740
Let me step back, the
new budget constraint

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.470
is the red segments plus the
black segment in the middle.

00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:46.110
New budget constraint runs
from $32,000 on the y-axis,

00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:48.480
it intersects the black line,
the old budget constraint

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.220
at $20,000.

00:43:50.220 --> 00:43:53.760
It's the old budget constraint
from $20,000 down to $10,000,

00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.218
and it becomes the
new red segment.

00:43:55.218 --> 00:43:56.218
I should mentioned that.

00:43:56.218 --> 00:43:58.500
So the budget constraint
is the two red segments

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:00.450
and the black
segment in between.

00:44:00.450 --> 00:44:02.290
That's the new
budget constraint.

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:06.970
So let's look at person B. What
happens to person B and why?

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:08.150
What does person B do?

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.650
Yeah?

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:09.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:10.525
JONATHAN GRUBER: Why?

00:44:10.525 --> 00:44:12.640
AUDIENCE: Because it's
a higher [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.950
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right,
crucially, since person

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.400
B never crosses the
red line, we know

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.480
they must be better off at
point D than at point B.

00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:25.870
Because we know that since point
D is above that line, that's

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:28.870
a higher indifference curve
than they're on at point B.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.600
So not only do you cause every
person below $10,000 to quit,

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:34.930
you also cause some people
above $10,000 to quit.

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:35.570
Why?

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.237
Well, they give up a
little consumption,

00:44:37.237 --> 00:44:38.547
but they get a ton of leisure.

00:44:38.547 --> 00:44:40.380
So let's say someone
is at $11,000, $12,000,

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:42.710
like, wait a second,
all my work is only

00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:44.460
getting me $1,000 or
$2,000 over quitting.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.880
I might as well quit.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.958
So this welfare program causes
a ton of people to quit.

00:44:48.958 --> 00:44:51.000
All the people who were
going to earn very little

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.458
quit, and some people who are
going to earn somewhat little

00:44:53.458 --> 00:44:55.678
quit.

00:44:55.678 --> 00:44:56.470
But that's not all.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:45:00.650
Let's look at person
C. Person C used

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:02.330
to work a certain
amount-- you know,

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.420
used to work more
than 1,000 hours.

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.390
Take less than 1,000
hours of leisure.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:12.010
Now what happens,
well what happens--

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.840
forget the diagram, step back.

00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:17.590
If I take someone and
choose a marginal tax rate,

00:45:17.590 --> 00:45:21.530
what happens to their
labor supply and why?

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:23.240
What happens to their
leisure and why?

00:45:25.870 --> 00:45:27.110
So I take you.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.180
You're working--
let's say you're

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.410
taking 800 hours of
leisure, doesn't matter what

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:33.770
the exact number was.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.710
I then come and save
you have a 20% tax rate

00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:37.930
on every earnings above $20,000.

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:42.725
How does that
affect your leisure?

00:45:42.725 --> 00:45:43.225
Yeah?

00:45:43.225 --> 00:45:45.400
AUDIENCE: Might as
well increase it.

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:47.380
JONATHAN GRUBER: You
would increase it, why?

00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.865
AUDIENCE: Because
then above $10,000,

00:45:50.865 --> 00:45:52.240
I guess you would
get less money,

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.447
but I guess maybe less
utility above $10k,

00:45:54.447 --> 00:45:56.530
because you're going to
give it to the government?

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:58.155
JONATHAN GRUBER: You
might increase it.

00:45:58.155 --> 00:45:59.450
But what might else you do?

00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.950
Yeah?

00:45:59.950 --> 00:46:01.660
AUDIENCE: The wage
effectively decreases,

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:03.370
so the price of
leisure decreases.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:04.958
So you take more of it?

00:46:04.958 --> 00:46:07.000
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right,
I think that you increase

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.580
leisure, that's what he said.

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.390
OK, increased leisure,
but what else?

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.960
Yeah?

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:14.008
AUDIENCE: Might increase
it just to cover taxes,

00:46:14.008 --> 00:46:14.800
so you might work--

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.080
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, what
do we call the two effects?

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.400
AUDIENCE: Oh, your
income and substitution.

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly,
we have substitution income

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:20.890
effects.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:25.090
The substitution effect, let's
say your net wage is lower,

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:29.920
your net wage just went from $20
an hour to $16 an hour, right?

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.110
So a lower net
wage, you work less,

00:46:32.110 --> 00:46:34.600
but the income effect
says, you work more.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.860
Because you're now
effectively poorer.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.480
When you're poorer, you
consume less of everything,

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.780
including leisure.

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:48.710
So when you tax my wage, I
might take less leisure, i.e.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:52.260
work more, through the
substitution effect--

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:56.580
I'm sorry, we tax my wage, I
might take more leisure, i.e.

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:59.100
work less, through the
substitution effect,

00:46:59.100 --> 00:47:01.450
because the returns
to work are lower.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.530
But I might take less
leisure, i.e. work more,

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.500
because I'm now poorer.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.700
So we don't know
what's going to happen.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.370
But we typically assume
substitution effects dominate.

00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:13.680
You can't go wrong in this class
without making that assumption.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.470
We want you remember
the trade-off--

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:17.470
but typically, some
substitute effects dominate.

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.750
So we typically think
people will work less.

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.420
We think taxing people will
cause them to work less.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:25.212
But be clear, it's
not obvious it will.

00:47:25.212 --> 00:47:26.920
But we typically think
that's the result.

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.337
And typically, once again,
when you average men and women,

00:47:29.337 --> 00:47:31.600
as we discussed in our labor
supply lecture, overall,

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.910
you get an upward slope
in labor supply curve.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:38.220
That is overall if you
tax people that work less.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:42.150
So what that does, it lowers
the hours of work for person C.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.450
This is our leaks in the bucket.

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:47.420
We've suddenly massively
reduced the amount, potentially

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:50.840
massively, reduced the amount
people who want to work.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.010
Why do we care?

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:55.350
We care because a Figure 21-9.

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.800
What have we done?

00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.810
We've gone from an initial
point where people initially

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:05.010
had initial supply curve of
S1, and demand curve of D.

00:48:05.010 --> 00:48:08.700
And therefore, we're
supplying L1 hours of labor

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.470
at a wage, W1.

00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:13.920
Now they're producing less--
their supply curve shifts in.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:17.320
That's created a
deadweight loss.

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:21.250
There is less stuff
being produced,

00:48:21.250 --> 00:48:24.850
because people are staying
home rather than working.

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:26.642
And the key point is,
that's not a problem.

00:48:26.642 --> 00:48:28.975
Staying home rather than
[INAUDIBLE] is not the problem.

00:48:28.975 --> 00:48:31.810
The problem is, they're
staying home only because we've

00:48:31.810 --> 00:48:34.840
reduced the price of labor.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.580
We've increased
the price-- we've

00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:38.290
reduced the price of
leisure, I'm sorry.

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:40.270
We've reduced the
return to labor,

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.440
reduced the price of leisure.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.480
As a result, people
are staying home.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.460
We've distorted their behavior.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.430
We've caused them to
stay home and not work.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.410
We cause them to stay
home and not work,

00:48:49.410 --> 00:48:51.270
there's less stuff
for the rest of us.

00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:53.840
So it's a deadweight loss.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:55.580
Efficiency falls.

00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.130
And that is the efficiency
equity trade-off.

00:48:58.130 --> 00:49:01.370
This deadweight
loss is Okun's leak.

00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:04.600
That's the leak
it Okun's bucket.

00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.820
So now we have the trade-off.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.510
On the one hand, we have an
incredibly unequal society,

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.010
where a program like this can
really make people better off.

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.927
Take money from rich
people who don't need it,

00:49:13.927 --> 00:49:15.298
give it to poor people who do.

00:49:15.298 --> 00:49:16.840
On the other hand,
in doing so, we're

00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:18.860
going to have less
stuff as a society.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:21.220
We're going to shrink
the size of the pie

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:23.950
in order to redistribute
the slices of the pie.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:25.540
Is it worth it?

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:28.090
That's where the social
welfare function comes in.

00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:29.800
The social welfare
function allows

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.350
you to evaluate whether
something like this

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:33.220
is worth it.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.637
Without a social
welfare function,

00:49:34.637 --> 00:49:36.100
you can never answer
that question.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.540
You just can't, because there's
one hand and the other hand.

00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:39.520
What the social
welfare function does

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.890
is give you a mathematical
representation that allows

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:42.790
you to answer that question.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:44.290
So in section on
Friday, you'll work

00:49:44.290 --> 00:49:46.750
through an example of
using a social welfare

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:50.380
function to evaluate a welfare
transfer program like this.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.640
And they'll come back on Monday
and talk more about taxation.

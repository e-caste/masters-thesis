00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.750
PROFESSOR: That I know of that
derives two-dimensional

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.810
symmetries.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.340
And so, what I will give you
instead is a set of notes--

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.140
nothing fancy, just
handwritten--

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.680
but which will carry out each of
the derivations in detail,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.500
so you'll have something to
fall back on if it seems

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.330
overly complicated.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.280
Any questions on what we've
done to this point?

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.740
We've really set forth the
ground rules and components of

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.970
our final step.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.700
And that, as I mentioned
earlier, is to combine one or

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.860
more of these collections of
symmetry elements around a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.770
fixed point in space, with one
of the five two-dimensional

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.030
lattices that can accommodate
them.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.400
And when we find a successful,
feasible combination, we will

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:08.060
have derived something that we
could call the two-dimensional

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:15.515
crystallographic space groups.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.120
These are collections of
operations which really pick

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.870
up everything-- the
whole space--

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.810
move it, tumble it end over end,
and throw it back down

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.350
into coincidence with itself.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.450
So hence the term space group,
rather than point group, where

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.265
it's only a point that's left
invariant at worst.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.590
OK, so what we're going to do
then is to take each of the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.460
point groups in turn, and
combine each of them, when

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.370
possible, with one of the
five lattice types.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:57.520
And I remind you that those
are the oblique lattice or

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.770
parallelogram lattice.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.740
And this was what was required
by two and one,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.990
no symmetry at all.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:28.970
Then there was the primitive
rectangular net, and the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.160
symmetry element that required
that was a mirror plane, or we

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.820
could have, depending on how the
mirror plane was aligned

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.670
relative to the translation, we
could also have a lattice

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.790
that was non-primitive,
a double cell.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.300
And that was a centered
rectangular net.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.900
And either of those
was compatible

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.590
with a mirror plane.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.400
Then we had a square cell--

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.770
square net or square cell-- and
that was what was required

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.440
by a 4-fold axis.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:12.320
And then the hexagonal net, and
that could be required by

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.360
either a 3-fold or a 6-fold.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.260
Well, if you add up the number
of point groups that we've

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.980
listed here, there are only
six, but there are 10

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.120
crystallographic point groups.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.850
So what about the ones that we
have not yet considered adding

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.676
to a lattice, and these are
the nets of the form Cnv.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.130
So let's consider, in turn, each
of those point groups and

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.680
see what they would require
of the lattice that could

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.340
accommodate them.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.900
But let's do 2MM first.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.610
2MM, the 2 is compatible
with an oblique net.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.990
The mirror plane wants either
a rectangular net or a

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.860
centered rectangular net.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.450
So all we can do is to add
this to a rectangular or

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.930
centered rectangular net.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.600
Let's put a 2-fold axis
at the lattice point.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.120
The mirror plane has to be
aligned along the edge of a

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.100
rectangular net.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.710
If there are two of them, you
just put one along each of the

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.960
edges of the rectangular net.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.850
A mirror plane in a net could
either go in like this, or

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.490
could go, for the centered
net, in like this.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.040
So what we're saying, 2-fold
doesn't care, add a mirror

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.420
plane, it means that
the parallelogram

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.270
has to become a rectangle.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.470
You can put the two mirror
planes of 2MM in along the two

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.120
edges of the rectangle, or do
this equally well with a

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.840
centered rectangular net, put
the mirror plane in parallel

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:06.410
to the edges, just like we did
in CM, put the 2-fold axis in

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.760
at the lattice points.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.430
So there's a lattice point at
the corner, and also a lattice

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.340
point in the middle
of the cell.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:22.040
So for the rectangular net, we
could put in either M or 2MM

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.570
in both of these rectangular
nets, the

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.820
primitive and the centered.

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.650
4-fold access requires that
the net become still more

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.454
specialized and have the
shape of a square.

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:35.922
AUDIENCE: Professor?

00:05:35.922 --> 00:05:37.800
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.670
AUDIENCE: We can't
see on this side.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.800
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.790
I'll pace back and forth,
which I usually do.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.380
Then everybody will
get equal time.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.470
OK, so I'm glad you spoke up.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:56.270
4-fold axis requires
a square net.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:02.470
There are two mirror planes,
45 degrees apart, and those

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.610
mirror planes have to be
along the edges of

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:06.060
a rectangular net.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.260
Put one of them in this
orientation, and that surely

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.060
is along the edge of a
rectangular net, along the

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.800
edge of a net that's not only
rectangular but square.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.334
But it has a higher symmetry,
and that's fine.

00:06:19.334 --> 00:06:22.510
Looks as though this diagonal
mirror plane might cause

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.490
troubles, but let's note that
if we look at the diagonal

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:32.230
translations in this lattice,
that they will define a

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:35.940
centered rectangular net, so
putting the other mirror plane

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.100
in this way puts it along
the edge of a

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.550
centered rectangular net.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.200
So this mirror plane is
perfectly happy as well.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.110
So in the square lattice
we could pop either

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.960
symmetry 4 or 4MM.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.080
3-fold is an interesting one.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.290
That's the odd symmetry that
does strange things.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.810
Here is a hexagonal net,
and that's what

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.030
a 3-fold axis requires.

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:15.600
Two translations, identical in
magnitude, and in terms of

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:19.195
what goes on along them, in
exactly 120 degrees apart.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:28.300
Now, I don't readily see any
rectangle along the edge of

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.875
which I could align the
mirror plane in 3M.

00:07:31.875 --> 00:07:35.830
But it's the oblique shape of
this net that throws you off.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.130
Let's notice that if I draw
several unit cells side by

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:51.510
side, here is a double cell that
has a rectangular shape.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:53.940
OK?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.590
Take 2T1 plus T2 as one edge
of the cell, and leave the

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:05.610
other one as T2, and we have
defined a cell where that is

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.680
identically a 90-degree angle.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.000
So one of the mirror planes
of 3M could go in this

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.440
orientation, and the other one
would be 30 degrees away.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.570
So this would be the
orientation of

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:23.200
the two mirror planes.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:30.970
So we're putting in 3M with
M perpendicular to the

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:33.630
translations that define
the primitive hexagonal

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.270
cell, T1 and T2.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:44.540
But there's another
way you can do it.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.810
Let me draw the same net, the
same hexagonal net, and look

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:49.861
at a different kind
of double cell.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.590
OK, here's my hexagonal net, two
translations, T1 and T2,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:07.730
with a 3-fold axis at
the lattice point.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.880
And now I will again draw a
couple of extra cells--

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.650
double T1, and let's
double T2.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:35.420
And then let me point out that
I can put in the mirror plane

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:44.570
this way and along this way, and
here is a double cell, and

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:49.180
I can put the mirror
plane along this

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:51.370
direction and this direction.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.970
So this is crazy.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:04.510
This is the same lattice and
the same point group, but

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:08.120
there are two different ways I
can align the point group in

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:09.670
the lattice.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:13.320
I can put the mirror plane in
such that it's perpendicular

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.790
to a cell edge, or put the
mirror plane in 30 degrees

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.600
away from that orientation such
that it is along the edge

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:26.370
of a centric rectangular net.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:33.960
So I could add 3M as well with
the mirror plane aligned

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.800
parallel to the translations
in the net.

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.600
So lots of funny permutations
here.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.350
Here I have one symmetry
element, two different

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.300
lattices that I can
combine with it.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.920
Here I have one point group, 3M,
but two different ways in

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.990
which I can set it relative
to the edges of the cell.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:55.670
Yes?

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.446
AUDIENCE: Why are you putting
two mirror planes in each of

00:10:57.446 --> 00:10:58.514
those figures when you
really only could

00:10:58.514 --> 00:11:00.550
do one mirror plane?

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.640
PROFESSOR: Actually, I need--

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.990
well, there are going to be a
radiating sheaf of mirror

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.040
lines coming out of
that 3-fold axis.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.310
AUDIENCE: An angle
of 60 degrees.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.960
PROFESSOR: They are at an
angle of 60 degrees.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.710
It has to be 60 degrees,
and that is

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:15.000
indeed what I have here.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.780
I've just drawn part of 3M, and
if I draw the remaining

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:20.530
mirror planes, they
would do this.

00:11:32.266 --> 00:11:34.710
OK, I think that's fairly
intelligible.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.800
Another reason for notes is to
draw these diagrams when

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.900
they're reasonably complex.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:46.510
On a blackboard, when you're
rushing to get through it, is

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:49.030
something that's easier said
than done, even though you may

00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:52.380
have done it a number
of times.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.950
So there is the job that we've
laid out for ourselves.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:02.000
Five lattices, 10 point groups,
and we can drop each

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.380
of the point groups into one or
more of the lattices of the

00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:08.630
five that we have determined.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.830
As soon as we combine things,
we're going to have the

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:19.290
situation that we've
encountered before.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.950
In general, if I have an
operation number one that

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.800
produces one transformation of
coordinates, and combine it

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.370
with an operation number two
which has another change of

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.640
coordinates, there must
automatically

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.340
arise some third operation.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.040
And we can write it in terms of
the language of operators

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.230
by saying operation number one
followed by operation number

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.840
two is equivalent to an
operation number three.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.970
And in terms of the pattern,
this says that whenever you

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:54.250
throw two symmetry
transformations together, a

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.500
third one pops up.

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:57.490
You can't push it down.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:00.350
It's going to be there once
you add the first two

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.510
combinations.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.080
You may have to be really clever
to see where it is and

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.060
what it is, but it's
going to be there.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.020
It's going to be there.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.390
It comes in automatically.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:15.680
So this general class of
statement, this equality in

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.710
operations, is something that
I like to call, for short, a

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:19.960
combination theorem.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:25.140
And we've seen several examples
of this already,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.390
notably the one in the last hour
that said whenever you

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:33.080
combine two mirror lines at an
angle mu, you automatically

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.640
create, like it or not, a
rotation operation of a 2 mu.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.810
So as soon as we start making
these combinations, we're

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:47.610
going to find a new
operation arising.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.560
So let's start with
the simplest one.

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.300
Add a 1-fold axis to a
general oblique net.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:58.800
So there is T1, there is T2, we
don't put anything in it,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.580
it's just a simple array of
translations with lattice

00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.890
points that we can put at the
terminal point of these

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:07.160
translations.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.470
There's no symmetry.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:11.860
If we put in one atom, that atom
hangs on every lattice

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:17.035
point, and that's all
there is to it.

00:14:17.035 --> 00:14:20.960
It's so simple it's not only
uninteresting, it's ugly.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.740
It's just a simple atom arranged
in a periodic array.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:29.000
As with everything we've done
so far, it's convenient to

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.320
have a notation to indicate
which particular plane group

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.370
one has, and the symbol here
is to give side by side the

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:49.630
type of lattice as the first
part of the symbol, and then

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:51.793
the point group that
you have added.

00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:58.830
So what do we have here?

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:03.980
We've taken a primitive oblique
lattice, and we've

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:07.380
added no symmetry at
all, a 1-fold axis.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:12.390
And here people who have derived
symmetry theory assume

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.090
that the reader knows
something.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.990
And so you're going to get a lot
of respect when you show

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:21.250
your colleagues that you know
what this notation means.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.560
All you have to do, if you know
the symmetry, is to state

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.760
whether the lattice is
primitive, as it has to be for

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.880
an oblique net, or whether it's
centered, in the case of

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.150
the rectangular net.

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:35.020
Three dimensions is a lot
more complicated.

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.320
If the lattice is cubic, it
could be primitive, it could

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.760
be face-centered, it could
be body-centered.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.820
So you need a symbol that tells
the type of lattice.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:46.010
In this case it's primitive, and
the point group that we've

00:15:46.010 --> 00:15:49.820
added is 1, so this rather
boring ugly thing

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.070
here is called P1.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.150
Another bit of code.

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:59.190
We're going to do eventually
the same thing in three

00:15:59.190 --> 00:15:59.980
dimensions.

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.020
We're going to take just
a general oblique

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:05.000
three-dimensional lattice, and
not adorn it with any sort of

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.200
symmetry at all, and that
will also be called P1.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:14.470
But to distinguish the two,
capital P1 means a

00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:18.640
three-dimensional lattice, and
we won't be working with those

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.120
for a while.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.360
We haven't even enumerated
them.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.450
A lowercase p, that is
the symbol for a

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:32.320
two-dimensional net.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.200
In other words, a plane group
rather than a space group.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:42.980
So here's the first, P1, and it
really doesn't give shivers

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.060
running up and down my
spine to look at it.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.850
So let's do one that's a little
more interesting.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:54.830
Let's take a 2-fold axis and
combine it first with a

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:56.545
primitive rectangular net.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:06.190
I'm sorry, what am I saying?

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:07.440
I want an oblique net.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.359
So the symbol--

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:18.960
and I'm assuming this is going
to be unique, and we haven't

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:22.060
seen anything with a 2-fold
axis in it, so it is.

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.280
So this would be P for a
primitive lattice, 2 for the

00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:28.790
symmetry that you've added
to the lattice.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.140
And since you are all
cognoscenti, I don't have to

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:34.050
tell you it's an oblique
lattice, because you know,

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.030
don't you, deep down in your
heart, that a 2-fold axis

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:40.460
requires only that the lattice
be an oblique lattice.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.710
Nothing special is required.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:50.090
So what we will do is to take
this general oblique lattice

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:54.910
with two translations, T1 and
T2, and to this-- remember, we

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:57.040
don't deal with symmetry
elements.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.300
We have to do this operation
by operation.

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.780
So what we're doing is taking
the operation A pi, the only

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.160
non-trivial operation contained
in a 2-fold axis,

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.090
and putting that in at
a lattice point.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.550
OK.

00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:16.190
Bells ring and whistles
go off.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:20.350
We don't know what happens when
we make this combination.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.840
And let me do this in more
general terms, so we can

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.730
derive the theorem
once and for all.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:30.960
Here's a translation, and let
me add to the end of that

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.730
translation a rotation
operation A alpha.

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.730
In this case, it would be
the operation A pi.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:47.450
What's the net result of
rotating and then translating?

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:50.100
That's a non-trivial question.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.680
So if I'm doing this for a
general rotation of alpha, let

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:11.790
me take a translation, and I'm
going to make my construction

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:15.090
in the following way, because
I'm really clever.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:20.680
And I'm going to put this
translation T at one half of

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.180
alpha on one side of the
perpendicular to T.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:29.650
And then I'll let that
rotation go to work.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:35.180
And it'll take the translation
and move it to alpha over 2 on

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.885
the other side of the
perpendicular.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.330
And now I'll let the translation
move to this

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:49.330
rotated translation, and if it
does so, it's going to move

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:50.970
the translation over to here.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.480
Here's a motif hanging
on this translation.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:20:04.020
It's rotated over to here, and
then gets slid over to here.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.970
This one is right-handed, this
one is right-handed, this one

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:08.470
is right-handed.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.890
How do I get from this
one to this one?

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:14.780
Only two ways, translation
or rotation.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:22.960
If we rotate, about what
point are we rotating?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.440
Now I'm going to use
a definition

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.530
which seemed trivial.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:30.480
I said, a symmetry element is
the locus of points that is

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.730
unmoved by the operation.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:37.530
And if we decided, because
these two motifs are not

00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:40.720
parallel to one another and have
the same corrality, that

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.970
the rotation--

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:46.560
has to be a rotation that
relates the two.

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.650
When asked finally the
question, what

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:49.950
point is left unmoved?

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:53.470
Ha.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:57.120
It's this point where these two
translations come together

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.700
at a single point.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.150
That's the point that's left
unmoved by rotating from here

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:06.350
to here and then sliding over
by the translation T.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.760
And I can say exactly where
that rotation is.

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.050
It's going to be along the
perpendicular bisector of my

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.450
original translation.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:21.110
And where is it going
to be located?

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:27.980
This line makes an angle of
alpha over 2 with respect to

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.740
the perpendicular to
T. So that angle is

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.090
also alpha over 2.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:37.620
This line and this line both
make an angle of alpha over 2

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:42.210
relative to the normal to the
translation, so this angle is

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.480
also alpha over 2.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.550
And look how this
has turned out.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:54.310
The combination of a rotation
with a translation is another

00:21:54.310 --> 00:22:00.530
rotation, B, about a different
point but through the same net

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:05.070
amount alpha as the original
translation.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:08.710
On top of that, really
to nail this down,

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.210
where should we look?

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:23.130
This distance in here is T over
2, and the tangent of

00:22:23.130 --> 00:22:26.233
alpha is T over 2 over
this distance x.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:38.900
And if I just solve for
that distance, x is

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:42.960
equal to T over 2--

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.370
I'm sorry.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:47.560
I got this garbled.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:57.280
T over 2 over x is equal to
the tangent of alpha.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.550
That's what I wanted to do.

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:03.350
So if I solve for x, that
distance x is T over 2 over

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:07.580
the tangent of alpha, and I
can write that as T over 2

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:10.840
times the cotangent
of alpha over 2.

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.000
So here it is, done
properly at last.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.140
Go up a distance x along the
perpendicular bisector of T,

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:27.130
and you go up a distance T over
2 times the cotangent of

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:28.330
alpha over 2.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:34.220
So this is a general result for
any rotation operation.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:41.500
Combine a rotation operation A
alpha with a perpendicular

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.130
translation--

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.000
perpendicular to the
rotation axis A--

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.900
and the result is a new rotation
operation through the

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:52.810
same angle, but at a
different location.

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:58.330
It's at a distance x, which is
equal to T over 2 times the

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:02.360
cotangent of alpha over 2
along the perpendicular

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:08.690
bisector of T.

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.050
So this is a general theorem.

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.530
This is a fact of
two-dimensional life that is

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.560
always going to be true
regardless of alpha.

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:20.960
And the only constraint is that
the translation has to be

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:26.690
added perpendicular to the locus
of the rotation axis,

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:29.360
and that has to be the case in
two dimensions, because the

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:33.950
rotation axis has to always be
normal to the space, the

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:34.940
two-dimensional space.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.190
In three dimensions, we'll have
to generalize this to

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.400
make the translation have
arbitrary orientation relative

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.140
to the rotation axis, but we've
got enough to chew on at

00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:46.390
the moment.

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.090
Yes.

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:54.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.050
PROFESSOR: The distance x is
the distance up along the

00:24:58.050 --> 00:24:59.200
perpendicular bisector.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.850
I'm sorry.

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:03.076
I said it but I didn't
write it in.

00:25:03.076 --> 00:25:04.890
OK?

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.870
Let me go through it again
since we've got

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.630
everything on the board.

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:11.470
We start with the original
object, rotate it by alpha,

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:15.070
and then we then further map
it to a new location by the

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.090
translation T.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:20.260
Both motifs are right-handed,
but they're not parallel, so

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.930
therefore, they have to be
related by a rotation.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:28.290
If we ask what is the locus
about which this location has

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:31.900
occurred, we use the fact that
the locus of a rotation axis

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.330
is the only point that's
left unmoved by the net

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:38.210
transformation, and the place
where this translation

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.360
intersects the translation that
has been shifted over by

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.760
T is a point that sits up
along the perpendicular

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.520
bisector of the translation by
a distance T over 2 times the

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.440
cotangent of alpha over 2.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.960
So that's in the abstract.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.380
Let's now look at a particular
application of this to our

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.360
addition of a 2-fold rotation
to a translation.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:11.900
So here's the translation T.
We're going to put a 2-fold

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.280
axis and the only operation
which it

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.660
possesses, namely A pi.

00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:22.800
And according to our theorem,
up along the perpendicular

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.290
bisector of T by distance x
equals T over 2 times the

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:32.700
cotangent of alpha over
2 should be a

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.630
new operation B pi.

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:40.280
So in this case, this would be
T over 2 times the cotangent

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.810
of pi over 2.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:48.560
Cotangent of 90 degrees is 0.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.910
So this says that you go
0 of the way along the

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:56.920
perpendicular bisector, which
means you stay right at the

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.400
midpoint of T. So this says that
if you rotate through 180

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.230
degrees, follow that by this
translation, you should find

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.160
that the net effect is a
rotation of pi over 2 about

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.410
this point.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.750
Boggles the mind, but let's
show that it works.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:20.350
Here is an initial point,
initial motif number 1, and it

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.110
is right-handed.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:25.320
We rotate by 180 degrees.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.050
Here's number 2, it stays
right-handed, and I pick it up

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:33.980
and I move it by this
translation, and it moves from

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:39.180
here to here.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.610
Here's number 3, it stayed
right-handed, and the way I

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:47.600
get from 1 to 3 in one shot is
to rotate 180 degrees about

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.850
the midpoint of the
translation.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.570
How about that?

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.300
People are so astounded that
they're stunned, except for

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.870
the people who couldn't see what
I was doing, and they're

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.570
moving back and forth
frantically trying

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:05.820
to see what I wrote.

00:28:13.306 --> 00:28:16.680
I'll let you catch your breath,
and then let's do

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:22.740
this, use this to derive the
two-dimensional space group,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.930
the plane group that results
when we add a 2-fold access to

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:28.738
an oblique net.

00:28:28.738 --> 00:28:32.420
And it's turned out very simply,
because if I've got

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:35.900
the operation B pi here, that
implies that I've got a 2-fold

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:39.840
axis, because that's the only
operation that exists within a

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.040
2-fold axis.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:44.710
So I'll start by putting
in a 2-fold axis here.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.840
I'll combine A pi with this
translation T1, I get a new

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:51.350
rotation operation, B pi,
in the middle of this

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:55.580
translation, so there's a
new 2-fold axis there.

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:59.200
The 2-fold axis here hanging at
this lattice point as well,

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.910
and at these other
lattice points.

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.270
Combine the rotation A pi with
this translation T2, I get a

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:09.980
new operation, B pi, sitting
in the middle of this

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.940
translation, so I've got all I
need to say that there's a

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.490
2-fold axis there.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.410
That 2-fold axis will get
translated down here by T1.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:23.620
This 2-fold axis will be
translated over to here by T2.

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.810
Then the only other thing that
I have to combine this

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:32.990
translation with is the
translation T1 plus T2, and

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:36.540
that combined with A pi says I
should have B pi in the middle

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.290
of that translation as well,
so I'll get another 2-fold

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.610
axis in the middle
of the cell.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.860
And that's it.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:47.790
We've got our first nontrivial
two-dimensional space group.

00:29:47.790 --> 00:29:50.740
And what do we call this?

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.540
Confusing as hell, some might
say, but crystallographers

00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:55.980
would say that it's a primitive
lattice combined

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.710
with a 2-fold axis,
this is P2.

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:02.170
I don't have to tell you that
it's an oblique net, because

00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:05.790
you know that that is all that
a 2-fold axis requires, that

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:07.040
the net be oblique.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.440
What does the pattern
look like?

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.930
I'll say another thing that's
so simple, it takes a while

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:15.800
for it to sink in.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:19.720
The pattern of a plane group
is the pattern that is

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:24.760
generated by the point group
merely hung at every lattice

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.870
point in the net.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:31.190
So if this is what a 2-fold axis
does, relates a pair of

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:37.510
motifs like this, a pattern for
P2 is this pair hung at

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.760
every lattice point.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:48.360
So all of the objects are of the
same pirality, all either

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.440
left-handed or right-handed.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.930
I've got the same pair at every
corner of the cell.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:58.230
And notice that these new
symmetry elements that popped

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:02.900
up just like what we found in
the point groups, the new

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:09.150
mirror planes that came arose
as a consequence of the

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.390
combination that we had made.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:16.300
And they were independent in
most cases, 3M being the one

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.870
case where they weren't.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:21.610
These additional three
2-fold axes are

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.520
independent 2-fold axes.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.820
They're different kinds of
2-fold axes than the ones at

00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:27.720
the corner.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.910
Not only are they not equivalent
by translation, but

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.782
they do different things
relative to the motifs that

00:31:33.782 --> 00:31:34.890
are in the pattern.

00:31:34.890 --> 00:31:39.160
This 2-fold axis has a different
relation relative to

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.210
the two closest motifs
than does this one,

00:31:43.210 --> 00:31:45.660
than does this one.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:50.440
They relate different objects
pairwise in the pattern.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:57.810
And no two of these 2-fold
axes describe the same

00:31:57.810 --> 00:31:59.470
pairwise relationship.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.720
So these are independent
2-fold axes.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.110
Independent in the sense that
they do different things

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:22.250
relative to the motifs in the
pattern, different in the

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:26.740
sense that there is no other
operation that throws this one

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.920
into this one, and therefore,
of necessity, would require

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.180
that the pair about this 2-fold
axis be the same as the

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.565
pair about this 2-fold axis.

00:32:47.175 --> 00:32:47.670
OK.

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:55.230
So there is a first nontrivial
two-dimensional space group.

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.460
I should mention--

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.240
probably an obvious fact--

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:04.420
that this also has a cousin
in three dimensions.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.440
If I just imagine all of these
2-fold axes extending out

00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:11.820
through space perpendicular to
the plane of the blackboard,

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:15.810
and take another translation
that is also perpendicular to

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.930
the blackboard, I would have
the three-dimensional space

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.830
group which has the same symbol
except capital P,

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.770
indicating that it's
a space lattice.

00:33:25.770 --> 00:33:28.590
So almost at no extra charge,
we've done all the work to

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.440
determine one of the

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.119
three-dimensional space groups.

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:34.005
Yes?

00:33:34.005 --> 00:33:36.850
AUDIENCE: If you change the
order of the combination of

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:40.420
the translation rotation, do
we get the same operation?

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:40.900
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.135
That is a good question.

00:33:46.865 --> 00:33:49.260
I really meant to mention it
earlier in connection with the

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.950
point groups.

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.820
Does interchange of the order
of the operations in a

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.630
combination change the result,
or change, in other words, the

00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:03.750
symmetry element that is
equivalent to the net

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:06.320
combination of the two?

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:10.600
How many think yes,
it does change?

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.790
AUDIENCE: Could you
say that again?

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:15.070
PROFESSOR: OK, if we have two
operations A and B, is

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:19.840
operation A followed by B the
same result as the operation B

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:20.780
followed by A?

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.370
Does the order make
a difference?

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:26.066
And how many say yes--

00:34:26.066 --> 00:34:27.060
AUDIENCE: The order makes
a difference?

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.179
PROFESSOR: The order does
make a difference.

00:34:29.179 --> 00:34:32.260
How many say no?

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.739
Well, this is one of these happy
occasions where I can

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:37.719
say you're all right.

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.949
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.560
So let's ask when does it
make a difference and

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.810
when does it not.

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:50.989
Let's look at one of
our point groups.

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:55.420
Let me take a non-trivial
point group.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:59.260
This would be point group 4MM.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:34:59.470
OK?

00:34:59.470 --> 00:35:02.780
So those are all mirror planes
of two different kinds.

00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:06.050
And let me quickly sketch
in the pattern.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:09.865
The pattern is just a pair of
things hanging on the mirror

00:35:09.865 --> 00:35:13.805
plane, and that pair is
rotated by 90 degrees.

00:35:18.094 --> 00:35:18.590
OK.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.710
Suppose we look at the operation
A pi over 2, a

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:27.140
90-degree rotation in a
counterclockwise direction,

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.090
and let the other operation
be sigma 1, this

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.670
reflection plane here.

00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:39.470
Suppose we reflect and follow
that by A pi over 2.

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:46.900
We reflect to here and then we
rotate by 90 degrees, and

00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:49.870
that's going to give us the
number 3 sitting up here.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.030
So we reflect it and
then rotate it.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:59.240
How about if we first rotate
that same object by A pi over

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:03.660
2 and follow it by sigma 1.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:12.280
So we'll rotate number 1 to
here, so this is 2 prime, and

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.190
you can see we're already
in trouble.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.920
If we now reflect along sigma
1, this is 3 prime.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.080
So in one case we ended up here,
in the other case we

00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:22.560
ended up here.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.850
So the order did make
a difference.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:30.970
Let us look at another
example.

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:32.470
Let's look at 2MM.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.010
So here's an operation sigma 1,
here's an operation sigma

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:46.950
2, so let's first do sigma
1 followed by A pi.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.980
So here's object 1, reflect to
here, and then we rotate by

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:54.320
180 degrees, and this
is number 3.

00:36:57.050 --> 00:37:02.010
Now let's do the operation A pi
and follow it by sigma 1.

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:08.430
So we'll take number 1 and
rotate it up to here.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.410
So here's number 1 prime.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:14.070
And then we reflect by sigma
1, and 3 and 3 prime are

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:15.590
exactly the same.

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:18.590
So it didn't make
a difference.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:22.450
So the answer is sometimes yes,
sometimes no, which is

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:23.830
interesting, but even
more interesting

00:37:23.830 --> 00:37:25.555
is how can you tell?

00:37:25.555 --> 00:37:26.545
Yeah, you have a question?

00:37:26.545 --> 00:37:28.525
AUDIENCE: In that first
identity you drew--

00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:29.020
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.217
AUDIENCE: The right side, it
seems like your commas are

00:37:34.217 --> 00:37:36.940
drawn backwards and that
just affects--

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.930
PROFESSOR: Could be.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:39.540
Mm, no, they're--

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.880
ah, these are drawn backwards.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.690
They should all have their
tails pointing in.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:48.030
No, it doesn't work, actually,
because even if I screwed up

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.710
on the orientation, the
positions are different.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.680
Again, first time I reflected,
and then

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.670
rotated, so this is 3.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:02.966
If I rotate and then reflect,
I'm way over here.

00:38:02.966 --> 00:38:08.110
So this is one location, this is
another location, and even

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:10.140
if I screwed up by having the
tails pointed the wrong

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:14.290
orientation, still
not the same.

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:18.580
But here, clearly, reflecting
and rotating is the same as

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.645
rotating and reflecting.

00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:22.780
I end up in the same place.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:25.120
So how can you tell?

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.010
It's a very difficult thing to
prove that this is the case,

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:33.540
but you can interchange the
order of operations when the

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.700
two symmetry operations that are
involved leave each other

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:39.950
untransformed.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.200
And if the two symmetry
operations move one another,

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.875
then changing the order changes
the net result.

00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:52.690
It doesn't change the nature of
the operation, but it does

00:38:52.690 --> 00:38:54.910
change the locus about
which it operates.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.220
Let me show you what I mean.

00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.220
Here's 2MM.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.730
The 2-fold axis takes
this mirror plane,

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:03.020
turns it upside down.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.740
It takes this mirror plane
and flips it over.

00:39:05.740 --> 00:39:09.490
The mirror plane is left
unchanged in both cases.

00:39:09.490 --> 00:39:12.070
The mirror plane has the 2-fold
axis sitting right on

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.990
it, so it doesn't change the
location of the 2-fold axis

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:16.270
when it acts on it.

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.540
And similarly, this mirror plane
takes this mirror plane

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.110
and reflects it, and it doesn't
change anything.

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:23.730
So all of these operations--

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.410
the three independent
operations, sigma 1,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.320
sigma 2, and A pi--

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:32.600
all leave their locus of
operation unchanged.

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:36.350
Whereas that, clearly, is not
the same for a 4-fold axis and

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:37.880
a mirror plane.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.020
The mirror plane, when it acts
on the 4-fold axis, leaves it

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.720
unchanged, but the 4-fold axis,
when it acts on the

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.560
mirror plane, moves
it into a new,

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.290
entirely different location.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:49.640
And when that is the case, the
order does make a difference.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.840
So I can take that corny joke of
the mathematicians, what is

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:03.590
purple and commutes?

00:40:03.590 --> 00:40:04.970
An Abelian grape.

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.380
I can say, what is purple
and commutes?

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:13.135
It's a purple 4-fold axis in a
mirror plane, a purple 4MM.

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:23.010
OK, what other aspect of the
plane groups and three

00:40:23.010 --> 00:40:30.090
dimensional space groups is an
analytic representation of the

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:37.350
way the plane group
maps atoms around?

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:43.170
And I see that it is five of the
hour, so let me just make

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:48.920
one final statement to indicate
what I'm going to

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.760
talk about next time.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:58.830
Here's the arrangement of 2-fold
axes, and if you have

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:04.600
an atom sitting in here, and
this is T1 and T2, and we use

00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:07.140
this as the basis of a
coordinate system, so this

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.555
atom sits at a location x
along T1 and y along T2.

00:41:12.555 --> 00:41:15.800
And then they ask, what other
atoms are related to it?

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.810
Well, that 2-fold axis will move
x to minus x, and move y

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:26.500
to minus y, and those are the
only two atoms I get.

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.600
So a characteristic of this
plane group, if I were

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.150
describing to you a crystal
structure which had this

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:38.260
symmetry, I might say something
like a lithium in a

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:44.120
position with coordinates xy,
and therefore minus x minus y

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.700
would also have to occur.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:49.070
I have an oxygen at a different
number, x prime y

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.910
prime, and that must then
also occur at minus x

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:54.370
prime minus y prime.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:57.410
And it looks as though any time
you throw in an atom at a

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:00.790
location xy, you get a symmetry
related companion to

00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:04.040
it with negative coordinates.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:06.620
And this is what is called
the general position

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.870
of the space group.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.960
There's nothing special about
it, and you put in an atom

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.190
here, you get another
atom here.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:20.300
This is going to be a nice
economical way of describing

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.550
an atomic arrangement,
particularly if you realize

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:27.280
that there are almost 150 atoms
that appear in the unit

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.280
cell for some of the
cubic symmetries.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:33.820
Drop in one, wow, all hell
breaks loose, 150 other ones.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.440
But what you can do is codify
the coordinates of all these

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:37.920
symmetry-related atoms.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.420
And that is a great utility in
describing crystal structures,

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.320
because I only have to give
you the coordinates of one

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.450
representative atom.

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:49.140
But this is not the only
thing that happens.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.760
This is the general position
because it's general relative

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:57.180
to its location with respect
to the symmetry elements.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:02.930
If x and y were both 0, I would
have one atom moving to

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:06.312
the origin to coincide
with the second one.

00:43:06.312 --> 00:43:09.740
And if I put one in at 0, 0,
that's all I'm going to get.

00:43:09.740 --> 00:43:12.960
The 2-fold axis is just going
to twirl it around, and the

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.020
translation will repeat it to
the other lattice points.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.230
So if I put in an atom
at 0, 0, that's all

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:21.230
I'm going to get.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.630
And the same thing would occur
for any of these four

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.630
independent 2-fold axes.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:32.300
If I let x and y migrate to 0,
1/2, this atom will join

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.820
together with this atom, and
I would get just one atom

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:37.440
sitting there.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.950
So there's a position also
of the form 0, 1/2, and a

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:46.570
position 1/2, 0, and a position
1/2, 1/2 that are the

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:49.070
location of these four
distinct 2-fold axes.

00:43:52.590 --> 00:43:57.590
OK, to have a shorthand way of
referring to the general

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:02.170
position in these positions,
which are called special

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:03.420
positions--

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:09.085
what's special about them is
that they're right on top of a

00:44:09.085 --> 00:44:19.400
symmetry element, and whenever
that happens, the number per

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:37.920
cell is a sub-multiple of the
number in the general

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:43.665
position, because coalescence
has occurred.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.130
And so they're three independent
2-fold axes, so

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:57.330
there are four locations where
you get only one atom per cell

00:44:57.330 --> 00:44:58.930
rather than two.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:03.060
And then to give you a way of
referring to these positions

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:08.620
readily, they are labeled
starting with the most

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.420
specialized, just going through
the alphabet, position

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:16.450
a, position b, position c,
position d, position e, which

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:17.700
is the general position.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:24.160
And then another piece of
information that's almost

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.820
trivial here, but is not for
more complicated symmetries,

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:34.620
what's called the rank of the
position, and that is the

00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:39.500
number that you get per cell,
one per cell, one per cell,

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.150
and for the general position
you get two.

00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:46.470
So the rank of the position is
just the number per cell.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:49.580
And then, if it's a special
position, the atom has to sit

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:57.320
at a site of some symmetry, and
in this case, the atoms

00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.160
all sit at 2-fold axes for
the special position.

00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:04.485
The general position always has
site symmetry 1 always.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.940
So that's the characteristics
of the way in which this

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:16.910
symmetry can move
atoms around.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:22.730
And this is of great utility
in interpreting structures.

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:26.740
For example, suppose our motif
was not an individual atom,

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:30.000
but was a molecule.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.150
And suppose you had one
molecule per cell.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:38.200
That would tell you the molecule
has to fit in a

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.370
special position.

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:42.320
And the special positions
are all 2-fold axes.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.300
So if the molecule has to sit
on a 2-fold axis, the

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.790
configuration of that molecule
has to have at least a 2-fold

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.860
symmetry, or else you can't fit
in one per cell in this

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:55.050
particular plane group.

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.120
So you can use this information
to determine

00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:58.900
structures.

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.680
I'm going to give you a problem
a little bit later on

00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.940
when we get to three-dimensional

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:07.620
crystallography, and I'm going
to give you the magnitude of

00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:11.320
the cell edge and the density
of rock salt.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:14.840
And from that, in 10 minutes,
you can find out that there's

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.250
only one possible structure
for rock salt.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.170
The Braggs fiddled around for
the better part of a year

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:25.750
doing x-ray experiments and
trying to calculate what the

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:28.480
intensities would be for
different atomic positions.

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:32.110
You, in another two weeks, can
get the same answer in 10

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.660
minutes knowing only the lattice
constant and the

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:38.882
density and the space group.

00:47:38.882 --> 00:47:42.440
So a lot of physical
consequences of the nature of

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.050
the structure, the confirmation
of the molecule,

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:48.780
the extent or absence of solid
substitution of one species

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:51.360
for another, can be dredged out
of the properties of the

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.580
space group.

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.250
OK, I've run 2 minutes over,
but we took our break two

00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.980
minutes later, so let's call it
a day and I shall see you

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.980
on Thursday, hopefully armed
with pictures so that I can

00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:06.460
personally present each one
of you with your corrected

00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:07.710
problem sets.

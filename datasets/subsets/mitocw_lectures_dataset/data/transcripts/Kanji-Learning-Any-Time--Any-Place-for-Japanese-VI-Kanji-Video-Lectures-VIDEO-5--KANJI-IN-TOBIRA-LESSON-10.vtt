But ‘mukashi no tomodachi ga otozureta’
kore wa ‘my old friend visited me.’

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.700
So here, subject marker ‘ga’ needs to
appear.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.188
So be careful, the usage of this particle
actually determines whether it is transitive

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:49.292
or intransitive.

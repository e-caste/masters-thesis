00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.850
PROFESSOR: So this
is the equation

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.560
that we-- this inviscid
Burgers' equation, no viscosity,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.110
is the one we've learned
about for-- shocks appear,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.750
fans can appear and
I want to do more

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.830
today with exact solutions.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.400
So today is a little
bit more analysis

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.160
than numerical solutions.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.600
So while doing
something, sort of PDE

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.170
rather than numerical
PDE, well, it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.190
natural to include Burgers'
equation with viscosity.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.580
So that's got the
extra term there.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.490
And if I can, I would
like to say something

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.270
about two other important
equations, nonlinear.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.040
One has a third derivative
on the right-hand side,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.430
so it's a dispersion
rather than a diffusion.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.840
And that equation is named
after Korteweg-de Vries,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.040
KdV it's often called.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.100
I'll just put that down;
KdV is the shorthand

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.430
for that equation.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.400
And it comes up in water
waves, one-way water waves

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.890
actually, along a
shallow channel.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.220
It was actually seen by somebody
riding along next to the wave

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.100
and the wave kept its shape.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.550
And so this equation
has had a period

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.320
of great fame in some way.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.020
It's nonlinear of
course, but it was

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.760
discovered that there was a
really clever way to solve it.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.980
Actually, we will
solve these equations

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.500
even though they're nonlinear,
that won't be too hard.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.200
The clever ideas that went
into solving that one,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.870
I can describe a little
bit, but not in full detail.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.930
And then we'll connect also to
Hamilton-Jacobi type equations,

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.830
which are very closely related
to this in one dimension

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.940
and in fact, they'll
come into it.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.970
OK, so those are the
equations and then, next time,

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.320
will come a little more
about finite differences

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.570
for those equations and a
lot more about the level set

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.560
method, which is more
connected to Hamilton-Jacobi

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.020
and is quite a remarkable idea.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.300
OK, so that's for next time.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.510
This is for this time.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.820
So what I have in mind for
this time is: to begin,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.690
can we solve our equation
starting from a source,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.240
starting from a delta
function, a point source?

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.550
What's the solution look like?

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.950
And I guess when I
thought about it,

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.440
I can see several ways
to get at the answer

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:38.970
and it's a very worth it example
to do this from a point source.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.610
It has a natural
interest and then

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.790
it comes up in many other ways.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.950
So how we going
to get the answer?

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.990
Well, I can do it in
terms of fans and shocks.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.900
Let me just proceed
informally at first.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.660
The delta function is
like a step up followed

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.690
by a step down.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.490
Well, a very big step up and
an immediate step down, right?

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.060
So it's the extreme
case of-- and remember

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.100
that the step up--
for the step up,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.630
you remember the
Riemann problem?

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.830
Going from a lower
to a higher one.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.245
That's the case where the
characteristics separate, leave

00:04:32.245 --> 00:04:36.550
an open space that has to
be filled in with a fan.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.860
So I would expect the
solution to start with a fan

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.300
and then I'm imagining
that as the limit

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.330
of an initial
function like this.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.740
So that's step up,
will start a fan going

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.180
and then this step down
will start a shock going.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.530
Because here, I have u is zero
and here u is something big

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.590
and that drop down means that
the characteristics from here

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.590
will immediately overtake-- the
characteristics from the zero,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.810
starting from zero, have
zero speed, in the xt-plane,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.290
they're just going up.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.350
The characteristics that
start because of this thing

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.700
are going to the right,
so I'll have a shock.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.290
So I'm expecting a
fan and then a shock

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.930
based on the previous lectures.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.320
OK, and I'm going to
figure out what fan it is

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.490
and what shock it is
and where the shock is.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:06:00.860
Now what I have on here is an
exact formula for the solution.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.030
You might say, why didn't
you tell me that before?

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.170
And I will plug
in the initial, it

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.170
comes from the initial function
and from a minimization process

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.560
and it's not obvious.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.640
That's a funny way to describe
a function of x and t,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.070
but of course it does.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.810
x and t appear here,
y is the parameter

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.290
and I'm minimizing
with respect to y

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.430
and that will give us-- well, it
better give us the same answer.

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:39.250
So I'm taking this as an
important case, which gives us

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.520
a chance to review all the
pieces that came into the-- all

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.160
the rules that came into it.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.420
We had the rules for a fan,
which was of the form x over t

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.950
if it started at zero.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.190
We have the rules for a shock,
which was that the shock speed

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:08.300
should be the jump in f of
u-- which is u squared over 2

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.210
for Burgers'-- divided
by the jump in u.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:15.630
And so that's a
difference of squares,

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.280
this is a difference
of first powers.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:22.700
When I do that simple
division, it factors out

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:27.670
and I get a u_left
plus a u_right over 2,

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.460
the 2 coming from there,
and the difference

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.420
going into the difference
of squares gives me that.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.470
OK, and then the other condition
was the entropy condition

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:44.180
that f prime-- remember,
this is f prime of u--

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:48.850
so f prime of u,
which is here, u.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:53.520
So u_left should be
greater-- the shocks,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.150
what's the rule on
the entropy condition?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.500
That the characteristic
should run into the shock.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.370
So coming from the left,
they should be faster.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:08.590
We have some shock line--
it's increasing with a speed

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:13.500
s, which is d position
of the shock-- dx/dt,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.340
and coming from the left, the
shocks should be going faster

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.660
and run into it.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.200
Coming from the
right, the shocks--

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.350
the characteristics
should be slower

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:27.330
so that the shock
line catches them

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:32.410
and therefore, these
also run into the shock.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:37.800
So this is f prime at u_right.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.580
And remember here,
it's just u_left bigger

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.860
than the shock speed,
bigger than u_right.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.150
Now I'm going to go
to the delta function

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.290
itself, which will
be cleaner and neater

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:59.710
than this steep square wave.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.880
So we could pick any
of those as the key

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.660
to telling us-- this is what
I'm expecting for a solution.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.730
Here is zero.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:12.300
Here is x.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:17.670
So I'm expecting that--
I guess I'll graph u.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:21.200
u of x at some time t.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.060
OK, so I'm graphing u
at some later time t.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:29.500
OK, I'm expecting the solution
to be u equal zero here,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.410
because it starts
at zero-- well,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.110
I'm really-- now, when I point
to that figure, what I really

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.030
mean now is a delta function.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.400
So this is infinitely
thin and infinitely tall.

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.810
So characteristics are going
to take off and well, who

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.990
can say-- you might think the
whole thing would break down

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:59.510
because the delta
function is in some sense,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.150
infinite at that point.

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:02.160
But it doesn't.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:05.890
You'll see that a very
sensible solution emerges here.

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:12.300
And it's a fan, so u
is x over t, I guess.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:21.290
So u starts at zero-- yeah, let
me draw u at some later time t.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:25.880
It's linear and
then it's a shock.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.160
So this is what I
expect for the answer.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.980
I expect u to be zero, x
over t up to some point,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:43.620
up to the shock, up to--
x is the shock position,

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:50.880
and then after that
it has the value zero

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:57.410
because the initial
function hasn't changed,

00:10:57.410 --> 00:10:59.710
hasn't got the message.

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:08.270
So this was after
x equal X of t.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:12.120
That's what it should look like.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.070
I'm proceeding here sort
of on the basis of what

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.610
we know about the solution.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:26.310
And maybe I can just mention
that the text, the problems

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:29.210
at the end of the
section on conservation

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:35.680
laws in the Introduction
to Applied Math text

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.380
ask about a few other
initial functions.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.960
For example, minus
the delta function.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.310
Maybe we should think
through those questions.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.740
Is the solution with minus the
delta function the negative

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.170
of this solution?

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.290
What do you think?

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:01.340
No.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.110
This is a nonlinear
equation and that fact

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:11.600
shows up right away
in the possibility

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.090
that when you change the
sign of the initial function,

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:18.160
you don't just change
the sign of the solution.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.460
And other things,
I could ask well,

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.120
suppose I have an
initial function

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.900
u_0 of x and I add 1 to it.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.880
Does that add 1 to the
solution everywhere?

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:30.760
That's a question
to think about.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.430
So these are sort
of questions that

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:42.380
are not finite differences,
but differential equations.

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:48.340
All that remains here is to
find the position of that shock.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.480
I guess one way to do it-- OK,
I can think of several ways

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:54.620
to do it.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:58.905
One way would be to use the
fact that the total mass is

00:12:58.905 --> 00:13:00.610
conserved.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:05.100
So the integral
of u at any time,

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.650
the integral of that
function from minus infinity

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.660
to infinity-- that's
the total mass--

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.670
has to agree with the initial
total mass, which is 1,

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.570
because the initial
density distribution was

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.670
that delta function
at the origin

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.960
and that we know
integrates to 1.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.210
So one way to find this
position would be the fact

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:36.390
that the integral from zero to
the place that the fan ends--

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:45.080
that's a capital X-- of
x over t dx should be 1.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.920
1 because it was initially 1.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:56.140
So that's gives us capital X
squared over 2-- over 2t as 1.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.190
In fact, I guess
I'm thinking now,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:01.200
this approach
occurred to me sort of

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.590
as I was walking to class, I'm
thinking now that's unbeatable.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:09.500
That tells us where
the shock position is,

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.030
capital X squared over
2t is 1, so capital X

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:16.730
is square root of 2t.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:30.630
OK, we could take that
as a guess, if you like,

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:38.000
and verify that it obeys all
the nonlinear rules here.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.710
Right now it just obeys the
fact that the total mass

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:45.170
is conserved, which is
like the minimal fact.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:49.480
But of course, we've
built into this solution

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.990
an expectation of fan followed
by shock, which is now

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.090
what we really want to verify.

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:00.730
So I guess, what
should I check next?

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:03.360
I maybe should check
the shock speed.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.170
Does this solution
with that shock

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.760
give me the correct shock speed?

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.030
OK, let me check that.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.580
What's the shock
speed? s is the speed

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:25.020
of the shock, so it's the
derivative of square root of 2t

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.130
and what's that?

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:30.360
That's square root
of 2 t to the 1/2.

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.540
So that's square root
of 2 times t to the 1/2.

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.310
The derivative of t to the
1/2 is 1/2 t to the minus 1/2.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.460
So it's 1 over
square root of 2t.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.870
That's the shock speed for
this proposed solution.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.980
If we decide that the shock
should be at that point.

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.550
Now what's supposed to happen?

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.710
What is it that I want to check?

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:05.490
I want to check that
the jump condition is

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.050
correct for this shock.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.190
That if a shock speed is
that, so the question mark is,

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:18.100
is this-- so that's
the speed of the shock

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:23.880
as we're sort of conjecturing
it to be located.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.430
And now the question is
whether that shock speed

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:34.130
agrees with u on the left
plus u on the right over 2.

00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.570
So what do I have to check?

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:41.230
I have to check what is u
on the left of the shock

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.050
if this is my answer.

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:49.380
Well, the left of the
shock is the point when

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:53.660
x equals capital X. That's
where the shock happened,

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:56.280
so it's capital X over t.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.440
Square root of 2t over t.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:06.840
So the value of u square
root of 2t over t.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.770
That's where the fan is.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.640
That's this height and
that height is zero.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.560
So it's the average
of this and zero.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.770
So that's the jump condition.

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:24.040
So this is the jump
condition that we're

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:32.510
checking and is it right?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.580
I hope so.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.620
Otherwise we're in
mighty big trouble.

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.400
OK yes, I have the
same cancellation

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.620
of square root of 2
into 2 and t to the 1/2

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:47.480
leaves me with-- yes,
I'm left with that.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.070
So yes.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.530
Jump condition satisfied by
this conjectured solution.

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:00.570
What else?

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:07.100
Well, just having a shock
with the right speed

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.630
doesn't mean I've
got the right answer.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.270
Doesn't mean I've
got the right answer,

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:17.790
can I just make that point
because it's easy to slip by.

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:25.740
Let me take an extreme
case where I compare.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.460
So these comments
are going to be

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:35.270
to say that I really need to
check the entropy condition.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.190
Because I could
have two problems.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:47.800
One which started from initial
value minus 1 jumping to 1.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.430
So that's a Riemann problem.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:54.080
And the other which starts
from 1 and jumps to minus 1.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:59.090
And I guess in both
cases, remember

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.010
that f of u, which
is u squared over 2,

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:11.160
is 1/2 on both sides of
that line x equals zero.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.250
In other words,
could this solution

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:26.030
stay at minus 1 and this
solution stay at plus 1

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.740
and have a jump between them?

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.600
And same for this.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.870
This solution could stay at
1, this could stay at minus 1

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:35.380
and have a jump.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.940
And now of course,
in this case the jump

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.060
will be upwards
from minus 1 to 1.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:45.180
In this case it'll be a
drop from 1 down to minus 1.

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:53.740
And I guess I think this one is
OK with the entropy condition

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.190
and this one is not OK.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.310
Let me say again
what I'm meaning.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.280
The fact that I've chosen
this simple example

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:10.420
with f of u equal u
squared so that 1 squared

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:14.010
and minus 1 squared
give me the same answer.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.570
So the jump across this line
is zero, the speed of the shock

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:21.880
is zero, the jump
condition is OK.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:30.440
So I'm saying that the jump
condition is OK for both.

00:20:33.670 --> 00:20:36.540
And it's the right thing to
have the jump in this one,

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:37.790
but this is wrong.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.740
There should be a
fan and I guess I've

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.480
forgotten how the fan will go.

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:54.230
We do have 1 here and we
do have minus 1 there,

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:59.180
but the value of u is connected
not by a jump at a point,

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:03.340
but by a fan that gets
us from there to there.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.360
A fan is also known
as an expansion wave.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.660
That's the right thing
to have for that problem.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.470
All that is just
to say that I do

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.990
have to check the
entropy condition.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:22.350
But I hope it's not going
to be too difficult.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:27.960
So my entropy condition--
remember, for this special case

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.550
f prime is just u.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:31.560
So I'm really just
checking, now,

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:35.300
u_L greater than the shock
speed, greater than u_R.

00:21:39.650 --> 00:21:42.020
u_R is zero of course.

00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.830
On this side of the
shock it's zero.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.230
So the shock-- can you get that?

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:58.490
We're going to be OK on
the entropy condition.

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.740
The shock speed is greater than
zero and it's smaller than u_L.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.010
Well, how is that?

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:09.110
Is this quantity,
the shock speed--

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.860
no, greater than--
is this shock speed--

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.550
so checking that entropy
condition means-- shall

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.760
I put it up here?

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:26.710
u_L bigger than-- so this was
the characteristic speeds,

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:29.530
the wave speeds on
the left of the shock.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.610
They must run into the
shock, so they must

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.630
be going faster than the shock.

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:37.130
OK, so let me just do
this comparison. u_L

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:42.720
at the left of the shock, on the
left of the shock x is capital

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.990
X, which we decided was root 2t.

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:54.300
So this is root 2t over t.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:59.830
That's u_left because
the shock starts

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:05.690
when x is equal to root 2t
and that's what u equals.

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:11.510
And the shock speed we
figured out here is 1 over.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.100
Now, so the question
is, is this true?

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.440
1 over root 2t.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.860
I guess I sure hope that it is.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:24.350
And it is, of course.

00:23:24.350 --> 00:23:29.910
If I multiply up by this, I
have 2t over t, which is just 2

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:32.050
is bigger than 1.

00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.470
So the answer again, is yes.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:46.870
So that completes checking that
our proposed solution of fan

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:50.780
then shock is OK.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:58.460
But, now let me
come to this formula

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.810
because it's quite a
handy, useful formula.

00:24:01.810 --> 00:24:09.010
And what I have here
is f of u divided by--

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.850
or f of x minus y divided by 2.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.520
That something squared
over 2 divided by t.

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.350
Sorry, divided by t.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:22.710
Well, what do I want to
say about that going on?

00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:35.600
Well, first of all, if I do plug
in the delta function for u_0,

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.990
it gives the right answer.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.890
I can easily do
this minimization.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.290
What what do I get when I plug
in the delta function for u_0,

00:24:43.290 --> 00:24:47.830
just to start on
trying this formula

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.780
to be sure it gives the same
answer that we just found?

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:57.290
So the integral of u of x
and zero, the integral of u

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:59.580
is a step function.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:04.940
So this will be a step
function of 1 for y

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.140
greater than zero and
zero for y less than zero.

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.370
Minimization requires
a little patience

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:18.780
because a step function of y
is coming in here, y is there.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.930
And the only way I would
know to do that minimum

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:25.940
would be the separate
the different cases

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:28.220
and do each one.

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.890
Each one would be simple.

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:35.560
I don't think we need to
take our time to do that.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.000
It's going to give
the same answer

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.800
and the minimization
is actually carried out

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.880
in the applied math book.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.210
But I would like to
say where it came from.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:53.400
Where did this formula-- so
I'll go back to this formula.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:26:06.830
As a general formula
for any starting value,

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.630
starting function.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:14.690
And in some way
derive the formula.

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:19.500
Figure out where
did that come from?

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.660
It came from the
Burgers' equation

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:29.430
with-- so now I want to
speak about this guy--

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:34.410
the Burgers' equation
with viscosity.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:37.220
It turns out that that
equation-- and this

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:39.580
is very important.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.880
That equation has
an exact solution,

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.260
because I can change
variables and make it linear.

00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:49.870
I can turn it into
the heat equation.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:53.230
So that was a neat idea,
which two people noticed

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.960
at almost the same time.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.960
That very satisfying
change of variables

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.770
will turn this, will get
rid of this nonlinearity

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:05.740
and turn it into
the heat equation.

00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.130
So it's a nonlinear change
of variables of course,

00:27:08.130 --> 00:27:11.500
but not that hard to
discover once you begin

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.360
to hope that there is one.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:19.210
And then, once it's a heat
equation we know the solution.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.050
The linear heat equation
we know how to solve.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.790
So we solve it and then what?

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:31.300
Let the viscosity nu go to zero.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:37.250
Watch what this solution
is doing as nu goes to zero

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:42.660
and it will-- of
course, it'll be

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.520
smooth for any
positive value of new.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.950
The viscosity keeps
things smooth.

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.870
The shock appears in the limit.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.000
Maybe I should say something
just physically about waves,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.040
breaking waves.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.820
If you look at waves
in water, they're

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.660
obeying a nonlinear wave
equation, more complicated

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:17.630
than ours, but nevertheless
the same features.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:26.080
And a wave forms and as
all water skiers know,

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.770
surfers know-- surfers,
I guess, know it best.

00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:35.090
The wave in time
begins to break.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:40.150
Now, up to that
time the viscosity

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.110
is actually not so important.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:44.960
But as it begins
to break there's

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:52.540
a terrific u_xx now at the
moments before breaking.

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:01.020
And that u_xx then, that
term produces viscosity.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.790
I mean, there is
a viscosity there

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.120
and suddenly it's important.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.470
And so the viscosity will
prevent-- even though it's

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:13.850
small, the viscosity
will prevent

00:29:13.850 --> 00:29:18.140
the actual, complete break.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.050
I mean, what actually happens
in that wave is, of course,

00:29:22.050 --> 00:29:24.360
a very difficult thing.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.100
The nonlinearity,
turbulence-- everything's

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.990
happening suddenly.

00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:36.550
Not easy, but the main point
is that as in many problems,

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:43.600
a term that's small in the case
of smooth solutions, where u_xx

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.480
has a normal size and nu is very
small, so that term is small.

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:53.180
Suddenly, u_xx has a
giant size and that term

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.890
is important,
physically important.

00:29:56.890 --> 00:30:00.510
So Burgers' inviscid
equation, this

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:04.100
is the case with-- inviscid
means nu equals zero.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.030
So Burgers' equation
is dropping that term

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:10.570
and it does have a shock,
as we very well know.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:18.300
What are the steps
that these two people

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.670
noticed that take
Burgers' equation

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.680
and turn it into
the heat equation?

00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:33.470
Let me see if I can
remember the two steps.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:35.260
So I'm starting with
Burgers' equation

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:37.570
and I want to make
it the heat equation.

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:45.010
OK, so a first step is to
introduce the integral of u.

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:47.250
Let me call that capital U of x.

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.540
So capital U of x
will be the integral.

00:30:50.540 --> 00:31:02.130
So if I write it this way, I'm
going to change u to capital U.

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:04.870
So I'm introducing a
new variable capital

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.680
U. The linearity
won't disappear yet,

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:09.670
but it'll look a
little different.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:19.100
So if I took this equation
and I look at its-- well,

00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.730
let me just say,
what's the equation

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.050
going to look like
for capital U?

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:25.590
If I write it down, then
you'll see that it's right.

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:36.930
dU/dt plus-- instead of d by
dx it'll be 1/2 dU/dx squared

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:40.450
equals nu*U__xx.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:52.800
I claim that that's Burgers'
equation written for capital

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:56.850
U. Do you see that?

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:59.160
Let me just see, well,
how do I get from there

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.870
to the equation with a
star, Burgers' equation?

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:05.290
I think I just take
the x derivative.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:08.030
If I take the x
derivative of every term,

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:12.790
I'm taking the x derivative
of U, so that's a little u.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:16.380
So I have d little
u dt, as I want.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:19.620
If I'm taking the x
derivative of this term

00:32:19.620 --> 00:32:22.870
I have little u_xx, as I want.

00:32:22.870 --> 00:32:26.960
And if I take the x
derivative of this term

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.390
it'll produce that.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.760
The x derivative,
the 2 will come here,

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:34.180
dU/dx will be the little u.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.130
The x derivative of
that will be the u_x.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.370
It's straightforward.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:46.800
And so now I've got it in a
slightly different, but still

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.810
nonlinear form.

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:48.630
Still quadratic.

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:54.520
Now comes the nonlinear
change of variables.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.720
I think it's u is
minus 2*nu log--

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:03.930
so that's the nonlinear part--
of the new unknown that I

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:08.800
finally want, which is w.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.480
So that's an exponential
change of variable.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:19.180
Capital U is matching log w,
so w is matching e to the minus

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:21.150
an exponential of u.

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:25.750
And I won't go
through the steps,

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:28.810
but when you introduce
that in this equation,

00:33:28.810 --> 00:33:31.330
it turns into the heat equation.

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:39.670
Of course, the initial
function is different.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:46.290
The initial w is different
from the initial u.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:51.270
Well, in fact we could
see, at time zero--

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:53.500
so this was at all times.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.900
I didn't write the t explicitly.

00:33:55.900 --> 00:33:59.040
But at time zero,
what is w of zero?

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.970
I guess I just take
the exponential.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:06.140
I put this over here and
take its exponential.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:15.240
So w of x and zero will
be u of x and zero,

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:24.620
the starting value of u, divided
by minus 2*nu, all exponential.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.810
This is the sort of expression,
e to the something divided

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.650
by-- with a minus
sign-- divided by 2*nu,

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:34.230
that we're going to meet.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.000
We meet it in the
initial condition

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.460
and we meet it in the solution.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.270
Well, actually we now
know the solution.

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:47.280
If we remember, what's the
solution to the heat equation?

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.570
So we have the heat equation.

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.590
There's a constant
in the heat equation,

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.970
so we just have to remember,
where does that constant go,

00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:59.060
and that's actually worth doing.

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.060
And then we have to start it
from this initial condition.

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.590
Let me just write, over here,
the solution to the heat

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:06.090
equation.

00:35:11.770 --> 00:35:16.390
So this board will
follow that board

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:19.370
and remember-- so do you
remember the solution

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.410
to the heat equation?

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.480
You remember, we know
the solution that

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.000
starts from a delta function,
that fundamental solution

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:39.050
is that e to the minus
whatever over 2t, is it?

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.970
Yeah.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:45.040
So what is w of x and t?

00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.400
Let's see.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.130
So we have the heat equation.

00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:54.120
There is a square root of
4*pi and now it's 4*pi*nu*t.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.930
When nu was 1 we
didn't know that,

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:05.620
but now, essentially this nu,
I can change the time variable

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:07.500
to nu times t.

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:12.050
So everywhere I saw a t,
I now will see nu times t.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:15.090
And then, do you remember
what went in here?

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:20.950
The initial value,
w of x and zero,

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:27.200
times the fundamental
solution, that bell curve

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:35.280
that is centered
at x, and grows--

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.570
so it's e to the minus-- do you
remember what it looked like?

00:36:38.570 --> 00:36:41.280
I think there's an e
to the minus-- centered

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:48.760
at x, so it's x minus t
squared over-- was it 2?

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:52.840
Over 2t, it was, and
now there's a nu*t.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:02.050
x minus-- oh, wait a minute.

00:37:02.050 --> 00:37:04.240
I can't have x's.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.900
Let me take w of s and zero,
e to the x minus s squared.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.490
This is from minus
infinity to infinity.

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:19.850
And that, finally, is going
to give me w of x and t.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.750
So I integrate ds.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.850
It's actually good to go
back to and see something

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:38.000
that we derived
before but we haven't

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.760
thought about it for a while.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.360
This is the fundamental solution
starting at the point s.

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:54.960
This is the amount
of initial function

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.930
there is at the point s.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:06.190
And I integrate over all those
little starts of point sources.

00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:10.000
I integrate over all the
sources, all the way from s

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.740
equal minus infinity
to infinity,

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.990
and I get that answer.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:15.910
And now I know what
w of s and zero is.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.570
That's what I just found.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:24.660
This is e to the minus,
as we've just said,

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:32.460
capital U of x and zero--
U_0 I'll call it-- over 2*nu.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:35.550
So for this, substitute this.

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:48.690
It's requiring patience, but
not genius I'd say, to do this.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:53.350
Now the question is, what
happens as nu goes to zero

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.910
and that the thing that
makes this worth presenting.

00:38:57.910 --> 00:39:01.680
What happens to
integrals like this?

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.700
I have an integral of
something and the exponentials

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:07.890
are both negative.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.060
I've somehow an
integral like this.

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:14.130
I have the integral of some
e to the minus something--

00:39:14.130 --> 00:39:21.070
I'll say B-- over nu ds.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:27.480
Do you see that the B
involves the U_0 over 2?

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:32.160
Well, let me put a 2*nu.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.650
This is really what I
have in this formula.

00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:42.570
Well, divided by this thing, so
let me put that 1 over square

00:39:42.570 --> 00:39:45.630
root outside.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:47.780
And remember, my
question is, what

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:49.850
happens as nu goes to zero?

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.180
Do you have any idea--
I mean, it's a mess.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.340
We do not want to
do this integration.

00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:03.750
It's an exact formula, but
not one I want to deal with.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:09.450
What I do want is to know what
happens as nu goes to zero.

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:13.730
And the main point is that nu is
showing up in the denominator.

00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:15.820
We have some quantity
in the numerator,

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.380
what is that quantity?

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:28.400
That quantity is U_0 plus this
x minus x squared over 2*nu*t--

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:35.220
over t, because-- in
fact, if we're lucky,

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.270
this B is exactly this quantity.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.940
This is exactly this bracket.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:50.490
That's, I think, my B, if I
change letter from s to y.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:53.780
If I'd been like
prepared in advance,

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.090
I wouldn't have
introduced y and s

00:40:56.090 --> 00:41:01.140
because they're both
just dummy variables

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:03.130
and they should
have been the same.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.960
You see that this
guy-- because, you

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.450
remember the change between
little u and capital U?

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.200
Capital U is just the integral.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.390
So that's U_0.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:24.200
And this is this x
minus y squared over 2t.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:32.010
I'm not sure if I've
got a 2 somewhere lost,

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:36.000
but we won't worry about that.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.060
The main point
that I want to make

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.580
is, how do you deal with
an integral like this?

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:46.280
Because this is like a major
topic in a more advanced course

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:52.800
on applied math, a more advanced
course on the analysis of

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.080
applied math, not the
numerical analysis.

00:41:58.850 --> 00:42:07.130
What's happening as nu goes to
zero= Well, as nu goes to zero,

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.300
this thing is
getting very large.

00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:15.270
e to the minus a
very large amount.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:20.320
So it's as near nothing
as you can imagine.

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.470
e to the minus a
very negative amount.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:25.550
But still, the total
is considered somehow,

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:29.920
and the question is, what's
the main leading term

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.500
in this quantity, and the
answer is, you look at the point

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:40.400
where B is a minimum.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:44.311
If B at one point is 1, than we
have an e to the minus 1 over

00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:44.810
2*nu.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:52.720
And compared to e to
the minus 100 over 2*nu,

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.980
the e to the minus 1
over 2*nu is way bigger.

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.170
So that in the end,
the contribution all

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:03.740
comes from the point
where B is a minimum.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:07.460
And that's what this formula
says we should look for.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:09.910
And if you figure out
what that contribution is,

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:15.440
and taking into account the
fact that we do have a 4*pi*nu*t

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.140
here-- without this, the whole
thing would just be going

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:25.000
to zero as nu goes to zero; this
e to the minus very negative

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:25.610
stuff is zero.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:33.000
But we have a nu here, so in the
end something nonzero emerges,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.810
but it emerges totally at this
point where B is a minimum

00:43:37.810 --> 00:43:42.090
and that's what this
formula has found.

00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:45.300
This is the minimum value of b.

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:49.530
OK, I won't track down further.

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:51.850
Do I remember the right word?

00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:55.260
Is it stationary phase?

00:43:55.260 --> 00:43:57.870
Did anybody meet these words?

00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:05.280
I'm speaking now about something
in the history of applied math.

00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:08.500
Still, those tools
that were created

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.460
over the pre-computer
years are still

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:16.890
extremely valuable to
understand what's going on

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:19.840
and this is just
an illustration.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:31.800
OK, that's my comments on the
limiting case of Burgers',

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:36.590
which is inviscid
Burgers', and we actually

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:43.440
used this form of the
equation as the first step

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:44.640
in linearization.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.760
As I say, it's quite
a nice exercise, now,

00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:58.050
to use this formula.

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.870
An explicit formula, which we,
last time, did not suspect.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.640
We were tracking down-- we
knew the problem was nonlinear

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:11.240
and were tracking
down shocks and fans.

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:15.310
Here's a formula that just
plain gives us the answer.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:19.710
So this gives us a shock
or a fan, whichever.

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:26.010
This has the right shock
speeds if there's a shock

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:29.390
and it has the right-- the
entropy condition is satisfied

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:34.330
because it was satisfied all
along as nu was going to zero.

00:45:34.330 --> 00:45:38.060
OK, so now do I want to
make some final comments

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:42.390
on this Korteweg-de
Vries-- KdV-- equation.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.020
I mean, that would be an
ideal numerical example.

00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:03.260
In fact, its importance
was discovered numerically.

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:05.510
One could say that this
is one of the biggest

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:13.810
contributions of numerical
simulation to the theory

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:16.020
of nonlinear PDEs.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:23.280
The discovery-- and it just came
out of the blue-- the discovery

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.360
that that particular
nonlinear equation was

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.320
what we might call integrable.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:38.220
That there is some
twist that produce

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.860
linear equations whose
solution give the answer

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.770
to this nonlinear equation.

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.160
Maybe what I ought
to say is, first

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.770
to tell you what those
numerical experiments were like.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:56.310
And people just like looked
at the answers and said,

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.430
can this be?

00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:00.990
OK, what were they like?

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.960
So we could find--
without much work,

00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:15.070
we could find solutions of the
form, of a traveling wave form.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:20.720
So we could find solutions that
have the form some function

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.690
of x minus c*t.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:34.320
If you plug that in, you
have then derivatives of f.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:36.370
You have an ordinary
differential equation for f,

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:41.220
and you can actually
find shapes, waves that

00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:44.760
travel following that equation.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:49.430
So of course, what you
can't do is add two of them

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:53.100
together and still have a
solution because the equation

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.430
is not linear.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:58.520
So everybody assumed, OK, people
had found these traveling waves

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.250
before and the
computer will-- if you

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.010
start with the right
initial condition,

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:06.290
the computer will
produce a traveling wave.

00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:09.190
If you start with the
right initial condition,

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.550
the computer will show
two traveling waves

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.570
at different speeds.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:19.480
This c will be different
from one wave to the other.

00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.590
So what will happen
as time goes forward?

00:48:21.590 --> 00:48:27.540
One wave will catch the other
one because it's going faster.

00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:31.100
So the shapes of
each wave are known.

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.330
I think it's 1 over
hyperbolic cosine squared.

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.660
So we have one wave
going with a different c,

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.640
going faster than another wave.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.800
We're computing along.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:53.070
The fast wave catches the
slow wave and they interact.

00:48:53.070 --> 00:48:56.420
Of course they interact because
the problem's nonlinear,

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.150
and you can't see what's
happening at the time

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:03.090
when the big one
catches the small one.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.480
But you can keep computing.

00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:10.380
And what happened was
that after this jumble

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:15.350
the fast wave emerged
with the same shape.

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.940
And the slow wave emerge
behind it with the same shape.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:24.160
And there was some lag of
course, some delay moment,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:26.830
which had been used
up in the jumble

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.510
as the one passed the other.

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:31.750
But they emerged
looking the same.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:37.980
I mean, that's sort of
like a linear property.

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:41.550
Not exactly, because you
couldn't just add them,

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:44.710
it wasn't perfect, but
the shapes were perfect.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:51.480
And that suggested that this
equation might have hidden

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:55.180
linearity that nobody noticed.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.830
And then finally
that was discovered.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.170
It was a search.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:03.230
People found
conservation laws, it's

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.120
easy to show that
the integral of u

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.110
is conserved by this equation.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:10.680
We've done that
a thousand times.

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.160
Then other integrals
are conserved

00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:16.910
and if you just
like to do algebra,

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.120
a short list of conserved
quantities: integral of u,

00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:24.910
integral of u squared and
a few others, not just

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.900
u cubed and u fourth, of course.

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.960
People were creating a list.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:33.090
And then somebody saw how
to get an infinite number

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.420
of integrals.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:40.470
So that was a suspicion that
the problem was integrable.

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:42.700
That if you could
find an infinite list

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:47.130
of conserved quantities,
conserved even

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:50.570
under this nonlinear
interaction term,

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.710
that somewhere
something was linear.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:56.670
And then eventually, a
change of variables-- well,

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:59.270
more than a change of
variables, a total twist

00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:06.670
was found to integrate it
and get an explicit answer.

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:09.520
That's more than I can
do, but I want to say,

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:12.070
of course, that
immediately set out

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:18.630
a mad search for other
nonlinear problems

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:22.980
that were in this sense
completely integrable.

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.480
And now, am I going to be able
to list some of the ones that

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.920
were discovered?

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.440
I think I can-- whoops--
not on that board.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:38.280
So I'll just end with the
completely integrable nonlinear

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.240
equations.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:45.860
And I don't know if
the list is complete;

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:50.860
the discovery of new ones
is like a major thing.

00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:53.490
So we have Korteweg-de Vries.

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.370
That was this the first.

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:58.430
Then there was a nonlinear
Schrodinger equation.

00:51:58.430 --> 00:52:02.450
And the solutions, I have to say
what the solutions are called.

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:06.480
Those waves that I
mentioned, which--

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.480
they're not quite
that bad-- are called

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:13.970
solitons, solitary waves.

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:16.870
And it was the interaction
of solitons and the fact

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.310
that they emerged
looking unchanged

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:24.600
that set off this horrific
effort to figure out

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.730
what was going on.

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:29.530
So I was going to write
nonlinear Schrodinger in here,

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:37.100
and without saying exactly
where the nonlinearity appears,

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:38.830
but you take
Schrodinger equation

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:45.360
and-- then oh, I'm
blanking out on other--

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:49.070
there are just a couple
more famous ones.

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:55.890
I'll put those
names into an e-mail

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:58.210
rather than stumble here.

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:02.880
OK, so that's a little
history, with no details,

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:07.770
of an incredibly special
class of nonlinear PDEs.

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:12.320
Well of course, the
Navier-Stokes equations

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.190
aren't on that list.

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:19.560
And we still don't
know, especially in 3D,

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:23.010
I guess that's one of the
million dollar Clay prizes,

00:53:23.010 --> 00:53:28.690
is to know whether the
Navier-Stokes equations have

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:30.580
a solution for all time.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:33.490
So that's one of these
seven famous prizes

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:38.260
of which one of the
seven, geometry analysis

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:42.230
prize, apparently that
problem has been solved.

00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:44.490
So there are six to
go and one of them

00:53:44.490 --> 00:53:49.230
is whether the Navier-Stokes
equations have solutions.

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:52.300
Actually, I'll just take one
more minute of your time.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:54.430
Thank you.

00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:58.070
People had, or somebody
had conjectured

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:01.160
some possible vortex
blow-up in which

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:07.570
maybe that was a case, that
was an example of nonexistence.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:12.110
We could find a particular
initial function

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:16.170
that created such a
blow up in a small space

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:22.210
that the Navier-Stokes
equations couldn't be continued.

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:25.820
But big numerical experiments,
just reported in the last

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:30.400
weeks, show that that
particular example,

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:37.310
that somebody thought might
prove nonexistence after

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:41.210
a finite time, doesn't.

00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:45.500
So it's back to the
drawing board, really.

00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:47.500
I don't see how
numerically we're ever

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:53.550
going to see that it does exist,
but this numerical experiment

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:59.130
was sufficiently clear to say
that that particular phenomenon

00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:02.930
that looked dangerous
didn't go wrong.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.870
OK, so next time,
it's a little more

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:11.440
about numerical solutions
of these equations

00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.660
and then about the
level set method.

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:20.150
And then, looking ahead,
we have a guest lecture

00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:23.830
on financial mathematics,
the PDEs of financial math,

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:28.570
for everybody who wants to go
to New York and make a billion.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:33.940
And then we're going
to very quickly

00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.410
be in the second
part of the course,

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:41.750
on solving large linear systems.

00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:43.920
OK, I'll see you Friday
then for level sets.

00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:44.420
Good.

00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:45.680
Thanks for your patience.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:55.770
Hi.

00:55:55.770 --> 00:55:56.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:56.690 --> 00:55:58.500
PROFESSOR: Of course I have.

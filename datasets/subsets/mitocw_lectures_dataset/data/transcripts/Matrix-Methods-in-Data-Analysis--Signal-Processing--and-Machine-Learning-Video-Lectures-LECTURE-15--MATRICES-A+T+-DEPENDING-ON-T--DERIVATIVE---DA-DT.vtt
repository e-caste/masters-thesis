00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.850
GILBERT STRANG: So I've
worked hard over the weekend.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.150
I figured out what I
was doing last time

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.260
and what I'm doing this
time and improved the notes.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.060
So you'll get a new set of
notes on the last lecture

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.720
and on this one.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.770
And I kind of got a better
picture of what we're doing.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.370
And that board is
aiming to describe

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.000
the large picture of what we're
doing last time and this time.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:01.250
So last time was about changes
in A inverse when A changed.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.710
This time is about changes
in eigenvalues and changes

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.890
in singular values
when A change.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.340
As you can imagine, this is a
natural important situation.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.060
Matrices move, and therefore,
their inverses change,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.360
their eigenvalues change,
their singular values change.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.870
And you hope for a formula.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.620
Well, so we did have a
formula for last time

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.730
for the change in
the inverse matrix.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.300
And I didn't get every u and
v transpose in the right place

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:52.560
in the video or in the
first version of the notes,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.040
but I hope that that formula,
that that Woodbury Morrison

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.040
formula will be
correct this time.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.740
So I won't go back
over that part.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.520
But I realize also there
is another question

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.050
that we can answer when
the change is very small,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.510
when the change in A is dA
or delta A, a small change.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.590
And that's, of course,
what calculus is about.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.370
So I have to sort of
parallel topics here.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:46.770
What is the derivative when
the change is infinitesimal?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.590
And what is the actual change
when the change is finite size?

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.250
So now, let me say what we
can do and what we can't do.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:08.140
Oh, I'll start out by figuring
out what the derivative is

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.980
for the inverse.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.890
So that's like
completing the last time

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.320
for infinitesimal changes.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.960
Then I'll move on to changes
in the eigenvalues and singular

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.220
values.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.330
And there, you cannot
expect an exact formula.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.110
We had a formula that was exact,
apart from any typos, for this.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.790
And we'll find a
formula for this,

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.520
and we'll find a formula
for that and for that.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.940
Well, that one will
come from this one.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.580
So this will be a
highlight today.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.505
How do the eigenvalues change
when the matrix changes?

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.710
But we won't be able
to do parallel to this,

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.310
we won't be able to--

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.770
oh, we will be able to do
something for finite changes.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.490
That's important.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.090
Mathematics would have to
keep hitting that problem

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.860
until it got somewhere.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.770
So I won't get an exact
formula for that change.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.000
That's too much.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.030
But I'll get inequalities.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.710
How big that change could be.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.580
What can I say about it?

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.769
So these are highly interesting.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.670
May I start with completing
the last lecture?

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.400
What is the derivative
of the inverse?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.420
So I'm thinking here,
so what's the setup?

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:38.430
The setup is my matrix
A depends on time, on t.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.030
And it has an inverse.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.940
A inverse depends on t.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.230
And if I know this
dependence, in other words,

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.950
if I know dA dt, how the
matrix is depending on t,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.840
then I hope I could
figure out what

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.010
the derivative of A inverse is.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.360
We should be able to do this.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.630
So let me just start with--

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.310
it's not hard and it
complements this one

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:18.770
by doing the calculus case,
the infinitesimal change.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.650
So I want to get to that.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.420
I can figure out
the change in A.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:43.010
And my job is to find the
derivative of A inverse.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:50.720
So here's a handy identity.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.090
Can I just put this here?

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.210
So here's my usual identity.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.890
So as last time, I start
with a finite change

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.935
because calculus always
does that, right.

00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:10.000
It starts with a delta
t and then it goes to 0.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.820
So here I am up at
a full size change.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:24.550
So I think that this is equal to
B inverse A minus B A inverse.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:30.340
And if it's true, it's
a pretty cool formula.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.190
And, look, it is true, because
over on this right-hand side,

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.880
I have B inverse
times A A inverse.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.780
That's the identity.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.640
So that's my B inverse.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.180
And I have the minus, the B
inverse B is the identity.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:44.230
There's A inverse.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.690
It's good, right?

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:52.180
So from that, well,
I could actually

00:06:52.180 --> 00:07:04.240
learn from that the rank of
this equals the rank of this.

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.340
That's a point that I
made from the big formula.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.470
But now, we can see it
from an easy formula.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.440
Everywhere here, I'm
assuming that A and B

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.300
are invertible matrices.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.300
So when I multiply by
an invertible matrix,

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.530
that does not change the rank.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:28.770
So those have the same ranks.

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.650
But I want to get
further than that.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.220
I want to find this.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:37.380
So how do I go?

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.820
How do I go forward
with that job

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:43.350
to find the derivative
of the inverse?

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:51.660
Well, I'm going to call
this a change in A inverse.

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:56.015
And over here, I'll
have B will be--

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.920
yeah, OK, let's see, am I right?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.670
Yeah.

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:07.630
So B inverse will be--

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:14.680
this is A plus delta A inverse.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.220
And this is-- well,
that's A minus B. So

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:29.680
that's really minus delta A.
From A to B is the change.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.429
Here, I'm looking at the
difference A minus B.

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.049
So it's minus a change.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.960
And here, I have A inverse.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:45.640
I haven't done anything
except to introduce this delta

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.240
and get B out of it
and brought delta in.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.130
Now, I'm going to do calculus.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:09:00.220
So I'm thinking of B as
there's a sort of a delta t.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:04.370
And I'm going to divide
by both sides by delta t.

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.830
I have to do this if I want--

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.840
and now, I'll let
delta t go to 0.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.030
So calculus appears.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:27.390
Finally, our-- I won't
say enemy calculus,

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:31.730
but there is a sort
of like competition

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.520
between linear
algebra and calculus

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.700
for college mathematics.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.260
Calculus has had far, far
too much time and attention.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.930
It like it gets three
or four semesters

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.440
of calculus for people who
don't get any linear algebra.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.260
I'm glad this won't be on the
video, but I'm afraid it will.

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.680
Anyway, of course, calculus
is fine in its place.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.450
So here's its place.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.270
Now let delta t go to 0.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.010
So what does this
equation become?

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.510
Then everybody knows that as
the limit of delta t goes to 0,

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.560
I replace deltas by--

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:25.270
so this delta A divided by
delta t that has a meaning.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.940
The top has a meaning and
the bottom has for me.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:33.580
But then the limit, it's the
ratio that has a meaning.

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:37.255
So dA by itself, I don't
attach a meaning to that.

00:10:37.255 --> 00:10:38.790
That's infinitesimal.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.720
It's the limit, so that's why
I wanted a delta over a delta

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.160
so I could do calculus.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.070
So what happens now
is delta t goes to 0.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.500
And, of course, as
delta t goes to 0,

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.720
that carries delta A to 0.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.160
So that becomes A inverse.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:01.390
And what does this approach
as delta t goes to 0?

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.710
dA dt with that minus sign.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.650
Oh, I've got to
remember the minus sign.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.890
The minus sign is in here.

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.060
So I'm bringing
out the minus sign.

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.380
Then this was A
inverse, as we had.

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.930
And that's dA dt.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.310
And that's A inverse.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.660
That's our formula,
a nice formula,

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:32.150
which sort of belongs
in people's knowledge.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:38.250
You recognize that if
A was a 1 by 1 matrix,

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:45.060
we could call it x, instead of
A. If A was a 1 by 1 matrix x,

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.830
then I'm saying the formula
for the derivative of 1

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.570
over x, right?

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.010
A inverse just 1 by 1
case is just 1 over x.

00:11:56.010 --> 00:12:00.120
So the derivative of 1-- or
maybe t, I should be saying.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:05.580
If A is just t, then the
derivative of 1 over t with

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.790
respect to t is....?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.680
Is minus 1 over t squared.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.010
The 1 by 1 case we know.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.330
That's what calculus does.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.640
And now we're able to
do the n by n case.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.520
So that's just like good.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:33.330
And then it's sort of parallel
to formulas like this, where

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.020
this delta A has not gone to 0.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.990
It's full size, but low rank.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.280
That was the point.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:44.880
Actually, the formula would
apply if the rank wasn't low.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:48.870
But the interest is
in low rank here.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.130
Are we good for this?

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.370
That's really the completion
of last time's lecture

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.500
with derivatives.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.530
OK, come back to here, to
the new thing now, lambdas.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:05.280
Let's focus on
lambdas, eigenvalues.

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.960
How does the eigenvalue change
when the matrix changes?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.960
How does the eigenvalue change
when the matrix changes?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.150
So I have two possibilities.

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:19.860
One is small change
when I'm doing calculus

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.530
and I'm letting a
delta t go to 0.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:27.570
The other is full
size, order 1 change,

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.130
where I will not
be able to give you

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.010
a formula for the
new lambdas, but I'll

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:36.120
be able to tell you
important facts about them.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:39.240
So this is today's lecture now.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:42.510
You could say that's the
completion of Friday's lecture.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.600
What about d lambda dt?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.590
It's a nice formula.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.300
Its proof is fun too.

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.920
I was very happy
about this proof.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.320
OK, so I guess calculus
is showing up here

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.760
on this middle board.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.910
So how do I start
with the eigenvalues?

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.260
Well, start with what I know.

00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:14.750
So these are facts,
you could say,

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:17.020
that I have to get the
eigenvalues into it.

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.230
And, of course, eigenvalues
have to come with eigenvectors.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:24.240
So I'll again use A of t.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.350
It will be depending on t.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:29.290
And an eigenvector
that depends on t

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.350
is an eigenvalue that
depends on t times

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.036
and eigenvector
that depends on t.

00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:36.990
Good?

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:42.580
That's fact one that we plan to
take the derivative of somehow.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:47.650
There's also a second fact
that comes into play here.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:52.520
What's the deal on the
eigenvalues of A transpose?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.270
They are the same.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.490
The eigenvalues of A
transpose are the same

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:58.110
as the eigenvalues of A.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.690
Are the eigenvectors the same?

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:01.860
Not usually.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.500
Of course, if the
matrix was symmetric,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.150
then A and A transpose
are just the same thing.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.620
So A transpose would
have that eigenvalue--

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.160
eigenvector.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.850
But, generally, it has
a different eigenvector.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:22.890
And really to keep a sort
of separate from this one,

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:24.530
let's call it y.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.970
It will have the
same eigenvalue.

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.590
I'm going to call it y.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.760
But I'm going to make it a row
vector, because A transpose is

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.270
what--

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.340
instead of writing
down A transpose,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.130
I'm going to stay with
A, but put the eigenvalue

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.240
on the left side.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.000
So here's is the eigenvalue--

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.260
eigenvector for A on the left.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:53.680
And it has the same eigenvalue
times that eigenvector.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:58.100
But that eigenvector is a
row eigenvector, of course.

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.230
This is an equality
between rows.

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:05.150
A row times my
matrix gives a row.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.450
So that's the eigenvalues of--

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:10.210
and it has the same eigenvalues.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:14.650
So this is totally parallel
to that, totally parallel.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.770
And maybe sort of less--

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:25.450
definitely less
seen, but it's just

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.970
the same thing for A transpose.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:30.910
Everybody sees that if I
transpose this equation,

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.400
then I've got something
that looks like that.

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.320
But I'd rather have it this way.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.960
Now, one more fact I need.

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:46.090
There is-- there has to
be some normalization.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.800
What should be the
length of these?

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.530
Right now, x could
have any length.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.750
y could have any length.

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:55.360
And there's a natural
normalization,

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.890
which is y transpose
times x equal to 1.

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.415
That normalizes the two.

00:17:05.415 --> 00:17:09.160
It doesn't tell me the length
of x or the length of y.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.089
But it tells me, the key
thing, the length of both.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:20.050
So what I've got there is
tracking along one eigenvalue

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.480
and its pair of eigenvectors.

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.480
And you're always welcome to
think of the symmetric case

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.400
when y and x are the same.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.740
And then I would call them q.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.360
Oh, well, I would call them q
if it was a symmetric matrix.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:39.850
So if it's a symmetric
matrix, both eigenvectors

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.350
would be called q.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.413
And this would be
saying that q is a--

00:17:44.413 --> 00:17:45.330
AUDIENCE: Unit vector.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:47.070
GILBERT STRANG:
Unit vector, right.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.640
So this is all stuff we know.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:55.910
And actually, maybe I should
write it in matrix notation,

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:57.140
because it's important.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.350
That's for one eigenvector.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:09.650
This is for all of them at once.

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:11.120
Everybody's with it?

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.120
The x's are the columns of x.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.620
And lambda is the diagonal
matrix of lambdas.

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.750
And it has to sit on
the right so that it

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:24.190
will multiply those columns.

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.120
So this is like all
eigenvectors at once.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.310
What would this one be?

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:39.390
This would be like y
transpose A equals A--

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:41.690
AUDIENCE: y transpose inverse?

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:43.110
GILBERT STRANG: y
transpose, yes--

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:47.100
equals-- and probably
these are multiplied--

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.460
I feel wrong if I
write y transpose here.

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:58.260
Like here, the x was on
the right and on the left.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:06.310
And I'll-- oh, yeah,
y transpose, yeah.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:10.110
OK, so what do I put?

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.407
Lambda y transpose.

00:19:12.407 --> 00:19:12.907
Thanks.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:18.970
And what do I put here?

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.200
What does this translate to if
this was for one eigenvector?

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.060
For all of them
at once, it's just

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.747
going to translate to y
transpose x equal the identity.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.540
This is pretty basic stuff.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:37.770
But stuff somehow we don't
always necessarily see.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:38.840
Those are the key facts.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:46.900
And now, I plan to
take the derivative,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.690
take the derivative
of respect to lambda.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:53.500
Oh, I can derive one more fact.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.800
So this would be a formula.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.870
This is formula 1.

00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:06.210
Formula 1 just says, what do I
get if I hit this on the left

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.530
by y transpose?

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.560
Can I do that?

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:18.960
y transpose of t A of t x
of t equals lambda of t.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.530
That's a number.

00:20:20.530 --> 00:20:30.090
So I can always bring that out
in front of the inner product

00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:32.684
of vector notation.

00:20:32.684 --> 00:20:37.470
Are you good for that?

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:43.780
I'm pleading like everything
I've done is totally OK.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.660
And now, I have a improvement
to make on this right-hand side,

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:51.110
which is...?

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.690
So what is y transpose times x?

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:54.190
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.440
GILBERT STRANG: It's 1.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.890
So let's remember that.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:57.390
It's 1.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:07.720
So in other words, I have got
a formula for lambda of t.

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.070
As time changes,
the matrix changes.

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:14.550
Its eigenvalues change
according to this formula.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:18.130
Its eigenvectors change
according of this formula.

00:21:18.130 --> 00:21:23.760
And its left eigenvectors change
according to that formula.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:27.990
So everything here
is above board.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.610
And now, what's the point?

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:38.450
The point is I'm going to
find this, the derivative.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.620
So I'm going to take the
derivative of that equation

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.330
and see what I get.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.260
That'll be the formula for the
derivative of an eigenvalue.

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:52.450
And amazingly, it's
not that widely known.

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:56.500
Of course, it's classical,
but it's not always

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.210
part of courses.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:02.160
So this is as time varies,
the matrix varies, A.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.200
And therefore, its
eigenvalues vary,

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.360
and its eigenvectors vary.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.960
So we're going to
find d lambda dt.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.210
It's one level of
difficulty more

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:18.670
to find dx dt, the
derivative of the eigenvector

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.300
or the second derivative
of the eigenvalue.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.570
Those kind of come together.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:24.470
And I'm not going to go there.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:27.280
I'm just going to do the
one great thing here--

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:30.020
take the derivative
of that equation.

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:31.080
Shall I do it over there?

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.060
So here we go.

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.480
So I want to
compute d lambda dt.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:44.378
And I'm using this
formula for lambda there.

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:53.726
So I've got three
things that depend on t.

00:22:53.726 --> 00:22:56.290
And I'm taking the
derivative of their product.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.400
So I'm going to use
the product rule.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.440
I'll apply the product
rule to that derivative.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:13.230
Take the derivative of the
first guy times A times x.

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:34.330
Take the derivative of the
second guy times the second guy

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.010
and the third guy.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:42.990
y transpose of t A of t dx dt.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:51.920
OK?

00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:57.160
We are one minute away
from a great formula.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:00.790
And I'm really happy if
you allow me to say it.

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:05.710
That that formula comes
by just taking those facts

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:09.670
we know, putting them
together into this expression

00:24:09.670 --> 00:24:13.450
that we also know, and
this is like lambda

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.470
equals x inverse Ax.

00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:21.740
That's a diagonalizing thing
and then taking the derivative.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.820
So what do I get if I
take that derivative?

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:31.677
Well, this term
I'm going to keep.

00:24:31.677 --> 00:24:33.010
I'm not going to play with that.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.520
Everybody is clear?

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.710
That's a number.

00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:44.770
Here's a matrix.

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.350
dA dt is a matrix.

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:52.250
I take the derivative
of every entry in A.

00:24:52.250 --> 00:24:57.510
Here's its column
vector, its eigenvector.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.770
And here's a row vector.

00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:03.150
So row times matrix times
column is a number, 1 by 1.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:07.040
And actually, that's my answer.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:07.910
That's my answer.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:15.080
So I'm saying that these two
terms cancel each other out

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.000
as those two terms
added to zero.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.060
This is the right answer
for the derivative.

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:25.640
That's a nice formula.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:31.250
So to find the derivative
of an eigenvalue,

00:25:31.250 --> 00:25:36.500
the matrix is changing, you
multiply by the eigenvector

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.260
and by the left eigenvector.

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:39.960
It gives you a number.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.220
And that's the d lambda dt.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:49.060
So why do those
two guys add to 0?

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.280
That's all that remains here.

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.240
And then this topic is ended
with this nice formula.

00:25:57.380 --> 00:26:00.840
So I want to simplify that,
simplify that, and show

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.150
that they cancel each other.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.950
So what is Ax?

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.520
It's lambda x.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.910
So this guy is nothing
but it's lambda

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:23.430
that depends on time of course
times dy dt dy transpose dt.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.685
I'm just copying that.

00:26:24.685 --> 00:26:27.520
Ax is lambda x.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.590
Sorry, I didn't mean
to make that look hard.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.310
You OK with that?

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.110
Ax is lambda x.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:41.010
And I am perfectly safe,
because lambda is just a number

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:42.670
to bring it out to the left.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:45.870
So it doesn't look
like it's in the way.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:47.220
And what about this other term?

00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.150
So I have y transpose--

00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:56.090
oh, y transpose A, what's that?

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:00.980
What's y transpose A?

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.770
That's the combination
that I know.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:09.320
y transpose A, y is that
left eigenvalue. y transpose

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.150
A brings out a lambda.

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:19.390
So this also brings out a lambda
times y transpose times dx dt.

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.020
OK?

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.400
I just use Ax equal
lambda x there.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.670
It was really nothing.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:33.990
Now, what do I do?

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.460
I want this to be 0.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.170
Can you see it happening?

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:40.600
It's a great pleasure
to see it happening.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.060
So what do I have here?

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.248
What's my first step now?

00:27:44.248 --> 00:27:45.490
AUDIENCE: Like take lambda--

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:48.170
GILBERT STRANG:
Bring lambda outside.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.130
That's not 0.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.780
We don't know what that is.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.240
Bring lambda outside there
times the whole thing.

00:27:57.650 --> 00:28:01.040
So for some wonderful
reason I believe

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:05.240
that this number, which is
a row times a column, a row

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.540
times a column,
two terms there, I

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:14.170
believe they knock each other
out and that result is 0.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:16.024
And why?

00:28:16.024 --> 00:28:18.070
Why?

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.980
Because I come back to--

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.710
this board has all that I know.

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:27.490
And here's y transpose
times x equal 1.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.330
And how does that help me?

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.782
Because what I'm seeing in that
square, in those brackets is?

00:28:34.782 --> 00:28:36.490
AUDIENCE: The derivative
of y transpose--

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:39.850
GILBERT STRANG: The derivative
of the y transpose x.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:41.750
So it's the derivative of?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:42.250
AUDIENCE: 1

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.000
GILBERT STRANG: 1.

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.170
Therefore, 0.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:50.430
So this is the derivative of 1.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:51.490
It equals 0.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.130
Those two terms
knock each other out

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:57.650
and leave just the nice
term that we're seeing.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.380
So the derivative
of the eigenvalue,

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:04.690
just to have one more look
at it before we leave it.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.120
The derivative of the
eigenvalue is this formula.

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.640
It's the rate at
which the matrix

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.120
is changing times the
eigenvectors on right and left.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.170
Sometimes they're called
the right eigenvector

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:23.880
and the left eigenvector
at the time t.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:28.260
So we're not saying
in this d lambda dt.

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:33.930
In other words, I
get a nice formula,

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.170
which doesn't involve the
derivative of the eigenvector.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:39.120
That's the beauty of it.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.650
If I want to go up to
take the next step--

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:47.580
I tried this weekend,
but it's a mess.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.310
It would be to take the--

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:53.640
so this is my formula then,
d lambda dt equals this.

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:57.240
And I can take the next
derivative of that,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:01.350
and it will involve
d second dt squared.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:05.400
But it will also
involve dx dt and dy dt.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:10.230
And in fact, a pseudo
inverse even shows up.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:18.060
It's another step, and I'm not
going that far, because we've

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:20.570
got the best formula there.

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:29.620
So now that has
answered this question.

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:33.440
And I could answer that
question the same way.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:37.750
It would involve A transpose
A and the singular vectors,

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:42.190
instead of involving A
and the eigenvectors.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.068
Maybe that's a
suitable exercise.

00:30:45.068 --> 00:30:45.610
I don't know.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.380
I haven't done it myself.

00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:53.560
What I want to do
is this, now say,

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.590
what can we say about the
change in the eigenvalue--

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.670
and I'll just stay first
of all with eigenvalue--

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:08.040
when the change is like rank 1?

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.830
This is a perfect example
when the change is rank 1.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:26.350
So what can we say
about the eigenvalues--

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:31.330
let's take the top, the largest
eigenvalue, or all of them,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.390
all of them, lambda
j, all of them--

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:44.490
of A plus a rank 1
matrix uv transpose.

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:53.110
Oh, let's do the nice
case here, the nice case,

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:57.000
because if I allow a general
matrix A, I have to worry about

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.100
does it have enough
eigenvectors?

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:00.150
Can it diagonalize?

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.220
All that stuff.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.815
Let's make it a
symmetric matrix.

00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:12.500
And let's make the rank
1 change symmetric too.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:18.320
So the question is, what can
I say about the eigenvalues

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.670
after a rank 1 change?

00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:22.520
So again, this
isn't calculus now,

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.370
because the change
that I'm making

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:32.520
is a true vector and
not a differential.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.340
And I'm not going to
have an exact formula

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.670
for the new
eigenvalues, as I said.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:46.380
But what I am going to do is
write down the beautiful facts

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.100
that are known about that.

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.760
And here they are.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.930
So, first of all,
the eigenvalues

00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:58.130
are in descending order.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:01.040
We use descending order
for singular values.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.170
Let's use them also
for eigenvalues.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:07.400
So lambda 1 is greater
or equal to lambda 2,

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:10.230
greater or equal to
lambda 3, and so on.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.870
Oh, give me-- give me an idea.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:26.690
What do you expect from
that rank 1 change?

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:29.870
So that change is rank 1.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.330
Can you tell me any more about
that change, u u transpose?

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:36.337
What kind of a matrix
is u u transpose?

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:43.300
It's rank 1, but
we can say more.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.480
It is...?

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.110
AUDIENCE: Symmetrical.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:48.290
GILBERT STRANG:
Symmetric, of course.

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.140
And it is...?

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:49.640
Yeah?

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.973
AUDIENCE: Positive semidefinite.

00:33:50.973 --> 00:33:53.100
GILBERT STRANG:
Positive semidefinite.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:54.480
Positive semidefinite.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.465
This is a positive change.

00:33:56.465 --> 00:34:03.265
u u transpose is the typical
rank 1 positive semidefinite.

00:34:03.265 --> 00:34:04.640
It couldn't be
positive definite,

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.950
because it's only got rank 1.

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.460
What's the eigenvector
of that matrix?

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:13.000
Let's just-- why not here?

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.199
We can do this in two seconds.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.830
So u u transpose,
that's the matrix

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.020
I'm asking you to think about.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:25.219
And it's a full n by n
matrix, column times a row.

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:27.690
Tell me an eigenvector
of that matrix.

00:34:27.690 --> 00:34:28.190
Yes?

00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.820
AUDIENCE: u.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:29.570
GILBERT STRANG: u.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:35.190
If I multiply my matrix by
u, I get-- what do I get?

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:37.969
I get some number times u.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.770
And what is that number lambda?

00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:41.600
AUDIENCE: u transpose u.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.570
GILBERT STRANG: That lambda
happens to be u transpose u.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:49.280
So that's different
from u u transpose.

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.760
This is a matrix.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.030
This is 18.065 now.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.650
That's a number.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:58.540
And what can you tell
me about that number?

00:34:58.540 --> 00:34:59.290
It is...?

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.060
AUDIENCE: Greater
than or equal to 0.

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.290
GILBERT STRANG: Greater--
well, even more.

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:04.670
Greater than 0.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.090
Greater, because this
is a true vector here.

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:10.250
So this is greater than 0.

00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:12.920
It's the only eigenvalue--
all the other eigenvalues

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:16.440
of that rank 1 matrix are zero.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.740
But the one non-zero eigenvalue
is over on the plus side.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.580
It's u transpose u.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:26.510
We all recognize that as
the length of u squared.

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:29.540
It's certainly positive.

00:35:29.540 --> 00:35:32.690
So we do have a positive
semidefinite definite matrix.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:39.760
What would your guess be of the
effect on the eigenvalues of A?

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.230
So I'm coming back
to my real problem--

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:45.080
eigenvalues of S,
sorry, S. Symmetric

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.240
matrices, I'm saying symmetric.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:51.090
What is your guess if I
have a symmetric matrix

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:53.960
and I add on u u transpose?

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.840
What do you imagine that
does to the eigenvalues?

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.340
You're going to get it right.

00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:01.120
Just say it.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:05.320
What happens to the eigenvalues
of S if I add on u u transpose?

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.100
They will...?

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.380
AUDIENCE: More positive.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.330
GILBERT STRANG: They'll
be more positive.

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:10.300
They'll go up.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.970
This is a positive thing.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:15.320
It's like adding
17 to something.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:16.920
It moves up.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.010
So therefore, what
I believe is--

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:30.590
so I've got two sets
of eigenvalues now.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.170
One is the eigenvalues of s.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:36.650
The other is the different
eigenvalues of S.

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.190
So I can't call them both
lambdas or I'm in trouble.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:50.540
So do you have a favorite
other Greek letter

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.310
for the eigenvalues of S?

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:53.430
AUDIENCE: Gamma.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.000
GILBERT STRANG: Gamma.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.215
OK, gamma.

00:36:57.215 --> 00:36:58.590
As long as you
say a Greek letter

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.630
that I have some
idea how to write.

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:04.710
Zeta, it seems to me, is like
the world's toughest letter

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.220
to write.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:09.300
And electrical engineers
can coolly flush off a zeta.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:13.440
I've never succeeded.

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.260
So I'll write--
what did you say?

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:17.070
AUDIENCE: Gamma.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:22.980
GILBERT STRANG: Gamma
j of the original.

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.150
So those are the
eigenvalues of the original.

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.580
These are the eigenvalues
of the modified.

00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:33.130
And we're expecting the lambdas
to be bigger than the gammas.

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.200
So that's just a
qualitative statement.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.410
And it's true.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:44.190
Each lambda is bigger
than the gamma.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:48.600
Sorry, yeah, yeah, each
lambda, by adding this stuff,

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.390
the lambdas are bigger than--
so I'll just write that.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:53.040
Lambdas are bigger than gammas.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:07.840
And that's a fundamental
fact, which we could prove.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.880
But a little more is known.

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.450
Of course, the question
is, how much bigger?

00:38:13.450 --> 00:38:17.770
How much can they be way bigger?

00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:19.540
Well, I don't believe
they could be bigger

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.680
by more than that number myself.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.250
But there's just
better news than that.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.550
So the lambdas are
bigger than the gammas.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.540
So lambda 1 is
bigger than gamma 1.

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:41.800
So this is the S plus
u u transpose matrix.

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:45.160
And these are the
eigenvalues of the S matrix.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.260
Lambda 1 is bigger than gamma 1.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:52.450
But look what's happening
in this line of text here.

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.640
I'm saying that gamma 1--

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.150
that lambda 2 is
smaller than gamma 1.

00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:59.410
Isn't that neat?

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:01.960
The eigenvalues go up.

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.752
But they don't just
like go anywhere.

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:15.135
And that's called interlacing.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:25.240
So this is one of those
wonderful theorems that

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:34.140
makes your heart happy, that
if I do I rank one change

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.580
and it's a positive change,
then the eigenvalues increase,

00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:41.880
but they don't increase--

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:45.800
the new eigenvalue is below
the new second eigenvalue.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.280
It doesn't pass up the
old, first eigenvalues.

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.150
And the new third
eigenvalue doesn't pass up

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.380
the old second eigenvalue.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.690
So that's the
interlacing theorem

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:06.490
that's associated with the
names of famous math guys.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:10.900
And of course you have
to say that's beautiful.

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:14.350
While we're writing
down such a theorem,

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.930
make a guess of what
the theorem would

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:23.280
be if I do a rank 2 change.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:31.220
Suppose I do an S,
staying symmetric.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:34.200
And I do a rank 1 change.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:37.770
But then I also do a rank 2
change, say w w transpose.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:43.830
So what's the deal here?

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:50.370
What do I know about the change
matrix, the delta S here?

00:40:50.370 --> 00:40:53.840
I know its rank is 2.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.230
I'm assuming u and w are
not in the same direction.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:40:59.990
So that's a rank 2 matrix.

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.120
And what can you tell me about
the eigenvalues of that rank 2

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:03.620
matrix?

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:09.630
So it's got n eigenvalues
because it's an n by n matrix.

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:14.160
But how many non-zero
eigenvalues has it got?

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:17.926
Two, because its rank is 2.

00:41:17.926 --> 00:41:21.140
The rank tells you the number
of non-zero eigenvalues

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:23.540
when matrices are symmetric.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.990
It doesn't tell you enough.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.720
If matrices are unsymmetric,
eigenvalues can be weird.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:32.710
So stay symmetric here.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:38.010
So this has two
non-zero eigenvalues.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.110
And can you tell me their sign.

00:41:41.110 --> 00:41:44.140
Is that matrix
positive semidefinite?

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.700
Yes, of course, it is.

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.600
Of course.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.350
So this was and this was.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.860
And together it certainly is.

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:59.160
So now, I've added a rank 2
positive semidefinite matrix.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.890
And now, I'm not going
to rewrite this line,

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:06.530
but what would you
expect to be true?

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.140
You would expect that
the eigenvalues increase.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.610
But how big could gamma--

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:20.360
yeah, so gamma 2,
let's follow gamma 2.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.470
Well, maybe I
should use another--

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:29.070
do the Greeks have any other
letters than lambda and gamma.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.253
They must had--

00:42:30.253 --> 00:42:30.960
AUDIENCE: Zeta.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.793
GILBERT STRANG: Who?

00:42:31.793 --> 00:42:33.420
C?

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.760
Hell with that.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.150
Who knows one I can write?

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:37.920
AUDIENCE: Alpha.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:38.837
GILBERT STRANG: Alpha.

00:42:38.837 --> 00:42:39.600
Good, alpha.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.620
Yes, alpha.

00:42:40.620 --> 00:42:41.220
Right.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:50.615
So alpha is the eigenvalues
of this rank 2 change.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.420
OK.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:59.000
Now, what am I going
to be able to say?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.400
Can I say anything about the--

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:08.640
well, of course, alpha 1
is bigger than lambda 1,

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.860
which was bigger than--

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.140
eigenvalues are going up, right?

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.270
I'm adding positive definite
or positive semidefinite stuff.

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:19.500
There's no way eigenvalues
can start going down on me.

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:24.000
So alpha 1 is a greater
or equal to the lambda

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.180
1, which had just a
rank 1 change, which

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.280
is greater or equal to the--

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.230
mu, was it mu?

00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:34.353
AUDIENCE: Gamma.

00:43:34.353 --> 00:43:35.270
GILBERT STRANG: Gamma.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:42.140
Gamma 1, and so on.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:50.370
OK, now, let's see, is
gamma 1 bigger than alpha--

00:43:50.370 --> 00:43:54.050
what am I struggling
to write down here?

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:57.160
What could I say?

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:00.170
Well, what can I
say that reflects

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:07.440
the fact that this lambda 2--

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:12.200
or sorry, so gamma 1 went up.

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.150
Gamma 1 was bigger
than lambda 2.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:15.890
That was the point here.

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:17.050
Gamma 1 is bigger.

00:44:17.050 --> 00:44:20.540
So this was a sort of easy,
because I'm adding stuff.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.830
I expected the lambda to go up.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:26.660
This is where the theorem
is that it didn't go up

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:28.830
so far as to pass--

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:32.240
or sorry, the lambda
2, which went up,

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.180
didn't pass up gamma 1.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.580
Lambda 2 didn't pass up gamma 1.

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.850
And now let me write
those words down.

00:44:40.850 --> 00:44:45.170
Now the alpha 2--

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:48.260
well, could alpha
2 pass up lambda 1?

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:53.000
And what about alpha 3?

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.680
Let me say what I believe.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:08.020
I think alpha 2, which is like
1 behind, but I'm adding rank 2,

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:12.270
I think alpha 2 could
pass up lambda 1.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:13.440
It could pass lambda 1.

00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:15.270
But alpha 3 can't.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:21.260
I believe that alpha 3 is
smaller than lambda 1--

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:26.300
smaller than gamma
1, the original.

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:26.960
Got it.

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.680
Anyway, I'll get it
right in the notes.

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.290
You know what
question I'm asking.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:44.860
And for me, that's
the important thing.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.560
Now, there is a little
matter of why is this true?

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.460
This is the good case.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:54.700
Let me give you another
example of interlacing.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:55.810
Can I do that?

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.830
It really comes
from this, but let

00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:02.220
me give you another example
that's just striking.

00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:10.390
So I have a symmetric
matrix, n by n.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:18.260
Call it S. And then I throw
away the last row and column.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.875
So in here is S n minus 1.

00:46:20.875 --> 00:46:24.250
The big matrix was Sn.

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:26.516
This one is of size n minus 1.

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:31.900
So it's got sort of
less degrees of freedom,

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:36.370
because the last degree
of freedom got removed.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:39.040
And what do you think
about the eigenvalues

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.670
of the n minus 1
eigenvalues of this

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.670
and the n eigenvalues of that?

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:46.740
They interlace.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.370
So this has eigenvalue lambda 1.

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:57.990
This would have an
eigenvalue smaller than that.

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:01.710
This would have an
eigenvalue lambda 2.

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:06.900
This would have an eigenvalue
smaller than that and so on.

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.120
Just the same
interlacing and basically

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.850
for the same reason,
that when you--

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:19.440
this reduction to
size n minus 1 is

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.070
like I'm saying xn has
to be 0 in the energy

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.380
or any of those expression.

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:32.370
And the fact of making xn be 0
is like one constraint, taking

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.380
one degree of freedom away.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:38.220
It reduces the eigenvalues,
but not by two.

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:44.180
OK, now I have
one final mystery.

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:47.650
And let me try to tell you what.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:48.750
It worried me.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:55.070
Now what is it that worried me?

00:47:55.070 --> 00:48:06.350
Yes, suppose this change, this
u, this change that I'm making,

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:11.930
suppose it's actually the
second eigenvector of S.

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.325
So can I write this down?

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:26.180
Suppose u is actually the
second eigenvector of S.

00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.370
What do I mean by that?

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:33.350
So I mean that S times
u is lambda 2 times u.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:40.530
Now, I'm going to change it.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:45.860
S plus u u transpose, that's
what I've been looking at.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.580
And that moves the
eigenvalues up.

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:51.010
But what worries me is
like if I multiply this

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:57.550
by 20, some big
number, I'm going

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:03.340
to move that eigenvalue
way up, way past.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:08.900
I got worried about
this inequality.

00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:17.090
When I add this, that same
u is lambda 2 plus 20 u.

00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:22.120
Su is lambda 2u.

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.350
And this 20 is 20.

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.490
u is a unit vector.

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:30.380
So you see my worry?

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.460
Here, I'm doing a rank 1 change.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:39.080
But it's moved an
eigenvalue way, way up.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:45.650
So how could this
statement be true?

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:50.330
So I've just figured
out here what gamma--

00:49:50.330 --> 00:49:54.170
well, do you see my question?

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.680
I could leave it as a
question to answer next time.

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.170
Let me do that.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:04.620
And I'll put it online
so you'll see it clearly.

00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:11.290
It looks like and it happens
this eigenvector now has

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.710
eigenvalue lambda 2 plus 20.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:19.170
Why doesn't that blow
away this statement?

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:24.360
I'll put that, because it's sort
of coming with minus 10 seconds

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:29.280
to go in the class, so let's
leave that and a discussion

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.100
of this for next time.

00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:35.320
But I'm happy with this
lecture if you are.

00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:38.670
Last lecture I got
u's and v's mixed up.

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:40.500
And it's not reliable.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.940
Here, I like the
proof of the lambda dt

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.800
and we're started
on this topic 2.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.300
Good.

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:50.150
Thank you.

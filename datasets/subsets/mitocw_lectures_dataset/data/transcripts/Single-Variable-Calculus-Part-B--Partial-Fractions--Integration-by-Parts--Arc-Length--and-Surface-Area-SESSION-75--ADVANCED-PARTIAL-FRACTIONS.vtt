00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.380
Hi.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.000
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.710
You've been talking in
class about partial fraction

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.670
decomposition as a
tool for integration.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.970
So remember that the point of
partial fraction decomposition

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.220
is that whenever you have a
rational function, that is,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.010
one polynomial divided by
another, that in principle,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.830
partial fraction
decomposition lets

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.720
you write any such expression as
a sum of things, each of which

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.480
is relatively easy to integrate.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.800
So the technique here
is purely algebraic.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.920
And then you just
apply integral rules

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.560
that we've already learned.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.892
So I have here four
rational functions for you.

00:00:44.892 --> 00:00:46.600
And what I'd like you
to do in each case,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.670
is try to decompose it
into the general form

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.800
that Professor
Jerison taught you.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.370
So don't, I'm not asking
you to-- if you'd like,

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.610
you're certainly welcome
to go ahead and compute

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.330
the antiderivatives after
you do that, but I'm

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.150
not going to do it
for you, or I'm not

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.450
going to ask you to do it.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.908
So what I'd like
you to do, though,

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:08.560
is for each of these
four expressions,

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.730
to break it out into the
form of the partial fraction

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:13.534
decomposition.

00:01:13.534 --> 00:01:15.950
So why don't you take a few
minutes to do that, come back,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.658
and you can check your
work against mine.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:27.380
All right.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.970
Welcome back.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.220
Hopefully you had some
fun working on these.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.880
They're a little
bit tricky, I think,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.920
or I've picked them to
be a little bit tricky.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.720
So let's go through
them one by one.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.425
I guess I'll start
with the first one.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:49.800
So with the first one, I have
x squared minus 4x plus 4

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.930
over x squared minus 8x.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.360
Now, the first thing to do when
you start the partial fraction

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.200
method, is that
you have to check

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.360
that the degree of
the numerator is

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.190
smaller than the degree
of the denominator.

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.520
Now in this case,
that's not true.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.720
The degree on top is 2, and
the degree on bottom is 2.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.020
So we need to do long division.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.470
Or you know, we need
to do something-- well,

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.860
long division is the usual
and always-- usual way,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.400
and always works-- in order to
reduce the degree of the top

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.460
here so that it's smaller
than the degree at the bottom.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.910
Now, I've done
this ahead of time,

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.010
and it's not too hard
to check that this

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:41.290
is equal to 1 plus 4x plus
4 over x squared minus 8x.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.850
It's a relatively easy long
division to do in any case.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:46.610
So OK.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.260
So what we get after we
do that process is we

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.180
get something in front
that's always a polynomial.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.630
And that's good,
because remember,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.620
our goal is to, you know,
manipulate this into a form

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.650
where we can integrate
it, and polynomials

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.790
are easy to integrate.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.230
So then we usually just forget
about this for the time being.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.930
And what we want to
do is partial fraction

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.850
decompose the second part.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.250
So to do that, the first
thing you need to do,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.880
once you've got a smaller
degree on top than downstairs,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.740
is that you factor
the denominator.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.310
So in this case, I'm
going to keep the 1 plus,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.260
just so I can keep
writing equals signs

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.060
and be honest about it.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.370
But really, our focus
now is just entirely

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.420
on this second summand.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.000
So this is equal to 1
plus 4x plus 4 is on top.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.640
And OK, so we need to factor
the denominator, if possible.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.164
And in this case, that's
not only possible.

00:03:40.164 --> 00:03:41.330
It's pretty straightforward.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.940
We can factor out an
x from both terms,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.660
and we see that
the denominator is

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.540
x times x-- whoops-- minus 8.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.050
OK.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.320
Now, in this case, this
is the simplest situation

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.980
for partial fraction
decomposition.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.990
We have the denominator
is a product

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.110
of distinct linear factors.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.610
So when the denominator
is a product

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.430
of distinct linear factors,
what we get this is equal to,

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:12.195
what the partial fraction
theorem tells us we can write,

00:04:12.195 --> 00:04:18.100
is that this is equal to
something, some constant,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.240
over the first factor
plus some constant

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.490
over the second factor.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.980
Now, if you had, you know,
three factors, then you'd

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.050
have three of these terms,
one for each factor,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.350
if they were distinct
linear factors.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.960
So great.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.620
OK.

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.185
Now we can apply
the cover up method

00:04:38.185 --> 00:04:39.560
that Professor
Jerison taught us.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.480
So again, the 1 doesn't
really matter here.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.880
You can just ignore it.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.610
So we have this is
equal to this sum,

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.770
and we want to find the values
of A and B that make this true.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.720
And then once we have values
of A and B that make this true,

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.310
the resulting expression
will be all set to integrate.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.000
Right?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.550
This will just be easy.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.360
It's just a polynomial,
in fact, just a constant.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.460
This is going to
give us a logarithm,

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.580
and this is going to
give us a logarithm.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.440
So once we find these
constants A and B,

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.407
we're all set to integrate.

00:05:09.407 --> 00:05:11.240
So OK, so how does the
cover up method work?

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:15.590
Well, so you cover up
one of the factors.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.850
In this case, x.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.390
And you cover up,
on the other side,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:24.680
everything that doesn't have x
in the denominator, and also x.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.450
And then you go
back here, and you

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:30.420
plug in the appropriate values,
you know, the x minus whatever.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.170
So in this case,
that's x equals 0.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.160
And so over here, you
get 4 over minus 8.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:43.890
So that gives us A is equal
to 4 divided by negative 8,

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.890
which is minus a half.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:50.300
And now we can do the same
thing with the x minus 8 part.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.330
So we cover up x
minus 8, we cover up

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:56.220
everything that doesn't
have an x minus 8 in it.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.390
So we've got, on the
right-hand side, we get B,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.080
and on the left hand side,
we have to plug in 8 here.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:07.650
So we plug 4 times 8 plus 4,
which is 32 plus-- it's 36,

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.870
and divided by eight, so
that's 36 divided by 8

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.480
is 9 divided by 2.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.060
So once you've got these
values of A and B-- OK.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.890
So our original
expression, now we

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:27.800
substitute in these
values of A and B,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.180
then we know that this
is is a true equality,

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.670
and then the integration
of this expression

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.150
is just reduced completely
to the integration

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.430
of this easy-to-integrate
expression.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.930
OK?

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.020
And so this is the partial
fraction decomposition here,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:46.230
with, you know A equals minus a
half, and B equals nine halves.

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.200
So that's part (a).

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.060
Let's go on to part (b).

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.720
I have to remind myself
what part (b) is.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.220
OK.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:58.690
So part (b) is x squared divided
by x plus 2 to the fourth.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.660
So in this case,
in the denominator,

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.450
we still have only
linear factors,

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.280
but we have repeated factors.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.080
And I mean, this is actually
a particularly simple example,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.960
where we have only one factor,
but it's repeated four times.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:20.460
Right?

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:21.430
Fourth power.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.790
So when you have that
situation, the partial fraction

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.620
decomposition looks a
little bit different.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.130
And so what you get is that you
have, for every repeated power,

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.070
so for each-- this one
appears four times,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.130
so you get four summands
on the right-hand side,

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.180
with increasing powers
of this linear factor.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.420
So with increasing
powers of x minus 1.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.920
So this is going to be
A-- or sorry, x plus 1.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:53.960
A over x plus 1
plus B over x plus 1

00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:04.890
squared plus C over x plus
1 cubed plus D over x plus 1

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:05.560
to the fourth.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.330
Now remember, even
though the degree here

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.690
goes up in these later summands,
what stays on top is the same.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:15.460
It just stays a constant.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.500
If this were a quadratic
factor, it would stay linear.

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:22.430
The top doesn't increase
in degree when do this.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.920
And a good simple way
to check that you've

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.646
got the right-- you know, before
you solve for the constants,

00:08:29.646 --> 00:08:32.020
make sure you've got the
correct abstract decomposition--

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:36.890
is to count the number
of these constants

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.170
that you're looking for.

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:41.380
It should always
match the degree

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:44.280
of the denominator over here.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.492
So in this case, the degree
of the denominator is 4,

00:08:47.492 --> 00:08:48.575
and there are 4 constants.

00:08:48.575 --> 00:08:52.760
So we've-- so that's a good
way to check that you set

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:54.410
the problem up right.

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:54.940
OK.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.020
So now, what do we
do in this case?

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:59.830
Well, the cover up
method works, but it only

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:02.590
works to find the
highest degree term.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:03.090
Right?

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.830
So we cover up x
plus 1 to the fourth,

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:11.940
and we cover up everything with
a smaller power of x plus 1,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.880
and then we plug in negative 1.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.380
Right?

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.730
Because we need
x plus 1 to be 0.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.210
So OK, so over here we get
negative 1 squared is 1,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.750
so we get, right away,
that D is equal to 1.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.010
OK.

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.460
But that doesn't
give us A, B, or C.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:34.860
We can't get A, B, or C
by the cover up method.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.510
Now, there are a
couple different ways

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.730
you can proceed at this point.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:43.910
One thing you can do, which
is something that often works,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:47.230
is you could plug in values.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.660
Well, so this will always work.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.000
I shouldn't say often works.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.200
You can start plugging
in other values for x.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.060
And as you plug in other
values for x, what you'll see

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.050
is that for every value
you plug in, you'll

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.890
get a linear equation
relating your variables-- A,

00:10:01.890 --> 00:10:04.640
B, C, and whatever,
in this case, that's

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.250
all we've got left, A,
B, and C-- to each other.

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:10.630
And so if you plug in three
different values of x, say,

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:12.470
you'll get three
different linear equations

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.230
with three different variables,
and then you can solve them.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.430
That's one thing you can do.

00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.500
Another thing you could do is
you can multiply through by x

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.335
plus 1 to the fourth.

00:10:23.335 --> 00:10:25.210
So if you do that, you'll
have-- on the left,

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.980
you'll just have x
squared, and on the right

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.280
you'll have-- well,
you'll have A times

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.850
x plus 1 cubed plus B times x
plus 1 squared, plus C times

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.070
x plus 1, plus D. And we already
know that x is equal to 1.

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:39.570
OK?

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.320
And so then, for those
two things to be equal,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.000
they're equal as
polynomials, all

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.270
their coefficients
have to be equal.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.120
So you can just look at the
coefficients in that resulting

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:56.500
expression, and ask, you know,
which coefficients-- sorry.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.700
You can set coefficients
on the two sides equal.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.174
The two polynomials
are equal, all

00:11:00.174 --> 00:11:02.090
of their corresponding
coefficients are equal.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:03.730
So you could look,
you know, at this side

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:04.688
and you'll say, oh, OK.

00:11:04.688 --> 00:11:07.004
So the coefficient
of x cubed has

00:11:07.004 --> 00:11:09.420
to be the same as whatever the
coefficient of x cubed over

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.876
here is, and the
coefficient x squared

00:11:11.876 --> 00:11:14.000
has to be the same as the
coefficient of x squared,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:14.920
and so on.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.010
So that's another
way to proceed.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:25.550
Yeah, all right.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.260
Those are really your
two best options.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.110
I like to multiply
through, personally.

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.890
So OK.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.880
So if I were to do that, in
this case, on the left-hand side

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:44.560
I'd get x squared equals
A times x plus 1 cubed

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:54.470
plus B times x plus 1 squared
plus C times x plus 1 plus D.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.360
Except we already know
that D is equal to 1,

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:58.670
so I'm just going
to write plus 1.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.230
So OK.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.280
So actually, let
me say that there

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:05.610
are other things you could do.

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.460
Which is, you could
rearrange things

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.070
and simplify algebraically
before plugging in values,

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.430
or before comparing
coefficients.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.210
So let me give you
one example of each

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:19.800
of those three possibilities.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.390
So for example, one
thing you can do,

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:25.430
is you can look at the
highest degree coefficient.

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.770
So as Professor Jerison said,
the easiest coefficients

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:30.889
are usually the high-order
terms and the low-order terms.

00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:32.430
So in this case,
the high-order terms

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.534
would be-- this
is a third degree

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:35.950
polynomial on the
right-hand side,

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.180
and it's a second degree
polynomial on the left.

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.590
So the highest-order
term here, x cubed,

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.700
just appears in this one
place as coefficient A. Right?

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.940
This is A x cubed
plus something times x

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.630
squared plus blah blah blah.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.640
And over here, we
have no x cubeds.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.889
So we have x cubeds here,
but no x cubeds here.

00:12:53.889 --> 00:12:56.180
That means the coefficient
of x cubed here has to be 0,

00:12:56.180 --> 00:12:57.120
so A has to be 0.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.050
OK.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.089
So A has to be equal to 0,
and that simplifies everything

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:05.630
a little bit.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:11.780
So now we get x squared equals
B times x plus 1 squared

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:18.310
plus C times x plus 1 plus 1.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:23.630
Now let me show you what I mean
about algebraic manipulation.

00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:26.570
This 1, if you wanted, you could
always just subtract it over

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:27.660
to the other side.

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.190
Right?

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.689
And so then you'll
have, on the left

00:13:29.689 --> 00:13:31.390
you'll have x squared minus 1.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.440
And x squared minus
1, you can write

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:42.480
as x minus 1 times x plus 1
equals B times x plus 1 squared

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.545
plus C times x plus 1.

00:13:46.545 --> 00:13:48.795
And then you can divide out
by an x plus 1 everywhere.

00:13:48.795 --> 00:13:50.530
It appears in all terms.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:59.570
So you get x minus 1 equals
B times x plus 1 plus C.

00:13:59.570 --> 00:14:02.460
And now what this does for you,
is you sort of just reduced

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.400
the degree everywhere.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.210
And actually, you could
substitute x equals minus 1

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.960
again, if you wanted
to, for example.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.650
And here, so for example, if
you substitute x equals minus 1,

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:18.330
that's the same idea as what
you do in the cover up method.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.780
This B term will
just die completely,

00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:22.860
and you'll be left with
negative 2 on the left.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.780
So you get C-- I'm going to
have to move over here, sorry.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.540
C is equal to negative 2, then.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.380
And also, you can
do the one thing

00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:33.280
that I haven't done so
far, is this plugging

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.130
in nice choices of values.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:37.980
So another nice choice of value
for x that we haven't used

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.370
is x equals 0.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.230
So if you plug in x equals
0, you'll get minus 1

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.815
equals B plus c.

00:14:44.815 --> 00:14:50.310
So minus 1 equals B plus C.
And since we just found C,

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.760
that means that B is equal to 1.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:55.260
All right.

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:59.200
So-- oh boy, I'm using a lot
of space, aren't I. All right.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.400
So in this case, we've got
our coefficients, A equals 0,

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.580
D equals 1, B equals
1, C equals minus 2.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:09.400
And that gives us the partial
fraction decomposition.

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:15.770
Let's go back over here then,
and look at question (c).

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:19.080
So for (c), the question is,
what is the partial fraction

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:23.390
decomposition of 2x plus
2 divided by the quantity

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:27.492
4x squared plus 1 squared?

00:15:27.492 --> 00:15:28.450
This one's really easy.

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:29.880
This one is done.

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:32.190
This is already partial
fraction decomposed.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.690
Right?

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.880
When you have-- so here we
have an irreducible quadratic

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.950
in the denominator.

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:42.400
You can't factor this any
further than it's gone.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.780
It also occurs to
a higher power.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:47.680
So when you partial fraction
decompose something like this,

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.010
you want something linear
over 4x squared plus 1,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:56.760
plus something linear over
4x squared plus 1 squared.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.690
But we already have that, right?

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:01.860
The first linear part
is 0, and the second

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.490
is something linear over
4x squared plus 1 squared.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:08.040
So to integrate this, it's
already in a pretty good form.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.540
Now, you're actually
going to write,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.039
if you wanted to
integrate this, you

00:16:11.039 --> 00:16:14.510
would split it into two
pieces, one with the 2x

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:15.900
and then one with the 2.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.040
And the first one,
you would just

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.760
be a usual u substitution,
and the second one,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:24.190
we would want some sort of
trigonometric substitution.

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:28.170
But this one is already
ready for methods we already

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:29.430
should be comfortable with.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:29.930
OK.

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:31.090
So C, that's easy.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.255
It's done already.

00:16:32.255 --> 00:16:35.650
I'll put a check mark there,
because that makes me happy.

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:36.160
OK.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:39.460
And for-- all right, and
so for this last one,

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:42.470
I'm also not going to
write this one out.

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:45.059
But the thing to notice
here is the way I wrote it--

00:16:45.059 --> 00:16:46.350
and this was really mean of me.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.890
Right?

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.630
I wrote it as x squared
minus 1 quantity squared.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.240
So a natural instinct
is to say, aha!

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.840
It's a quadratic repeated
factor in the denominator.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.340
Right?

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:58.490
But that's just because I was
mean and I wrote it this way.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:59.870
That's not actually
what this is.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.810
This is not irreducible.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:02.760
This factors.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:07.723
You can rewrite-- let
me come back over here.

00:17:07.723 --> 00:17:11.730
This is for question (d).

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:18.520
So you can rewrite x squared
minus 1 squared as x minus 1

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.100
squared times x plus 1 squared.

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.190
You can factor this
x squared minus 1.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.430
So when you factor this
x minus 1, what you see

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.440
is-- this isn't a
problem that has

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.230
one irreducible quadratic factor
appearing to the second power.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.850
What it has is two
linear factors,

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.840
each appearing to
the second power.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:43.700
So the partial fraction
decomposition in this problem

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:49.800
will be something
like A over x minus 1

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:58.320
plus B over x minus 1
squared plus C over x plus 1,

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:03.180
plus D over x plus 1 squared.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.110
That's what you'll get when
you apply partial fraction

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:07.450
decomposition to this problem.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:11.030
And then you have to solve
for the coefficients A, B, C,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:11.530
and D.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:15.490
So I'm not going to write that
out myself, but I cleverly

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.644
did it before I
came on camera, so I

00:18:18.644 --> 00:18:21.310
can tell you what the answer is,
if you want to check your work.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:30.740
So here we have A is equal
to 0, B is equal to 1,

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:35.690
C is equal to 1, and
D is equal to minus 3.

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:38.300
So that's for the-- I
didn't write it over here.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.720
That's for this
particular numerator

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.950
that we started
with back over here.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.690
So for this particular
fraction, if you carry out

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.970
the partial fraction
decomposition, what you get

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:53.810
is right here.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.170
So OK, so those are, that
was a few more examples

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.210
of the partial
fraction decomposition.

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:02.109
I hope you enjoyed them,
and I'm going to end there.

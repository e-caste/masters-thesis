00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.880
Let's review our wish list for the characteristics
of a combinational device.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.820
In the previous lecture we worked hard to
develop a voltage-based representation for

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.710
information that could tolerate some amount
error as the information flowed through a

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.340
system of processing elements.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.029
We specified four signaling thresholds: V_OL
and V_OH set the upper and lower bounds on

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.320
voltages used to represent 0 and 1 respectively
at the outputs of a combinational device.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.480
V_IL and V_IH served a similar role for interpreting
the voltages at the inputs of a combinational

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.780
device.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.930
We specified that V_OL be strictly less than
V_IL, and termed the difference between these

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.710
two low thresholds as the low noise margin,
the amount of noise that could be added to

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.539
an output signal and still have the signal
interpreted correctly at any connected inputs.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.390
For the same reasons we specified that V_IH
be strictly less than V_OH.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.430
We saw the implications of including noise
margins when we looked at the voltage transfer

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.659
characteristic - a plot of V_OUT vs. V_IN
- for a combinational device.

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.250
Since a combinational device must, in the
steady state, produce a valid output voltage

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.590
given a valid input voltage, we can identify
forbidden regions in the VTC, which for valid

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.110
input voltages identify regions of invalid
output voltages.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.299
The VTC for a legal combinational device could
not have any points that fall within these

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.619
regions.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.299
The center region, bounded by the four threshold
voltages, is narrower than it is high and

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.939
so any legal VTC has to a have region where
its gain is greater than 1 and the overall

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.740
VTC has to be non-linear.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.090
The VTC shown here is that for a combinational
device that serves as an inverter.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.430
If we're fortunate to be using a circuit technology
that provides high gain and has output voltages

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.259
close the ground and the power supply voltage,
we can push V_OL and V_OH outward towards

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:10.470
the power supply rails, and push V_IL and
V_IH inward, with the happy consequence of

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.750
increasing the noise margins - always a good
thing!

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.030
Remembering back to the beginning of Lecture
2, we'll be wanting billions of devices in

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.470
our digital systems, so each device will have
to be quite inexpensive and small.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.920
In today's mobile world, the ability to run
our systems on battery power for long periods

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.829
of time means that we'll want to have our
systems dissipate as little power as possible.

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.829
Of course, manipulating information will necessitate
changing voltages within the system and that

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.110
will cost us some amount of power.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.911
But if our system is idle and no internal
voltages are changing, we'd like for our system

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.600
to have zero power dissipation.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.630
Finally, we'll want to be able to implement
systems with useful functionality and so need

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.010
to develop a catalog of the logic computations
we want to perform.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.540
Quite remarkably, there is a circuit technology
that will make our wishes come true!

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.620
That technology is the subject of this lecture.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.760
The star of our show is the metal-oxide-semiconductor
field-effect transistor, or MOSFET for short.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.650
Here's a 3D drawing showing a cross-section
of a MOSFET, which is constructed from a complicated

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.760
sandwich of electrical materials as part of
an integrated circuit,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.760
so called because the individual devices in
an integrated circuit are manufactured en-masse

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.170
during a series of manufacturing steps.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.870
In modern technologies the dimensions of the
block shown here are a few 10's of nanometers

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.380
on a side - that's 1/1000 of the thickness
of a thin human hair.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.930
This dimension is so small that MOSFETs can't
be viewed using an ordinary optical microscope,

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:56.120
whose resolution is limited by the wavelength
of visible light, which is 400 to 750nm.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.430
For many years, engineers have been able to
shrink the device dimensions by a factor of

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.681
2 every 24 months or so,
an observation known as "Moore's Law" after

00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:12.010
Gordon Moore, one of the founders of Intel,
who first remarked on this trend in 1965.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.260
Each 50% shrink in dimensions enables integrated
circuit (IC) manufacturers to build four times

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.970
as many devices in the same area as before,
and, as we'll see, the devices themselves

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.320
get faster too!

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.790
An integrated circuit in 1975 might have had
2500 devices; today we're able to build ICs

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.690
with two to three billion devices.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.409
Here's a quick tour of what we see in the
diagram.

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.210
The substrate upon which the IC is built is
a thin wafer of silicon crystal which has

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.250
had impurities added to make it conductive.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.470
In this case the impurity was an acceptor
atom like Boron, and we characterize the doped

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.680
silicon as a p-type semiconductor.

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.020
The IC will include an electrical contact
to the p-type substrate, called the "bulk"

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.540
terminal, so we can control its voltage.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.260
When want to provide electrical insulation
between conducting materials, we'll use a

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.630
layer of silicon dioxide (SiO2).

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.160
Normally the thickness of the insulator isn't
terribly important, except for when it's used

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.030
to isolate the gate of the transistor (shown
here in red) from the substrate.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.030
The insulating layer in that region is very
thin so that the electrical field from charges

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.560
on the gate conductor can easily affect the
substrate.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:32.310
The gate terminal of the transistor is a conductor,
in this case, polycrystalline silicon.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.200
The gate, the thin oxide insulating layer,
and the p-type substrate form a capacitor,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.760
where changing the voltage on the gate will
cause electrical changes in the p-type substrate

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:44.800
directly under the gate.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.920
In early manufacturing processes the gate
terminal was made of metal, and the term "metal-oxide-semiconductor"

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.070
(MOS) is referring to this particular structure.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:02.410
After the gate terminal is in place, donor
atoms such as Phosphorous are implanted into

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.360
the p-type substrate in two rectangular regions
on either side of the gate.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.460
This changes those regions to an n-type semiconductor,
which become the final two terminals of the

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.980
MOSFET, called the source and the drain.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.110
Note that source and drain are usually physically
identical and are distinguished by the role

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:25.070
they play during the operation of the device,
our next topic.

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:30.070
As we'll see in the next slide, the MOSFET
functions as a voltage-controlled switch connecting

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.150
the source and drain terminals of the device.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.120
When the switch is conducting, current will
flow from the drain to the source through

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.720
the conducting channel formed as the second
plate of the gate capacitor.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.880
The MOSFET has two critical dimensions: its
length L, which measures the distance the

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:52.320
current must cross as it flows from drain
to source, and its width W, which determines

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.920
how much channel is available to conduct current.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.430
The the current, termed I_DS, flowing across
the switch is proportional to the ratio of

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:03.060
the channel's width to its length.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.760
Typically, IC designers make the length as
short as possible.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:14.760
When a news article refers to a "14nm process,"
the 14nm refers to the smallest allowable

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.480
value for the channel length.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.760
And designers choose the channel width to
set the desired amount of current flow.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.090
If I_DS is large, voltage transitions on the
source and drain nodes will be quick, at the

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.770
cost of a physically larger device.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:37.220
To summarize: the MOSFET has four electrical
terminals: bulk, gate, source, and drain.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.460
Two of the device dimensions are under the
control of the designer: the channel length,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:47.800
usually chosen to be as small as possible,
and the channel width chosen to set the current

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.570
flow to the desired value.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:55.240
It's a solid-state switch - there are no moving
parts - and the switch operation is controlled

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.310
by electrical fields determined by the relative
voltages of the four terminals.

WEBVTT

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:15.150
MICHALE FEE: OK.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.770
So let's go ahead
and get started.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.700
So what is neural computation?

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.740
So neuroscience used to be
a very descriptive field

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.070
where you would describe the
different kinds of neurons.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.800
Who here has seen the famous
pictures-- the old pictures

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.970
of the golgi-stained neurons,
all those different types

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.610
of neurons, describing what
things look like in the brain

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.760
and what parts of the brain
are important for what

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.540
kinds of behavior based
on lesion studies.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.520
It used to be
extremely descriptive.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.710
But things are changing
in neuroscience,

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.540
and have changed dramatically
over the past few decades.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.060
Really, neuroscience now is
about understanding the brain,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.660
how the brain works, how
the brain produces behavior.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.500
And really trying to develop
engineering-level descriptions

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.820
of brain systems and brain
circuits and neurons and ion

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.660
channels and all the components
of neurons that make the brain

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.160
work.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.210
And so, for example,
the level of description

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.590
that my lab works at and
that I'm most excited about

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.250
is understanding how neural
circuits-- how neurons

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.100
are put together to make
neural circuits that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.290
implement behaviors,
or to produce

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.800
let's say object recognition.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.770
So this is a figure
from Jim DiCarlo,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.080
who is our department head.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.360
Basically a
circuit-level description

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.790
of how the brain goes
from a visual stimulus

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.960
to a recognition of what that
object is in the stimulus.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.370
Now at the same
time that there's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.040
been a big push toward
understanding or generating

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.090
an engineering level
descriptions of brains

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.970
and circuits and
components, neurons,

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.010
there's also been tremendous
advances in the technologies

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.740
that we can use
to record neurons.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.590
So there are now imaging
systems and microscopes

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.020
that can image thousands
of neurons simultaneously.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:35.360
This is an example of a movie
recorded in an awake baby mouse

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.510
that's basically dreaming.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.310
And let me just show you
what this looks like.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.940
So this is a mouse that has
a fluorescent protein that's

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.340
sensitive to neural activity.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.460
And so when neurons in a part
of the brain become active

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.690
they become fluorescent
and light up.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.450
And so here's a top surface
of the mouse's brain.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.070
And you can see this spontaneous
activity flickering around

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.010
as this mouse is just
dreaming and thinking

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.050
about whatever it's
thinking about.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.540
So one of the key
challenges is to take images

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.480
like this that represent
the activity of thousands

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.490
of neurons or
millions of neurons

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.990
and figure out how to relate
that to the circuit models that

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.080
are being developed.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.020
So here's another example.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.220
So there are these new probes
where these are basically

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.620
silicon probes
that have thousands

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.250
of little sensors on
them and a computer here

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.600
that basically reads out
the pattern of activity.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.430
These are called neuropixels.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.580
So those are
basically electrodes

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.640
that can, again, record
from thousands of neurons

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.630
simultaneously.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.030
And they're quite
long and can record

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.260
throughout the whole brain,
essentially, all at once.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.090
So the key now is you have these
very high dimensional data set.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.020
How do you relate that
to the circuit models

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.140
that you're developing?

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.370
And so one of the key
challenges in neuroscience

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.660
is to take very
large data sets that

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.120
look like this that
just look like a mess

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.870
and figure out what's going
on underneath of there.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.110
It turns out that people are
discovering that while you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:25.270
might be recording from
tens of thousands of neurons

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.910
and it looks really
messy that there's

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.140
some underlying very simple
structure underneath of there.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.790
But you can't see
it when you just

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:39.030
look at big collections
of neurons like this.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.240
So the challenge here
is really to figure out

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.340
how to not only just
make those models,

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.035
but test them by taking
data and relating

00:04:48.035 --> 00:04:50.160
the patterns of activity
that you see in these very

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.810
high dimensional data sets,
do dimensionality reduction--

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.470
compress that data down into
a simple representation--

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.980
and then relate it to those
models that you developed.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.500
One of the things we're going
to try to do in this class

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.500
is to apply these techniques
of making models of neurons

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.100
and circuits together
with mathematical tools

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.180
for analyzing data in
the context of looking

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.730
at animal behaviors.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:31.740
So for example, in my lab
we study how songbirds sing,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.230
how they learn to produce
their vocalizations.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.270
Songbirds learn by
imitating their parents.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.108
They listen to their parents.

00:05:38.108 --> 00:05:43.088
[BIRDS SINGING]

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.640
Here, hold on.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.422
I'm going to skip ahead.

00:05:54.422 --> 00:05:55.901
How do I do that?

00:05:55.901 --> 00:06:00.338
[BIRDS SINGING]

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.254
[INAUDIBLE] bring up the--

00:06:06.254 --> 00:06:08.719
I was hoping I'd be
able to skip ahead.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:17.610
So this is just a
setup showing how

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.090
we can record from neurons in
birds while they're singing

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.920
and figure out how
those circuits work

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.510
to produce the song.

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.010
This is a little
micro-drive that we built.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.120
It's motorized so that we
can move these electrodes

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.110
around independently in the
brain and record from neurons

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.840
without the animal knowing that
we're moving the electrodes

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.870
around and looking for neurons.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.110
So songbirds are really cool.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:42.420
They listen to their parents.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.760
They store a memory of
what their parents sing.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.470
And then they begin babbling.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.500
And they practice over and
over again until they can learn

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.920
a good copy of their song.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:53.160
So here's a bird that's
singing with the micro-drive

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.930
on its head.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.075
And you can hear the
neuron in the background.

00:06:57.075 --> 00:06:57.700
[STATIC SOUNDS]

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.700
Sorry, it's not over
the loudspeaker here.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.690
But can everyone hear that?

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:06.485
So we can record from neurons
while the bird is singing.

00:07:06.485 --> 00:07:07.110
[BIRDS SINGING]

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.050
Look at the activity
in this network

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:12.960
and try to figure out
how that network actually

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.880
works to produce the song.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.740
And also we can record
in very young birds

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.050
and figure out how the
song is actually learned.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.850
And there's an example
of a neuron generating

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.920
action potentials, which is
the basic unit of communication

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.550
in the brain.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.540
[BIRDS SINGING]

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.440
And we try to build
circuit models

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.248
and figure out how that
thing actually works

00:07:44.248 --> 00:07:45.540
to produce and learn this song.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.930
So these computational
approaches

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.490
that I'm talking
about are not just

00:07:55.490 --> 00:08:00.120
important for dissecting brain
circuits related to behavior.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.320
The same kinds of
approaches, the same kind

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.640
of dimensionality reduction
techniques we're going to learn

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:12.160
are also useful in
molecular genetic studies,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.395
like taking
transcriptional profiling

00:08:15.395 --> 00:08:18.020
and doing clustering and looking
at the different patterns that

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.520
are there.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.230
It's also useful for
molecular studies.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:27.050
Also, these ideas are very
powerful in studying cognition.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.480
So if you look at the work
that Josh Tenenbaum does

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.400
and Josh McDermott, who
developed mathematical models

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.020
of how our minds work, how we
learn to think about things,

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:42.027
those are also very model-based
and very quantitative.

00:08:42.027 --> 00:08:44.360
So the kinds of tools we're
going to learn in this class

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.610
are very broadly applicable.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.040
They're also increasingly
important in medicine.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.890
So at some point we're going to
take a little bit of a detour

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:58.910
to look at a particular
disease that's caused

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.042
by a defect in an ion channel.

00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.500
And it turns out
you can understand

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.590
exactly how that defect
in that ion channel

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:11.260
relates to the phenotype
of the disease.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.260
And you can do that by creating
a mathematical model of how

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.440
a neuron behaves when it
has an ion channel that

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.210
has this defect in it.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.960
So it's very cool.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.790
And once you model
it, you can really

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.125
understand why that happens.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.500
So here are some of
the course goals.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.110
So we're going to
start by working

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.750
on basic biophysics of
neurons and networks

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.280
and other principles underlying
brain and cognitive functions.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:40.530
We're going to develop
mathematical techniques

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:46.020
to analyze those models and
to analyze the behavioral data

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.060
and neural data
that you would take

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.580
to study those brain circuits.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.720
And along the way, we're going
to become proficient at using

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.170
MATLAB to do these things.

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:01.670
So how many of you have
experience with MATLAB?

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:02.960
OK, great.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.510
And not?

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.050
So anybody who doesn't have
experience with MATLAB,

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:12.830
we're going to really make
an effort to bring you up

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:14.720
to speed very quickly.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.440
Daniel has actually just
created a very nice MATLAB cheat

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.870
sheet that's just amazing.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:26.110
So there will be lots of
help with programming.

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:27.840
So let me just mention
some of the topics

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.010
that we'll be covering.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.370
So we'll be talking
about equivalent circuit

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.715
model of neurons.

00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:38.320
So let me just explain
how this is broken down.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.560
So these are topics
that we'll be covering.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.080
And these are the
mathematical tools

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.150
that go along with
those topics that we'll

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.790
be learning about in parallel.

00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:50.220
So we'll be studying
neuronal biophysics.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.620
And we'll be doing some
differential equations

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.230
along the way for that, just
first-order linear differential

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:58.020
equations, nothing
to be scared of.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.910
We'll talk about
neuronal responses

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:01.830
to stimuli and tuning curves.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.330
And along the way,
we'll be learning

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.000
about spike sorting and
peristimulus, time histograms,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.330
and ways of analyzing
firing patterns.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.060
We talked about neural
coding and receptive fields.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.270
And we'll learn about
correlation and convolution

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.270
for that topic.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.617
We'll talk about feed forward
networks and perceptrons.

00:11:19.617 --> 00:11:21.200
And then we're going
to start bringing

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.890
a lot of linear algebra,
which is really fun.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.320
It's really powerful.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.590
And that linear
algebra sets the stage

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.170
for then doing
dimensionality, reduction

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:36.890
on data, and principal component
analysis, and singular value

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:39.580
decomposition, and other things.

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:44.590
We'll then take an additional
extension of neural networks

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:45.940
from feed forward networks.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:48.130
We'll figure out how
to make them talk back

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.590
to themselves so they
can start doing things

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.790
like remember things
and make decisions.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.170
And that involves more
linear algebra, eigenvalues.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:01.340
And then I'm not
sure we're going

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:06.070
to get time to sensory
integration and Bayes' rule.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.720
So by the end of
the class, there

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.180
are some important
skills that you'll have.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:16.180
You'll be able to think
about a neuron very clearly

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.120
and how its components
work together

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:23.220
to give that neuron
its properties.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.060
And how neurons themselves
can connect together

00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.580
to give a neural
circuit its properties.

00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:33.030
You'll be able to write
MATLAB programs that

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.770
simulate those models.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.760
You'll be able to analyze
data using MATLAB.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.850
You'll be able to visualize
high dimensional data sets.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.970
And one of my
goals in this class

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.010
is that you guys
should be able to go

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:51.390
into any lab in the
department and do

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.910
cool things that even the
graduate students may not

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.840
know how to do.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.200
And so you can do really
great stuff as a UROP.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.360
So one of the most important
things about this class

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.130
is problem sets
because that's where

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:15.610
you're going to get the hands-on
experience to do that data

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:21.280
analysis and write programs
and analyze the data.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.240
Please install that.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.290
It's really important, if
you don't already have that.

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.010
We use live scripts for
problems set submissions.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:33.510
And Daniel made some
nice examples on Stellar.

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.830
And of course the guidelines
for Pset submissions

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.810
are also on Stellar.

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.888
OK, that's it.

00:13:40.888 --> 00:13:41.930
Any questions about that?

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.850
No?

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.050
All right, good.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:51.430
So let's go ahead
and get started then

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:52.375
with the first topic.

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.210
OK.

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.750
So the first thing
we're going to do

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:10.150
is we're going to build
a model of a neuron.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:12.550
This model is very particular.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:18.890
It uses electrical components
to describe the neuron.

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:22.630
Now that may not be surprising
since a neuron is basically

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.220
an electrical device.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.370
It has components that
are sensitive to voltages,

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.400
that generate currents,
that control currents.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:33.820
And so we're going to build our
model using electrical circuit

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.580
components.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.030
And one of the nice
things about doing that

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.370
is that every electrical
circuit component,

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:42.640
like a resistor or
a capacitor, has

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:47.950
a very well-defined mathematical
relation between the current

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:50.260
and the voltage,
the current that

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.870
flows through that
device and the voltage

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.670
across the terminals
of that device.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:58.300
So you can write down very
precisely, mathematically,

00:14:58.300 --> 00:15:02.040
what each of those
components does.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.050
So then you can then
take all those components

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:12.270
and construct a set of
equations or in general a set

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:16.890
of differential equations that
allows you to basically evolve

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.950
that circuit over time
and plot, let's say,

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.530
the voltage on the inside of
the cell as a function of time.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.390
And you can see that that
model neuron can actually

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:33.410
very precisely replicate many
of the properties of neurons.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.010
Now neurons are actually
really complicated.

00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:40.850
And this is the real reason why
we need to write down a model.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:42.740
So there are many
different kinds of neurons.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.500
Each type of neuron
has a different pattern

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.800
of genes that are expressed.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.530
So this is a cluster
diagram of neuron type based

00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:55.760
on a transcriptional
profiling of the RNA

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.000
that I think it was about 13,000
neurons that were extracted

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.830
from a part of the brain.

00:16:00.830 --> 00:16:02.420
You do a transcriptional
profiling.

00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.880
It gives you a map of
all the different genes

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.908
are expressed in each neuron.

00:16:06.908 --> 00:16:08.450
And then you can
cluster them and you

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.480
can see that this particular
part of the brain,

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.200
which is in the
hypothalamus, expresses all

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.672
of these different cell types.

00:16:17.672 --> 00:16:19.130
Now what are those
different genes?

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.170
Many of those different
genes are actually

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:22.430
different ion channels.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:26.090
And there are hundreds of
different kinds of ion channels

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:29.300
that control the flow of
current across the membrane

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.600
of the neuron.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.610
So this is just a diagram
showing different potassium ion

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.160
channels, different
calcium ion channels.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.505
You can see they have families
and different subtypes.

00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.130
And all of those
different ion channels

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.110
have different
timescales on which

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.230
the current varies as a
function of voltage change.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.090
They have different
voltage ranges

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.770
that they're sensitive to.

00:16:51.770 --> 00:16:53.420
They have different
inactivation.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.610
So many ion channels, when you
turn them on, they stay on.

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.700
But other ion
channels, they turn on

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.640
and then they slowly decay away.

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:03.170
The current slowly decays away.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.609
And that's called inactivation.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.109
And all these
different ion channels

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.960
have different combinations
of those properties.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.290
And it's really
hard to predict when

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:15.319
you think about how
this neuron will

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:18.450
behave with a different
kind of ion channel here.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.579
It's super hard to just look
at the properties of an ion

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.332
channel and just see how that's
going to work in a neuron

00:17:25.332 --> 00:17:27.290
because you have all
these different parts that

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.285
are working together.

00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:31.790
And so it's really important
to be able to write down

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:32.990
a mathematical model.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:35.930
If you have a neuron that has a
different kind of ion channel,

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:40.400
you can actually predict how
the neuron's going to behave.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.970
Now that's just the
ion channel components.

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:47.010
Neurons also have
complex morphologies.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.220
This is a Purkinje
cell in the cerebellum.

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.240
They have these very densely
elaborated dendrites.

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.160
Other neurons have
very long dendrites

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.990
with just a few branches.

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:02.960
Other neurons have very
short stubby dendrites.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.670
And each of those different
morphological patterns

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:12.440
also affects how a neuron
responds to its inputs,

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.020
because now a neuron
can have inputs

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.450
out here at the end of
the dendrite or up close

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:19.340
to the soma.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.640
And all of those, the
spatial structure,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.700
also affects how
a neuron responds.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.310
And those produce very
different firing patterns.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.760
So some neurons, if you
put in a constant current,

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.130
they just fire regularly up.

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.070
So it turns out we
can really understand

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.360
why all these
different things happen

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.030
if we build a model like this.

00:18:47.265 --> 00:18:48.640
So let me just
point out a couple

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:50.560
of other interesting
things about this model.

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.390
Different parts of
this circuit actually

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.610
do cool different things.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.300
So neurons have not
just one power supply.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.767
They've got multiple
power supplies to power

00:19:00.767 --> 00:19:02.350
up different parts
of the circuit that

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.290
do different things.

00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:08.380
Neurons have
capacitances that allow

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:14.050
a neuron to accumulate over
time, act as an integrator.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.470
If you combine a
capacitor with a resistor,

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:20.200
that circuit now
looks like a filter.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:24.430
It smooths its past
inputs over time.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.430
And these two components
here, this sodium current

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:30.790
and this potassium current,
make a spike generator

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:32.650
that generates an
action potential that

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:34.930
then talks to other neurons.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.610
And you put that
whole thing together,

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.620
and that thing can act
like an oscillator.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.900
It can act like a
coincidence detector.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.800
It can do all kinds of
different cool things.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:48.170
And all that stuff
is understandable

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:52.490
if you just write down a
simple model like this.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:53.533
Any questions?

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:59.360
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.610
going to just start
describing this network.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:07.880
We're going to build it
up one piece at a time.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:13.260
And we're going to start
with a capacitance.

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.990
But before we get
to the capacitor,

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:16.820
we need to do one more thing.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.620
We need to do one
thing first, which

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.760
is figure out what the
wires are in the brain.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.220
For an electrical circuit,
you need to have wires.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.700
So what are the
wires in the brain?

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.110
What do wires do in a circuit?

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.890
They carry current.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:42.060
So what are the
wires in a neuron?

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.388
AUDIENCE: Axons?

00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:44.430
MICHALE FEE: What's that?

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:45.142
AUDIENCE: Axons?

00:20:45.142 --> 00:20:46.170
MICHALE FEE: Axons.

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.580
So axons carry information.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.110
They carry a spike that
travels down the axon

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:53.430
and goes to other neurons.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:57.940
But there is even a
simpler answer than that.

00:20:57.940 --> 00:20:58.440
Yes?

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.691
AUDIENCE: Ion channels?

00:20:59.691 --> 00:21:03.600
MICHALE FEE: Ion channels
are these resistors here.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.084
But what is it that connects all
those components to each other?

00:21:08.084 --> 00:21:09.834
AUDIENCE: Intracellular
and extracellular.

00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:10.930
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:14.680
It's the intracellular and
extracellular solution.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.810
And so what we're
going to do today

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.530
is to understand how the
intracellular and extracellular

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.420
solution acts as a
wire in our neuron.

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:31.150
And it's not quite as
simple as a piece of metal.

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:32.800
It's a bit more complicated.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.570
There are different
ways you can get

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:39.315
current flow in intracellular
and extracellular solution.

00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:40.690
So we're going to
go through that

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:43.630
and we're going to analyze
that in some detail.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:53.200
So in the brain, the wires
are the intracellular

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.480
and extracellular
salt solutions.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.240
And you get current
flow that results

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.730
from the movement of ions
in that aqueous solution.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:07.420
So the solution
consists of ions.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.690
Like in the
extracellular, it's mostly

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.080
sodium ions and chloride ions
that are dissolved in water.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.630
Water is a polar solvent.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:19.970
That means that the negative
parts, the oxygen that's

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:21.520
slightly negatively charged.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:25.810
Oxygen is attracted
toward positive ions.

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:28.540
And the intracellular
and extracellular space

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.120
are filled with salt
solution at a concentration

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.091
of about 100 millimolar.

00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.430
And that corresponds
to having one

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:45.310
of these ions about
every 25 angstroms apart.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:49.200
So at those
concentrations, there

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.580
are a lot of ions
floating around.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.000
And those ions can move
under different conditions

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.540
to produce currents.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:03.620
So currents flow in
the brain through two

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.450
primary different mechanisms.

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:11.510
Diffusion, which is
caused by variations

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.150
in the concentration.

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:18.000
And drifts of particles
in an electric field.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.530
So when you put
an electric field,

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:22.490
so if you take a beaker
filled with salt solution,

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.490
you put two metal
electrodes in it,

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.170
you produce an
electric field that

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:30.380
causes these ions to drift in--

00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.533
and that's another
source of current

00:23:32.533 --> 00:23:33.950
that we're going
to look at today.

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.030
So here are our learning
objectives for today.

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.350
We're going to understand how
the timescales of diffusion

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.420
relate to the length scales.

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.040
That's a really
interesting story.

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.710
That's very important.

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.700
We're going to understand how
concentration gradients lead

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:54.630
to currents.

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:57.680
That's known as
Fick's First Law.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.700
And we're going to
understand how charges drift

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.120
in an electric field in a
way that leads to current,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.850
and the mathematical
relation that

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.760
describes voltage differences.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.660
And this is called
Ohm's Law in the brain.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.388
And we're going to learn about
the concept of resistivity.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.860
So the first thing we
need to talk about,

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.380
if we're going to talk about
diffusion, is thermal energy.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.880
So every particle
in the world is

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:35.350
being jostled by other particles
that are crashing into it.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:38.740
And at thermal equilibrium,
every degree of freedom,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.160
every way that a particle
can move, either forward

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.300
and backward, left and right,
up and down, or rotations,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.980
this way or this way,
or whichever way,

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:54.610
I didn't show yet,
come to equilibrium

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.870
at a particular energy that's
proportional to temperature.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.570
In other words, if
a particle is moving

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:03.640
in this direction
in equilibrium,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.740
it will have a kinetic energy
in that direction that's

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:10.160
proportional to the temperature.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.270
And that temperature
is in units of kelvin

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.040
relative to absolute zero.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.550
And the proportionality constant
is the Boltzmann constant,

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:24.020
which has units of
joules per kelvin.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.610
So when you multiply the
Boltzmann constant k times

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:30.910
temperature, what you find is
that every degree of freedom

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:33.550
will come to equilibrium
at 4 times 10

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:39.910
to the minus 21 joules,
which is an amount of energy,

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.310
at room temperature.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:46.120
At zero temperature, you can
see that every degree of freedom

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.320
has zero energy.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.550
And so nothing is moving.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:52.390
Nothing's rotating, nothing's
moving any direction.

00:25:52.390 --> 00:25:53.680
Everything's perfectly still.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.670
So let's calculate
how fast particles

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:04.820
move at thermal equilibrium
in room temperature.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:11.660
So you may remember from
your first physics class

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.550
that the kinetic
energy of a particle

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:17.640
is proportional to the velocity
squared, 1/2 mv squared.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.990
So the average velocity
squared of a particle

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:27.610
at thermal equilibrium is just
1/2 times that much energy.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:29.090
That makes sense?

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:34.430
Now we [AUDIO OUT] how
fast a particle is moving--

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.680
for example, a sodium ion.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.980
So you can see that the average
velocity squared is just

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:43.150
kT over m.

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.890
We just divide both sides by m.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.200
So the average velocity
squared is kT over m.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.360
The mass of a
sodium ion is this.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.490
So the average
velocity squared is

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:54.980
10 to the 5 meter squared
per second squared.

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:56.690
Just take the square
root that, and you

00:26:56.690 --> 00:27:01.230
get the average velocity
is 320 meters per second.

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.150
So that means that the
air molecules, which

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:08.840
have a similar
mass to sodium ion,

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.790
are whizzing around at
300 meters per second.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:17.955
So that would cross this room
in a few hundredths of a second.

00:27:17.955 --> 00:27:19.580
But of course, that's
not what happens.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:25.550
Particles don't just go whizzing
along at 300 meters per second.

00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:28.705
What happens to them?

00:27:28.705 --> 00:27:30.410
AUDIENCE: Bump into each other.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:31.618
MICHALE FEE: Into each other.

00:27:31.618 --> 00:27:35.520
They're all crashing into
each other constantly.

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.440
So in solution, a particle
collides with a water molecule

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.910
every about 10 to the
13 times per second.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.850
10 to the minus 13 seconds
between collisions.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:50.750
So that means the particle is
moving a little bit crashing,

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:52.500
moving in a different
direction, crashing,

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.410
moving in a different
direction and crashing.

00:27:55.410 --> 00:28:01.200
So if you follow one particle,
it's just jumping around,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.403
it's diffusing.

00:28:02.403 --> 00:28:03.570
So what does that look like?

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.260
Daniel made a little
video that shows to scale.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:10.650
This is position in micron.

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.000
And time is in real-time.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:17.280
So this video shows in real-time
what the motion of a particle

00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.060
might look like.

00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:27.750
In each point, it's moving,
colliding, and moving off

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:30.050
in some random direction.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.840
You can actually see this.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.670
If you look at a
very small particle--

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.480
who was it, Daniel, who did that
experiment looking at pollen?

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.592
It's Brownian, at Brown.

00:28:46.592 --> 00:28:47.175
AUDIENCE: Yup.

00:28:47.175 --> 00:28:49.590
MICHALE FEE: What
was his first name?

00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:50.790
Brown.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:51.720
Brownian motion.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.620
Have you heard of
Brownian motion?

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.070
So somebody named
Brown was looking

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:02.010
at pollen particles in water and
noticing that they jump around,

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:04.820
just like this.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.790
And he hypothesized that they
were being jostled around

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:08.450
by the water.

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.720
Any questions?

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:22.370
So what can we say about this?

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.840
There's something really
interesting about diffusion

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.480
that's very
non-intuitive at first.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.250
Diffusion has some really
strange aspect to it.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:36.950
That a distance that
a particle can diffuse

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:41.390
depends very much on
the time that you allow.

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:43.850
And it's not just
a simple relation.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.200
So let's just look at this.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.200
So let's ask how
much time does it

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.860
take for an ion to
diffuse a short distance,

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:57.320
like across the
soma of a neuron.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:01.150
So an ion can diffuse
across the soma of a neuron

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:02.560
in about a 20th of a second.

00:30:07.548 --> 00:30:08.840
How about down it at dendrites.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.960
So let's start our
ion in the cell body.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.640
And ask, how long
does it take an iron

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.980
to reach the end of a dendrite
that can be about a millimeter

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:18.480
away.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:25.610
Can take about 10
minutes on average.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:27.350
That's how long it
will take an iron

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.540
to get that far away
from its starting point.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:35.880
So you can see, 20th
of a second here.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.250
And here it's like 500 seconds.

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:43.050
About 10 minutes.

00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:45.390
How long does it take an ion,
starting at the cell body,

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:47.392
to diffuse all the way down--

00:30:47.392 --> 00:30:49.350
so you know there are
neurons in your body that

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:54.110
start in your spinal cord and go
all the way down to your feet.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:59.030
So motor neurons in your spinal
cord can have very long axons.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.590
So how long does it take
an ion to get from the soma

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:07.400
all the way down to the end
of an axon, a long axon?

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:16.960
Somebody just take a guess.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.840
It's 20th of a second
here, 10 minutes here.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.010
Anybody want to guess?

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:27.170
An hour, yup.

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:29.180
10 years.

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:30.560
OK.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.310
Why is that?

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.595
That's crazy, right?

00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:34.470
How is that possible?

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.860
And that's an ion.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:40.320
So a cell body is making
proteins and all kinds of stuff

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.930
that have to get down
to build synapses

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.760
at the other end of that axon.

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:49.350
And proteins diffuse a heck
of a lot slower than ions do.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:54.480
So basically a cell body
could make stuff for the axon,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:58.430
and it would never get there
in your entire lifetime.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:02.730
And that's why cells have to
actually make little trains.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:04.260
They literally
make little trains.

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.490
They package up stuff
and put it on the train

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:12.070
and it just marches down the
axon until it gets to the end.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.250
And this is the reason why.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.070
So what we're going to do is
I'm going to just walk you

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:21.590
through a very simple
derivation of why this is true

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:24.790
and how to think about this.

00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:27.250
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:30.580
So normally things diffuse
in three dimensions, right?

00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:32.870
But it's just much harder
to analyze things in three

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:33.370
dimensions..

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.430
So you can get basically
the right answer

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:39.520
just by analyzing how things
diffuse in one dimension.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.950
So Daniel made this
little video to show you

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:43.160
what this looks like.

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.968
This is I think 100 particles
all lined up near zero.

00:32:47.968 --> 00:32:49.510
And we're going to
turn on the video.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:52.300
We're going to let them all
start diffusing at one moment.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.037
So you can just watch
what happens to all

00:32:54.037 --> 00:32:55.120
these different particles.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:01.380
So you can see that
some particles end up

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.550
over here on the left.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.230
Other particles end up
over here on the right.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:08.790
You can see that the
distribution of particles

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.490
spreads out.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.740
And so we're going to figure out
why that is, why that happens.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.490
So the first thing I
just want to tell you

00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:21.430
is that the distribution
of particles,

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.880
if they all start at
zero, and they diffuse

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:28.870
in 1D away from zero, the
distribution that you get

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.500
is Gaussian.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.720
And the basic reason is that,
let's start at the center,

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.210
and on every time step they
have a probability of 1/2

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:41.560
of going to the right and
1/2 of going to the left.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.760
And so basically there
are many more combinations

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:49.330
of ways a particle can do
some lefts and do some rights

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.250
and end up back
where it started.

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:53.290
It's very unlikely
that the particle

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:57.670
will do a whole bunch of
going right all in a row.

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.780
And so that's why the
density and the distribution

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.995
is very low down here.

00:34:03.995 --> 00:34:05.620
And so you end up
with something that's

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.735
just a Gaussian distribution.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:15.790
So let's analyze this
in a little more detail.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:19.469
So we're going to just make a
very simple model of particles

00:34:19.469 --> 00:34:21.434
stepping to the
right or to the left.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.100
We're going to consider
a particle that

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.790
is moving left or right at a
fixed velocity vx for some time

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.580
tau before a collision.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.830
And we're going to imagine
that each time the particle

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:41.250
collides it resets its velocity
randomly, either to the left

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:43.280
or to the right.

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.489
So on every time step,
half the particles

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.500
will step right by
a distance delta,

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.699
which is the velocity
times the time tau.

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:54.260
And the other half
of the particles

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.500
will step left by
that same distance.

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:00.440
So they're going either to
the left or to the right

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.460
by a distance delta.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.820
So if we start with n
particles and all of them

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:17.660
start at position
0 at time 0, then

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:23.060
we can write down the position
of every particle at time step

00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:27.480
n, the i-th particle
at time step n.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.270
And we're going to assume that
each particle is independent,

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:34.760
each doing their own
thing, ignoring each other.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:38.560
So now you can see
that you can write down

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:42.850
the position of the particle
at time step n is just

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.490
the position of the particle
at the previous time

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:48.420
step, plus or minus
this little delta.

00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:52.740
Any questions about that?

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:03.250
So please, if you ever just
haven't followed one step

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:05.390
that I do, just let me know.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:07.030
I'm happy to explain it again.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:11.170
I often am watching somebody
explaining something really

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.440
simple, and my brain is
just in some funny state

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.660
and I just don't get it.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:21.020
So it's totally fine if you want
me to explain something again.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.020
You don't have to be
embarrassed because happens

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:23.830
to me all the time.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.460
So now what we can do
is use this expression,

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.700
compute how that distribution
evolves over time,

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:39.070
how that distribution of
particles, this i-th particle

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:42.340
over time, time step n.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.650
All right, so let's calculate
what the average position

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:46.060
of the ensemble is.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.320
So these brackets mean average.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:51.490
So the bracket with an
i, that I'm averaging

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:55.525
this quantity over i particles.

00:36:55.525 --> 00:37:00.130
And so it's just
the sum of positions

00:37:00.130 --> 00:37:02.800
for every particle, divided
by the number of particles.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.910
That's the average position.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.590
So again, the position of the
i-th particle at time step n

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.570
is just the position of that
particle at the previous time

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.940
step, plus or minus delta.

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:16.480
We just plug that into
there, into there.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.320
And now we calculate the sum.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.640
But we have two terms.

00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:20.980
We have this term and that term.

00:37:20.980 --> 00:37:23.480
Let's break them up
into two separate sums.

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:27.880
So this is equal to the sum
over the previous positions,

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:33.310
plus the sum over how
much the change was

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:35.020
from one time step to the next.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.400
Does that makes sense?

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.040
But what is this sum?

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.800
We're summing over
all the particles,

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.770
how much they changed from
the previous time step

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.780
to this time step.

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.200
Well, half of them moved to
the right and half of them

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.050
the left.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:54.260
So that sum is just zero.

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:59.210
So you can see that
the average position

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:01.220
of the particles
at this time step

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:04.550
is just equal to the average
position of the particles

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:05.840
at the previous time step.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.690
And what that means is that
the center of the distribution

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.840
hasn't changed.

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:15.800
If you start all the particles
at zero, they diffuse around.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:18.970
The average position
is still zero.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:19.650
Yes?

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:22.555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
bracket [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:22.555 --> 00:38:23.500
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:30.650
So this here is just this.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:35.480
So this bracket means I'm
averaging over this quantity i.

00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.230
So you can see that's
what I'm doing here.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.712
I'm summing over i and dividing
by the number of particles.

00:38:40.712 --> 00:38:41.712
AUDIENCE: And what is i?

00:38:41.712 --> 00:38:44.270
MICHALE FEE: I is
the particle number.

00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:48.920
So if we have 10 particles,
i goes from 1 to 10.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.420
Thank you.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.970
So that's a little boring.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:39:00.030
But we used a trick
here that we're

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:02.040
going to use now to
actually calculate

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.640
the interesting thing, which
is on average how far do

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:09.950
the particles get from
where they started.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:13.070
So what we're going to do is not
calculate the average position

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.350
of all the particles.

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:19.610
We're going to calculate
the average absolute value

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.155
from where they started.

00:39:21.155 --> 00:39:22.800
Does that makes sense?

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:27.132
We're going to ask, on average,
how far did they get from where

00:39:27.132 --> 00:39:28.340
they started, which was zero.

00:39:32.260 --> 00:39:37.180
So absolute values,
nobody likes.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.390
They're hard to deal with.

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:43.580
But this is exactly the same
as calculating the square root

00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.590
of the average square.

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:50.942
It's the same as
calculating the variance.

00:39:50.942 --> 00:39:52.493
Does that makes sense?

00:39:52.493 --> 00:39:53.910
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.380
going to calculate the
variance of that distribution.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.890
And the square root
of that variance

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:02.670
is just the standard deviation,
which is just how wide it is,

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:07.500
which is just how far on
average the particles got

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.402
from where they started.

00:40:09.402 --> 00:40:11.490
Does that makes sense?

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:13.930
So let's push on.

00:40:13.930 --> 00:40:17.412
We're going to calculate
the average square distance.

00:40:17.412 --> 00:40:19.870
Now we're just going to take
the square of that at the end.

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:23.890
So the average of the
position squared, we're

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:26.740
going to plug this into here.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.190
So we're going to square it.

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:31.240
So the position of
the particle squared

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:33.230
is just this quantity squared.

00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:35.450
Let's factor it out.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.530
So we have this term
squared plus twice

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:43.720
that times that here,
plus that term squared.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:47.450
And we're going to
now plug that average.

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:50.620
So the average position
squared is just the average.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:56.230
The average position
squared at this time step n

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:59.200
is the average position
squared at the previous time

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.940
step plus some other stuff.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.190
And let's take a look at
what that other stuff is.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:06.400
What is this?

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:10.180
This is plus or
minus 2 times delta,

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:15.060
which is the step it takes,
the size of the step times x.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.520
So what is that average?

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.660
Half of these are positive and
half of these are negative.

00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.630
So the average is zero.

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.450
And quantity is the
average of delta squared.

00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:33.570
Well, delta squared is
always positive, right?

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.580
So what does this say?

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:43.050
What this says is that the
variance at this time step

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.680
is just the variance
at a previous time step

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.410
is a constant.

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:49.260
So let's analyze that.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:51.660
What this says is that
at each time step,

00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:56.950
the variance grows
by some constant.

00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:58.090
Delta is a distance.

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:02.660
Delta squared is just the units
of variance of a distribution

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.910
that's a function of distance.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:10.010
So if the variance
at time step 0 is 0,

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.560
that means they're all
lined up at the origin.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.660
One time step later, the
variance will be delta squared.

00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.730
The next time step, it
will be two delta squared.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.180
The next time step,
dot, dot, dot.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.540
Up at some time step n, it
will be n times delta squared.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.860
So you see what's happening?

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.720
The variance of
this distribution

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:27.665
is growing linearly.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:38.870
We can change from time
steps to continuous time.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:45.190
So the step number
is just time divided

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:48.880
by tau, which is
some interval in time

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.930
like the interval
between collisions.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:54.790
And so you can see that
the variance is just

00:42:54.790 --> 00:43:01.120
growing linearly in time where
the variance is just 2 times d

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:06.070
times T, where d is what we
call the diffusion coefficient.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.010
It's just length
squared divided by time.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.030
Why is that?

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:20.155
Because as time grows, the
variance grows linearly.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:28.180
So if we want to take
time, multiply it

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.430
by something that
gives us variance,

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.600
it has to be variance
per unit time.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.090
And variance, for
something that's

00:43:38.090 --> 00:43:42.760
a distribution of position,
has to have position squared.

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:43.260
Yes?

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:46.324
AUDIENCE: But do we like
[INAUDIBLE],, like that?

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.400
MICHALE FEE: It's built
into the definition

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.460
of the diffusion constant, OK?

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:03.490
Any questions about that?

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.380
And now here here's the answer.

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:13.170
So the variance is
growing linearly in time.

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:17.540
What that means is that
the standard deviation,

00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:20.450
the average distance
from the starting point,

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:23.140
is growing as the
square root of time.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:28.050
And that's key.

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.430
That I want you to remember.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:40.930
The distance that
a particle diffuses

00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:43.930
from its starting
point on average grows

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.210
is the square root of time.

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:56.590
So for a small molecule,
a typical small molecule,

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.490
the diffusion constant is 10 to
the minus 5 centimeters squared

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:02.650
per second.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:07.140
And so now we can just plug
in some distances in times

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:12.480
and see how long it
takes this particle

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.850
to diffuse some distance.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:15.870
So let's do that.

00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:18.510
Let's plug in a
length of 10 microns.

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.730
That was our soma,
our cell body.

00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.430
It's 10 to the
minus 3 centimeters.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.980
Time is that squared,
length squared.

00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:30.490
So it's 10 to the minus 6
centimeters squared divided

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.410
by the diffusion constant.

00:45:32.410 --> 00:45:35.708
2 times the diffusion constant,
2 times 10 to the minus 5

00:45:35.708 --> 00:45:37.000
centimeters squared per second.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.010
You can see centimeter
squareds cancel.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.160
That leaves us time.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.450
50 milliseconds.

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:47.000
Now let's put in one millimeter.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.240
That was the length
of our dendrite.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.570
So that's 10 to the
minus 1 centimeter.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.670
So we plug that into
our equation for time.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:58.790
Time is just L squared--

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:02.670
I forgot to actually
write that down.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.395
Here's the equation
that I'm solving.

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.720
So what this equation at
the bottom here is saying

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:18.760
is some distance is equal
to the square root of 2dT.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.600
And I'm just saying L
squared is equal to 2 dT.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.000
And I'm solving for
T, L squared over 2d.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.920
That's the equation I'm solving.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:33.795
I'm giving you a length and I'm
calculating how long it takes.

00:46:40.110 --> 00:46:42.690
So if you put in 10
to the minus 1 here,

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:44.900
you get 10 to the minus
2 divided by 2 times 10

00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.910
to the minus 500 seconds,
which is about 10 minutes.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:54.610
And now if you ask how long
does it take to go a meter,

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:56.840
that's 10 to the 2 centimeters.

00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:00.180
That's 10 to the 4 divided
by 10 to the minus 5.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.930
Somebody over here
figured it out right away.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:09.160
About 5 times 10
to the 8 seconds,

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.200
which is about 10 years.

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.320
A year is pi times 10 to
the 7 seconds, by the way.

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.020
Plus or minus a few percent.

00:47:25.296 --> 00:47:26.550
Any questions about that?

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:35.730
Cool, right?

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:39.590
So neurons and cells
and biology has

00:47:39.590 --> 00:47:45.130
to go to extraordinary lengths
to overcome this craziness

00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:53.820
of diffusion, which explains
a lot of the structure you

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:54.600
see in cells.

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:08.570
So you can see that
diffusion causes

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:12.380
the movement of ions
from places where

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:15.170
they're concentrated to places
where there aren't so many

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:15.950
ions.

00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:19.580
So let's take a little
bit slightly more

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.345
detail look at that idea.

00:48:21.345 --> 00:48:22.970
So what I'm going to
tell you about now

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.830
is called Fick's First Law.

00:48:24.830 --> 00:48:26.810
And the idea is that
diffusion produces

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:30.530
a net flow of particles from
regions of high concentration

00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:34.010
to regions of lower
concentration.

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:36.260
And the flux of
particles is proportional

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:38.120
to the concentration gradient.

00:48:38.120 --> 00:48:40.070
Now this is just
really obvious, right?

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:45.770
If you have a box, and on the
left side of the box you have n

00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:46.370
particles.

00:48:46.370 --> 00:48:48.830
Then on the right
side of the box then

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:51.643
you're going to have particles
diffusing from here to there.

00:48:51.643 --> 00:48:53.060
And you're going
to have particles

00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.190
diffusing from there to there.

00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.300
But because there are
more of them over here,

00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:00.250
they're just going to be
more particles going this way

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:02.756
than there are that way.

00:49:02.756 --> 00:49:03.910
Does that makes sense?

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:10.080
Let's say each
particle here might

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.530
have a 50% chance of
diffusing here or staying here

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:15.600
or diffusing somewhere else.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.047
Particles here also
equally have probability

00:49:18.047 --> 00:49:18.880
of going either way.

00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.280
But just because there
are more of them here,

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.710
there's going to be more
particles going that way.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.780
You can just
calculate the number

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:30.690
of particles going this way
minus the number of particles

00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.270
going that way.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:34.680
And that gives
you the net number

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:36.930
of particles going to the right.

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.920
But what does that look like?

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:47.760
You have the number here minus
the number some distance away.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.047
And what if you were to
divide that by the distance?

00:49:51.047 --> 00:49:52.130
What would that look like?

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.420
Good.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.980
It looks like a derivative.

00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.320
So if you calculate
the flux, it's

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.390
minus the diffusion
constant times

00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:05.750
1 over delta, the separation
between these boxes.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:09.140
It's the concentration here
minus the concentration there.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:11.920
And that is just a derivative.

00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:15.050
And that's Fick's First Law.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:18.290
I have a few slides at the
end of the lecture that

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:21.540
do this derivation
more completely.

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:25.280
So please take a look at
that if you have time.

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:31.660
So now this is really
an important concept.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:36.430
This Fick's First Law, the fact
that concentration gradients

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:40.720
produce a flow of
ions, of particles,

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.840
is so fundamental
to how neurons work.

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.640
And here we're
going to be building

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.410
that up over the course of
the next couple lectures.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.230
So imagine that you
have a cell that

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:56.160
has a lot of potassium
ions inside and very

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.720
few potassium ions outside.

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:00.100
Now you can see
that you're going

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:03.035
to have potassium ions
diffusing from here.

00:51:03.035 --> 00:51:04.410
Sorry, and I forgot
to say, let's

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:07.710
say that your cell
has a hole in it.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:10.710
So you're going to have
potassium ions diffusing

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:13.830
from inside to outside
through the hole.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:16.200
You also have some
potassium ions out here.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.030
And some of those
might diffuse in.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.360
But there are just so
many more potassium ions

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.480
inside than outside
concentration-wise

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:26.760
that the probability of one
going out through the hole

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.760
is just much higher than the
probability of a potassium ion

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.410
going back into the cell.

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.510
So here I'm just zooming
in on that channel,

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.400
on that pore through
the membrane.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.160
Lots of potassium ions here.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.610
On average, there's going to
be a net flow of potassium

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.610
out through that hole.

00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:54.172
And we can plot the
concentration gradient

00:51:54.172 --> 00:51:54.880
through the hole.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:57.490
And you can see it's
high here, it decreases,

00:51:57.490 --> 00:52:00.670
and it's low outside.

00:52:00.670 --> 00:52:05.160
And so there's a net flow that's
proportional to the steepness

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.220
of concentration profile.

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.850
So that's true,
you get a net flow,

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:14.770
even if each particle is
diffusing independently.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.590
They don't know anything
about each other.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.695
And yet that concentration
gradient produces a current.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.030
All concentration
gradients go away.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:31.360
Why is that?

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.330
Because calcium ions will flow
from the inside of the cell

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:37.810
to the outside of the cell until
they're the same concentration.

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.790
And then you'll
have just as many

00:52:39.790 --> 00:52:43.570
flowing back inside as
you have flowing outside.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:44.290
Why?

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.810
So eventually that would
happen to all of our cells.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:47.810
Why doesn't that happen?

00:52:52.067 --> 00:52:54.432
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because they're alive.

00:52:54.432 --> 00:52:57.070
MICHALE FEE: Well, that's
exactly the right answer,

00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:01.440
but there are a few
intermediate steps.

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:04.470
If you were to not
be alive anymore,

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:06.390
the potassium ions
would just diffuse out.

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.520
And that would be the end.

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:12.360
But what happens is
there are other proteins

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.970
in the membrane that take
those potassium ions from here

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:17.940
and pump them back inside and
maintain the concentration

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:18.660
gradient.

00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:20.100
But that costs energy.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.260
Those proteins use ATP.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.240
And that ATP comes from eating.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.850
But eventually all
concentration gradients go away.

00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.420
So that is how we
get current flow

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.460
from concentration gradients.

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:52.590
Now the next topic has to do
with the diffusion of ions

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:57.340
in the presence of
voltage differences,

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:00.800
in the presence of
voltage gradients.

00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.790
The bottom line here
that I want you to know,

00:54:03.790 --> 00:54:07.330
that I want you to understand,
is that current flow in neurons

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:08.640
obeys Ohm's Law.

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:09.650
Now what does that mean?

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.290
Let's imagine that
we have a resistor.

00:54:12.290 --> 00:54:17.380
Let's say across a membrane
or in the intracellular

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:21.790
or extracellular
space of a neuron.

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:26.230
The current flow through
that resistive medium

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:31.780
is proportional to the
voltage difference.

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:33.250
So that's Ohm's Law.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:38.080
The current is proportional
to the voltage difference

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.020
across the two terminals, the
two sides of the resistor.

00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.290
And the proportionality constant
is 1 over the resistance.

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:50.680
So here current has
units of amperes.

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:55.750
The voltage difference
is units of volts.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:59.600
And the resistance
has units of ohms.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.650
Any questions about that?

00:55:06.130 --> 00:55:08.240
So let's go through--

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:10.160
let's develop this
idea a little bit more

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.350
and understand why it is that
a voltage difference produces

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.470
a current that's
proportional to voltage.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:20.220
So let's go back to
our little [AUDIO OUT]

00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.800
filled with salt solution.

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.800
There are ions in here
dissolved in the water.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.060
We have two metal plates.

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.760
We've put a battery between
the two metal plates that

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:31.580
holds those two plates at
some fixed voltage difference

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:39.780
delta v. And we're going
to ask what happens.

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.050
So let's zoom in here.

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:43.070
There is one plate
that's at one potential.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:45.500
There's another plate
at another potential.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.420
There's some voltage
difference between those

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:52.940
that's delta v. The two plates
are separated by a distance L.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:56:02.660
And that voltage difference
produces an electric field

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.530
that points from the
high voltage region

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:07.800
to the low voltage region.

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:14.390
So an electric field produces
a force on a charge--

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:16.670
we have lots of
charges in here--

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:22.700
that's proportional to the
charge and the electric field.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.260
So what is that
force going to do?

00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:29.600
That force is just going
to drag that particle

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.770
through the liquid,
through the water.

00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.520
So why is it?

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:44.100
So if this were a vacuum in
here and we put a charge there

00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:47.190
and metal plates and we
put a battery across,

00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.540
what would that particle do?

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:53.580
It would move.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.080
But what would this force
do to that particle?

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:57.880
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:58.780
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:00.910
So what would the velocity do?

00:57:00.910 --> 00:57:01.780
AUDIENCE: Increase.

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.230
MICHALE FEE: It would
just increase linearly.

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:04.920
So the particle
would start moving.

00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:06.930
And it would start moving
slowly and it'd go--

00:57:06.930 --> 00:57:09.585
poof-- crash into the plate.

00:57:09.585 --> 00:57:10.960
But that's not
what happens here.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.358
Why is that?

00:57:13.358 --> 00:57:14.774
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:14.774 --> 00:57:17.190
MICHALE FEE: Because
there's stuff in the way.

00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:22.540
And so it accelerates, and it
gets hit by a water molecule.

00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:24.770
And it gets pushed
off in some direction.

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:29.110
And then it accelerates in
this direction, gets hit again.

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:32.680
But it's constantly being
accelerated in one direction

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.855
before it collides.

00:57:34.855 --> 00:57:35.980
And so here's what happens.

00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:48.970
So it's diffusing around.

00:57:48.970 --> 00:57:52.600
But on each step, it has a
little bit of acceleration

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.610
in this direction,
in the direction

00:57:54.610 --> 00:57:55.540
of the electric field.

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:07.360
And so you can show using
the same kind of analysis

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:12.940
that we used in calculating
the distribution, the change

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.520
in mean and variance,
you can show

00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:20.200
that mean of a
distribution of particles

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:24.000
that starts at zero shifts--

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.670
of positive particles
shifts in the electric field

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:31.220
linearly in time.

00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:35.150
And you can just think about
that as the electric field

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:38.300
reaches in, grabs that
charged particle, and pulls it

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:41.780
in this direction
against viscous drag.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:46.370
So now a force produces
a constant velocity, not

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:49.160
acceleration.

00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:51.440
And that velocity is
called the drift velocity.

00:58:54.330 --> 00:59:01.190
So the force is proportional
to drift velocity.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:03.630
What is that little f there?

00:59:03.630 --> 00:59:04.720
Anybody know what that is?

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:06.095
AUDIENCE: Frictional
coefficient.

00:59:06.095 --> 00:59:08.600
MICHALE FEE: It's
the coefficient

00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:10.580
of friction of that particle.

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.900
And Einstein cleverly
noticed that the coefficient

00:59:14.900 --> 00:59:20.390
of friction of a particle
being dragged through a liquid

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.735
is related to what?

00:59:21.735 --> 00:59:22.235
Any guess?

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.900
Diffusion coefficient
of that particle.

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:30.525
Is that cool?

00:59:30.525 --> 00:59:32.260
That just gives me chills.

00:59:35.010 --> 00:59:38.770
The frictional
coefficient is just

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:41.750
kT over the diffusion constant.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.320
So if you actually just go
through that same analysis

00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:48.160
of calculating the mean of the
distribution, what you find

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.450
is that v moves
linearly in time.

00:59:52.450 --> 00:59:54.130
But it's also very intuitive.

00:59:54.130 --> 01:00:01.000
If you're in a swimming pool,
you put your hand in the water,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.180
and you push your hand
with a constant force.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:05.840
What happens?

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.590
Well, let me flip it around.

01:00:07.590 --> 01:00:10.790
You move your hand through the
water at a constant velocity.

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:14.620
What is the force feel like?

01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:16.197
The force is constant, right?

01:00:16.197 --> 01:00:17.530
So flip it the other way around.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:19.072
If the force is
constant, then you're

01:00:19.072 --> 01:00:20.840
going to get a
constant velocity.

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:24.120
Yes?

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.430
AUDIENCE: So side
question, but you can also

01:00:26.430 --> 01:00:28.555
look at that like a
terminal velocity problem?

01:00:28.555 --> 01:00:29.430
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.660
It's exactly the same thing.

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:39.250
So the drift velocity is
proportional to the force

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:43.420
by proportionality constant,
1 over the coefficient

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.270
of friction, which
is now d over kT.

01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:49.180
And what is this
force proportional to?

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:50.530
Anybody remember?

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:54.695
The force was proportional
to the electric field.

01:00:59.050 --> 01:01:03.590
And so let's
calculate the current.

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:06.280
So I'm going to argue
that the current is

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:10.950
proportional to the drift
velocity times the area.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:12.770
Now why is that?

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.410
So if I have an
electric field, it

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:18.980
makes these particles, all
the particles in this area

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:24.250
here drift at a constant
velocity in this direction.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:25.900
So there is a certain
amount of current

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:29.706
that's flowing in
this area right here.

01:01:29.706 --> 01:01:31.700
Does that makes sense?

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:35.690
Now if my electrodes are big
and I also have electric field

01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:38.360
up here, then that
electric field

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:42.067
is causing current
to flow up here too.

01:01:42.067 --> 01:01:43.650
And if there's
electric field up here,

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.780
then there will be current
flowing up here too.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:48.570
And so you can see that the
amount of current that's

01:01:48.570 --> 01:01:51.720
flowing between the electrodes
is proportional to the drift

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:57.120
velocity and the cross-sectional
area between the two

01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.520
electrodes.

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.130
Yes?

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:01.370
So that's really important.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:10.410
Now we figured out
that the drift velocity

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:13.500
is proportional to
the electric field.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.440
So the current is proportional
to the electric field

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:17.910
times the area.

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:21.030
And the electric field is
just the voltage difference

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:25.890
divided by the spacing
between the electrodes.

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:27.870
And so the current is
proportional to voltage

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:30.750
times area divided by length.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.090
So we have a proportionality.

01:02:32.090 --> 01:02:34.490
Current is
proportional to voltage

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:36.420
times area divided by length.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:39.980
And now let's plug in what that
proportionality constant is.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.350
This is now like
Ohm's Law, right?

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.630
We're saying the current
is proportional to voltage

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:53.170
difference.

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.600
The thing that the
proportionality constant

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.750
here is something
called resistivity.

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.860
Otherwise known as conductivity.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:02.583
But we're going to
use resistivity.

01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:07.490
So this is just Ohm's Law.

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:13.230
It says current is proportional
to voltage difference.

01:03:13.230 --> 01:03:15.210
Let's rewrite that a
little bit so that it

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:16.680
looks more like Ohm's Law.

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:20.010
Current is proportional
to voltage difference.

01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:23.580
And that thing, that
thingy right there,

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.770
should have units of what?

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:27.510
1 over ohms.

01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:28.820
Right?

01:03:28.820 --> 01:03:30.980
So that is 1 over resistance.

01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.670
Let's just write down
what the resistance is.

01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:39.660
Resistance is just resistivity
times length divided by area.

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:42.290
So let's just stop
and take a breath

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:45.230
and think about why
this makes sense.

01:03:48.100 --> 01:03:51.100
Resistance is how
much resistance there

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.630
is to flow at a
given voltage, right?

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:58.130
So what happens if we
make ours really small?

01:03:58.130 --> 01:04:01.130
What happens to the resistance?

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
really big.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.960
MICHALE FEE: The
resistance gets big.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:10.070
The amount of current gets
small because there's less area

01:04:10.070 --> 01:04:13.272
that the electric field is in.

01:04:13.272 --> 01:04:14.480
And so the current goes down.

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:15.855
That means the
resistance is big.

01:04:15.855 --> 01:04:17.820
If we make our
plates really big,

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.790
the resistance gets smaller.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:24.270
What happens if we pull
our plates further apart?

01:04:24.270 --> 01:04:26.120
What happens to the resistance?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
further apart.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:28.730
MICHALE FEE: Good.

01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.950
If the plates are further
apart, L is bigger,

01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:32.030
and resistance is bigger.

01:04:32.030 --> 01:04:34.580
But conceptually,
what's going on?

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.000
Physically, what's going?

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.010
The plates are further
apart, so what happens?

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:40.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.500
MICHALE FEE: Right.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.450
The voltage difference
is the same,

01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:46.430
but the distance is bigger.

01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:50.620
And so the electric field,
which is voltage per distance,

01:04:50.620 --> 01:04:51.730
is smaller.

01:04:51.730 --> 01:04:58.120
And that smaller electric field
produces a drift velocity.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:02.600
And that's why the
resistance goes up.

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:05.250
Cool, right?

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:06.690
OK.

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:12.560
Now, let's talk for a
minute about resistivity.

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:18.140
So resistivity in the brain
is really, really lousy.

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:23.270
The wires of the
brain are just awful.

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:26.110
So if you look at the
resistivity for copper, which

01:05:26.110 --> 01:05:30.700
is which is the wire
that's used in electronics,

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:36.940
the resistivity is 1.6
microohms times centimeters.

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:40.780
What that means is if I took a
block of copper, a centimeter

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:44.080
on a side, and I put
electrodes on the side of it,

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.730
and I measured the resistance,
it would be 1.6 microohms.

01:05:51.705 --> 01:05:59.460
That means I could run an amp,
that thing with 1.6 microvolts.

01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:09.810
Now the resistivity of the
brain is 60 ohms centimeters.

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:14.190
That means a centimeter of
block of saline solution,

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:18.770
intracellular or
extracellular solution,

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:24.890
has a resistance of 60 ohms
instead of 1.6 microohms.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:27.395
It's more than a
million times worse.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:35.380
And what that means is that
when you try to send current

01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:38.990
through brain, you try
to send some current,

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:41.580
the voltage just drops.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:45.360
You need huge voltage drops
to produce tiny currents.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.910
That's why the brain
has invented things--

01:06:55.910 --> 01:07:00.710
axons-- because the
wires are so bad that you

01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:02.900
can't send a signal from
one part of the brain

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.360
to another part of the
brain through the wire.

01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.270
You have to invent this special
gimmick called an action

01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:14.240
potential to send a signal
more than a few microns away.

01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:20.580
It's pretty cool, right?

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:24.810
That's why it's so interesting
to understand the basic physics

01:07:24.810 --> 01:07:28.260
of something, the basic
mechanisms by which something

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.230
works because most
of what you see

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:36.170
is a hack to compensate
for weird physics, right?

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.670
Yes?

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:38.594
AUDIENCE: Does this [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:44.366 --> 01:07:50.570
MICHALE FEE: This
high resistivity--

01:07:50.570 --> 01:07:54.290
you're asking what causes
that high resistivity.

01:07:54.290 --> 01:07:59.660
It basically has to do with
things like the mean-free path

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:01.190
of the particle.

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:06.050
So in a metal, particles
can go further effectively

01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:06.980
before they collide.

01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.810
So the resistivity is lower.

01:08:11.810 --> 01:08:15.007
AUDIENCE: Is that
slope [INAUDIBLE]??

01:08:15.007 --> 01:08:17.340
MICHALE FEE: It's a little
bit different inside the cell

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:19.410
because there's more
gunk inside of a cell

01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:20.979
than there is outside of a cell.

01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:23.310
And so the resistivity
is a little bit worse.

01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:26.380
It's 2,000 ohms centimeters,
or 1,000 or 2,000

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:28.770
inside the cell and
more like 60 outside.

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:30.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.830
MICHALE FEE: Yes once
you're outside the cell,

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.956
it's basically the
same everywhere.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:40.130
OK?

01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:45.060
So that's it.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.029
So here's what we
learned about today.

01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:53.890
We understood the relation
between the timescale

01:08:53.890 --> 01:08:55.529
of diffusion and length scales.

01:08:55.529 --> 01:09:00.840
And we learned that the distance
that a particle can diffuse

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:03.029
grows only as the
square root of time.

01:09:06.069 --> 01:09:09.970
We understood how concentration
gradients lead to currents.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:13.420
And we talked about
Fick's First Law

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.870
that says that concentration
differences lead

01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:18.250
to particle flux.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:21.729
The flux is proportional to
the gradient or the derivative

01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:23.560
of the concentration.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:27.850
And we also talked about how
the drift of charged particles

01:09:27.850 --> 01:09:31.630
in an electric field
leads to currents,

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:37.000
and how the voltage current
relation obeys Ohm's Law.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.090
And we also talked about
the concept of resistivity

01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.689
and how the resistivity in
the brain is really high

01:09:43.689 --> 01:09:45.700
and makes the wires in
the brain really bad.

01:09:48.649 --> 01:09:51.470
So that's all I have.

01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:54.360
I will take any questions.

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:54.900
Yes, Daniel?

01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:56.900
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to introduce David.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:57.950
MICHALE FEE: OK.

01:09:57.950 --> 01:09:58.970
Our other TA is here.

01:10:01.690 --> 01:10:02.915
Any questions?

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:05.910
Great.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:08.160
So we will see you--

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:09.570
when is the first [AUDIO OUT]?

01:10:09.570 --> 01:10:09.810
Is that--

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:10.602
AUDIENCE: Tomorrow.

01:10:10.602 --> 01:10:12.320
MICHALE FEE: Tomorrow.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:15.320
So I will see you Thursday.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.570
GARY GENSLER: Thank you
for everybody coming back.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.150
And I should tell
you, when I start

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.030
the session with
that little shh,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.420
I learned from a
congressman in Baltimore.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.270
As some of you know, I've spent
a lot of time around politics.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.610
And one of my roles
in politics was

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.060
that I was the treasurer of
the Maryland Democratic Party.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.800
Which, if you
anybody ever asks you

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.810
to be the treasurer of
a state party, come.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.080
I can give you some
advice about what

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.910
that's all about
when your home state

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.510
senator asks you to do it.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.420
So I had to quiet down the
annual Jefferson Jackson Day

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.890
dinners.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.070
I'd organize these big dinners,
and there's 400, 500, 600

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.630
people at these dinners.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.450
I couldn't do it.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.955
I couldn't get their attention.

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:16.338
And Congressman Elijah
Cummings comes up,

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:17.630
and he just leans into the mic.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.290
Shh.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.170
And it quieted the
whole place down.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.530
I said, Congressman,
what is this?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.580
Is this something you've
learned in politics,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.060
something you learned from
your minister, your priest?

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.730
He said, it works every
time, works every time.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.110
So Elijah Cummings gave
me that little duty.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.510
Blockchain and
money, we're here.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.490
I know it's a little
bit like eating broccoli

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.040
these last couple of
classes, because we went

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.610
through cryptography, and
then we moved a little bit

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.320
into consensus protocols.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.460
And today, we're going to pick
that up and try to finish up

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.150
the design bits of Bitcoin.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.263
I wanted to introduce,
though, one walk-in.

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:08.180
We're going to have
walk-ins from time to time

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.763
in this class.

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:11.690
But Patrick Murck,
he's hiding over here

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.550
with the cap in the hoodie.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.190
He's got the look
for a lawyer who's

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.270
been spending his time around
Bitcoin for seven years.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.732
Now, he's currently affiliated
with Berkman Klein at Harvard.

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:25.690
And I didn't know Patrick
was going to be here,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.648
so I'm calling him out.

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:28.910
He's also special counsel
of the Cooley law firm.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.880
And he has a bunch
of clients who

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.620
try to do the right
thing by the law.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.535
But sometimes they
find themselves

00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:38.660
dealing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.580
or other fine
government institutions.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.890
But Patrick was
also general counsel

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.323
to the Bitcoin Foundation.

00:02:45.323 --> 00:02:47.240
And for a short while,
you ran it, didn't you,

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.358
before it kind of went puff?

00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:51.150
PATRICK MURCK: Yes.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.718
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:53.510
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.700
But Patrick's the type
of lawyer that wears

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.500
a hoodie and a baseball cap.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.440
He's a Bitcoin lawyer.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.860
If you ever need Patrick for
one of your entrepreneurial

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.970
efforts, I'm sure Cooley law
firm will like advising you,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.626
too.

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:11.087
AUDIENCE: Do you take bitcoin?

00:03:11.087 --> 00:03:12.170
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:13.890
AUDIENCE: Does he take bitcoin?

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.350
PATRICK MURCK: I have.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.000
[INAUDIBLE] In fact, I've
never bought a bitcoin, ever.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.030
[INAUDIBLE] paid 100% in
bitcoin, so it's all good.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.593
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:28.010
GARY GENSLER: So
Patrick, when you

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.660
get paid 100% in
bitcoin from a client,

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.630
how long do you hold it?

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.938
PATRICK MURCK: Well,
it depends, right?

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:42.680
PATRICK MURCK: Often,
in the early days--

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.960
not very long,
because I had to pay

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.183
for my mortgage and my kid's
daycare and things like that,

00:03:48.183 --> 00:03:49.350
and they don't take bitcoin.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.180
So I've sold a lot of
bitcoin over the years.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.385
Something sadly, but
I never bought them.

00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:57.265
I just earned them.

00:03:57.265 --> 00:03:59.390
GARY GENSLER: Earned them--
so you're like a miner,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.370
except for you're a
lawyer who gets bitcoin.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.328
PATRICK MURCK: I
mine with my mind.

00:04:03.328 --> 00:04:05.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.580
GARY GENSLER: The study
questions for today

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.740
was, we were going to
turn to that last piece

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.779
about transactions and something
called the unspent transaction

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:23.540
output, and script code that
is a computer code that's

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.968
used inside of Bitcoin.

00:04:26.968 --> 00:04:29.900
We're going to talk a
little bit about the design

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.360
features bringing it all
together, and particularly

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.230
around the reading, which
was the academic pedigree

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.240
of Bitcoin.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.130
Which is also a
reading that Patrick

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:46.310
assigns when he does his study
group at Harvard Law, as well.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.690
And then, yes, all
of you are going

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:49.990
to be able to participate.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.540
And we're going to take a
survey amongst all of you

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.210
as to who's Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.540
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.220
Or would you rather do more
on transactions script?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.240
All right, we'll do
a little bit of both.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.015
The readings, of course, the
Bitcoin Academic Pedigree,

00:05:10.015 --> 00:05:12.140
which we're going to talk
about in the latter part.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.120
And I'll do a
little cold-calling

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.870
and get some feedback as to what
you thought from the reading

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.930
or if you're still skimming it.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.750
And then there was a
CoinDesk article, just

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:26.870
making sense of it all.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.840
And so as I said, we'll go
through the transactions.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.350
We'll do a little bit of
putting it all together

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.160
and the Academic Pedigree.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.710
We'll have a little fun.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.800
You all are going
to have a chance

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.610
to tell us who Satoshi Nakamoto
is, or was, or the committee.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.760
So transactions-- you've
seen this graph before.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.750
But transactions, the
format in a transaction

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.780
ledger-- not only in Bitcoin,
but really everything--

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.420
is somebody on one
side of a transaction

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.910
and somebody on another
side of a transaction.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.370
So in Bitcoin, there's an input.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:15.690
And the input inside of Bitcoin
is an ID of a previous output.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:21.450
So not only is Bitcoin a series
of blocks of information--

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:27.860
each block that has 1,000 to
2,000 individual transactions--

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.760
but in a sense, there's a
separate chain that's going on.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.500
I sometimes think
of a blockchain

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.700
as, yes, there's the chain
of big chunks of data,

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.660
but there's also a chain
of individual transactions.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.852
Shimon, is that a hand raised
or just scratching your head?

00:06:44.852 --> 00:06:46.148
AUDIENCE: I'll be more careful.

00:06:46.148 --> 00:06:47.606
GARY GENSLER: No,
that's all right.

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:50.257
Shimon is a faculty member
of the Finance department

00:06:50.257 --> 00:06:50.840
here at Sloan.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.545
And some of you might take his
Finance 1 course, I assume.

00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:56.795
Somebody in here is, probably.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.570
So the input is
just really the idea

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.780
of wherever the output was.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.590
You can think of a
chain of a transaction.

00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.080
Can anybody tell me where
all transactions come from?

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.420
Where's sort of the genesis
of the value, if you

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:22.450
follow a transaction
chain back to its origin?

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.498
Hugo.

00:07:23.498 --> 00:07:24.290
AUDIENCE: Coinbase.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:26.510
GARY GENSLER:
Coinbase-- so anybody

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.305
want to say what a Coinbase is?

00:07:30.305 --> 00:07:36.140
AUDIENCE: It's a generation
of a freshly minted bitcoin.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:37.730
GARY GENSLER: Right,
so the generation

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.580
of a freshly minted bitcoin--
not the way that Patrick Murck

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.360
got it when he's selling
his services for the law,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:49.010
but how a miner gets it,
they get their transactions.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.850
Remember initially, 50 coins
was what happened initially back

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.350
in 2009.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.670
Now it's 12 and 1/2 coins.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.760
And in a short couple--

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.470
maybe it's about
18 or 20 months,

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.450
it goes to 6 and 1/4 coins.

00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:07.370
And it keeps splitting half
and half and half, eventually

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.010
to no Coinbase.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.410
But every transaction,
in essence,

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.420
had to go back all
the way to Coinbase--

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.270
some Coinbase, some 50 or 25 or
12 and 1/2 coins being issued.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.290
And then the output--

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:24.560
so a transaction format
is pretty straightforward,

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.190
in a sense.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.590
The input is a previous output
and a digital signature,

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:33.200
and then, to whom do
you want to send it.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.510
And it's sent to
Bitcoin addresses.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.309
That's why we spent
just a moment--

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:40.429
we just glossed over what
a Bitcoin address is.

00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:43.880
It's sort of a translation
to a public key,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.910
but it's not identical
to a public key.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:48.950
And of course, you need value.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:51.470
Value measured in
bitcoins or satoshis,

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.270
or if we're on the
Ethereum network,

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.750
it would be an ether and
gas, et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.760
On 1,600 different
platforms, it could

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:01.005
be a different native currency.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.085
Lock time, I don't
think lock time

00:09:06.085 --> 00:09:07.210
was in any of the readings.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.910
But anybody want to tell
me what a lock time is?

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.600
It's relevant to some of
how the technology goes.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.090
Anybody want to take a guess?

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.020
Where's Alin?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.170
Not Alin the PhD, but Alin
from the digital currency

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.680
initiative.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.130
No?

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.713
You're hiding.

00:09:22.713 --> 00:09:24.780
You don't want to say
what a lock time is?

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:29.640
AUDIENCE: I thought it's some
sort of protection mechanism

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.212
for, I guess, double spending.

00:09:34.212 --> 00:09:36.710
GARY GENSLER: It is a protection
mechanism, but not so much

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.260
about double spending.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.647
Tom, did I see your hand up?

00:09:39.647 --> 00:09:40.730
AUDIENCE: This is a guess.

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.080
Is it when the
transaction is hashed?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.080
GARY GENSLER: It's when.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.310
It's about time.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:48.570
It's when the
transaction can happen.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:51.620
So right now, it's
2:45 on September 20.

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:56.510
If you put a lock time
in at 2:50 or 2:55,

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.210
it couldn't happen until 2:55.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:01.790
So you can actually
conditional the transaction.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.470
That's all lock time is.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:06.790
But you can say, it
can't happen until.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.528
You could put tomorrow's date.

00:10:08.528 --> 00:10:10.070
AUDIENCE: The
counterparty sets that,

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:11.468
so it's like the
date on a check?

00:10:11.468 --> 00:10:13.510
GARY GENSLER: It's a little
different than a date

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.980
on a check.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:18.940
Because one of the things
that gets validated in Bitcoin

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:23.310
is, is that it will not
validate a transaction early.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:28.330
And if you put October 6
on a handwritten check,

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.760
the bank might still take
it, even though they probably

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.530
shouldn't.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.880
So it is like the
date on a check,

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:42.020
except it's verified and
validated and so forth.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.110
I'm going to take
Emily and then Shimon.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.610
AUDIENCE: So if you were to set
the lock time in the future,

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:53.100
could that mess up the
blocks in the chain?

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.850
What is kind of the
right chain of events

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.430
that you're recognizing
if you're choosing to set

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:00.953
a lock time in the future?

00:11:00.953 --> 00:11:03.120
I guess the broader question
would be, why would you

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:05.643
set a lock time in the future?

00:11:05.643 --> 00:11:07.560
GARY GENSLER: Shimon,
were you answering that?

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.990
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.282
I want to ask you, in the
[INAUDIBLE] question section,

00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:15.030
is what purpose does
it serve, right?

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.310
AUDIENCE: It's not a really
Turing complete language,

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.390
so you're not really trying
to create conditions here.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.943
But this is sort of a condition.

00:11:22.943 --> 00:11:24.360
GARY GENSLER: So
it's a condition.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.010
Because at any
point in time, you

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.600
might want a
condition of payment.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.780
You might want a condition
of payment on time.

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:33.540
And we're, in a
few slides, going

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:36.360
to talk about the scripting
language, the computer

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.520
language that allows
transactions to happen.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.270
Shimon said, was
not Turing complete.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.980
From the readings,
anybody want to tell us

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.720
what Turing complete is in
computer science language?

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:57.190
No?

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.660
Anybody know who Turing is?

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.787
Anybody see Imitation Games.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.855
Anyone know what
the Turing Award is?

00:12:05.855 --> 00:12:09.130
It's sort of the Nobel Laureate
for computer scientists.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.780
AUDIENCE: Isn't that the
award when the machine can

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.720
actually can pass
as a human being?

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.220
GARY GENSLER: Well, that's one
thing associated with Turing.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:20.270
But the Turing Award
is an annual award,

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.540
sort of like a Nobel Laureate,
but for computer scientists.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.470
Turing complete allows
you to do loops inside

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:30.120
of computer programs.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.540
And the script language does
not allow that to happen.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.800
Every function needs to
sort of have some language.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.410
I know Alin looking at
me to see I don't dive.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:47.340
But to answer Emily's
question, it's just,

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.760
there's so many different ways
to condition a transaction.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:52.410
And Satoshi Nakamoto
thought, well,

00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:56.490
let's put it in here, right
in the transaction format,

00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.100
that you can condition on time.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.470
And then two parties
could do that.

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.560
To your question about
whether it could inadvertently

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.840
lead to double spending,
it's a very good question.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.960
Can I hold it until we just
do validation for a second?

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:17.650
So this is a unique
identifier for the input.

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:23.140
But it's really uniquely
identifying from a past output.

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.030
What's the block number?

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:30.130
Is it from the 250,000th
block or the 300,000th block?

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.250
So it takes
literally a block ID.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:36.610
And then within that block,
which one of its 1,500

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.100
transactions might it be?

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.060
So you can find any transaction
on an entire blockchain

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:46.330
by knowing the block, and
then within the block, which

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.620
transaction.

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:52.210
It's just a data mechanism
on how to store data.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:53.710
And through this
mechanism, there's

00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:58.230
a chain of transactions, as
well as a chain of blocks.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:01.478
And then the value we
talked about that--

00:14:01.478 --> 00:14:03.270
I think there's, if I
did my numbers right,

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.213
10 to the 8th satoshis
in every bitcoin.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:08.630
It's a little hard
because I think

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.020
there's 10 to the ninth
gas in every ether.

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:15.340
And that's a coin.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.290
That is what is a coin.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.480
When Satoshi Nakamoto did
this, it wasn't really

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.670
a coin, because it was a
question whether anybody

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.890
would give value.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.240
And until about 18
months later, when

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.920
those two pizzas went for
10,000 bitcoin, what was it?

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:34.590
Or until somebody started
the first exchange,

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:41.230
a crypto exchange,
to exchange that.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.040
So you can also have multiple
inputs and multiple outputs.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:48.610
And I'm going to use an
example that I just created of,

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:52.000
I want to send some bitcoins
to two different people.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.240
And I need some bitcoins.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.310
So I might grab
three former inputs.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:02.570
And these are just
Transaction ID 6, Index 3.

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:04.240
Of course, it wouldn't be ID 6.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.410
It might be ID 300,000.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:11.290
But the point being
is, grab 10 bitcoin,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.140
so I want to find three inputs.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:20.650
And I needed to send six
bitcoins, let's say, to Amanda.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.560
You like that.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.690
And just because you're
sitting up front, James,

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.220
I'm just going to send three.

00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.250
But I'm not using Amanda's
name and James' name.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.150
I'm using your Bitcoin address--

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:35.270
Amanda's Bitcoin address,
and James' Bitcoin address.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:37.690
So rather than
being account-based,

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:42.430
like if you have an account at
Bank of America, and you say,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.120
I want to send $10,
I just check to make

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.070
sure I have more than $10.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:52.270
In Bitcoin, I actually have
to fine individual transaction

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.090
outputs that add up
to-- in this case,

00:15:55.090 --> 00:16:00.790
I want to send nine bitcoin,
six to Amanda, three to James.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:04.000
Not really, Amanda.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.145
So what's 10 minus 9?

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:06.990
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.990
GARY GENSLER: Thank you.

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:09.610
That was really hard.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:11.800
We are at MIT.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.680
But I might not
send one back to me.

00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.920
I'm going to send
0.9 back to me.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.180
This is kind of my change.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.900
So a Bitcoin transaction
can either be equal,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.050
the inputs equal the outputs.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.750
I could have sent
one back to me.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.290
But I've decided to
incentivize miners and leave

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:39.860
a little extra, 0.1 bitcoin,
which would be a lot of fee,

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:40.670
actually.

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:45.403
That would be about,
what, $640 or so?

00:16:45.403 --> 00:16:46.570
I probably wouldn't do that.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:54.030
I would probably leave for a fee
10 or 20 or 100 satoshi maybe.

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:57.170
I don't know what the
current market is.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.360
But this is a transaction.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.360
Multiple inputs, multiple
outputs, but you always

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.220
have to send back to yourself.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.010
What happens to these inputs
if this transaction actually

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.990
happens?

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:12.420
They go away.

00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:18.810
The actual inputs disappear
once they go through this.

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.680
And so inputs always
have to equal outputs.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.480
When a transaction is validated,
one of the validation methods

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.935
is to make sure that the lock
time has actually happened,

00:17:29.935 --> 00:17:31.310
that you've passed
the lock time.

00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.210
Another validation point is
that inputs are greater than

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.350
or equal to outputs.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.300
If outputs are
greater than inputs,

00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.020
the transaction will
not be validated.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:45.680
The digital signatures
have to be validated,

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.710
going just back to
the prior slide.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:54.170
That digital signature has
to be validated, as well.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:18:00.040
And that, this previous ID
and index actually exists.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.050
And this is getting to
your question Emily.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.940
It still exists.

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:10.160
But these inputs,
once you've used them,

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.590
they no longer exist
in the database.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.150
They're kind of in the past.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:17.950
So that's the transactions.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:18.730
That's the core.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:21.010
I know it's like
eating broccoli,

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:25.590
but it's an important part of
all of blockchain technology.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.280
The Coinbase transaction
we've already talked about,

00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:29.740
so I'll slide over this quickly.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:32.590
But it's a reward for
solving the puzzle.

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:35.170
In the case of Bitcoin, it's
solving the proof of work.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.670
Tom.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:39.287
AUDIENCE: Sorry, can we go
back to the miner incentive.

00:18:39.287 --> 00:18:43.830
It's the 0.1 or 1 satoshis.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:46.510
And how is that different
than the cost of trust

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:50.590
when you use a financial
institution as the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:56.360
GARY GENSLER: So Tom's question
is, the miners' economics.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:58.880
Of course, they get
their 12 and 1/2 bitcoin,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.420
and they might get
some transaction fees.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.130
Tom's question's the other side.

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.130
Why is that any
different than paying

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:08.750
some central intermediary?

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.060
Anybody want to try doing this?

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.880
I could cold-call, but
does anybody want to--

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.410
this is an economics
question about markets.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.570
AUDIENCE: I would say
that the person that

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.720
is sending the transaction
has the ability

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:31.800
to choose how much it will
pay for that transaction.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.860
And in the bank, it's
regulated, and you pay.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.360
Maybe that's one
of the differences.

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:41.110
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so one difference

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:46.680
is that the bank is setting,
generally, a fixed fee

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.180
schedule, and this is
a decentralized market

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.880
mechanism for setting fees.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.525
Sean.

00:19:54.525 --> 00:19:58.080
AUDIENCE: The fee for
intermediaries a lot higher

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.320
compared to Bitcoin,
the transaction fees.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.820
GARY GENSLER: So
Sean's second point

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:05.790
is that, currently-- this might
not be true in the future.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:08.430
But currently,
central intermediaries

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.510
are able to charge higher fees
than in this decentralized

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:13.476
system.

00:20:13.476 --> 00:20:14.390
Alin?

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.140
AUDIENCE: I think that,
conceptually, it's

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:20.180
not different from a
centralized intermediary.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.590
It's just, the
functions are the same.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.140
The amounts, maybe
the amount that I pay,

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.030
the amount of the
fees are different,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:28.972
but the concepts are the same.

00:20:28.972 --> 00:20:31.180
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
Alin is basically saying,

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:32.597
well, maybe it's
not so different.

00:20:32.597 --> 00:20:35.820
I mean, though it might be
floating rather than fixed,

00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:38.437
it might be currently
lower rather than higher,

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:40.020
but you're saying,
fundamentally, it's

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:41.610
about the same.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:43.610
One minute, Shimon,
let me just--

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.030
because you're faculty.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:47.090
You're going to actually
tell us the answer.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.060
AUDIENCE: Question--
is this mandatory?

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.310
GARY GENSLER: Very good
question-- it's not mandatory.

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:57.210
AUDIENCE: So that could create
a big misalignment of interest.

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:58.710
GARY GENSLER: So
it's not mandatory.

00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:01.620
Fees are market-based.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.750
And at times, like
last December,

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:05.850
they were really high.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:09.030
And now they're
quite low, partly

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:14.670
because the Bitcoin network is
not humming at full capacity.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:19.110
It can readily fit 1,000 to
2,000 transactions a block.

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.270
And it's not like
there's a jamming

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:24.870
to get 10,000 and 20,000
transactions into a block,

00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.120
as there was last December.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.351
I'm sorry, Shimon.

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:33.420
AUDIENCE: I think
it's very different,

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.880
in the sense that
you're basically

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:39.180
inflating the fee in most
[INAUDIBLE] inflation.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.430
So even if when
you don't transact,

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.460
you're paying implicitly for
other people's transactions,

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.230
and that's going to
change over time.

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:49.110
So that's actually kind
of a clever mechanism

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.690
of how, structurally,
these are going

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:55.410
to shift over time
in the network,

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.720
as it hopefully matures.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.650
GARY GENSLER: Why don't
we take one more here--

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:01.960
Alexis.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:08.070
AUDIENCE: That's like when
you have [INAUDIBLE] they're

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.420
going to keep the money.

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.400
And they could use it for
making [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.210
So they make money on a spread.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.990
Whereas here, for
the case of Bitcoin,

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:20.847
the money's going to
stay in the system,

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:22.680
and it's going to flow
to another miner, who

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.850
is going to use it for
another transaction.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:28.530
It will stay within the
same network, I would say,

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.088
rather than just going
to another destination.

00:22:31.088 --> 00:22:32.130
GARY GENSLER: I hear you.

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:34.800
But it might actually leave
the network to lawyers,

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:37.430
like Patrick.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:40.040
Or it might leave the network
if you use it at Starbucks,

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.660
if Starbucks would accept it.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.420
So I'm challenging
your thought, but you

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.620
can challenge mine back.

00:22:52.355 --> 00:22:57.610
Why don't we close out with
Eric, and then just move on.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.370
AUDIENCE: The difference
might be in the perspective.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:04.140
From the person that's
originated a transaction,

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.770
it's basically the same thing.

00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.400
But if you think
about it as a system,

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:13.720
there's no single entity
gathering all the money

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.560
from transactions.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.230
You have a network, a
[INAUDIBLE] network,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:21.140
of [INAUDIBLE] that
are getting that.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:25.240
And besides, once we get
out past the 21 million

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:30.497
bitcoin generation cap,
then all the systems

00:23:30.497 --> 00:23:32.080
must be using
[INAUDIBLE] in some way.

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.260
And transaction fees
would be [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.510
GARY GENSLER: So Eric raises
two points that I'll--

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.910
there are other points, but
two that I want to repeat.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.380
One is, this is more
decentralized possibly today

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.670
than the current commercial
banking system, for instance,

00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.900
for transaction processing,
or the transaction processing

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:59.650
that Visa and First
Data do, which we'll

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:03.010
study when we get to payments.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.028
So it's possibly
more decentralized.

00:24:05.028 --> 00:24:06.820
I think you said it
was more decentralized,

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:08.710
but I'm putting the
word possibly in there.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.030
And two is that, at
least in bitcoin's case,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.350
there's two revenue sources
for providing the services.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:23.480
The miners do it for the
Coinbase transactions, 12

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.880
and 1/2 bitcoin per block,
approximately $80,000 US

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.530
per block currently.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.110
But also, there's
this little incentive

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:39.580
of fees, which, over time, will
have to grow as you go down.

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.300
If it's only going to be
one bitcoin per transaction,

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.950
and then ultimately almost
0 bitcoin for transaction,

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:50.980
there will have to be more
satoshis in the fee side.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.200
And some alternative coins--

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.650
not Bitcoin-- are
more modeled on fees,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:03.610
and some coins are more
modeled on mining rewards.

00:25:03.610 --> 00:25:06.850
The economics--
Satoshi Nakamoto,

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:11.410
whomever he or she was,
or were, if it's a group,

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.610
had to think through
a bunch of economics.

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:16.050
They've survived for 10 years.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.810
It doesn't mean that's the
best set of microeconomics

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:21.420
for a blockchain system.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:22.770
Tom, you look really skeptical.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:23.993
AUDIENCE: I'm skeptical.

00:25:23.993 --> 00:25:25.410
But maybe this
would be the moment

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.045
where I take my 12-hour dive.

00:25:27.045 --> 00:25:28.170
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.720
So you're about ready
for your rabbit dive?

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:32.220
Maybe.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:32.887
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:25:35.432 --> 00:25:37.140
GARY GENSLER: So the
Coinbase transaction

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.940
we've talked a lot about.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:44.220
The reward, at least in Bitcoin,
halves every 210,000 blocks.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.740
A very important thing
that Nakamoto put in

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:51.430
is, you couldn't use your
Coinbase reward for 100 blocks.

00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:57.420
So it was sort of stale
or frozen for 100 blocks.

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.660
I can think of two
reasons, but maybe you all

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:03.060
would think of another reason.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:06.280
Anybody want to give it a shot
as to why you might do it?

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.950
Xiaojian

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:09.480
AUDIENCE: Maybe
you mine the block,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:12.980
and you're trying to mine
a block that shouldn't be--

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:14.520
or it's not legal.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.210
You spend the money right
away so you can get--

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:18.960
GARY GENSLER: This is
the principal reason

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.240
that's talked about, not
only in the literature,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:26.660
but in the early blog post,
was, well, how many blocks does

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.370
the chain have to go
before everybody really

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.590
thinks it's consensus?

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:34.830
You could have said 5, 10, 20.

00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:37.650
Satoshi picked 100
blocks, saying,

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:42.160
that, hopefully,
is pretty settled,

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.930
or about 1,000 minutes.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:46.430
James.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.500
AUDIENCE: If you mine,
and then you can spend,

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:50.690
couldn't you just
perpetually create blocks

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.270
and then pay yourself and
create more and earn more

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:55.085
and then keep building
up [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:55.085 --> 00:26:56.460
GARY GENSLER: So
James is asking,

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:58.130
could you just kind
of game the system

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.695
and keep mining and spending
and mining and spending?

00:27:03.485 --> 00:27:05.125
AUDIENCE: Then your
rewards go down.

00:27:05.125 --> 00:27:06.250
GARY GENSLER: Sorry, Aviva?

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.933
AUDIENCE: Then your
awards go down over time.

00:27:08.933 --> 00:27:10.850
GARY GENSLER: Well, that
takes 200,000 blocks.

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:12.980
AUDIENCE: But if there
are many of you doing that

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:16.330
at the same time, then
you accelerate the--

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.830
GARY GENSLER: So in some ways,
that's what miners are doing.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:21.770
But they have to
wait 100 blocks.

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:25.100
And so that was what Satoshi
was trying to get at.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:30.000
If you have to wait 100 blocks,
it's probably now the consensus

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.170
chain.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.740
It's probably been so
validated, unless we

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.080
got into the problem--

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.200
Patrick, you weren't here.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.140
But some of the students
raised the question, well,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.930
what if one country
as large as China

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.910
walled off their whole
network, and just China

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.470
went one way and the rest
of the world went another?

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.230
The theory of the case is
that, within 100 blocks

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:58.080
or 1,000 minutes, somehow
that would be discovered.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.270
But if it weren't, you might
have a little bit of what

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:05.430
James is raising as a question.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.330
But that's at least
the theory of the case.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.140
It's always recorded as the
first transaction in the Merkle

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:14.980
Tree.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.170
Highly technical
point, but it has

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.810
to roll up into that darn
thing we were talking about,

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:23.640
the data compression
at the Merkle Tree.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.980
And here's a little fun fact.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:31.340
You can add 100 bytes of
arbitrary data in a Coinbase.

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:34.850
You might say, why
does he raise this?

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.460
Well, because it's
just a fun little place

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:43.310
that some people express their
creative wit, artistic stuff,

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.020
send secret messages
to each other,

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:49.920
that, buried in the
Coinbase transactions,

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.120
there is a whole forensics
of fun little things

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.240
that sometimes miners
put in to the Coinbase,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:59.800
for those of you
who are artistic.

00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:05.580
The very first genesis
block had this sentence.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:09.990
"The Times, January 3,
2009, Chancellor on brink

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:11.790
of second bailout for banks."

00:29:11.790 --> 00:29:13.920
That was a headline out
of the Financial Times

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:18.906
that says Satoshi Nakamoto put
in the first block of Coinbase.

00:29:18.906 --> 00:29:21.400
It's just a little fun place.

00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.370
There's a playfulness that goes
on amongst miners, sometimes

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:25.660
talking to each other.

00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:26.830
Did you ever get a message?

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.190
Did anybody send you--

00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:29.800
PATRICK MURCK: Not
that I'm aware of.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.175
I know what you're
talking about.

00:29:31.175 --> 00:29:33.820
There's one miner that likes
to put Catholic catechisms in.

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.220
GARY GENSLER: That has put
in the whole catechism?

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.540
PATRICK MURCK: In every block,
there's a little catechism

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.720
that he puts in.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.880
It's a Allegis mining pool.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.160
It's a small one.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.040
So there you go.

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.250
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:46.930
And do they pay you
in bitcoin, too?

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.670
PATRICK MURCK: No,
they're not a client.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.360
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.230
So it all rolls into a database
called the unspent transaction

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:57.050
output.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.020
These are the
unspent transactions.

00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:01.840
If it's been spent,
it's kind of burned.

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:05.650
And bitcoin transactions
that haven't been spent

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.740
fall into this.

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:11.110
And you can use it.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.840
It's created because it
speeds up the whole system.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.930
Instead of going back and
looking for all these things,

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:18.430
there's actually a
database that has

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.220
all the unspent transactions.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.770
I include in here
what I find as a sort

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:27.670
of interesting
revelation or irony.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:33.570
When Satoshi built Bitcoin,
and for the 16 versions

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.790
that have come since
over the 10 years,

00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:39.060
all the developers, the
Bitcoin core developers,

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.790
have kept the unspent
transaction output,

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:46.080
not on a blockchain
specifically, but in a database

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.750
called a LevelDB database.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.900
So those of you who are closer
to computer science than I

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.860
could say all the pros and
cons of a LevelDB database.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.990
But I'm just
observing that, even

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:06.040
within the most used first
central database for blockchain

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:10.210
called Bitcoin, they chose
to use not a blockchain,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.900
but, in essence, a more
standard database to keep

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:17.260
the unspent transaction output.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:20.940
Now, in a sense, it's all part
of this blockchain solution.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:24.130
I'm just saying,
it's one database

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.230
within the blockchain
world that's

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.333
actually not a blockchain.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.550
It's just sort of an
interesting irony.

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.370
But it also sort of
says, economically

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.700
and technologically,
Satoshi was trying

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.020
to create a money system.

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.580
He wasn't trying
to use blockchain

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:45.680
for every bit of data.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.865
So this is the actual size of
the unspent transaction output.

00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:49.990
If you can't see, there's--

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:53.830
I think it's about
50 to 60 million.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:55.610
It was higher.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.880
There was about 60
million unspent.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.250
It's not 60 million
bitcoins, because there's

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:02.770
about 17 million bitcoin.

00:32:02.770 --> 00:32:04.310
So you could average it out.

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.190
You could say, well,
each transaction

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:08.380
has less than 1 bitcoin.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:10.990
Well actually, there's been
surveys and studies showing

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:14.470
that about half of these
54 million transactions are

00:32:14.470 --> 00:32:18.990
so small that they go by the
term of-- they're called dust.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.360
That there's so few
satoshi that it's not

00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:26.130
even worth the fees
to try to redeem them.

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.040
They only add up to less
than a half a percent

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:34.230
of all the outstanding
bitcoin, but they're just dust.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:39.000
So maybe out of these 54 million
unspent transaction outputs,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.060
half of them will never
be used, because it's not

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:43.800
economically worthwhile.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:46.800
It's like the pennies in
the top dresser drawer

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.560
that you all might not spend.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.700
There's this similar thing here.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:54.330
Hugo.

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:56.755
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess I
have a question about that.

00:32:56.755 --> 00:32:58.380
It might not be
feasible now, but maybe

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:01.320
with layers on top of
bitcoin that people can

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.220
do these micro-transactions.

00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.730
Because like, our pennies
might be worth a lot

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:06.997
of money, [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:06.997 --> 00:33:08.580
GARY GENSLER: So
Hugo is raising that,

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.620
just like the pennies in
your top dresser drawer

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:12.840
might be worth
something one day,

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:16.200
what I'm referencing as
Bitcoin dust, about half

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:20.250
of these unspent transaction
outputs, a satoshi here,

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:23.910
10 satoshi there, might
one day be worth something.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.170
Good point.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:27.960
It's just like the pennies in
your top dresser drawer though.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.500
Have you lost them
in the meantime?

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.750
They might be worth something.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.170
But in the meantime, have
you lost the private key

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:37.530
to those little satoshis?

00:33:37.530 --> 00:33:39.570
I put on here three
moments of time

00:33:39.570 --> 00:33:41.940
just to give you the
sense of the actual number

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.950
of transactions
that have happened.

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:47.550
There's been 342 million
transactions on the Bitcoin

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.340
network to date, or
as of a day or two ago

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.210
when I put the slides together.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.760
So of the 340
million transactions,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.390
only about 54 million
are still outstanding.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:05.760
The other 290 million have
been spent, if you wish.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:09.300
Yes.

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:12.129
AUDIENCE: So then where are
these outstanding transactions

00:34:12.129 --> 00:34:12.629
stored?

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:18.895
Are they still being included
in the blocks themselves,

00:34:18.895 --> 00:34:20.520
where you add them
to the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.020
GARY GENSLER: Which outstanding
transactions, the 54 million

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.870
that are still available?

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:32.420
The 54 million all reside in
a database within the Bitcoin

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:37.429
software called the unspent
transaction output, UTXO.

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.540
And UTXO-- these aren't
letters I'm making up--

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:46.600
that's a database, 54
million transactions.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.830
Separately, they are actually
in the blockchain itself.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:54.940
So all 340 million transactions
that have ever happened

00:34:54.940 --> 00:34:57.300
are in the blockchain.

00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.680
But to make it easier for
the software, the 54 million

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:08.220
that have never been spent
reside in a software.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:10.710
Does that answer the question?

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:11.300
Work with me.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.967
AUDIENCE: So it's a
distributed database

00:35:12.967 --> 00:35:14.550
amongst all the different nodes.

00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:15.467
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.200
All 10,000 of the nodes
can have the full UTXO set.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.530
Some wallet providers
have the full UTXO set,

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.740
but they don't have to.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:33.043
Somewhat lightweight nodes
usually don't, but can.

00:35:33.043 --> 00:35:34.460
But a lightweight
node would never

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.550
want to have all 340 million
and the full blockchain.

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:41.300
So in essence, they're
in multiple places,

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:46.650
because they're in the full
blockchain, 10,000 nodes.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:50.120
And they're also in the UTXO,
not only on the 10,000 nodes,

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.770
but occasionally elsewhere.

00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:53.450
Alin.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:56.810
AUDIENCE: So I heard you say
the word spent transaction,

00:35:56.810 --> 00:35:58.610
which is a bit misleading.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:00.900
Because a transaction can
be spent and not spent.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:03.440
Because, for example, you
would have two outputs.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:05.990
One output is spent by
a future transaction,

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.070
and the other
output is not spent.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:10.222
So it's a bit misleading
to say spent transaction,

00:36:10.222 --> 00:36:12.680
because that only happens when
the transaction has only one

00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.480
output and that output is spent.

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.730
GARY GENSLER: Well,
I'm using it lightly.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.570
I'm saying that, of the 340
million transactions that

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:23.105
have happened, 290--

00:36:23.105 --> 00:36:24.730
AUDIENCE: Have an
output that is spent,

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:27.210
or what are you saying exactly?

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:29.310
Because transactions
have multiple outputs.

00:36:29.310 --> 00:36:32.150
They might have n, and
maybe k of them are spent.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.930
So the other
outputs are unspent.

00:36:33.930 --> 00:36:36.300
GARY GENSLER: I'm saying
there's 340 million--

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.440
if I did my data search
correctly-- and I'm fallible,

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.340
so I might not have.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:44.100
But if I did my data
source correctly,

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.490
there was 340 million
previous outputs.

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.990
290 million of them are gone.

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:52.770
AUDIENCE: OK, so then you
should say transaction outputs,

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:55.200
because those are different
than transactions.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:55.950
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:59.040
Except for it was
easier to put TXS.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:03.243
But yes, Alin's clarification
is, I believe, accurate.

00:37:03.243 --> 00:37:05.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
so people can understand

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:07.260
that there is a difference
between a transaction

00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.430
and a transaction output.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.710
GARY GENSLER: In essence,
what Alin's saying is,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:15.180
there's currently 54
million transaction outputs

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.360
in the UTXO, which
also says outputs.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.320
There had been, in the past,
another 290 million outputs

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.435
that have already been spent.

00:37:27.435 --> 00:37:28.750
Are we together?

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.200
So there's a scripting language.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.650
There's a little bit
of computer code.

00:37:36.650 --> 00:37:38.960
I said there was no prerequisite
to take any computer

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.880
science before you were here.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.130
And my own computer
programming is so old,

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:47.780
because when I was programming,
it was in Fortran and APL.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.950
And you can look that up.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:52.100
It's kind of like
around with cuneiform

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:57.350
and you know the Rosetta Stone.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:02.990
But Satoshi Nakamoto
decided to put a little bit

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.650
of computer programming inside.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:08.390
And I'm not going to
get the count right,

00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.030
but there's several hundred,
but not several thousand,

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.130
little operations
and codes that you

00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:17.390
can use in the Bitcoin script.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:19.940
It's not Turing
complete, which means

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:23.840
you can't do a lot of the
things that you can do in all

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:26.730
the rest of computer science.

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:29.340
But it's more secure.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.980
In essence, it has
fewer attack vectors.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.300
It's harder to bring
down a little bit.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.570
It's a programming
code, as I said.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:42.090
For those interested,
it's called stack-based,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:46.260
where you sort of move the
code over one at a time

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.320
as it's being performed.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:50.940
And it gives some flexibility.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.940
And back to Emily's question
about why there was lock time,

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:59.700
or Shimon's, scripting code
allows for some conditionality,

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.240
that it appears that
Nakamoto was trying

00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.270
to give some
ability to condition

00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:14.070
a transaction on events, but
not so much conditionality, so

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:17.550
much flexibility, that he
needed a Turing complete.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.550
So he kind of, I'm going to
say, chose a midway place.

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:26.430
I believe, you could
have created Bitcoin

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:28.980
and say there was no
scripting language.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:34.750
It was just going to be a
straight instruction, moving

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.940
this input to another output.

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:42.100
Created a little bit of
computer code, but not a lot.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.970
That's what I think of the
economics and the marketplace

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:46.900
for this.

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.930
And next Tuesday when we
talk about smart contracts--

00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:53.140
and I promise you,
there's a reason

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.390
for the craziness of
my talking about Turing

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:57.640
complete and scripting code.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.180
Because next Tuesday, we'll be
talking about smart contracts

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.910
where they're much
more flexible.

00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:06.712
And so this is sort
of the foundational--

00:40:06.712 --> 00:40:08.170
and you don't need
to know anything

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.660
more about computer
science than you want,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.910
unless you go with Tom
down that rabbit hole

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.590
and spend more time reading.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:22.180
So there's four different types
of, I call them script types.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.300
They're not actual script
words, but you will read

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:27.080
about these from time to time.

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:29.390
And I just wanted
to cover these four.

00:40:29.390 --> 00:40:32.650
The UTXO, remember, is about
54 million transactions.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.480
And there's been a
nice academic paper

00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:38.020
that I didn't assign that
was written earlier this year

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.770
that investigated
the whole 54 million,

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:44.470
all of the unspent transactions.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.820
And this is how it broke down.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:53.050
81% are transactions that send
to a hash of a Bitcoin address.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:56.930
Eight, nine years ago
when Satoshi created this,

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:59.210
that was not the most
popular instruction.

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.860
But it's basically
sending an output

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:05.120
to the hash, the compression,
the commitment of a Bitcoin

00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:07.050
address.

00:41:07.050 --> 00:41:09.210
We're now up to 18%.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.240
This didn't exist three
and four years ago, really.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:16.080
But 18% go to a
conditional script.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:18.420
It's a hash of a
conditional script.

00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:21.840
So somebody saying, Emily,
it's not even about time.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.200
It's like, you can
only get it when

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.810
all these other instructions
that are in the scripting

00:41:27.810 --> 00:41:30.650
language happen.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.790
And I'm going to hide the
conditions in a hash of it.

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:43.720
And then only 0.1% goes
the way that he first

00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.330
envisioned nine years ago,
directly to a Bitcoin address.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.840
So it's either to a hash
of a Bitcoin address,

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.320
a hash of a conditional script,
and a little less than 1% now

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.900
go to multiple signatures.

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:00.150
Meaning, you need two out of
three or three out of five.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.880
Or believe it or not,
this academic paper

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.730
shows that some say 0 out of 1.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:09.790
Now, it's hard to believe that
somebody mistakenly programmed

00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:14.020
something to go to 0 signatures,
but apparently somebody did.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.210
So I just wanted to
give you a sense there's

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:21.310
some flexibility in the computer
code, not a lot of flexibility,

00:42:21.310 --> 00:42:26.560
but just enough that you can do
things that are really helpful.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:30.730
And they're going to solve a
lot of challenges for Bitcoin.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.410
Hugo mentioned layer 2.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:35.470
We're going to be talking about
layer 2 later in the semester,

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:39.340
where there's a whole way to put
technology on top of Bitcoin.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:41.350
And it's because the
scripting language is there

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:42.400
that you can do that.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.690
Any questions on script?

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:50.830
I know I'm trying to cover
a big, weighty topic in 120

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:51.635
seconds or less.

00:42:55.648 --> 00:42:56.148
No?

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.090
So just back to the whole--

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.020
this is just a review.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.030
What have we've talked about?

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.610
There's that little
graphic again.

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.830
It's just a bunch of blocks.

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.870
That's what a blockchain is.

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:13.960
Though today, we realize
that underneath the blocks,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.170
we have another chain.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:17.740
I often think of two chains--

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.020
the chains of blocks.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:24.590
In Bitcoin, there's about
a half a million blocks.

00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:27.080
But underneath that, there's
all the transactions that

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.970
are, in fact, chained, as well.

00:43:28.970 --> 00:43:32.720
54 million of those outputs
have not yet been spent

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:37.280
and 290 million outputs
have been spent.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:40.190
But underneath about a
half a million blocks,

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:47.840
there's been 340 million
outputs, so to speak.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.680
It creates a database.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.220
Bitcoin is a
transaction database.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:56.700
Next Tuesday, we'll talk about
an account-based database

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.140
in Ethereum.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:00.390
But it could be a ledger
which is transactions

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:03.420
or a ledger which is balances.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.810
Satoshi Nakamoto decided
to do transactions here.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:10.410
In some ways, I believe it's
because it was fewer attack

00:44:10.410 --> 00:44:12.330
vectors.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.030
Probably a little
bit more secure,

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:16.320
but I'm not entirely sure.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.180
And until you solve the riddle
as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is,

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.940
we won't know the answer.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.440
Of

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.410
Course, hash functions
we talked about,

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.890
and digital signatures,
and a consensus protocol.

00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:35.660
So I like to think of
it in three buckets,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.060
whether it's for a
dinner party conversation

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.700
or digging into three lectures.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.740
It's the cryptography itself.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.288
We did that last Thursday.

00:44:45.288 --> 00:44:46.830
And if you have to
remember anything,

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.110
it's only two
cryptographic primitives--

00:44:49.110 --> 00:44:51.870
hash functions and
digital signatures.

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:54.600
How many people think
they kind of roughly have

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.070
what a hash function is?

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.570
All right, so I
lost half of you.

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:00.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.910
All right, is there anything
I can do for Lauren's table?

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:05.360
I didn't see a
single hand go up.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.640
Are you reading
your Facebook page

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:12.500
or are you listening
to the class?

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:13.760
You've got your computer open.

00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.580
What's your name.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:15.330
AUDIENCE: Matthew.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:16.880
GARY GENSLER: Matthew.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.770
All right, that might
have been that you

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:19.062
weren't listening to the class.

00:45:19.062 --> 00:45:20.830
Thank you.

00:45:20.830 --> 00:45:23.350
How can I help in what
a hash function is?

00:45:23.350 --> 00:45:26.900
My promise is to
bring everybody along.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.540
Nobody at your table
said you even roughly got

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:30.720
what a hash function is.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.020
I'm not trying to
embarrass anybody.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.150
I'm trying to work this through.

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:44.920
Nicholas, so give me a baseline.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.570
Did you read any
of the readings?

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.470
Maybe not.

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.176
OK.

00:45:49.176 --> 00:45:50.480
AUDIENCE: I have, yes.

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.760
GARY GENSLER: You have, OK.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.690
Hash functions came
along decades ago

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:00.360
to help facilitate
database management.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.590
Sometimes it's
called a registry.

00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:07.520
It's taking a lot of data
and shrinking it down,

00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.780
compressing it, shrinking it,
to maybe a series of numbers.

00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:17.810
I think of it sometimes as
a zip code for information.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:21.330
Down in Baltimore,
Maryland, I'm in 2120--

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:24.290
well, I grew up in 21208.

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:25.700
It was my parent's zip code.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.370
I won't say my current.

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:29.654
We're being videoed.

00:46:29.654 --> 00:46:31.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:34.490
And so I think of it a
little bit like that.

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:37.610
So a hash function that has
nothing to do with bitcoin

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:42.440
came along to take a bunch of
data and create a registry.

00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.580
But through that, it also
became a way to do a commitment.

00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:47.810
Yes, your first name?

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:48.768
AUDIENCE: Dana.

00:46:48.768 --> 00:46:49.560
GARY GENSLER: Dana?

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.435
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Dana.

00:46:50.435 --> 00:46:53.510
What goes into the hash function
and comes out as a hash,

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.920
that's what I don't understand.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.950
GARY GENSLER: So what goes
in is any set of data.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.060
Today, that could
be an entire movie.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:03.960
It could be a picture of
everybody in this room.

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:12.940
Initially, it was mostly
alphanumeric data.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:15.570
But because, in
computer technology,

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:21.570
all data can be broken down
to a series of registries

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:22.860
of 0's or 1's--

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.020
computers started with--
literally the first one

00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:38.780
started with registries that
were either turned on or off.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:40.880
If they were on, call that a 1.

00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.590
If it was off, call it a 0.

00:47:42.590 --> 00:47:45.110
I'm not sure which way it goes.

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:48.500
I keep looking at Alin.

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:52.500
And so all data can
then be brought down

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.130
to a series of 0's and 1.

00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:59.600
And if you put four 0's and 1's
in front of each other, 2 times

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:05.450
2 times 2 times 2, 2 to the
fourth is 16, all of a sudden,

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:07.820
you see if you keep
going 2 to something,

00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:10.140
you can get a lot of data.

00:48:10.140 --> 00:48:13.230
So sit back to
answer your question

00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:16.380
Dana, when we talked last
week about The New York Times

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:17.370
crossword puzzle--

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:20.190
The New York Times
may, if they wish,

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:25.860
take the solution of their
crossword puzzle and hash it.

00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:28.505
And then Stephanie?

00:48:28.505 --> 00:48:29.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:31.380
GARY GENSLER: Stephanie likes
to do The New York Times

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.370
crossword puzzle.

00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:36.880
And she wants to know if she
properly completed The New York

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.380
Times crossword puzzle.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:42.400
The New York Times could
say to her cell phone,

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.490
we're not going to really
give you the answer,

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:49.232
but we'll give you the
hash of the answer.

00:48:49.232 --> 00:48:51.440
And then when she's finished
and she pushes a button,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:57.400
her application could say
whether her answer properly

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:59.510
hashes to theirs.

00:48:59.510 --> 00:49:00.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:01.180
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:02.660
We're trying to
learn here together.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.243
AUDIENCE: In the
case of a blockchain,

00:49:04.243 --> 00:49:06.730
it's whatever dated you
loaded to the blockchain,

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.150
and then in Bitcoin, it's
just the transactions.

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.570
Is that right?

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:14.260
GARY GENSLER: So in
Bitcoin and blockchain,

00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.550
they use hash functions
in several big ways.

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:24.220
Everything you said was
correct, except for the one

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.320
thing when you said, it's just.

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:30.310
Because they actually use
hash functions in the middle

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:31.330
of the proof of work.

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:37.540
Because the hash
pointer points--

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:41.480
block 3 points to block
2 and there's hashing.

00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.220
They use the hash function to
compress a bunch of data, what

00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.200
I call the Merkle
Tree, but it's taking

00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:52.990
1,500 or 2,000 transactions
and squeezing it into one hash.

00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:56.160
So they're hashing all
of these things up.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:01.550
It uses hash functions in the
midst of the Bitcoin address.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:05.140
So the hash function
is like electricity

00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:07.000
in the middle of it, almost.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.090
It's probably used
six or eight places,

00:50:10.090 --> 00:50:13.690
and some I don't, in
any way, know myself

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:15.687
or need to understand.

00:50:15.687 --> 00:50:16.770
Nicolas, how are we doing?

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:17.930
Did we get a little closer?

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:18.660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:20.702
GARY GENSLER: Lauren, did
we get a little closer?

00:50:20.702 --> 00:50:21.408
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:21.408 --> 00:50:22.200
GARY GENSLER: Matt?

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:22.992
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:50:22.992 --> 00:50:24.457
GARY GENSLER: You're there.

00:50:24.457 --> 00:50:26.290
AUDIENCE: I'm not there
yet, but I'm closer.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:27.020
GARY GENSLER: Stop by.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:27.860
Send me an email.

00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:29.598
It's gensler@mit.edu.

00:50:29.598 --> 00:50:30.890
I'm here like four days a week.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:31.918
Ben.

00:50:31.918 --> 00:50:33.710
AUDIENCE: So I think
the time that I really

00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:35.255
understood hash
functions was when

00:50:35.255 --> 00:50:37.820
I saw someone do a live demo.

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.950
It's a website called
[INAUDIBLE] Brain Wallet.

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:43.070
But you type in text,
and in real time,

00:50:43.070 --> 00:50:44.780
it converts it into a hash.

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:45.280
So

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.150
GARY GENSLER: Say the
website again, Ben.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.640
AUDIENCE: It's brainwallet.io.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:52.620
GARY GENSLER: Brainwallet.io--
a recommendation.

00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:55.840
AUDIENCE: You can also just
Google Brain Wallet blockchain.

00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:58.200
And you can type in text,
and you see in real time

00:50:58.200 --> 00:50:59.890
it converts it into
a Bitcoin address.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:02.810
If you change one letter, or
make one in uppercase or one

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:04.550
in lower case, it
changes in real time.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:08.280
And it's just, you put any
text in, you put a password in,

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.248
and it turns it into
a blockchain address.

00:51:10.248 --> 00:51:11.290
And that's all a hash is.

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:14.518
It translates text into a hash.

00:51:14.518 --> 00:51:15.810
GARY GENSLER: Or a whole movie.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.490
We talked about the
network consensus,

00:51:21.490 --> 00:51:28.000
how to actually agree on
the state of information

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.020
with no centralized authority.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:35.200
You don't have a central
bank or a commercial bank

00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:42.490
or a Facebook or a
parental unit, if you wish.

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:44.680
It's all of us out
there on the playground

00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:46.550
figuring it out
together somehow.

00:51:50.350 --> 00:51:52.670
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I
have a quesiton here.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.085
For the proof of
work, my question

00:51:55.085 --> 00:51:57.320
is, for example, I
make a transaction,

00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.440
does it mean I have to wait for
10 minutes for the transaction

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.780
to be completed?

00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.340
Or for example, when we do
Venmo, it's like instantaneous.

00:52:07.340 --> 00:52:10.030
I can immediately
get the results.

00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:11.780
GARY GENSLER: Anton's
question is, does it

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:13.280
mean I have to wait 10 minutes?

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:18.050
Venmo and so many other payment
practices can go more quickly.

00:52:18.050 --> 00:52:22.250
The answer to you is, yes.

00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:26.350
And that is one of the
commercial challenges

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:30.770
to blockchain as we
know it in Bitcoin.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:36.980
There are certain approaches
to that, layering in technology

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:39.552
on top of, they call it
layer 2 or lightning network.

00:52:39.552 --> 00:52:41.510
We're not going to dive
into lightning network.

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:45.160
But everybody should hold
onto Anton's question.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.930
It's the right question,
that if all of you

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:52.130
bring your critical reasoning
to this class about markets

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:56.300
and about commercial realities,
a little bit about the law

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.905
and a little bit
about technology.

00:52:57.905 --> 00:52:59.530
Because that's what
we're trying to do.

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:01.940
It's like, oh, well
does this really matter?

00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:02.510
Will it work?

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:03.080
Hugo.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.458
AUDIENCE: So just a point
of contention here--

00:53:05.458 --> 00:53:06.500
GARY GENSLER: Contention?

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:07.110
AUDIENCE: A little bit.

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.277
GARY GENSLER: Oh, very good.

00:53:08.277 --> 00:53:08.840
I like that.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.750
AUDIENCE: So if
you know the person

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:14.390
that you're transacting with,
you can accept the transaction

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.590
with 0 confirmations.

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:17.330
As long as it gets
into the mem pool

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.910
and has a reasonable
fee attached to it,

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.260
then it will eventually
get included on a block,

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:24.260
and that's probably good
enough for most people.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:27.950
GARY GENSLER: So what
Hugo is saying is,

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:34.060
another approach is to
take counterparty risk,

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:34.863
that Anton's--

00:53:34.863 --> 00:53:36.280
back to Anton's
question-- does it

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:37.990
mean you have to
wait 10 minutes?

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:40.030
The actual technical
answer to that

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:45.880
is, no, you don't have to wait
10 minutes, unless you want

00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:50.020
final settlement,
if you want finality

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:56.140
with no counterparty
risk, no commercial risk.

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.060
Hugo is saying, well,
if I'm willing to take

00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:01.660
some economic or commercial
counterparty risk, which is,

00:54:01.660 --> 00:54:05.470
in finance, you take
it all the time,

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:08.380
then maybe I can do it
in less than 10 minutes.

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.720
And in fact, even
Starbucks, when

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:14.470
Starbucks accepts your
credit card swipe,

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:17.170
they're taking a little
bit of counterparty risk

00:54:17.170 --> 00:54:21.010
from the payment processing
company First Data.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:24.010
I don't mean to say that
it might not be also

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:25.450
from Visa and the banks.

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:28.210
But I'll just say
the payment system

00:54:28.210 --> 00:54:30.490
has some counterparty risk.

00:54:30.490 --> 00:54:32.890
Because final settlement
in our payment

00:54:32.890 --> 00:54:36.420
system doesn't happen
within seconds.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.210
So the actual answer--
thank you, Hugo.

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.470
Clean me up again.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.750
You should do this all the time.

00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:44.520
Everybody should clean me up.

00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.720
It's that final
settlement can happen.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.433
And so you have to
find other solutions,

00:54:48.433 --> 00:54:50.100
whether it's some
commercial arrangement

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.228
with counterparty risk or
other technical commercial

00:54:53.228 --> 00:54:53.770
arrangements.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:54.290
Shimon?

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.770
AUDIENCE: Well, I'll
make a counterargument,

00:54:56.770 --> 00:55:00.065
which is that, 10 minutes is
not final settlement, right?

00:55:00.065 --> 00:55:01.290
Because it could be forking.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:04.630
So it's basically
the probability

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:08.380
of the finality
goes up with time,

00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:12.120
which is associated with how
many blocks are attached to

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.500
[INAUDIBLE].

00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:17.980
GARY GENSLER: So Shimon's point
is that, even in 10 minutes,

00:55:17.980 --> 00:55:23.000
your probability of
finality is not complete.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:27.470
Because the block
might not be the block

00:55:27.470 --> 00:55:29.840
that's included in
the longest chain.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.510
And many people
have said, you maybe

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:34.620
should wait three
blocks or six blocks.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:35.495
I think the longest--

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:40.370
I'm going to use
the term loosely--

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:46.110
orphaned chain has
been five blocks long.

00:55:46.110 --> 00:55:49.140
And in Bitcoin, what's
the longest orphan?

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:50.640
AUDIENCE: It was
an accidental fork.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.240
It was 20 or more blocks.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:56.127
Due to some crazy things
that miners were doing,

00:55:56.127 --> 00:55:57.710
they accidentally
forked a blockchain.

00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:59.720
AUDIENCE: OK, and
what year was that?

00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:02.020
AUDIENCE: So look
up March 2013 fork.

00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.815
And there's another fork
after that, in 2015 maybe.

00:56:04.815 --> 00:56:07.190
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, somebody's
been down the rabbit hole.

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:12.830
All right, there's some
still probabilistic risk.

00:56:12.830 --> 00:56:15.155
Aviva, and then we'll move on.

00:56:15.155 --> 00:56:17.450
AUDIENCE: What's a fork.

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:19.400
GARY GENSLER: So I
don't have the chart up.

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.590
But if you remember,
there was the slide

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:25.270
that showed the longest block.

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:26.920
It was in black.

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.740
And it had little purple blocks.

00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.780
That's a fork.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:39.030
There's some forks that end up
being that both chains continue

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:40.140
for a long time.

00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:41.550
They're called hard forks.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:43.110
And there is something called--

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:46.080
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
have come out of that.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:52.963
Most, the way that Alin was
using it, are discarded.

00:56:52.963 --> 00:56:55.130
I'm sorry, behind you,
remind me of your first name?

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:57.538
AUDIENCE: Erin.

00:56:57.538 --> 00:56:58.080
I don't know.

00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.550
Let me know if it's
not the right time

00:56:59.550 --> 00:57:00.425
to ask this question.

00:57:00.425 --> 00:57:03.922
But I'm getting a bit confused
between the most important

00:57:03.922 --> 00:57:05.880
things we now need to
know, and the differences

00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:09.870
between the technology of
mining Bitcoins versus just

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:14.220
transacting on the blockchain.

00:57:18.622 --> 00:57:20.580
What are the major
differences we need to know?

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.460
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question, Erin.

00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:27.300
Erin's question of, what do
I need to know about mining,

00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:29.010
what do I need to know
about transaction,

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:30.510
is it one and the same?

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:31.680
I apologize.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.940
They overlap, but
they're not the same.

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:35.805
So think of a Venn diagram.

00:57:35.805 --> 00:57:38.610
But it's a very good question.

00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:46.710
The essence of mining is
creating an incentive structure

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:50.520
where there is no
central authority

00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:56.850
to validate and put a new
set of transactions or data--

00:57:56.850 --> 00:57:59.310
I'm going to say broadly, data--

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:06.050
into the ledger, into the
accepted state of what

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.480
reality is.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.010
So mining helps with that.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:12.030
That's that whole process.

00:58:12.030 --> 00:58:15.770
In essence, who gets to
decide the next block of data?

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:21.430
Transactions are included in the
data, but it's not identical.

00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:27.880
Mining is really critical, but
it's not the only component.

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.233
In terms of
transactions, then you

00:58:30.233 --> 00:58:31.900
have to actually think
of, well, there's

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.300
this other thing going on.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.970
Well, there's been 340 million
of these in the Bitcoin network

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:38.470
so far.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:41.280
And has it been used already?

00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.270
Has it been spent?

00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:45.880
Does it have an appropriate
digital signature?

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:49.570
If there's a time lock on
it, is there a condition?

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.030
Might there even be this
little bit of scripting code

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:53.830
that puts other
conditions, like there

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.150
has to be multiple signatures?

00:58:57.150 --> 00:58:58.275
Has it been double spent?

00:59:01.810 --> 00:59:04.230
It was a very good question.

00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:06.492
They overlap a lot.

00:59:06.492 --> 00:59:07.950
One thing you can
just remember is,

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:10.830
mining is about that there's
been a half a million blocks.

00:59:10.830 --> 00:59:13.800
Transactions, there's
been 340 million.

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.370
So there must be
something else going on

00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:17.730
in all those transactions.

00:59:17.730 --> 00:59:20.430
Does that help a bit?

00:59:20.430 --> 00:59:21.865
Kelly?

00:59:21.865 --> 00:59:23.490
AUDIENCE: Since we're
talking about all

00:59:23.490 --> 00:59:25.590
the technical features
and how they overlap,

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:30.270
one of the questions was,
what part of blockchain

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.927
is novel to Satoshi?

00:59:37.310 --> 00:59:39.480
Is the novelty in
bringing it all together,

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.190
or is it one specific thing?

00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:43.770
Because the paper
talked about the ledger

00:59:43.770 --> 00:59:46.650
and creating the
incentive, and then

00:59:46.650 --> 00:59:49.350
sort of solving the whole
Byzantine Generals Problem.

00:59:49.350 --> 00:59:51.570
But I don't really understand.

00:59:51.570 --> 00:59:54.810
Was there a specific
thing that unlocked the--

00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:56.520
GARY GENSLER: So
Kelly's question,

00:59:56.520 --> 01:00:00.420
which is the heart of the
study questions is, what makes

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.610
the whole Satoshi paper novel?

01:00:02.610 --> 01:00:06.070
Is it just bringing
it all together,

01:00:06.070 --> 01:00:08.430
or is there something more?

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.370
I'll give you a hint.

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.630
I think there's one other--

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:15.540
I think that the genius can
be just in bringing together

01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.880
things.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.770
That in itself can
be sheer genius.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:21.840
AUDIENCE: There's also
the part that, creating

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.430
the value in the currency.

01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:24.770
But I don't know if that's--

01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:27.870
GARY GENSLER: Right, so
creating an incentive structure

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:30.500
within there.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.420
Others?

01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:32.920
Derek.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:33.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.790
GARY GENSLER: Question, or
answer to Kelly's question?

01:00:35.790 --> 01:00:36.790
AUDIENCE: No, I had a question.

01:00:36.790 --> 01:00:37.890
GARY GENSLER: All right, I'm
going to hold your question,

01:00:37.890 --> 01:00:38.932
Derek, just for a second.

01:00:38.932 --> 01:00:41.040
Who's going to help
me with-- because it's

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.492
central to the study questions.

01:00:44.492 --> 01:00:46.975
AUDIENCE: Just
another thing to add--

01:00:46.975 --> 01:00:50.950
the proof of work that
Satoshi did on the consensus

01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:52.748
to [INAUDIBLE] it's also novel.

01:00:52.748 --> 01:00:53.540
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:56.790
But novel, though,
didn't Adam Back

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:59.760
already do some
of it in hashcash.

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:02.700
So its application was novel.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:05.250
I come out where I think
the genius is bringing it

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:11.530
all together, and using
Adam Back's proof of work

01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:15.370
in a way that really
addressed double spend.

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:17.890
Adam Back was not dealing
with a double spend issue.

01:01:17.890 --> 01:01:19.260
He had different challenges.

01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:21.340
It was about email spam.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:23.152
Frankly, it didn't
even work with email.

01:01:23.152 --> 01:01:25.360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we
weren't counting [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.475
work as a completely
novel thing,

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:30.550
his article discussed how
it was already published.

01:01:30.550 --> 01:01:31.960
So I guess it's the application.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.000
GARY GENSLER: It's the
application specifically

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.865
to the double spend.

01:01:36.865 --> 01:01:41.470
Now, Patrick Murck,
would you answer it then?

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:43.840
This is somebody who ran
the Bitcoin Foundation,

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.832
but he's a lawyer, you know?

01:01:46.832 --> 01:01:48.790
PATRICK MURCK: I think
that's absolutely right.

01:01:48.790 --> 01:01:51.870
So usually-- and I think they
address it in that particular

01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:52.480
paper--

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.050
when somebody says,
what was a thing

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.300
that was different about
Bitcoin from everything else,

01:01:56.300 --> 01:01:59.020
the answer is Nakamoto
Consensus, right?

01:01:59.020 --> 01:02:02.410
And Nakamoto Consensus,
being the incentive structure

01:02:02.410 --> 01:02:05.050
pulling everything together
and aligning everybody

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.720
to actually create
trusted signing parties

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.900
for this database, without
having to actually trust

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.990
or identify those parties.

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:16.670
And that's something that
really hadn't existed before.

01:02:16.670 --> 01:02:18.520
And so that's really novel.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:21.280
That's sort of the
breakthrough that I

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.570
think you can attribute to
that particular white paper.

01:02:25.570 --> 01:02:27.730
I also use this as a way
to give a clean definition

01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:30.550
of blockchain, which is a
badly abused term, as I'm

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:33.955
sure you'll discover through
the rest of this class.

01:02:33.955 --> 01:02:36.100
It's saying, to
me, a blockchain is

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:40.248
something that is born
from Nakamoto Consensus.

01:02:40.248 --> 01:02:42.040
Blockchains, as they
discuss in that paper,

01:02:42.040 --> 01:02:44.080
have existed for decades.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.590
That's not even a
novel data structure.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.270
But using that to form Nakamoto
Con-- that's the thing.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:52.520
It always sort of
comes back to that.

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:55.348
Anyways, maybe a longer
elaboration than you wanted.

01:02:55.348 --> 01:02:56.890
GARY GENSLER: Good,
there we have it.

01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:00.145
You now know that you're in a
class that has guest speakers.

01:03:02.657 --> 01:03:04.990
I do want to say on the guest
speaker point-- and Derek,

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:07.830
I cognizant that
you have a question,

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.790
but we have 12 minutes or so.

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:16.030
Next Tuesday, Larry
Lessig, who sometimes

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:20.530
floats into this class,
has agreed to guest lecture

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.530
with me.

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:23.440
And so we're going to
co-do smart contracts.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:26.080
And let me just say a
little bit about Larry.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.160
You sort of see him here.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:29.270
He bicycles over from Harvard.

01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:31.150
He's a constitutional
scholar that's

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.080
a remarkable
constitutional scholar.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.250
And even though he came to be
a full professor at Harvard,

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:38.110
they stole him away
from Stanford actually,

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:41.420
where he was a full
professor, too, readily.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.530
But he's extensively written.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:48.110
Anybody in here a West Wing
fan, the television series

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:50.660
West Wing?

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:52.350
He is the only--

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.822
do you know that Larry
Lessig was in West Wing?

01:03:54.822 --> 01:03:55.970
AUDIENCE: No.

01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:57.470
GARY GENSLER: Now you do.

01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:58.340
Well, Larry was.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:02.360
And Christopher Lloyd played
Larry Lessig in one episode.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.400
But you'll go back and
you'll find the episode.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.560
And Larry has a funny
story about watching

01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.940
the filming of it.

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:15.320
But Larry is a constitutional
scholar over at Harvard.

01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:20.030
He clerked for Justice
Scalia on the Supreme Court.

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:25.580
He clerked for Posner
over in Chicago.

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.140
He knows a lot about contracts.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:29.810
And so I asked him if he'd
help teach smart contracts

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:30.600
next Tuesday.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.933
So Larry's going to-- we're
going to Mutt and Jeff it up

01:04:32.933 --> 01:04:35.240
here next Tuesday.

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.140
Watch out, Patrick.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.237
You might be up here one day.

01:04:38.237 --> 01:04:40.070
This is not a class
that we're going to have

01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.110
a lot of guest lecturers.

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:44.340
Later in this
semester, I hope, we're

01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.310
still in confirming
Jeff Sprecher, who's

01:04:46.310 --> 01:04:49.825
the chief executive officer
of Intercontinental Exchange,

01:04:49.825 --> 01:04:51.200
runs the New York
Stock Exchange.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.480
Jeff is probably joining us
on, I think it's November 15.

01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.700
But I really want to stay
to the content and so forth.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.418
Derek, what's your question?

01:05:03.418 --> 01:05:05.210
AUDIENCE: I can follow
up with you on that.

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:06.377
GARY GENSLER: OK, follow up.

01:05:06.377 --> 01:05:08.790
All right, and then we just
did transactions today.

01:05:08.790 --> 01:05:12.110
Remember, the hash function
is The New York Times.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:16.400
We're in a little better
place with Lauren's table now.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.730
All right, good, good.

01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:21.765
My goal is not to
embarrass anybody

01:05:21.765 --> 01:05:22.890
when I ask these questions.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:25.790
My goal is that we all
come along on this journey,

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:27.890
that we somehow have some basis.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.990
Because it does relate
to understanding

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:33.800
the commercial reality
and the economics.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:38.020
We talked about the time
stamping and the blocks,

01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:41.940
the Merkle Trees, which is not a
deep part of it, and of course,

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:43.280
digital signatures.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.470
Part of the reason I
replay this each time

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:47.090
is because, in
politics, I, of course,

01:05:47.090 --> 01:05:49.710
learned that repetition is
a really important thing.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:50.210
[LAUGHTER]

01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:55.280
But I also think it's
true in academic settings.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.160
And then Bitcoin addresses,
and that's just a cleanup,

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.890
that it's not an
identical to a public.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.800
And then the proof of work,
and back to the questions.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.770
Nakamoto Consensus
is, yes, all of this

01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:11.060
and an incentive structure,
but it's this proof of work.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:14.450
And to Erin's
question, proof of work

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:16.550
is a little bit different
than the transactions

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:20.160
that we talked about, but
there's a lot of overlap.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.230
And then it creates
the native currency.

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:28.810
And I've corrected this
slide to 2140, of course.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.490
The network is
really critical, too,

01:06:31.490 --> 01:06:33.360
and that there's all
these different actors

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.530
on a network, 10,000 nodes
and this many light nodes

01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.690
and the miners and the
mining pool operators.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:43.320
And they all have their
separate economics.

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:45.900
And so if anybody wants to
come and get office hours,

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.440
talk about those economics,
please come on in.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:51.870
If there's nothing you
remember from the reading,

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.200
I've now read this
paper probably six times

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.930
to kind of slowly get
it through my head.

01:06:57.930 --> 01:07:00.870
But every time I
read the Clark paper,

01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:03.930
I go, wow, that really helps me.

01:07:03.930 --> 01:07:07.590
Because it's not like
Satoshi Nakamoto just flipped

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.570
his fingers and there it--

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:13.020
it was on the backs of
a lot of cryptography,

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:15.850
a lot of technology earlier.

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:17.610
But this is the
chart I turn back to,

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:19.140
and it's sometimes helps me.

01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:22.590
Ah, there's time-stamping,
there's digital cache,

01:07:22.590 --> 01:07:26.280
there's proof of work,
and how these things.

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.200
Maybe 10 years from
now, they'll look back

01:07:28.200 --> 01:07:30.600
and Nakamoto's stuff
will just be built upon.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:32.100
That's the central question.

01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:34.290
That's what some
of our colleagues

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:36.600
are doing over at the
Digital Currency Initiative

01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:38.610
or over at the
Computer Sciences Lab.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:41.190
They're saying, can
they build upon this

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:44.283
and take it to another level?

01:07:44.283 --> 01:07:46.450
Right now-- and you'll see
throughout the semester--

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:49.290
there's not a lot of
full scale applications

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:52.310
of this technology.

01:07:52.310 --> 01:07:54.380
But it might just be in
a whole line of this.

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.422
Yes, and I can't remember
your first name, Aviva?

01:07:56.422 --> 01:07:57.820
AUDIENCE: I'm Aviva.

01:07:57.820 --> 01:07:59.340
And that is the
other Indian woman.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.170
GARY GENSLER: That's
the other Aviva.

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:01.837
AUDIENCE: That's the
other Indian woman.

01:08:01.837 --> 01:08:03.545
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
yeah, it's important.

01:08:03.545 --> 01:08:05.783
Out of 100 people, we can
have two Avivas, you know?

01:08:05.783 --> 01:08:07.700
We could even have two
Aviva's if there's two.

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
name's Priya.

01:08:09.550 --> 01:08:10.466
AUDIENCE: I'm Priya.

01:08:10.466 --> 01:08:12.950
GARY GENSLER: Pria--
oh, I'm sorry.

01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:13.900
Thank you.

01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.770
AUDIENCE: So I was
just thinking about,

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:19.229
as one of the applications
of the hash function--

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:24.040
so does the hash function
actually replace the data?

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.319
So I'm thinking now that
everyone's saving data

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:30.560
in the cloud, so can you
save a hash function instead

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.142
of your actual data, and
then so it can be compressed?

01:08:34.142 --> 01:08:36.350
GARY GENSLER: Very good
question-- my summary of it--

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.899
though others' probably
would be more expert.

01:08:38.899 --> 01:08:40.470
My summary is, you get a choice.

01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:41.970
You could do either.

01:08:41.970 --> 01:08:46.840
So let's take it in blockchain
rather than in the cloud.

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:51.790
You can choose to save in
a blockchain just hashes,

01:08:51.790 --> 01:08:55.569
and have the full
picture somewhere else.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:59.580
Let's say you were going
to do a whole database of--

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:00.623
AUDIENCE: A library.

01:09:00.623 --> 01:09:01.540
GARY GENSLER: Of what?

01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.915
AUDIENCE: I'd say
like a library.

01:09:02.915 --> 01:09:04.600
GARY GENSLER: A library--

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.510
and so there's 100,000
books in the library.

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:09.760
You could hash
all 100,000 books,

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.069
and then store the hashes in
the blockchain and not the books

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:16.720
themselves.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:19.420
And that would form a
blockchain of the commitments

01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.680
to those books.

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:25.149
Or you could actually, I
guess, put the books themselves

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:26.229
into the blockchain.

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:29.359
Now, I saw some shaking
heads in the middle.

01:09:29.359 --> 01:09:33.010
Alin from the Digital
Currency Initiative.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:35.670
AUDIENCE: The way I understand
this is, the answer is no.

01:09:38.979 --> 01:09:40.720
You can store the hash.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.556
That doesn't replace the data.

01:09:42.556 --> 01:09:45.460
The storing of the hash
allows you to prove

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.500
that you have the data.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.460
But the fact that
you store the hash

01:09:49.460 --> 01:09:51.520
doesn't mean that
you store the data.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:57.190
GARY GENSLER: But Alin,
there's a two-part question.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:59.050
You shouldn't get
rid of the book,

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:02.140
because hashes are one way.

01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:06.370
You're not able to take the
hash and recreate the look.

01:10:06.370 --> 01:10:09.040
You can't take the hash and
recreate The New York Times

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.070
crossword puzzle.

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:13.275
But you don't need to store
them in the same place.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:18.090
Thank you, because it's
two parts the question.

01:10:18.090 --> 01:10:20.850
You could store the
hashes in the cloud

01:10:20.850 --> 01:10:23.400
and store the books
somewhere else.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.455
But you still need to
store the book, maybe.

01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:32.450
So who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:35.480
We have just a handful of
minutes, but can every table--

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.550
each table's going
to take four minutes.

01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:40.550
And amongst yourselves, decide
who is Satoshi Nakamoto.

01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:41.910
So how are we doing?

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:45.108
Who's your answer
to Satoshi Nakamoto?

01:10:45.108 --> 01:10:47.150
AUDIENCE: We would say,
probably multiple people,

01:10:47.150 --> 01:10:48.500
led by Hal Finney.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.740
GARY GENSLER: OK, so the
first one is, multiple people,

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:53.480
probably led by Hal Finney.

01:11:00.561 --> 01:11:01.190
AUDIENCE: NSA.

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:05.100
AUDIENCE: Something within the
government or a government.

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:11.370
GARY GENSLER: So table number
2 is, government actor, US

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:12.796
or foreign.

01:11:12.796 --> 01:11:15.080
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
it matters, but maybe US.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.630
GARY GENSLER: US, but
it might not matter.

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:18.860
How are we doing over here?

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:20.138
AUDIENCE: Dorian Nakamoto.

01:11:20.138 --> 01:11:21.430
GARY GENSLER: Dorian Nakamoto--

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:27.860
so you're going with
the Newsweek story.

01:11:27.860 --> 01:11:30.620
Pria, sorry about the
name thing before.

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.620
Your table, who--

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:33.473
AUDIENCE: A bunch
of crypto punks.

01:11:33.473 --> 01:11:35.390
GARY GENSLER: What's
that, a bunch of crypto--

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:36.260
AUDIENCE: Punks.

01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:36.545
GARY GENSLER: Punks.

01:11:36.545 --> 01:11:39.140
AUDIENCE: Plus economists--
it's like a group of people.

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:42.380
GARY GENSLER: So a group of
crypto punks and economists.

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:44.720
And how do you spell
crypto punks, though?

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.220
AUDIENCE: Cipher punks.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.565
GARY GENSLER: Cipher punks,
cipher punks, actually.

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:53.770
Where are we here?

01:11:53.770 --> 01:11:55.280
AUDIENCE: NSA.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.320
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
the NSA, all right.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.697
AUDIENCE: People with
incentive and the capability.

01:11:59.697 --> 01:12:01.655
GARY GENSLER: Oh, so
incentives and capability,

01:12:01.655 --> 01:12:03.170
you think it's NSA.

01:12:03.170 --> 01:12:03.930
AUDIENCE: MIT.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:08.150
GARY GENSLER: MIT, oh!

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:10.520
AUDIENCE: We said, a
guy named Gary Gensler.

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.255
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:12.255 --> 01:12:13.880
GARY GENSLER: There
is a word for that,

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.090
but I can't say that on tape.

01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:21.940
Kelly, Anton, two Alins
what do we have here, Jihee.

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.410
AUDIENCE: Let's go
with Nick Szabo.

01:12:24.410 --> 01:12:28.610
GARY GENSLER: Nick Szabo,
who wrote the first paper

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:31.410
on smart contracts.

01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:34.300
So Aviva is Nick Szabo.

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.928
My hash table--

01:12:35.928 --> 01:12:38.020
[LAUGHTER]

01:12:40.487 --> 01:12:41.820
GARY GENSLER: Who do you go for?

01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:44.390
AUDIENCE: We actually
did have him, Szabo.

01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:46.940
GARY GENSLER: All
right, you can say

01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:48.430
another table for Nick Szabo.

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:50.620
Put another vote next to him.

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:51.400
Here?

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.942
AUDIENCE: We're
going with you, Gary.

01:12:52.942 --> 01:12:54.800
GARY GENSLER: No, no, come on.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:57.860
AUDIENCE: We think it's
Craig Steven Wright.

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:00.710
GARY GENSLER: Craig
Wright, the Australian.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.270
Oh, my god.

01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:06.350
Oh, Patrick Murck's table
is going to go last.

01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:08.600
Here?

01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.340
AUDIENCE: Bill Belichick.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:13.362
GARY GENSLER: Bill Belichick.

01:13:13.362 --> 01:13:16.630
AUDIENCE: Alan Greenspan.

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:18.630
GARY GENSLER: Alan Greenspan.

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.270
I actually know Alan.

01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:23.110
He's really talented,
but I don't think

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:25.420
Andrea would let him do this.

01:13:25.420 --> 01:13:28.030
Here, who do we have?

01:13:32.935 --> 01:13:33.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.560
GARY GENSLER: Who?

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], me.

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:37.510
GARY GENSLER: No, no, but who--

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:39.210
you're saying you invented it?

01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:40.450
No, no, this table.

01:13:40.450 --> 01:13:42.450
AUDIENCE: This table is
saying he invented it.

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:46.990
GARY GENSLER: Nick Szabo,
so another for Nick Szabo.

01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:51.160
So does anybody want to
tell us why it's the NSA?

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:55.960
Oh, Patrick Murck, I'm sorry.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.430
What's this table?

01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:59.980
PATRICK MURCK:
Well, I said, if I--

01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:00.850
so I don't know.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.720
But if I did know, I would
say that I don't know,

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.865
and I would create as much
obfuscation as possible.

01:14:06.865 --> 01:14:08.320
So I think I was
the worst person

01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.970
to have at a table for this.

01:14:09.970 --> 01:14:12.220
And I did them nothing but
a disservice in their hunt

01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:13.620
for Satoshi.

01:14:13.620 --> 01:14:15.185
But I'll let
somebody else speak.

01:14:15.185 --> 01:14:16.335
No, I don't know.

01:14:16.335 --> 01:14:17.710
GARY GENSLER: But
if he did know,

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:20.480
he would say he doesn't know.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:24.000
Derek, who did
your table go for?

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.670
AUDIENCE: We said Craig Wright.

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:28.780
PATRICK MURCK: You
can see my influence.

01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:31.570
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my gosh.

01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:35.680
So let me ask this, because
it's just for fun, one minute.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:38.020
Somebody said that
it was the NSA.

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.760
Do you want to say why?

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.410
AUDIENCE: Because,
arguably, they

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:44.830
have the most advanced
cryptography in the world.

01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:49.973
And if anybody was doing
this, to have a system where

01:14:49.973 --> 01:14:52.390
all the dark money in the world
was flowing around instead

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:56.220
of $100 bills, you would create
this and create it in a way

01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.497
where you could hack it
backwards and figure it out.

01:14:58.497 --> 01:14:59.705
And they have the capability.

01:14:59.705 --> 01:15:00.455
GARY GENSLER: Wow.

01:15:00.455 --> 01:15:00.955
Hugo.

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:03.497
AUDIENCE: More [INAUDIBLE] money
is going through [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:03.497 --> 01:15:05.230
right now than it
is through Bitcoin.

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:08.820
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo would
say that, if it was the NSA,

01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:12.790
it didn't work out
for them too well.

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.860
And those of you who
said Craig Wright,

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:17.380
I heard some others in
the room that said, no.

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:19.600
So who said Craig Wright?

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:23.190
Which two tables
said Craig Wright?

01:15:23.190 --> 01:15:25.460
Isabella and Ben, why did
you pick Craig Wright?

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:26.906
AUDIENCE: So I
read a bunch of it.

01:15:26.906 --> 01:15:30.762
And basically, people analyzed
the English used in the email,

01:15:30.762 --> 01:15:32.792
and they think it traced
back to Australia.

01:15:32.792 --> 01:15:34.250
And then we
[INAUDIBLE] from there.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:37.622
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
just the language analytics

01:15:37.622 --> 01:15:38.330
for Craig Wright.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.950
And those who said
it can't possibly

01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:43.920
be Craig Wright, who did that?

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.120
Alin?

01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
he started a website.

01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:49.160
He said, oh, here's
cryptographic proof

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.440
that I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.860
But he actually botched it.

01:15:51.860 --> 01:15:53.570
Like, if you are
Nakamoto, you can

01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:56.540
prove you're Nakamoto by
spending the first coin.

01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.030
But he couldn't do
that, so come on, man.

01:15:59.030 --> 01:16:01.010
GARY GENSLER: So Alin
says, he failed the test.

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:04.100
He didn't spend the
first coins from 2009.

01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:06.740
Three tables picked Nick Szabo.

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:11.263
Why'd you pick Nick Szabo, just
any one of the three tables?

01:16:11.263 --> 01:16:13.680
Because we're going to talk
about him in the next lecture.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:14.440
No?

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:15.790
All right, look, this
was a bit of fun.

01:16:15.790 --> 01:16:17.373
I just thought it
would be worthwhile.

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:19.420
Because the only
person in the room

01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:21.970
that really knows
who Satoshi Nakamoto

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.380
is isn't going to tell us.

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.750
[LAUGHTER] But you're
welcome back any time.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.400
Thank you.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.550
We'll see you next Tuesday.

01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:32.230
Remember, Larry Lessig is here,
so please do the readings.

01:16:32.230 --> 01:16:35.160
Please, let's have a good time.

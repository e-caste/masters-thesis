00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.810
PROFESSOR: Welcome to
another exciting day

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.740
of Engineering
Innovation and Design.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.100
We'll read some
interesting things today

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.981
so the pace might be
a little bit faster.

00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:40.480
Here we go.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.760
Pop quiz.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.517
I've given you a
piece of paper there.

00:00:48.517 --> 00:00:50.850
If you don't have that paper
you can use your own paper.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.360
This is the pop quiz.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.635
It's going to be given orally.

00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:00.700
Are you ready?

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.320
I want you to tell
me what questions I

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.820
would ask you on
a pop quiz today.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.890
That is your pop quiz.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.390
Question.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.098
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat that question?

00:01:21.098 --> 00:01:22.460
PROFESSOR: I'd be happy to.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.830
It sounds a bit circular, right?

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.060
I want you to tell
me what you think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.930
I would ask you on
a pop quiz today

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.780
if I were giving you
a quiz on the material

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.760
that we've had so far.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.010
AUDIENCE: What are the 10
steps in the design process.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.010
PROFESSOR: You should
just write this down.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.093
But I'm sure everyone would
appreciate your answer

00:01:40.093 --> 00:01:41.400
because it's a good one.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.440
So write that down.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.570
You might have two
or three answers.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.790
I'll give you about 34
seconds to fill that out.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.530
And time.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.280
Take your papers.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.502
Pass them over to this side of
the room all the way that side.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:01.210
And pass them to the
top down once you've

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.510
collected all those papers.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.900
Now-- and let's do it
quietly-- here's the question.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.607
What questions would I ask you?

00:02:07.607 --> 00:02:10.255
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:11.130
PROFESSOR: Your name.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.921
That's a great one.

00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:14.447
Keep going.

00:02:14.447 --> 00:02:15.780
AUDIENCE: Do we write our names?

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.040
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.510
You should write your name
on your paper, of course.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.570
Yes.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:19.997
That's so I know who wrote this.

00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:22.330
But that would be a good
question to ask on a pop quiz--

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.132
your name.

00:02:23.132 --> 00:02:24.340
AUDIENCE: What is innovation.

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.060
PROFESSOR: What is innovation.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.910
That's great.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.038
What else?

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:33.000
AUDIENCE: A few characteristics
of good and bad design?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.650
PROFESSOR: A few
characteristics of?

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.130
Of good and bad design.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.700
Sure.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.618
What else?

00:02:37.618 --> 00:02:39.410
AUDIENCE: I believe
I've already stated--

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.795
PROFESSOR: You did.

00:02:39.795 --> 00:02:40.753
And it was a great one.

00:02:40.753 --> 00:02:41.757
Could you restate it?

00:02:41.757 --> 00:02:43.550
AUDIENCE: What are the 10
steps of the design process.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.740
PROFESSOR: The 10
step design process.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.805
That's a wonderful one.

00:02:45.805 --> 00:02:49.137
Because that may even occur
on a subsequent pop quiz.

00:02:49.137 --> 00:02:50.970
AUDIENCE: What makes a
good design critique.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:51.930
PROFESSOR: What makes
a good design critique.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.950
Excellent.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.140
AUDIENCE: What's the most
important question to ask.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.590
PROFESSOR: What's the
most important question

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.590
to ask particularly when
you're given a problem.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:59.240
Absolutely.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.500
That's a great one.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.956
Any other ones?

00:03:01.956 --> 00:03:03.210
You did a great job.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.400
You all get A's.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.050
So that's the beginning.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.780
So look for these
questions that may

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.647
appear on subsequent
pop quizzes.

00:03:12.647 --> 00:03:13.480
Let's start in here.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.560
I want to know if anybody here
knows who these two people are.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.250
Anybody know who this
person is on the right?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.820
Tell me.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.500
Who is it?

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.354
AUDIENCE: John Ive.

00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:23.270
PROFESSOR: Johnny Ive.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.770
Absolutely.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.262
And what does Johnny Ive do?

00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:28.775
AUDIENCE: He's the
Chief Designer at Apple.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:29.400
PROFESSOR: Yup.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.560
Chief Designer at Apple
for hardware products.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.540
AUDIENCE: Industrial Designer.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.980
PROFESSOR: Industrial Designer.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.960
Exactly.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.120
And on the left-- this guy
here in the black and white

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.590
picture-- who's he?

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.399
Hah.

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:43.940
Not as famous as
Johnny Ive, I guess.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.750
Oh, maybe he is.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.587
Hold on.

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:46.840
AUDIENCE: Is it Dieter Rams?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.760
PROFESSOR: It is Dieter Rams.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.060
Absolutely.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.140
Dieter Rams and Johnny Ive--
two very important people.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.810
Let's show you a
little bit about them.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.450
Dieter Rams was born
in 1932 in Germany.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.480
And he's closely
associated with something

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.730
called the functionalist
school of industrial design.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.900
He made these things.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.920
Johnny Ive was born
a lot later in 1967.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.890
And you're all
familiar with his work

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.709
from having experienced it
firsthand or seen it firsthand.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.350
These are Dieter Rams' work.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.930
These are Johnny Ive's work.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.790
Let's do that again.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.912
This is what Dieter Rams made.

00:04:30.912 --> 00:04:35.780
And, interestingly enough,
Johnny Ives made these.

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.980
Do you notice any parallels?

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.440
Let's take a look some more.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.740
Johnny Ive on the right.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.850
Dieter Rams on the left.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.832
Johnny Ive on the right.

00:04:47.832 --> 00:04:50.160
Dieter Rams on the left.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.120
And would you believe Johnny
on the right and Dieter Rams

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.420
on the left?

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.250
Again, Johnny Ive on the
right with a speaker that

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.210
has an iPod on top of it
and a speaker over here

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.750
that has a phonograph on it.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.750
An iMac.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.790
A speaker.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.770
Johnny Ive.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.220
Dieter Rams.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.410
Johnny Ive on the right.

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:12.870
It's like a television.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.620
Doesn't it look
like a television?

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.950
And here it's a television.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.110
So this interesting.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.390
That's a speaker I guess.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.944
What is this product?

00:05:24.944 --> 00:05:25.700
AUDIENCE: An iPod.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.630
PROFESSOR: It is an iPod.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.530
And what is this product?

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.280
AUDIENCE: A radio.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.620
PROFESSOR: It's a radio.

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:30.800
It's a radio.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.587
So here's the question.

00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:35.670
They didn't talk about
this for a very long time--

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.794
Johnny Ive and Dieter Rams.

00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:39.270
So we're going to put
ourselves back up a few months

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.504
or a few years ago when no
one knew what's going on here

00:05:42.504 --> 00:05:43.920
or how they felt
about each other.

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.480
What do you think about this?

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.588
What do you think about
this when you see this?

00:05:52.588 --> 00:05:53.754
AUDIENCE: Legally different.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.420
PROFESSOR: Legally different?

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.067
Legally.

00:06:00.067 --> 00:06:00.900
What does that mean?

00:06:04.302 --> 00:06:06.302
AUDIENCE: It wouldn't be
copyright infringement.

00:06:06.302 --> 00:06:08.093
PROFESSOR: It's not
copyright infringement.

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:09.440
Yeah, totally different.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.342
These look totally
different from each other.

00:06:11.342 --> 00:06:12.800
I know there's no
way you could see

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.524
any similarity in this
corpus of work at all.

00:06:17.524 --> 00:06:19.690
Don't tell the Apple lawyers
who are suing Samsung--

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.840
or who sued Samsung
successfully.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.340
What else?

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.890
What else do you think
of when you see this?

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:25.230
Yes.

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:26.690
AUDIENCE: Good
design is repeated.

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.700
PROFESSOR: Good
design is repeated.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.000
What do you mean by repeated?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.980
AUDIENCE: Used again.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.960
PROFESSOR: That's pretty clever.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.460
Used again.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.654
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:33.654 --> 00:06:34.570
PROFESSOR: It's very--

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.057
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:40.327 --> 00:06:42.160
PROFESSOR: So she's
saying that good design,

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.785
you just use the same
thing over again.

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:44.650
AUDIENCE: No.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:45.270
PROFESSOR: No.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.290
Not quite?

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.970
Am I shading it?

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:47.469
OK.

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.159
Let's see what-- go ahead.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.200
AUDIENCE: No, that's all.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.240
PROFESSOR: OK, fine.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.590
If you think of
something, let me know.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.879
AUDIENCE: As long
as you don't have

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:56.404
to redesign the
wheel, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:01.960
PROFESSOR: So adapting
designs for what you need, OK.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.700
What else?

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.690
AUDIENCE: While the designs
are very similar and shared

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:10.120
between them, the products
themselves are very different.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.390
PROFESSOR: Ah.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.015
He says the designs are similar
but the products are different.

00:07:13.015 --> 00:07:14.140
Tell me.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.650
I see a music player on
the left and a music player

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.320
on the right.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.990
This one fits in your pocket.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.580
This one fits in your pocket.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.554
This one has a circular
thing that spins

00:07:25.554 --> 00:07:27.220
and this is a circular
thing that spins.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.140
This allows you to select stuff.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:30.820
That circle and this circle
allows you to select stuff.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.237
Tell me are they different?

00:07:32.237 --> 00:07:33.112
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:39.130
PROFESSOR: A little different.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.440
Sure.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.390
Because it's a screen
over here on the right.

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.060
And a hard drive, yes.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:47.700
Actually it's kind of funny.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:54.270
Right now, interestingly, if you
buy an iPod Touch or something,

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:57.780
you don't have to have
music on your iPod.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:02.325
It streams it wirelessly over
the air much like a radio.

00:08:05.775 --> 00:08:07.580
Fascinatingly similar.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:08.830
Everything old is new again.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.020
So you say they're different,
but they're kind of similar.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:12.520
What else?

00:08:16.407 --> 00:08:17.990
How do you think
they feel about this?

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:20.570
How do you think
that Dieter Rams felt

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:23.864
when he saw these
things coming out?

00:08:23.864 --> 00:08:24.530
AUDIENCE: Happy?

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.360
PROFESSOR: Happy.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.476
Why happy?

00:08:26.476 --> 00:08:28.860
AUDIENCE: He insprired a whole
new generation of design.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:29.818
PROFESSOR: There we go.

00:08:29.818 --> 00:08:33.940
So he says, I'm so glad you're
copying all my hardware.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.039
I feel like I've really,
really contributed

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:37.707
a lot more to society
because of this.

00:08:37.707 --> 00:08:38.790
That's one interpretation.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.910
What if someone was sitting
next to you during a test

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.760
and took that philosophy?

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.240
Would you feel happy about the
fact that they were inspiring

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.669
a whole new set of A's?

00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:54.210
I don't know.

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.380
At what point have you ever
made something or thought, hey,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:03.060
you're copying our stuff?

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.532
AUDIENCE: You want to look at
whoever wrote the textbook.

00:09:05.532 --> 00:09:07.990
You're reading the textbook
and putting down the knowledge.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.870
You're stealing from them.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.239
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:09:12.239 --> 00:09:12.780
I don't know.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:13.613
This is interesting.

00:09:13.613 --> 00:09:17.080
So we have these things that
definitely seem very similar.

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:25.460
But what's interesting
is that they both believe

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.010
in the same
fundamental approaches

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.140
to how to design great stuff.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.410
And they might have come
to similar conclusions

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:37.860
either knowingly, because
of this form factor,

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.770
maybe somewhat unknowingly
and they realized,

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.420
boy this looks a
little bit like this,

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.160
what can we learn from that.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.167
What is step number two?

00:09:47.167 --> 00:09:48.500
AUDIENCE: The information phase.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:49.410
PROFESSOR: The
information phase, yes.

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:50.480
The information phase.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.396
So how can we leverage
what's out in the world

00:09:52.396 --> 00:09:53.910
already to inform our design?

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:57.330
And they might have looked at--
I don't know-- 50 or 100 or 200

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.830
different ideas and came on
this one or a group of them

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:00.390
that looked like this.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:02.306
And he said, it reminds
me of this other thing

00:10:02.306 --> 00:10:04.380
that I saw a long time
ago, when I was a kid.

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:07.100
And I loved the way it worked.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:07.805
So yes.

00:10:07.805 --> 00:10:09.180
I think you're
right about this--

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.220
that great design has
a lot of similarities.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.650
And you'll see this
happening throughout history.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.490
Things change very
little in history.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.280
There are few changes that
occur-- fundamental changes.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.180
Take a look at kitchens.

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.230
Kitchens in the past-- I
don't know, let's say 60,

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.460
70 years-- have only
had really two changes

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.160
that are substantive.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.480
One of them is that there
are now-- almost always when

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.885
the new kitchens are
designed-- open to another room

00:10:36.885 --> 00:10:38.640
or to an area where
people can entertain.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.130
People use the kitchen
differently now

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.010
as a way of connecting
with people.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.500
Before, you'd shut
off the kitchen.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.420
You close the door.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.650
And you bring out the food.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:49.025
And you say, look at this
beautiful food and not the mess

00:10:49.025 --> 00:10:50.280
in the kitchen.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.020
That changed.

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.710
And microwave ovens changed.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.630
Who here has a microwave oven?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.710
Wow.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.900
And who here has
a microwave oven

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:00.544
and doesn't have
their own kitchen?

00:11:00.544 --> 00:11:02.210
So some of you don't
even have a kitchen

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:03.040
and you've got a microwave oven.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.747
Pretty amazing.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:04.580
That's a big change.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.490
Otherwise, we've
got refrigeration.

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:08.777
We've got a stove.

00:11:08.777 --> 00:11:10.860
About the same height as
all the stoves before it.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.530
We've got ovens.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.557
If you're rich, you
might have two ovens.

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:18.140
Maybe you have a
garbage disposal now,

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:19.848
but there's not a
whole bunch of changes.

00:11:19.848 --> 00:11:21.290
Things change very slowly.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:23.050
So we'll see this in design.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.276
And what's interesting is
that Dieter Rams came up

00:11:25.276 --> 00:11:28.310
with these 10 principles
of good design.

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.090
So let's discuss them.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.030
I want you to tell me, for
each of these principles,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:40.455
what you think they mean and
if you think they're any good.

00:11:40.455 --> 00:11:44.550
Good design is innovative.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.675
What does that mean that
good design is innovative?

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:50.250
How about this.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:52.430
Who thinks good design is
not innovative-- does not

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.346
have to be innovative?

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.292
Give me some example.

00:11:58.292 --> 00:11:59.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:59.284 --> 00:12:00.276
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:12:00.276 --> 00:12:02.650
To prove that good design does
not have to be innovative.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.100
AUDIENCE: The one
you just showed us?

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.780
PROFESSOR: So you're
saying that this was not

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.754
an innovation over this?

00:12:10.754 --> 00:12:11.920
AUDIENCE: Well, parts of it.

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:13.120
PROFESSOR: Part of it.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.150
What part?

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.290
AUDIENCE: The way it looks.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:17.520
PROFESSOR: Is innovative?

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.213
Or not innovate?

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:24.220
AUDIENCE: Not if you're
comparing it to the other one.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.400
PROFESSOR: How come?

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.000
This is made of plastic.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.650
This has different
kinds of plastic.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.340
It's got a screen on it.

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:32.405
It's got four buttons
on the outside.

00:12:32.405 --> 00:12:34.530
It's got headphones that
are attached to it instead

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.560
of using a speaker.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.624
You think it's too similar?

00:12:39.624 --> 00:12:41.665
AUDIENCE: No, I'm saying
that it's as innovative.

00:12:41.665 --> 00:12:43.748
I think it doesn't have
to be extremely innovative

00:12:43.748 --> 00:12:45.570
because I'm saying
they look very similar.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.695
There are innovations
but they're not drastic.

00:12:48.695 --> 00:12:50.320
PROFESSOR: Would you
say an iPod is not

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.340
a drastic innovation
over a radio?

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.580
AUDIENCE: Yes, I'm
saying it is, but I'm

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.400
saying the physical
appearance of it.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.816
PROFESSOR: The
physical appearance

00:12:57.816 --> 00:12:59.480
may not be innovative.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.230
Other examples?

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:03.890
I'm going to bring this
other slide back up.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:04.882
Yes.

00:13:04.882 --> 00:13:06.507
AUDIENCE: Some of
the things that we've

00:13:06.507 --> 00:13:10.338
been using since forever,
like a bowl or something--

00:13:10.338 --> 00:13:12.830
it's really basic but I
think it's good design.

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:14.702
PROFESSOR: A bowl
is a good design.

00:13:14.702 --> 00:13:16.655
But if someone made a new bowl--

00:13:18.912 --> 00:13:20.370
AUDIENCE: It could
be a good design

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.800
and innovate but I don't
think it's required.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.540
PROFESSOR: You
don't it's required?

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:29.420
So a new bowl doesn't have to be
innovative to be well designed

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.650
or to be a good design.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.613
That's interesting.

00:13:31.613 --> 00:13:33.585
AUDIENCE: To go back
to the last example,

00:13:33.585 --> 00:13:35.557
innovation also
depends on the context

00:13:35.557 --> 00:13:37.040
when you're looking
at the design.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.190
PROFESSOR: What do
you mean the context

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.250
in looking at the design?

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:40.490
What do you mean it
depends on the context?

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:42.531
AUDIENCE: So right now,
before I saw Dieter Rams,

00:13:42.531 --> 00:13:44.837
I was of the opposite
position of Johnny Ives.

00:13:44.837 --> 00:13:47.252
But now I that I see a
different context, maybe I see

00:13:47.252 --> 00:13:49.312
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:49.312 --> 00:13:50.270
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:51.061
That's interesting.

00:13:51.061 --> 00:13:52.280
Context.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.620
What do you mean context, now?

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.817
What's your context?

00:13:55.817 --> 00:13:58.150
AUDIENCE: It's what I know
about those kinds of designs.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.620
PROFESSOR: It's what you know.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.262
Context about what you know.

00:14:01.262 --> 00:14:04.015
Could it be something
else as well?

00:14:04.015 --> 00:14:05.665
AUDIENCE: Context
of similar designs

00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:07.480
and their past designs
related to that.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.680
PROFESSOR: A broader context.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.065
What else?

00:14:11.065 --> 00:14:11.565
Yes.

00:14:11.565 --> 00:14:14.065
AUDIENCE: I would have to argue
that this design is innovate

00:14:14.065 --> 00:14:17.052
because if a design is very
good, then there is no reason

00:14:17.052 --> 00:14:18.480
you want to improve it.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.700
PROFESSOR: If a design is
very good if there's no?

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.670
AUDIENCE: There's no
reason to improve it.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.010
PROFESSOR: No reason
to improve it.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.390
AUDIENCE: If you come
up with something that's

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:26.290
good than from
what is was before

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.479
and it's selling
well then there's

00:14:29.479 --> 00:14:30.520
clearly some improvement.

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.460
PROFESSOR: She said if
you have a new product

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:35.620
and it's selling
well then there's

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:36.920
clearly some improvement.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.950
What if it's not
selling so well?

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:40.162
Could it be innovative?

00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:41.703
AUDIENCE: It could
also be innovative

00:14:41.703 --> 00:14:45.464
because I think the innovation
is defined-- well, not defined,

00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:50.007
but it about when you decide
that needs to be redesigned.

00:14:50.007 --> 00:14:51.590
PROFESSOR: Innovation
comes about when

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.040
you decide it needs
to be redesigned.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.540
Interesting.

00:14:57.250 --> 00:14:59.800
Other ideas?

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.850
I think context is
very interesting here

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.490
and a little unusual.

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.570
Context-- we look at the
world in a certain way.

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:12.460
By a show of hands
here, who thinks

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:16.300
that their hairstyle
looks ridiculous?

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:20.230
There are no hands that went up.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:23.090
Who here thinks that people
whose-- they see pictures

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.860
of people from the '80s
have ridiculous hairstyles?

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:28.270
Yeah, a lot more
hands go up now.

00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.450
How about the '70s?

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.166
So you don't think that in 20
years you're going to look back

00:15:33.166 --> 00:15:35.790
at pictures of yourself and go,
I cannot believe my hair looked

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:38.140
like that?

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.580
Context, right?

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.950
Context of our society.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.025
Angel goes, no way,
his hair looks great.

00:15:45.025 --> 00:15:45.650
That's awesome.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:46.899
I'm always keeping this thing.

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:48.010
And he may.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:49.706
He may keep that.

00:15:49.706 --> 00:15:51.830
Some things are a little
more timeless than others.

00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:55.660
Do you know something
interesting about art forgery?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.410
Anyone know a lot
about art forgery?

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.010
So if there's a piece of
art from the-- let's say,

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.860
early 1800s-- and let's
suppose it's now 1920.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:11.070
And I have hired Jacob
to forge a piece of art--

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.920
he's a great art forger.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.570
Well, if he's great, at the time
when they had these forgeries,

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.990
you wouldn't be able to
tell that it was a forgery.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.290
But 30, 40, 50 years later, you
say, oh, that's the forgery.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.540
I can tell.

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:32.410
Because unconsciously, Jacob
sees the world around him

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.040
and he begins to put in
elements of contemporary design

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.500
into that piece.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.720
And 50 years later, the
context has changed,

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:42.670
and you can see it.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:45.330
You can see the stuff in there.

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.380
You can see those
differences and everything

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.750
he's done to balance out
all the small differences.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:52.070
And it looks like a forgery.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.780
It's pretty amazing.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.037
So maybe this is true.

00:16:55.037 --> 00:16:55.870
Maybe it's not true.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.390
How about this one?

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:57.848
Good design makes
a product useful.

00:16:57.848 --> 00:17:00.330
Is that true?

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:02.950
Who thinks it's not true?

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.970
Who thinks it is true?

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:06.020
What does it mean?

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:08.506
What does it mean to be useful?

00:17:08.506 --> 00:17:10.256
I want to know what
it means to be useful.

00:17:10.256 --> 00:17:11.484
AUDIENCE: Satifies a need.

00:17:11.484 --> 00:17:12.650
PROFESSOR: Satisfies a need.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.286
Tell me more about that.

00:17:19.286 --> 00:17:19.869
What's a need?

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:30.030
Do I need to listen to all
my music wherever I am?

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.270
I kind of need to.

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.820
I get bored easily.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:37.050
Satisfies a need
or maybe something

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.420
less serious than a need.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.570
AUDIENCE: If it adds value.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.139
PROFESSOR: Adds value.

00:17:43.139 --> 00:17:44.430
What does it mean to add value?

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.275
What is value?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:50.400
Any ideas?

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.368
Anyone?

00:17:52.368 --> 00:17:54.340
AUDIENCE: Performs an
action efficiently.

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.016
PROFESSOR: Performs
an action efficiently.

00:17:57.016 --> 00:17:59.040
Does art perform an
action efficiently?

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.516
AUDIENCE: It depends on
how if art is useful.

00:18:04.516 --> 00:18:05.390
PROFESSOR: Well, yes.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.020
Is art useful?

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:06.780
I don't know.

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:07.630
Is art design?

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.380
Oh, different topic.

00:18:09.380 --> 00:18:12.370
Reserved for a different day.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.095
What else?

00:18:13.095 --> 00:18:14.970
AUDIENCE: It does what
it was designed to do.

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.053
PROFESSOR: Designed to do.

00:18:16.053 --> 00:18:17.559
It does what it
was designed to do.

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:19.100
So good design makes
a product useful

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.800
because it's doing what
it's supposed to do.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.129
It has fulfilled its
intended purpose.

00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:28.552
AUDIENCE: I think I'd like
to argue that because I think

00:18:28.552 --> 00:18:32.464
that you could have a useful
product that has a purpose that

00:18:32.464 --> 00:18:34.460
wasn't intended by
the manufacturer.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.350
PROFESSOR: A useful
product whose purpose

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.750
was not intended by
the manufacturer.

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.738
Let's consider this.

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.940
This is risky.

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.850
This is a brand new Apple
Macintosh Retina Display

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:54.940
MacBook Pro which I'm going
to use as a door stop.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.200
Oh, yeah.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:03.940
Not int--

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:09.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.527
Can we get a close
up on that one?

00:19:11.527 --> 00:19:12.610
Can we see this over here?

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.318
I don't know if you
can see it down here.

00:19:14.318 --> 00:19:16.900
This is my pride and joy here
being used as a door stop.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.760
Not intended by
the manufacturer.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:21.850
Pretty useful if we need
to prop open the door

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.190
I suppose I could prop it open.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:27.360
Oh god, that scraping
sound sounds terrible.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:31.920
Anything for you guys.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.550
Anything.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.200
So look how nice it
props the door open

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.700
if we didn't have
something else.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.850
Again, not intended
by the manufacturer

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.583
who had to work on the
tolerances of this device.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:50.700
So that's interesting.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.730
What if it didn't performance
its intended action

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.539
and I found a new use for it?

00:19:58.539 --> 00:19:59.330
Is it still useful?

00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:05.680
I could have an Acer or
something that I would think--

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.127
or maybe a five-year-old
Acer that's very, very slow

00:20:08.127 --> 00:20:10.710
and doesn't work very well and
I need to get rid of it anyway.

00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:11.200
And it's broke.

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:11.910
It's falling apart.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.368
And the screen-- every time I
move it the screen falls off.

00:20:14.368 --> 00:20:17.000
And I can take it and make
it a very useful doorstep.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.622
Not its intended purpose at all.

00:20:19.622 --> 00:20:22.110
AUDIENCE: I still don't think
that it's a good design just

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:25.577
because it has a use, though,
because you used it as a door

00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:29.074
stop but I still don't think
that is one of the best

00:20:29.074 --> 00:20:30.120
choices for a door stop.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.170
PROFESSOR: You don't think
it's the best choice for a door

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:31.670
stop?

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:34.230
I think it's a
beautiful door stop.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.626
Maybe the MacBook Air is better.

00:20:35.626 --> 00:20:36.375
It's wedge shaped.

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:40.676
AUDIENCE: I think the
connotations of design

00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:41.770
is purposeful.

00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:45.005
So if you use it for
an unintended use,

00:20:45.005 --> 00:20:47.460
I don't think it's
considered a good thing.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.330
PROFESSOR: If I use it
for an unintended use,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.340
it's not good design.

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.576
Why not?

00:20:50.576 --> 00:20:52.492
AUDIENCE: Because when
a designer is designing

00:20:52.492 --> 00:20:54.325
a product, they have a
specific use in mind.

00:20:54.325 --> 00:20:56.000
And they're trying
to achieve that goal.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.517
If they don't achieve that goal
and then achieve another goal--

00:21:00.517 --> 00:21:03.100
PROFESSOR: What if they achieve
something far better, far more

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:04.540
noble, far more incredible?

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:05.980
AUDIENCE: That's not what
they were trying to do.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.730
PROFESSOR: I know but
is it good anyway?

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.620
Does it matter what the
intent is is the question.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.411
AUDIENCE: I think it
does matter what the--

00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:13.210
PROFESSOR: You think
intent matters.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:16.160
Who thinks intent matters?

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.250
Who thinks intent
does not matter?

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:19.900
Who's unsure about this?

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.467
Oh, yes.

00:21:20.467 --> 00:21:22.300
This would be good for
a later conversation.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.180
Let's consider this.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:23.990
Good design-- now
know we're getting

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:25.156
really crazy-- is aesthetic.

00:21:25.156 --> 00:21:27.446
What does it mean
to be aesthetic?

00:21:27.446 --> 00:21:29.320
[AUDIENCE MEMBERS RESPONDING
 SIMULTANEOUSLY]

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.890
PROFESSOR: Pleasing.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.870
Pleasing in what way?

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:34.760
AUDIENCE: Visually.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.099
PROFESSOR: Visually pleasing.

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:38.580
AUDIENCE: All ways.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.110
PROFESSOR: What?

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:42.467
AUDIENCE: All ways,

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:44.050
PROFESSOR: Pleasing
in other ways too.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.850
Not just visually but
auditorily pleasing.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:51.076
Maybe the smell of a new car.

00:21:51.076 --> 00:21:52.520
You don't think
they work on that?

00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.000
Oh, they work on that.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.892
In fact, Mercedes
once was having

00:21:55.892 --> 00:21:57.850
an issue with some cars
because it didn't quite

00:21:57.850 --> 00:21:59.900
have that Mercedes smell.

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.250
So they hired a nose.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.910
Anyone knows what a nose is?

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.003
It's a person who
smells really well.

00:22:05.003 --> 00:22:06.586
And it's about one
in-- I don't know--

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:08.919
100,000 people or 500,000
people or a million people who

00:22:08.919 --> 00:22:10.910
have this great ability
to smell things well.

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.119
And the nose went to the car.

00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:13.076
And they took this car.

00:22:13.076 --> 00:22:15.590
They shipped it from wherever
the car person, owner was.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.580
They gave her a different car.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.455
They shipped it down.

00:22:17.455 --> 00:22:20.870
And she [SNIFFING] smelled
all around the car.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:22.560
Then she went, door,
take the door off.

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.268
And the went, OK.

00:22:23.268 --> 00:22:24.429
They stripped the door off.

00:22:24.429 --> 00:22:25.720
She's smelling around the door.

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.080
She said take this
panel off the door.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.240
They took the
panel off the door.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.739
She's smelling and
goes, this is it.

00:22:29.739 --> 00:22:32.540
This is the problem
right here, in the door.

00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:34.300
It was the insulation.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.980
And they went to the
insulation people.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.580
They said, what did you
do to our insulation.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:38.960
They said, we didn't do
anything to the insulation.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:39.950
Show us what happened.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.750
And they found out.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.920
In one part of this process,
really early on, the insulation

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:49.170
had been stored in sacks
that had once stored tea.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:51.180
Oh, yeah.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.710
That new car smell,
very important.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:56.380
So good design is aesthetic.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.180
Who thinks this is true that
good design must be aesthetic?

00:23:01.609 --> 00:23:03.650
AUDIENCE: It's something
that you're going to use

00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.130
and you want it to be pleasing
in every sense of the word.

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:07.430
PROFESSOR: You want
it to be pleasing

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:08.555
in every sense of the word?

00:23:08.555 --> 00:23:10.520
Who thinks it's not true?

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:11.417
Tell us why.

00:23:11.417 --> 00:23:13.875
AUDIENCE: If you look at the
inside of a motor or something

00:23:13.875 --> 00:23:16.041
that people aren't going
to look at I feel like what

00:23:16.041 --> 00:23:18.240
it physically appears
like does not matter.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:18.420
PROFESSOR: Great.

00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.450
So you're saying if you look
at the inside of a motor people

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:21.090
where people aren't
going to look,

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:22.970
you think it doesn't matter?

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:25.940
There's a company that
disagrees with this philosophy.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.894
And this company
is called Apple.

00:23:28.894 --> 00:23:30.310
I bring up a lot
of Apple examples

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:31.120
because I happen to know them.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.494
And I think it's
very interesting

00:23:32.494 --> 00:23:34.695
because we are all
familiar with them.

00:23:34.695 --> 00:23:36.070
Apple does something
interesting.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.910
With the inside of an iPhone, if
you-- I'm not going to take it

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.480
apart-- I'll do a lot.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.790
But if you take
the iPhone apart,

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.200
everything there matches
a certain color chart

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.120
that they have.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.225
They have a color chart.

00:23:49.225 --> 00:23:50.850
And if it doesn't
match the color chart

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:55.470
it doesn't go inside
there because they believe

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.040
if you start cheating
on the inside,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.000
it'll begin to leak out.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.890
And that cheating
will become revealed

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.290
on the outside of the design.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.240
They think the parts that you
never see are still important.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.540
When the Macintosh
first came out--

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:11.340
it was a big object like this.

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.350
A little small display.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.784
And if you were
able to open it--

00:24:15.784 --> 00:24:17.200
and it was only
meant to be opened

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.782
by professionals
who are in the shop.

00:24:19.782 --> 00:24:21.740
You weren't meant to open
it because of the CRT

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:24.186
and it can be a very
high voltage there.

00:24:24.186 --> 00:24:25.685
You open it and
take it off the back

00:24:25.685 --> 00:24:28.310
and inside is a relief
of everyone's signature

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.555
who worked on that
product, inside that,

00:24:31.555 --> 00:24:33.170
that no consumer
was meant to see.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:38.810
Do you still think
it's unimportant?

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:41.745
AUDIENCE: I feel like what
makes a good design would

00:24:41.745 --> 00:24:42.460
be other factors.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.950
PROFESSOR: Other factors.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.192
OK.

00:24:45.192 --> 00:24:47.192
AUDIENCE: If you're talking
about like an engine

00:24:47.192 --> 00:24:50.380
or something would you count
the sound of it as aesthetic?

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.580
PROFESSOR: I would count
the sound of an engine

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:54.200
as aesthetic.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.650
Absolutely.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.338
AUDIENCE: So I want a car that
sounds like an angry weasel.

00:24:58.338 --> 00:24:59.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:01.420
PROFESSOR: You want your
car to sound a certain way.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.120
People say, oh, the
roar of the car.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.535
The roar of that V8
engine, they say.

00:25:06.535 --> 00:25:09.910
Or that distinctive Porsche
sound they talk about.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:10.460
Absolutely.

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:11.709
Think of the sound of the car.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.985
Good design helps us to
understand a product.

00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:19.370
Who thinks this is true?

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.560
Who thinks it's a lie?

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.284
Who thinks it's not necessary?

00:25:24.284 --> 00:25:26.665
Good design helps to
understand a product, no?

00:25:26.665 --> 00:25:27.540
We all agree on this.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.340
What does it mean to
understand a product?

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:34.346
How do I understand a
paper cup or a bowl?

00:25:34.346 --> 00:25:36.564
AUDIENCE: Well, there's
some cases in which you'll

00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:38.290
have something and
people don't usually

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.460
read manuals or
anything like that.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:43.980
So the more intuitive
you can make the design--

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.687
like make some
spot for, no, this

00:25:45.687 --> 00:25:47.020
is clearly where your hand goes.

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:47.940
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:48.618
Intuitive.

00:25:48.618 --> 00:25:49.993
Something where
it's clear, where

00:25:49.993 --> 00:25:52.034
you know how to interact
with it, engage with it.

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:55.990
Good design is unobtrusive.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:58.610
What does it mean
to be unobtrusive?

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:00.818
What do you mean about good
design being unobtrusive?

00:26:02.305 --> 00:26:03.680
AUDIENCE: Doesn't
get in the way?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:05.096
PROFESSOR: Doesn't
get in the way.

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:06.700
Who thinks this is true?

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.630
Who thinks this is not true?

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.803
Can you give me an example?

00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:12.344
AUDIENCE: I think
there are buildings

00:26:12.344 --> 00:26:14.657
that are very well designed
and they're very obtrusive.

00:26:14.657 --> 00:26:16.115
PROFESSOR: Obtrusive
buildings that

00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:18.160
are well designed but obtrusive.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:22.160
What does it mean in that
context to be obtrusive?

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.815
AUDIENCE: They can obstruct
traffic, other buildings,

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:28.810
other--

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:30.740
PROFESSOR: They could
be obtrusive in terms

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.404
of the visual line.

00:26:32.404 --> 00:26:33.820
Well some designs
are interesting.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.740
This design is somewhat
obtrusive, particularly

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.314
when it's being used.

00:26:44.314 --> 00:26:46.230
If anyone here has ever
been in an environment

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.100
where someone pulled
the fire alarm,

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:52.020
you'll know how obtrusive
a fire alarm can be.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.730
But it's pretty good
because it needs

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.660
to be at that time
and not now, which

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.368
is why it's trying to be
a little bit more quiet.

00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:01.742
It could be even better maybe
if we didn't see it at all.

00:27:01.742 --> 00:27:02.242
Maybe.

00:27:02.242 --> 00:27:02.960
I'm not sure.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.540
There must be a reason why
they all have to be red.

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:06.934
I don't know what
that reason is.

00:27:06.934 --> 00:27:08.767
AUDIENCE: I don't think
that premise applies

00:27:08.767 --> 00:27:11.177
when part of your design is
to make something obtrusive.

00:27:11.177 --> 00:27:13.510
PROFESSOR: When do you want
to make something obtrusive?

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.220
Give me an example.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.320
AUDIENCE: When you
have a fire alarm.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.820
PROFESSOR: Well
we're trying to make

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:18.320
it minimally obtrusive, right?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.611
They could've made it this big.

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.607
It could be coming
out of the wall.

00:27:25.607 --> 00:27:27.190
It could go off every
hour just to let

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:28.810
you know everything's cool.

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.750
What if they made
it half the size?

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:36.600
Or they could make
it even smaller.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.501
Wouldn't that be better?

00:27:39.501 --> 00:27:40.000
Maybe.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.294
OK.

00:27:41.294 --> 00:27:43.825
AUDIENCE: If you're Apple, yeah.

00:27:43.825 --> 00:27:45.200
PROFESSOR: Good
design is honest.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:45.700
Whoa.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:48.349
What does it mean to be
honest in your design?

00:27:48.349 --> 00:27:49.640
What does it mean to be honest?

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.556
Good design is honest.

00:27:54.312 --> 00:27:55.975
AUDIENCE: If something
looks like it's

00:27:55.975 --> 00:27:58.350
supposed to be doing a specific
thing it shouldn't do something

00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.830
else.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.760
PROFESSOR: So something looks
like it should do something,

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.301
it shouldn't be
doing something else.

00:28:02.301 --> 00:28:05.560
So I shouldn't walk up
to this and say, oh, you

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.570
got a beautiful door stop.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.340
I've been looking for
a door stop all day.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:13.812
What else?

00:28:13.812 --> 00:28:15.520
AUDIENCE: If it promises
to do something,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.519
it should do that thing.

00:28:16.519 --> 00:28:19.200
PROFESSOR: It should do the
thing it promises to do.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.650
AUDIENCE: It should abide by
all regulations and safety

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.245
conditions so it doesn't
hurt you in the process.

00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:24.870
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.703
It doesn't hurt you.

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.414
It protects the user.

00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:29.289
AUDIENCE: Does that mean
you should design it

00:28:29.289 --> 00:28:31.939
in an honest way, as in not
steal the design from somebody?

00:28:31.939 --> 00:28:33.355
PROFESSOR: That's
a good question.

00:28:33.355 --> 00:28:34.980
Should you design it
in an honest ways,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.269
as in not steal the design?

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.810
I don't know.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:37.726
We should ask Samsung.

00:28:40.495 --> 00:28:43.620
A little jab at that.

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:44.496
It's a good question.

00:28:44.496 --> 00:28:46.620
AUDIENCE: I just don't know
what it's referring to.

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.010
PROFESSOR: I don't either.

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:49.970
I think we can actually find out
more information now about it.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:51.039
But it's a good question.

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:52.330
What does it mean to be honest?

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.720
It might mean that as well.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.830
It can mean a lot of things
about what its intended use is.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:59.620
When I use it, does
it do what it's

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.078
supposed to do-- what
it promises to do?

00:29:03.078 --> 00:29:05.790
AUDIENCE: It can
also be adding more

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:09.787
than it needs to be--
like making a gold hammer.

00:29:09.787 --> 00:29:10.745
PROFESSOR: Gold hammer.

00:29:10.745 --> 00:29:14.542
So that gold toothbrush
that we saw from Napoleon.

00:29:14.542 --> 00:29:17.091
It may not be an honest design.

00:29:17.091 --> 00:29:17.840
Maybe it's silver.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.460
Silver toothbrush.

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.440
Can we think of an example
where this is not true?

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.350
Where design is dishonest?

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:27.610
Where you believe you
could do something with it,

00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:31.357
but you can't and
it's still good?

00:29:31.357 --> 00:29:33.190
AUDIENCE: For instance,
there's iPhone cases

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.575
that look like Game Boys.

00:29:34.575 --> 00:29:35.950
PROFESSOR: iPhone
cases that look

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:40.160
like Game Boys that make
it not look like an iPhone.

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.274
Is that dishonest?

00:29:42.274 --> 00:29:43.815
AUDIENCE: It might
be dishonest but I

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:45.673
think it's still good design.

00:29:45.673 --> 00:29:46.964
PROFESSOR: What about up there?

00:29:46.964 --> 00:29:49.807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:49.807 --> 00:29:50.890
PROFESSOR: Little outlets.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.922
You can't figure out how to get
this thing in til you turn it.

00:29:53.922 --> 00:29:54.630
Dishonest design.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.610
Who thinks that's
a dishonest design?

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.530
Who thinks it's an
honest design anyway?

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:01.147
Interesting.

00:30:01.147 --> 00:30:01.980
What about this one.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.930
What about childproof
bottle caps?

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:08.010
It looks like they
could be opened,

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:12.280
but if you are without the
skill, strength, or intellect,

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:15.610
then you won't be
able to open this.

00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:18.450
Childproof bottle caps don't
just affect children though.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.210
They can affect adults who
simply don't have the strength

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:22.960
to be able to open one of these
things-- to push down and open.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.810
So they have other designs
to get around that as well.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:28.105
But they're still a good design.

00:30:28.105 --> 00:30:30.370
But is that a bit dishonest?

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:33.070
To give a whole population the
idea that it can be opened,

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:35.050
but you can't open it?

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:36.650
I'm not sure.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.860
Good design is durable.

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.193
What does it mean to be durable?

00:30:39.193 --> 00:30:42.500
What does it actually
mean to be durable?

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.839
For the design to be durable.

00:30:45.839 --> 00:30:47.255
AUDIENCE: It's not
going to break.

00:30:47.255 --> 00:30:49.080
It's last.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.236
PROFESSOR: An object that will
last a decent amount of time.

00:30:52.236 --> 00:30:55.082
AUDIENCE: I mean for the
design to be timeless.

00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:56.790
PROFESSOR: For the
design to be timeless.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:57.998
What do you mean by timeless?

00:30:57.998 --> 00:31:00.723
AUDIENCE: It means that
five years from now it

00:31:00.723 --> 00:31:03.340
won't look antiquated
and out of touch.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.280
PROFESSOR: So years from
now, is it will still

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.774
look fresh and new and
novel contemporary.

00:31:08.774 --> 00:31:09.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:15.790
PROFESSOR: The idea that this
was the intended concept and it

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:18.463
will still feel like
it's appropriate.

00:31:18.463 --> 00:31:20.546
AUDIENCE: I feel like it's
sort of difficult to do

00:31:20.546 --> 00:31:21.577
that though because--

00:31:21.577 --> 00:31:22.410
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.324
Is it difficult?

00:31:24.324 --> 00:31:27.707
AUDIENCE: --people's ideas of
what they want change a lot.

00:31:27.707 --> 00:31:29.290
PROFESSOR: You say
that people's ideas

00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.350
of what they want change a lot.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.849
Tell us.

00:31:30.849 --> 00:31:34.103
AUDIENCE: Well, maybe not
a lot, but if you look back

00:31:34.103 --> 00:31:37.695
at older shows that were
predicting what the future was

00:31:37.695 --> 00:31:43.250
going to be like, they might
be spot on with the technology,

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.050
but the aesthetics
of things-- we

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:47.940
tend to have more rounded
corners on things.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:49.960
We don't like the
points as much anymore.

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:52.840
Things like that, that people
hadn't even considered back

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:56.850
then, are just taken for
granted now-- sort of.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.890
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.348
AUDIENCE: Well, I
mean, good design

00:31:59.348 --> 00:32:01.252
can be determined
after the fact.

00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:02.984
Maybe when you
make it, you don't

00:32:02.984 --> 00:32:04.108
know if it's a good design.

00:32:04.108 --> 00:32:06.942
And then after
tastes change and you

00:32:06.942 --> 00:32:08.120
are 10 years down the road--

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.340
PROFESSOR: You're able
to see if it's still

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.550
a good, sustainable,
relevant design later on.

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.640
Interesting.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:19.360
Good design is consequent
to the last detail.

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:21.540
Who thinks it's true?

00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:23.330
Who thinks it's false?

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:25.600
Who is unsure?

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.370
Who did not vote?

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.930
Let's try it again.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:33.550
Given your options, good
design is-- Let's clarify

00:32:33.550 --> 00:32:35.540
what it means.

00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:37.830
My mistake here.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:41.234
What does it mean to be
consequent to the last detail?

00:32:41.234 --> 00:32:44.276
AUDIENCE: Everything you
put in the design has

00:32:44.276 --> 00:32:45.182
the intended effect.

00:32:45.182 --> 00:32:47.140
PROFESSOR: Everything
you put in the design has

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:47.780
the intended effect.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.280
Everything.

00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:54.440
If you were going to give
me a written report--

00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.390
a big one-- give me some
aspects of that report

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:02.588
that you'd be concerned about.

00:33:02.588 --> 00:33:04.689
AUDIENCE: Whether or not
the content [INAUDIBLE] .

00:33:04.689 --> 00:33:05.480
PROFESSOR: Content.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.050
What else?

00:33:08.050 --> 00:33:08.930
AUDIENCE: Citations.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:09.805
PROFESSOR: Citations.

00:33:09.805 --> 00:33:10.490
What else?

00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:11.740
AUDIENCE: It's understandable.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.156
PROFESSOR: If it's
understandable.

00:33:13.156 --> 00:33:13.770
Comprehension.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:14.630
AUDIENCE: Format.

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:15.660
PROFESSOR: Format.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.192
So the--

00:33:17.192 --> 00:33:18.120
AUDIENCE: Structure.

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.161
PROFESSOR: The structure.

00:33:19.161 --> 00:33:19.704
What else?

00:33:19.704 --> 00:33:21.370
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say the format.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:22.430
PROFESSOR: Format.

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:23.217
What else?

00:33:23.217 --> 00:33:24.050
AUDIENCE: Font size.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:26.260
PROFESSOR: The font size.

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.620
And therefore, what else?

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:28.480
AUDIENCE: The font.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:29.581
PROFESSOR: The font.

00:33:29.581 --> 00:33:30.080
Absolutely.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.474
What else?

00:33:32.474 --> 00:33:34.410
AUDIENCE: Is it too wordy?

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:35.732
PROFESSOR: Length of words.

00:33:35.732 --> 00:33:37.190
AUDIENCE: The paper
it's on itself.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.520
PROFESSOR: The paper
it's on itself.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.020
Absolutely.

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:39.897
What else then?

00:33:39.897 --> 00:33:45.260
AUDIENCE: Does it fulfil
the task and requirements?

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.542
PROFESSOR: Does it fill
the task and requirements?

00:33:47.542 --> 00:33:48.625
We talked about the paper.

00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.276
I heard something else here.

00:33:50.276 --> 00:33:51.400
AUDIENCE: Color of the ink.

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.441
PROFESSOR: Color the ink.

00:33:52.441 --> 00:33:53.150
Absolutely.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.371
Color of the ink.

00:33:54.371 --> 00:33:56.920
AUDIENCE: When you present the
paper-- like if it's bound.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.180
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:33:57.180 --> 00:33:57.750
If it's bound.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:58.416
If it's stapled.

00:33:58.416 --> 00:33:59.780
How it's bound.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.742
All these things are details.

00:34:02.742 --> 00:34:03.950
Do you think they all matter?

00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:04.894
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:34:04.894 --> 00:34:06.810
PROFESSOR: Who thinks
if you take a paper that

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.665
has brilliant
content and a paper

00:34:08.665 --> 00:34:10.395
with the exact
same content-- two

00:34:10.395 --> 00:34:12.020
of them with the same
content-- and one

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:15.241
is stapled in the corner and
one is bound beautifully--

00:34:15.241 --> 00:34:17.449
do you think that they will
affect your grade at all?

00:34:17.449 --> 00:34:21.161
Who thinks it will
not affect your grade?

00:34:21.161 --> 00:34:23.600
Who thinks it will
affect your grade?

00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.170
That's good.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.129
Statistics show that it
will affect your grade.

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:28.669
Everyone who doesn't think that
it doesn't affect your grade,

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:30.929
you should make sure that
your papers are well bound--

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:33.489
because it looks to someone
else like you put more work

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.360
and effort into it
and that you believe

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.514
more sincerely in your product.

00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:40.972
AUDIENCE: A lot of that depends
on what the value system is

00:34:40.972 --> 00:34:43.084
that you're working on.

00:34:43.084 --> 00:34:44.584
If you don't actually
have the money

00:34:44.584 --> 00:34:47.044
or you don't want to spend
the money to bind that paper

00:34:47.044 --> 00:34:49.504
and you think that it's good
enough on its own then maybe

00:34:49.504 --> 00:34:51.472
the best design
isn't binding it.

00:34:51.472 --> 00:34:53.932
You might have a professor
who doesn't care.

00:34:53.932 --> 00:34:57.040
Given it's on average you
will score higher [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:57.790
PROFESSOR: So yes.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.590
You have a specific case
where it doesn't matter.

00:35:00.590 --> 00:35:01.549
That's true.

00:35:01.549 --> 00:35:04.090
AUDIENCE: I think you're talking
about high school teachers--

00:35:04.090 --> 00:35:06.465
that probably doesn't apply--
but once you start going

00:35:06.465 --> 00:35:08.590
into college and you're
looking at the true content

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.320
of the paper--

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.600
PROFESSOR: You think it
applies in high school

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:11.300
but not in college.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:12.716
AUDIENCE: I think it
applies less in college

00:35:12.716 --> 00:35:13.190
than it does in high school.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.500
PROFESSOR: I will tell
you this is not true.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.150
I will tell you from firsthand.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:20.230
And when I get a paper--
and I know this to be true--

00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:23.337
if anyone submits
their midterm report--

00:35:23.337 --> 00:35:25.170
their individual project--
and it is stapled

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:28.030
in the upper left hand corner,
you will with 100% certainly

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.210
be dropping the class
soon afterwards.

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:33.374
I've seen it every
single semester.

00:35:33.374 --> 00:35:35.290
Every semester, I'll get
at least one person--

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.850
and I'll say, please
do not do that--

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:38.986
and they will give it to
me anyway bound like that.

00:35:38.986 --> 00:35:40.610
And I just suddenly
have to count to 10

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.060
before they drop the class.

00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.354
AUDIENCE: But do you ask
them not to staple it?

00:35:44.354 --> 00:35:45.770
PROFESSOR: I say,
please don't use

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:47.630
a staple in the upper
left hand corner.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:48.914
And they do it anyway.

00:35:48.914 --> 00:35:50.580
There's a high
correlation between this.

00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:53.530
And teachers, when you get
that beautifully bound thing,

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.996
you think, wow, look
how cool this is.

00:35:55.996 --> 00:35:57.620
If you could sit in
those rooms, you'll

00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.780
think there is a difference.

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:00.430
And of course, they will
read the content as well.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:02.700
It's not that it's going
to make up for bad content.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.870
But it shows a lot more
strength and structure.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:06.870
And their brain will start
focusing a little bit

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:10.087
differently when they
review that paper.

00:36:10.087 --> 00:36:11.420
Consequently to the last detail.

00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:15.300
Who thinks that good design is
consequent to the last detail?

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.110
Who thinks it is not?

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:18.643
Why not?

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.476
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean,
it's the same thing.

00:36:20.476 --> 00:36:21.975
It's just like, you
have to consider

00:36:21.975 --> 00:36:23.410
what the audience will do.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.619
You need to knowledge the
value of that extra detail.

00:36:25.619 --> 00:36:27.410
If they don't value
it, like if you're just

00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:30.011
trying to feed a lot of people
and they're just incredibly

00:36:30.011 --> 00:36:32.866
hungry-- if you are trying to
feed a starving population,

00:36:32.866 --> 00:36:34.657
they're not going to
care that you seasoned

00:36:34.657 --> 00:36:36.613
the food that you've
made exactly perfectly.

00:36:36.613 --> 00:36:38.080
They're going to care once
they get something to eat

00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.070
and they get more of it.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:40.610
PROFESSOR: What if you
could season it perfectly?

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:41.430
Would that be better design?

00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:41.893
AUDIENCE: Well,
that would be great,

00:36:41.893 --> 00:36:43.392
but that's not the
world we live in.

00:36:43.392 --> 00:36:45.140
We live in a world
with limitations

00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:45.765
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:36:45.765 --> 00:36:47.030
We do live with limitations.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:49.450
But the question I would
ask you to think about

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:52.560
is when are those
limitations real

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:55.820
and when do we impose them
on ourselves unnecessarily?

00:36:55.820 --> 00:37:00.730
When do we think, well, we can't
do this, instead of thinking,

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.976
well, maybe we can't do this--
let's see if we can do it.

00:37:03.976 --> 00:37:05.850
You'll find a tremendous
amount of innovation

00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:11.940
happens when we resolve
the tension between what?

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.950
From last class.

00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:15.254
AUDIENCE: From what we desire?

00:37:15.254 --> 00:37:15.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.586
From what we desire
and what we require.

00:37:17.586 --> 00:37:19.580
If we can resolve
these tensions,

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:22.020
that is where we get innovation.

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.404
Absolutely.

00:37:23.404 --> 00:37:25.320
Good design is concerned
with the environment.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.070
What does it mean?

00:37:32.251 --> 00:37:36.745
AUDIENCE: Good design
doesn't neglect anything.

00:37:36.745 --> 00:37:37.370
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:40.550
Good design isn't just sitting
in its own little vacuum.

00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:43.700
It works within a whole
system, a whole big context

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.850
of things, whether it's
a physical environment,

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:50.350
a social environment,
or, like the iPod player,

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:52.780
works with the
iTunes Music Store.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.440
It connects to other things.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.860
Lastly, good design is as
little design as possible.

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.850
What does that mean?

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:07.260
AUDIENCE: I think
to use other things,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:12.343
like how Apple used
previous designs.

00:38:12.343 --> 00:38:15.170
So maybe they didn't have
to redesign that much.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.200
PROFESSOR: So she's
saying less design.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.280
Not as much redesign.

00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.867
What other interpretations
do we have?

00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:21.000
AUDIENCE: Keep it simple.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.361
PROFESSOR: To keep it simple.

00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:22.860
What else?

00:38:25.906 --> 00:38:27.780
AUDIENCE: Going back to
the example of Apple,

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.429
they try to limit the number
of buttons that you have.

00:38:30.429 --> 00:38:31.970
PROFESSOR: Try and
limit our buttons.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:32.469
Yes.

00:38:32.469 --> 00:38:34.008
AUDIENCE: And also
with the mouse.

00:38:34.008 --> 00:38:35.750
Let's use the Magic
Mouse for example.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.030
There is no button like
there are with other mice.

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.071
There aren't two buttons.

00:38:39.071 --> 00:38:40.670
It's just one
click that you use.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.169
And it's very intuitive to
how you're going to use it.

00:38:43.169 --> 00:38:45.460
PROFESSOR: So a Magic Mouse
has no buttons on it at all

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.259
and you can still click anyway.

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.550
And it knows what you're doing.

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.087
They're just trying to
reduce that user experience.

00:38:53.087 --> 00:38:54.795
But they had a lot
more complexity inside

00:38:54.795 --> 00:38:57.150
to figure out how
to make that work.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:58.522
What else?

00:38:58.522 --> 00:39:01.746
AUDIENCE: I think the
design is as little design

00:39:01.746 --> 00:39:04.474
as possible as in off
of previous designs,

00:39:04.474 --> 00:39:05.922
like going back to Dieter Rams.

00:39:05.922 --> 00:39:07.130
PROFESSOR: Dieter Rams' work.

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:07.640
Absolutely.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.960
Where he's really trying
to get that functionalist--

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:12.501
let's think about the functions
first and really build things

00:39:12.501 --> 00:39:14.780
around in the simplest most
streamlined, elegant way

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.550
possible.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.075
I want to consider these steps.

00:39:18.075 --> 00:39:20.700
Part of your homework will be to
consider if these are all true

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:23.080
and reflect on them and see
how they can be improved

00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.624
and which ones are missing.

00:39:24.624 --> 00:39:27.290
I bet you're going to be able to
think of ones that are missing.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:33.030
Design challenge.

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:34.890
Are you ready?

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:35.780
Are you ready?

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.420
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:40.000
PROFESSOR: I'll take that.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:40.647
Here we go.

00:39:40.647 --> 00:39:41.230
Are you ready?

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.000
This is what you know.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:47.790
The music stops.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:49.400
A man is dead.

00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:50.662
That's all you know.

00:39:50.662 --> 00:39:53.580
You need to solve what
happened and why did it happen.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:55.000
And I will answer questions.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.960
I will say, yes.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:56.990
Or I will say, no.

00:39:56.990 --> 00:40:00.220
Or I will say, Relevant.

00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:02.640
That's what you get.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.480
And we need to do this quickly.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:05.980
Go.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:08.000
AUDIENCE: Was the man
listening to the music?

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.136
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:10.136 --> 00:40:11.440
AUDIENCE: Was he blindfolded?

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.100
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:18.579
If you happen to know
this particular question.

00:40:18.579 --> 00:40:19.370
Was he blindfolded?

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.920
Yes.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.160
AUDIENCE: Did he die
because the music stopped?

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.160
PROFESSOR: Did he die
because the music stopped?

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.778
No.

00:40:25.778 --> 00:40:29.974
AUDIENCE: Is this a human
man who actually died and was

00:40:29.974 --> 00:40:31.912
living and then now
is no longer living?

00:40:31.912 --> 00:40:34.120
PROFESSOR: Was it a human
man who died who was living

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120
and is no longer living.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.160
Yes.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.100
AUDIENCE: Did the music
give instructions?

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.891
PROFESSOR: Did the
music give instructions?

00:40:40.891 --> 00:40:42.252
No.

00:40:42.252 --> 00:40:44.570
AUDIENCE: Did he die while
the music was playing?

00:40:44.570 --> 00:40:46.653
PROFESSOR: Did he die while
the music was playing?

00:40:46.653 --> 00:40:48.620
No.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:50.110
AUDIENCE: Where'd this happen?

00:40:50.110 --> 00:40:51.665
PROFESSOR: Where
did this happen?

00:40:51.665 --> 00:40:53.290
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1:
Yes or no questions.

00:40:55.914 --> 00:40:57.664
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2:
Does the music stopping

00:40:57.664 --> 00:41:01.080
coincide with the man's death?

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.867
PROFESSOR: The music stopped and
coincided with the man's death.

00:41:03.867 --> 00:41:04.700
What's the question?

00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:08.892
AUDIENCE: Did the music
coincide with the man's death?

00:41:08.892 --> 00:41:10.850
PROFESSOR: I don't know
how to answer that one.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:13.220
Give me some more detail
around the question.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.290
AUDIENCE: Did they
happen at the same time?

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:16.110
PROFESSOR: No.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:17.485
Did they happen
at the same time?

00:41:17.485 --> 00:41:18.252
No.

00:41:18.252 --> 00:41:19.370
AUDIENCE: Was he alone?

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.370
PROFESSOR: Was he alone?

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:21.460
No.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:23.168
AUDIENCE: Did the
music stopping indicate

00:41:23.168 --> 00:41:24.293
something else is starting?

00:41:24.293 --> 00:41:26.710
PROFESSOR: Did the
music stopping indicate

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:27.935
something else is starting?

AUDIENCE: Did the music
start in relation to

00:41:56.780 --> 00:41:58.756
that the man was dead?

00:41:58.756 --> 00:41:59.860

00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.068
AUDIENCE: Did the music
start in relation to the fact

00:42:02.068 --> 00:42:03.180
that the man was dead?

AUDIENCE: Did the man have
a preexisting condition?

00:42:25.207 --> 00:42:27.290
PROFESSOR: Do the man have
a preexisting condition

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.740
that was not covered
under the health code?

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.239
No.

00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:32.044
He did not have a
preexisting condition.

00:42:32.044 --> 00:42:34.190

00:44:36.742 --> 00:44:37.840
PROFESSOR: Is the music a?

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:38.650
AUDIENCE: A name.

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:39.270
PROFESSOR: A name.

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.240
AUDIENCE: Of something.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.600
PROFESSOR: Of something.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:42.998
I don't know what that means.

00:44:42.998 --> 00:44:43.934
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1:
Is it not music?

00:44:43.934 --> 00:44:45.338
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2: He
means is there a track

00:44:45.338 --> 00:44:46.274
called "The Music."

00:44:46.274 --> 00:44:47.080
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.360
No.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:49.860
Thank you.

00:44:53.131 --> 00:44:53.630
It's hard.

00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:55.854
It's not that hard.

00:44:55.854 --> 00:44:57.770
AUDIENCE: Was the man
in control of the music?

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.728
PROFESSOR: Was the man
in control of the music?

00:44:59.728 --> 00:45:01.640
No.

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:04.542
AUDIENCE: Is the music relevant
to the man's death at all?

00:45:04.542 --> 00:45:07.000
PROFESSOR: Is the music relevant
at all to the man's death?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:07.500
Yes.

00:45:10.015 --> 00:45:12.105
AUDIENCE: Did someone
try to stop his death?

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:14.875
PROFESSOR: Did someone
try to stop his death?

00:45:14.875 --> 00:45:15.375
Irrelevant.

00:45:18.408 --> 00:45:19.760
AUDIENCE: Did he want to die?

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.336
PROFESSOR: Did the
man want to die?

00:45:21.336 --> 00:45:21.836
No.

00:45:24.942 --> 00:45:26.525
AUDIENCE: Is the
song that was playing

00:45:26.525 --> 00:45:28.470
relevant to the man's death?

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.120
PROFESSOR: Is the
song that was playing

00:45:30.120 --> 00:45:31.425
relevant to the man's death?

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.961
-ish.

00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:40.202
Sorry to break the format.

00:45:40.202 --> 00:45:43.070
AUDIENCE: So is it an internal
injury that killed him?

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.320
An external injury
would be like a trauma,

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:55.248
whereas an internal injury
would be like a heart attack.

00:45:55.248 --> 00:45:58.339
I'm trying to figure
out the way he died.

00:45:58.339 --> 00:46:00.130
PROFESSOR: Ask me a
very specific question.

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.630
AUDIENCE: Was it
an internal injury?

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:06.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:09.297
Did he die of a heart attack?

00:46:09.297 --> 00:46:09.880
PROFESSOR: No.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.046
AUDIENCE MEMBER 1: A stroke?

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.730
AUDIENCE MEMBER 2:
Something hit him?

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:16.355
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:16.355 --> 00:46:18.050
AUDIENCE: An ice
cream truck hit him.

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:20.344
PROFESSOR: No.

00:46:20.344 --> 00:46:21.260
Did something hit him?

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:21.600
Yes.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:22.460
Did an ice cream truck hit him?

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:23.219
No.

00:46:23.219 --> 00:46:24.135
But that's very funny.

00:46:26.145 --> 00:46:28.520
AUDIENCE: Was the thing that
hit him intended to hit him?

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.846
PROFESSOR: Was the thing that
hit him intended to hit him?

00:46:31.846 --> 00:46:32.345
No.

00:46:36.015 --> 00:46:39.068
AUDIENCE: Did the music
player fall on the guy?

00:46:39.068 --> 00:46:41.234
PROFESSOR: The music player
did not fall on the guy.

00:46:41.234 --> 00:46:42.692
AUDIENCE: Since he
was blindfolded,

00:46:42.692 --> 00:46:47.814
was he to guide himself
in a certain direction?

00:46:47.814 --> 00:46:49.230
PROFESSOR: Ask the
question again.

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:50.688
AUDIENCE: Since he
was blindfolded,

00:46:50.688 --> 00:46:52.789
was he using the music
as a way to guide himself

00:46:52.789 --> 00:46:54.080
towards or away from something?

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:56.730
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.932
She asked the question was
the music guiding him--

00:46:58.932 --> 00:47:00.890
AUDIENCE: Was he using
the music to guide him--

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:02.848
PROFESSOR: Was he using
the music to guide him?

00:47:02.848 --> 00:47:03.454
Yes.

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:05.370
AUDIENCE: Is the man a
performer of some sort?

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:06.786
PROFESSOR: Is the
man a performer?

00:47:06.786 --> 00:47:08.258
Yes.

00:47:08.258 --> 00:47:10.570
AUDIENCE: Was he a
tightrope walker?

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.705
PROFESSOR: Was he
a tightrope walker?

00:47:12.705 --> 00:47:13.205
Yes.

00:47:17.035 --> 00:47:18.392
AUDIENCE: Did he fall?

00:47:18.392 --> 00:47:19.350
PROFESSOR: Did he fall?

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:19.849
Yes.

00:47:23.539 --> 00:47:25.080
AUDIENCE: Was the
man using the music

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.038
to guide himself blindfolded
across the tightrope

00:47:28.038 --> 00:47:30.435
and then the music
stopped and he fell off?

00:47:30.435 --> 00:47:32.560
PROFESSOR: Was the man
using the music to guide him

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.720
across the tightrope--

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:34.440
AUDIENCE: While he
was blindfolded.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.023
PROFESSOR: --while
he was blindfolded.

00:47:36.023 --> 00:47:37.988
And what was the next part?

00:47:37.988 --> 00:47:39.740
AUDIENCE: The music
stopped so he couldn't

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.060
find where he was going
so then he fell off.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:41.820
PROFESSOR: The
music stopped so he

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.290
couldn't find
where he was going.

00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:44.486
And therefore, he fall off.

00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:44.985
No.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.520
So close.

00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:51.920
AUDIENCE: Was he supposed to
jump into a net and missed?

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.080
PROFESSOR: We he supposed to
jump into a net and missed?

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:53.580
No.

00:47:56.045 --> 00:47:57.670
AUDIENCE: Did the
speakers fall on him?

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:58.270
PROFESSOR: Did the
speakers fall on him?

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.105
No.

00:47:59.105 --> 00:48:00.480
AUDIENCE: Was he
using the number

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:02.350
of beats to traverse
the tightrope?

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.300
PROFESSOR: Was using
the number of beats

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.383
to traverse the tightrope?

00:48:04.383 --> 00:48:05.120
No.

00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:08.632
AUDIENCE: Was the tightrope
the wire for the music player?

00:48:08.632 --> 00:48:11.090
PROFESSOR: Was the tightrope
the wire for the music player?

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:11.910
Very creative.

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:14.120
No.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:16.744
AUDIENCE: Was the music supposed
to stop when he was at the end

00:48:16.744 --> 00:48:18.031
but it stopped early?

00:48:18.031 --> 00:48:19.406
PROFESSOR: Was
the music supposed

00:48:19.406 --> 00:48:21.230
to be stopped when
he got to the end?

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:22.619
Yes.

00:48:22.619 --> 00:48:23.660
And that's what happened.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.390
So he's walking on a tightrope.

00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:31.056
And all of a sudden--
he's blindfolded--

00:48:31.056 --> 00:48:34.362
and the music stops, so he
figures he's at the end.

00:48:34.362 --> 00:48:37.150
And he just steps off.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.900
But he wasn't at the end.

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.696
And there was no net.

00:48:40.696 --> 00:48:45.020
And he fell to his death
where the ground hit him.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.430
[AUDIENCE DISGRUNTLEMENT]

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:49.954
You said, did something hit him.

00:48:49.954 --> 00:48:50.454
Yes.

00:48:50.454 --> 00:48:51.204
Something hit him.

00:48:53.970 --> 00:48:54.650
I didn't lie.

00:48:54.650 --> 00:48:55.846
Something did hit him.

00:48:55.846 --> 00:48:57.220
AUDIENCE: He hit the ground.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.350
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:00.430
I'm sorry.

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.371
You've all taken physics.

00:49:03.371 --> 00:49:05.370
The ground hit him as
much as he hit the ground.

00:49:05.370 --> 00:49:06.203
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.639
PROFESSOR: He wasn't dead.

00:49:11.639 --> 00:49:12.430
He was still alive.

00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.263
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:15.507 --> 00:49:17.340
PROFESSOR: The music
stopped before he died.

00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:19.330
AUDIENCE: Because arguably, he
died when he hit the concrete.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:19.710
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:20.210
No.

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.640
I answered the questions
very specifically each time.

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:24.910
In fact, we have all
the questions, here,

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.110
that you asked.

00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:29.970
Any ones in particular
that were of note?

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:32.760
So what's very interesting
here is about asking questions.

00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.560
And it leads us
into what we want

00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:37.570
to talk about here
with research.

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:39.420
Asking good questions
is really hard.

00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.350
And when you ask
questions, sometimes you

00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:43.400
find you're going down a path
that's giving you information.

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:44.410
Sometimes you don't.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:48.761
Often the first question I
get asked was, was he outside?

00:49:48.761 --> 00:49:49.260
No.

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.134
Was he in a building.

00:49:50.134 --> 00:49:51.010
Yes.

00:49:51.010 --> 00:49:53.305
What comes to your
mind as someone

00:49:53.305 --> 00:49:54.636
said he was in a building?

00:49:54.636 --> 00:49:55.490
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:49:55.490 --> 00:49:56.210
PROFESSOR: You'd think
an office building.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.790
Right?

00:49:56.790 --> 00:49:59.740
You wouldn't think
a tent or a circus.

00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.290
That's a building.

00:50:01.290 --> 00:50:02.570
It's a structure.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:06.240
If I said no to building, would
I have to say yes to tent?

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.120
Like at some point if
I'm being very binary.

00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.670
So asking questions
is very hard.

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.253
You see any ones
that you're skimming?

00:50:12.657 --> 00:50:14.990
QUESTION TYPER: The internal
injury one was really good.

00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.625
PROFESSOR: Internal injuries.

00:50:15.625 --> 00:50:17.950
QUESTION TYPER: That put
them in the right direction.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:18.670
PROFESSOR: Hitting the ground.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.628
So when you said, did
something hit him-- well,

00:50:20.628 --> 00:50:21.587
yes, something hit him.

00:50:21.587 --> 00:50:23.420
But it doesn't tell you
about the direction.

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:23.810
Right?

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:24.880
And now you're
beginning to think

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.130
an ice cream truck struck him.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:27.220
And this makes sense.

00:50:27.220 --> 00:50:29.050
What you did is exactly right.

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:31.770
All this is exactly what you
should be thinking about.

00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:34.220
But it shows us, given some
data-- think about when you're

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:37.250
asking questions-- you can
get the exact, truthful, right

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:41.040
answer and still be radically
incorrect about what

00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:44.216
you understand from this.

00:50:44.216 --> 00:50:45.840
That was a little
induction to research

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.690
here, complete with formula.

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:53.060
So research.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:54.090
Just a basic thing.

00:50:54.090 --> 00:50:56.215
You want to ask questions
and find out about stuff.

00:50:56.215 --> 00:51:00.540
Asking questions is important,
but answers can be misleading.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.680
Academic and scientific
research is often wrong.

00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.500
We think it's the
truth when we read it.

00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:09.070
And maybe it's truthful.

00:51:09.070 --> 00:51:10.290
Many of them are very good.

00:51:10.290 --> 00:51:12.520
But often they're wrong.

00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:16.000
And we base beliefs and make
conclusions and decisions

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.789
based on faulty information.

00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:19.330
Which gets us back
to the first thing

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:21.413
I talked to you about on
the first day, which was?

00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:24.950
To do what?

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:25.680
The first thing.

00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:25.920
AUDIENCE: Ask the
right question.

00:51:25.920 --> 00:51:27.450
PROFESSOR: To ask why.

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:30.030
To make sure that we're getting
to the underlying reasons.

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:32.440
Because that may be wrong.

00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.470
Research results may be good but
the conclusions may be wrong.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:37.870
So here we had great research.

00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:39.320
The question was, did he
die of internal injuries.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:39.820
Yes.

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.736
Did something hit him?

00:51:40.736 --> 00:51:41.260
Yes.

00:51:41.260 --> 00:51:42.340
What did we conclude?

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.300
That something hit him--
that he was stationary.

00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:46.190
Easy to do.

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.300
This is Fitts' Law.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.430
It's pretty cool.

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:52.367
I won't bother
explaining it right now.

00:51:52.367 --> 00:51:53.200
It's so interesting.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.830
It's used a lot in computer
and human interaction.

00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.155
I'll give you the basic idea.

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:05.600
This distance is D. And I
think, here in the formula,

00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.290
this is W, which really
talks about-- actually,

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:12.240
that's Ws here and Ws here.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.640
It's a margin of
error, technically.

00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.520
But here it's a width.

00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:18.540
And what he would do
is he'd say, look,

00:52:18.540 --> 00:52:20.601
we can have people doing
something like tapping.

00:52:20.601 --> 00:52:21.100
Here.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:21.799
Here.

00:52:21.799 --> 00:52:22.590
As fast as you can.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.210
Now if I take those
lines and I change them.

00:52:31.210 --> 00:52:34.320
I'm going to make
them like this.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.610
So that's one.

00:52:35.610 --> 00:52:37.850
I do this.

00:52:37.850 --> 00:52:39.390
Faster.

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:40.190
What if I do this?

00:52:48.180 --> 00:52:48.866
Pretty good.

00:52:48.866 --> 00:52:49.610
Pretty good.

00:52:49.610 --> 00:52:51.100
And so I'm pretty
good with that.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.220
But my speed changed.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:56.570
And if I wanted to go faster,
my accuracy would go down.

00:52:56.570 --> 00:52:58.810
So what can we
conclude from this?

00:52:58.810 --> 00:52:59.875
Lots of things.

00:52:59.875 --> 00:53:01.916
Somethings that are very
good and somethings that

00:53:01.916 --> 00:53:02.885
are incorrect.

00:53:02.885 --> 00:53:03.940
One conclusion.

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:05.820
If I work on a computer
system that just

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.070
has a keyboard and
no mice at all.

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:12.430
And it's now 1985, 1986.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:15.570
Should I use a graphical
user interface or not?

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:18.262
Well the incorrect conclusion
might be it will slow you down.

00:53:18.262 --> 00:53:20.220
Because every time you
move your hand over-- we

00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:21.110
can calculate it out.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.110
How long it's going to
take you for every action

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.299
that requires you
to use a mouse.

00:53:25.299 --> 00:53:27.340
And so we don't want to
have people slowing down.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:30.760
We're going to keep everything
using keyboard commands.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.420
But it may not be true that
it's going to make you faster.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.189
That's an incorrect conclusion--
maybe given that same system.

00:53:37.189 --> 00:53:38.730
But maybe if you
redesign the system,

00:53:38.730 --> 00:53:40.000
it will actually become
a system that you

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.910
can use faster because
you can use the mouse

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:44.096
to be able to do things
you couldn't do before.

00:53:44.096 --> 00:53:45.720
And the correct
conclusion that we draw

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.739
is the right click
for a pop-up menu--

00:53:48.739 --> 00:53:51.280
you right click on something
and then the menu's right there.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:53.290
So now you've moved
your hand to the mouse.

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:54.795
You move your mouse
to the target.

00:53:54.795 --> 00:53:56.020
And you right click on it.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.900
And now you have a
menu that's contextual,

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.234
that's short and easy to get to.

00:53:59.234 --> 00:54:01.358
Instead of moving your
mouse all the way to the top

00:54:01.358 --> 00:54:03.990
to a big menu bar and having to
find your way through cascading

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:05.740
menus.

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:08.050
That is the correct use of it.

00:54:08.050 --> 00:54:10.790
Research results may be good
but conclusions may be wrong.

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.600
So when you see a really good
research piece like this,

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.630
understand that what you do
with that is really important.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.990
We design projects for people.

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:22.730
People don't know
what they want often.

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:25.560
I could say, do you want
to have a device that's

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.645
this big and flat and has a
keyboard on it that's virtual

00:54:28.645 --> 00:54:29.610
and all the stuff.

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:31.260
You might say, nah,
I don't want that.

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:34.460
In fact, when the iPad
came out, the week

00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:37.510
beforehand or two weeks
before I had pre-ordered it

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.230
because I had to be
really cool and wanted it.

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:44.705
And my classmates were
saying, oh that's ridiculous.

00:54:44.705 --> 00:54:46.400
I said, why is it ridiculous?

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.290
Well, it's like a bigger
iPhone and you don't need that.

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.900
And I'm like I think
it's different.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.266
They said, no, it's
just a bigger iPhone.

00:54:54.266 --> 00:54:55.390
We're not going to get one.

00:54:55.390 --> 00:54:57.598
Well within a month, of
course, a whole bunch of them

00:54:57.598 --> 00:54:59.790
are ordering them because
they saw it was different.

00:54:59.790 --> 00:55:01.706
But if you asked them--
if you said, would you

00:55:01.706 --> 00:55:06.370
like to pay $600 or $800
for an object like this,

00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:08.430
they might have said, no.

00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:11.330
And then they never
would've made an iPad.

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:13.720
It's very hard to ask
people what they want.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.450
And if they know what they want,
they often can't articulate it.

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:20.670
They don't know what words
to use to convey the idea.

00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:22.506
So as a designer
when you research,

00:55:22.506 --> 00:55:24.880
how you ask questions, how
you interpret people's answers

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.671
is really critical.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:33.675
I'd like to show you
this video about why

00:55:33.675 --> 00:55:38.270
it can be hard to
get good answers when

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:40.190
you ask a question.

00:55:40.190 --> 00:55:43.500
This video is for a game
show called the Family Feud.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.190
Who does not know the show?

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:47.650
Briefly, here's how it works.

00:55:47.650 --> 00:55:49.080
They have parts
of the show where

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.855
they ask people-- 100 people
get surveyed-- they'll ask them

00:55:52.855 --> 00:55:56.990
a question like,
what would you expect

00:55:56.990 --> 00:56:00.500
to find in a refrigerator?

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.990
And you want to guess
the most popular answer

00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:05.360
because that will be the
number of points you get.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.666
So what would you answer?

00:56:06.666 --> 00:56:07.394
AUDIENCE: Milk.

00:56:07.394 --> 00:56:08.060
PROFESSOR: Milk.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:11.090
Milk is the most popular answer.

00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:13.270
And so this is a speed
round at the end where

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:15.300
they have two different teams.

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:18.150
And this one person comes
over and he's looking away

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:21.870
from the board and this guy asks
him these questions in a row.

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:23.620
It's like five questions.

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:25.910
One of them is
the milk question.

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:29.230
You're asking this person
who's on a game show-- average

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:31.530
person, answering questions.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.170
He happens to be under pressure
because he's on a game show.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:35.211
You'll see his responses.

00:56:37.967 --> 00:56:39.800
I'm just going to roll
this for a little bit

00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.174
and then we're going to show
you the second part of this.

00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:50.336
HOST (ON SCREEN): Name an animal
with three letters in its name.

00:56:52.982 --> 00:56:54.760
CONTESTANT 1 (ON SCREEN): Frog.

00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.926
HOST (ON SCREEN): Something
found in a refrigerator.

00:56:56.926 --> 00:56:58.220
CONTESTANT 1 (ON SCREEN): Milk.

00:56:58.220 --> 00:56:59.530
HOST (ON SCREEN): A
brand of gasoline.

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:00.290
CONTESTANT 1 (ON
SCREEN): Regular.

00:57:00.290 --> 00:57:03.110
HOST (ON SCREEN): Something
that comes with a summer storm.

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:04.500
CONTESTANT 1 (ON SCREEN): Snow.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:06.500
HOST (ON SCREEN): A sport
with an all-star game.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.710
[BUZZER]

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.210
Turn around.

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.960
You may never be up here again.

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.704
Let's take a look.

00:57:12.704 --> 00:57:15.692
Name an animal with three
letters in its name.

00:57:15.692 --> 00:57:17.684
You said, frog.

00:57:17.684 --> 00:57:20.174
Our survey said 0.

00:57:20.174 --> 00:57:22.420
Two people would
have to say that.

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.330
Something found
in a refrigerator.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:26.182
You said, milk.

00:57:26.182 --> 00:57:29.910
Our survey said 28.

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:32.920
A brand of gasoline we wanted.

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.267
You said, regular.

00:57:35.267 --> 00:57:36.245
That's a good brand.

00:57:36.245 --> 00:57:37.710
Our survey said.

00:57:37.710 --> 00:57:39.668
CONTESTANT 1 (ON SCREEN):
It's the brand I use.

00:57:39.668 --> 00:57:42.126
HOST (ON SCREEN): Something
that comes with a summer storm.

00:57:42.126 --> 00:57:46.702
You gave me the answer snow.

00:57:46.702 --> 00:57:48.100
Our survey said.

00:57:50.222 --> 00:57:51.930
PROFESSOR: So you saw
what happened here.

00:57:51.930 --> 00:57:54.350
This person is trying to answer
questions under pressure.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:56.308
He's trying to provide
the best answers he can.

00:57:56.308 --> 00:57:58.010
An animal with three letters.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:58.510
Frog.

00:58:01.690 --> 00:58:04.451
I can see maybe-- it's
a short word, right?

00:58:04.451 --> 00:58:05.700
Something in the refrigerator.

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:06.220
We got milk.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:06.530
You all got milk.

00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:07.430
You were great.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:08.900
A brand of gasoline.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.630
Regular.

00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:15.190
He thought regular
is the brand instead

00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:17.710
of Shell or Mobil
or something else.

00:58:17.710 --> 00:58:21.550
That's what he associated
with that area.

00:58:21.550 --> 00:58:25.410
Something that comes
with a summer storm.

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:25.910
Snow.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:30.890
It doesn't happen
in the summer, I

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:33.250
think, for most
parts of the world.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:34.450
Certainly not here.

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:38.480
But his reaction was to supply
an answer that wasn't useful,

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:40.230
even though he probably
would know things.

00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:42.570
But under pressure,
not easy for him

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.820
to be able to come
up with good answers.

00:58:44.820 --> 00:58:48.832
Let's continue this
and watch his opponent.

00:58:48.832 --> 00:58:51.202
HOST (ON SCREEN): I got
good news and bad news.

00:58:51.202 --> 00:58:52.630
CONTESTANT 2 (ON SCREEN):
Give me the bad news first.

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.004
HOST (ON SCREEN):
The bad news is

00:58:54.004 --> 00:58:57.740
you need 172 points
to win the money.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.136
The good news is you're
the man to do it.

00:59:00.136 --> 00:59:01.760
I'm going to ask you
the same questions

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.676
I asked the other Bob.

00:59:02.676 --> 00:59:06.386
You cannot and you do not
want to duplicate his answers.

00:59:06.386 --> 00:59:07.883
If you do, you hear this.

00:59:07.883 --> 00:59:08.881
[BUZZER]

00:59:08.881 --> 00:59:10.377
What noise do we hear?

00:59:10.377 --> 00:59:10.877
[BUZZER]

00:59:10.877 --> 00:59:12.380
Thank you.

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.464
I will then say try again.

00:59:13.464 --> 00:59:14.713
You'll give me another answer.

00:59:14.713 --> 00:59:15.480
Alright?

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.555
Remind everyone, to
Bob's shame, the answers

00:59:17.555 --> 00:59:22.530
he gave us and give me 20
seconds on the clock, please.

00:59:22.530 --> 00:59:26.050
Name an animal with three
letters in its name.

HOST (ON SCREEN): Try again.

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:35.230
CONTESTANT 2 (ON SCREEN): Ice.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:37.131
HOST (ON SCREEN): A
brand of gasoline.

CONTESTANT 2 (ON
SCREEN): Football.

00:59:47.646 --> 00:59:48.042
HOST (ON SCREEN): Football.

00:59:48.042 --> 00:59:49.208
You've got to give him that.

00:59:55.582 --> 00:59:59.550
Any man that says alligator,
you've got to give it.

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:02.774
Name an animal with three
letters in its name.

01:00:02.774 --> 01:00:05.998
You said, alligator.

01:00:05.998 --> 01:00:07.486
Our survey said.

01:00:18.886 --> 01:00:19.886
You don't use narcotics.

01:00:19.886 --> 01:00:21.154
Do you?

01:00:21.154 --> 01:00:22.862
CONTESTANT 2 (ON
SCREEN): No, but I will.

01:00:22.862 --> 01:00:24.903
HOST (ON SCREEN): I mean,
I thought frog was bad.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:34.270
I thought frog was
a disastrous answer

01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:36.750
until you came up
with alligator.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.734
It's a real tough one.

01:00:38.734 --> 01:00:41.214
Dog was the number one answer.

01:00:41.214 --> 01:00:43.198
Dog.

01:00:43.198 --> 01:00:45.190
CONTESTANT 2 (ON SCREEN):
Are you sure it was?

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:47.065
HOST (ON SCREEN): Three
letters in it's name.

01:00:47.065 --> 01:00:47.746

[CHATTERING]

01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:53.698
HOST (ON SCREEN): And
we wanted something

01:00:53.698 --> 01:00:55.682
found in a refrigerator.

01:00:55.682 --> 01:00:58.162
You both had this
nailed down very well.

01:00:58.162 --> 01:01:00.572
Unfortunately, you repeated
his answer, which was milk.

01:01:00.572 --> 01:01:03.524
But you said, ice.

01:01:03.524 --> 01:01:05.000
That's the place to find it.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.476
Our survey said 17.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.888
Milk was the number one answer.

01:01:11.888 --> 01:01:14.348
It was the only good
thing that Bob did.

01:01:14.348 --> 01:01:16.808
A brand of gasoline we asked.

01:01:16.808 --> 01:01:18.344
You said, ethyl.

01:01:18.344 --> 01:01:19.760
CONTESTANT 2 (ON
SCREEN): A brand.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.652
HOST (ON SCREEN): A brand which
I think you've been drinking.

01:01:22.652 --> 01:01:26.580
Our survey said.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:28.053
The number one answer was Shell.

01:01:28.053 --> 01:01:29.530
CONTESTANT 2 (ON SCREEN): Shell.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:31.988
HOST (ON SCREEN): Something
that comes with a summer storm.

01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.155
At least you have reached.

01:01:33.155 --> 01:01:34.261
Did you see his answer?

01:01:34.261 --> 01:01:35.734
Snow!

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:37.916
At least you said,
I believe, rain.

01:01:37.916 --> 01:01:39.345
Is that correct?

01:01:39.345 --> 01:01:40.830
Well, that's good.

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.810
Our survey said 9.

01:01:46.275 --> 01:01:49.270
And then a sport with
an all-star game.

01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:51.184
You said, Football.

01:01:51.184 --> 01:01:54.628
It was about two minutes late
but I insisted you get it.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:56.104
Our survey said.

01:01:56.104 --> 01:02:01.040
[BUZZER]

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.150
So these people are not stupid.

01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:05.440
They're smart people.

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.000
They're regular people.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.330
And they come with these
answers under pressure

01:02:09.330 --> 01:02:15.050
which were just not the
right answers by a long shot.

01:02:15.050 --> 01:02:17.580
So how you ask questions,
who you ask questions to,

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.040
the environment
you ask questions--

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.660
it may not always
be this extreme

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.370
where someone says alligator
for a three letter animal.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:28.020
But you will get shades
of differences-- shades

01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:28.544
of meaning.

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:29.960
Sometime who is
very stressed will

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:31.260
provide really bad answers.

01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:33.770
If you're really, really--
I get test anxiety.

01:02:33.770 --> 01:02:39.390
So when I took my
tests in grad school

01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:41.520
I went to support services
and got time and a half

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.620
because I couldn't do it.

01:02:42.620 --> 01:02:45.810
I'd be there and I would
look at these problems

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:48.757
and the information would
empty out of my mind.

01:02:48.757 --> 01:02:50.090
I just was too anxious to do it.

01:02:52.874 --> 01:02:55.040
Like other people, you will
get different responses.

01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:59.100
So how you conduct your
research is really important.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.990
So one of the various
ways we can research.

01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:04.157
Let's talk about this.

01:03:04.157 --> 01:03:05.740
If it was 1960, and
we wanted to learn

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:08.100
to cook like a French
chef, what would we do?

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:09.742
What could we do?

01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:10.700
AUDIENCE: Go to France.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:11.790
PROFESSOR: Go to France?

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:13.050
Just go to France?

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:14.841
And you just happened
to have the knowledge

01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:15.859
by going to France.

01:03:15.859 --> 01:03:17.400

smoking, you get--

you just happened to know.

01:03:20.655 --> 01:03:21.155
No.

01:03:21.155 --> 01:03:22.120
What else do you do?

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.305

to the Chefs there.

01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:24.680
Sure.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.752
What else could you do?

01:03:25.752 --> 01:03:27.080

French cooking school?

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:28.680
PROFESSOR: Go to
French cooking school.

We want to make the best way to
clean the kitchens in the '90s.

01:03:55.835 --> 01:03:57.540
If not, just ask your
mom, however, you

01:03:57.540 --> 01:03:58.987
could also do what?

01:03:58.987 --> 01:03:59.820

has been done to save money

01:04:18.485 --> 01:04:20.050
in call centers that
have these issues?

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:21.425
I don't think
you're going to get

01:04:21.425 --> 01:04:23.566
a whole lot of good responses.

go out and probably

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:38.670
talk to other people who have
done similar things in order

PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:04:39.310 --> 01:04:40.830
They could talk to other people
who had similar problems,

01:04:40.830 --> 01:04:42.454
but what about this
one particular call

01:04:42.454 --> 01:04:45.866
center for satellite
TV, located in Denver?

01:04:45.866 --> 01:04:47.570
AUDIENCE: Look at its budget.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:48.210
PROFESSOR: Look it's budget.

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:49.634
What would you learn
from the budget?

01:04:49.634 --> 01:04:51.610
AUDIENCE: Seeing where
the most money is going?

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:53.030
PROFESSOR: Well, we
know that a lot of money

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.760
is going to this thing.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.410
How do we have them save money
on this one particular part

01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:56.423
of the call center?

01:04:56.423 --> 01:04:58.006
AUDIENCE: Reduce the
number of workers

01:04:58.006 --> 01:04:59.530
by having an automatic system.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.470
PROFESSOR: Reduce
the number of workers

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:02.470
by having an automatic
system, but how would you

01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:04.457
know what the automatic
system should be doing?

01:05:04.457 --> 01:05:06.040
AUDIENCE: Look at
what the workers do.

01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.665
PROFESSOR: Look at
what the workers do.

01:05:07.665 --> 01:05:08.476
By what method?

01:05:08.476 --> 01:05:08.960
AUDIENCE: Watch them.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.876
PROFESSOR: Watch them.

01:05:09.876 --> 01:05:10.800
Absolutely.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.790
Actually sit down there
and watch the workers.

2015.

01:05:14.445 --> 01:05:16.820
The decision to develop an
extremely new type of consumer

01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:19.540
product, like when people had
to develop the iPad before they

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.340
developed the iPad.

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:23.219
What would you do?

01:05:23.219 --> 01:05:24.260
AUDIENCE: Talk to people.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:28.285
PROFESSOR: Talk to people
and ask them what they want?

01:05:28.285 --> 01:05:29.390
What would you ask them?

01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:31.030
What would you ask
people to figure out

01:05:31.030 --> 01:05:33.000
that brand new product that's
different than anything

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:33.660
ever before it.

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:34.522
AUDIENCE: You talk
about what they actually

01:05:34.522 --> 01:05:36.410
want like why they use iPads.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:40.515
Maybe they want something easy
in front of them to touch.

01:05:40.515 --> 01:05:41.140
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.610
So to get the
underlying mechanisms.

01:05:42.610 --> 01:05:43.109
Yes.

01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:47.060
So we have expert education
here, as he said, correctly.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.420
Historical and cultural
explanations, as you

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.490
said correctly.

01:05:50.490 --> 01:05:51.937
Ethnographic
research, as she said

01:05:51.937 --> 01:05:54.270
about observing someone
actually performing these tasks.

01:05:54.270 --> 01:05:55.853
This is how the
Swiffer was developed.

01:05:55.853 --> 01:06:00.200
They had people with cameras
watching people clean and mop

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:00.924
their floors.

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:03.090
And they thought, oh wait,
they do all these things.

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:04.340
The water gets dirty
and all this stuff.

01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:05.839
And they could
develop these ideas--

01:06:05.839 --> 01:06:07.690
the wet Swiffer and
the dry Swiffer.

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:09.020
Here, direct observation.

01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:10.910
Sit there and listen
to those calls coming

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:13.740
into the call
center, which I did.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:16.510
And I heard them say things.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.802
I sat down next to this person.

01:06:17.802 --> 01:06:19.843
You know when they say
the calls may be monitored

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:21.680
for quality control
or quality assurance?

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:24.190
Well, that was me
sitting next to her,

01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:25.810
jacked into the same box.

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.768
And I said, I'm just
going to hear what you do.

01:06:27.768 --> 01:06:28.700
First call comes in.

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:33.960
I've got a problem
with my TV thing.

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.940
I can't get this
station and she'd

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:37.190
have a very interesting thing.

01:06:37.190 --> 01:06:37.800
Did you diagnose it?

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.420
She'd work with them.

01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:39.760
20 minutes later, it'd be done.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:40.990
The next call would come in.

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.590
I've got this black screen.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:44.830
She's like, oh,
we'll, can you go in

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:46.250
and unplug it and
plug it back in.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.881
Sure.

01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:49.160
Hey, it's working now.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.240
Great.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.460
Next call comes in.

01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.637
I've got this really
strange problem.

01:06:53.637 --> 01:06:56.220
I was getting these channels but
now I'm not getting anything.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.220
She'd diagnose it and
send it a restart signal.

01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:58.830
It would work.

01:06:58.830 --> 01:06:59.996
The next call would come in.

01:06:59.996 --> 01:07:01.700
I've got this snowy screen.

01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.300
She'd say, can you unplug it.

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:03.827
Yes.

01:07:03.827 --> 01:07:04.660
And plug it back in.

01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.322
Yes.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:06.030
How's it working?

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:06.710
Works great.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.590
Perfect.

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:10.150
Every other call.

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:11.500
Every other call.

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.060
Black screen.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:12.715
Snowy screen.

01:07:12.715 --> 01:07:13.020
Black screen.

01:07:13.020 --> 01:07:13.520
Snowy screen.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:13.950
Unplug it.

01:07:13.950 --> 01:07:14.670
Plug it back in.

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.605
Resolved.

01:07:16.605 --> 01:07:17.480
What's going on here.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.620
I said, how do you know
that's the problem.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:23.500
Oh, because the installers
say don't turn off the box.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:24.916
They'd say you
don't have to worry

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:27.024
about turning off the box.

01:07:27.024 --> 01:07:29.440
Turns out if you don't turn
off the box every week or two,

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.980
eventually it will
want an update,

01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:34.690
not get it, and produce
a black or snowy screen.

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:36.627
And so she knew to do that.

01:07:36.627 --> 01:07:38.210
They were given
incorrect instructions

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:40.557
by the people who
installed the box.

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:42.140
And she gave them
better instructions.

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:43.386
Well, kind of better.

01:07:43.386 --> 01:07:45.510
The better instructions
we're actually, by the way,

01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:47.620
you'll have to do
this periodically,

01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:50.650
even if the installer told
you you didn't have to do.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:53.340
So here by observing
that, we figured out

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:56.880
that 30% of the calls to this
particular part of the call

01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:00.270
center were for a
black or snowy screen.

01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:03.181
Automation was introduced,
as you said-- who was it?

01:08:03.181 --> 01:08:03.680
Yes.

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.380
Correctly.

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.380
Automation was introduced
to solve this problem.

01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.285
The first question was, are you
experiencing a black or snowy

01:08:09.285 --> 01:08:10.314
screen.

01:08:10.314 --> 01:08:10.991
No.

01:08:10.991 --> 01:08:11.490
All right.

01:08:11.490 --> 01:08:14.030
Let me give-- Yes.

01:08:14.030 --> 01:08:14.624
Great.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:17.040
Unplug it and plug it back in
and let's see if that helps.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:17.956
I'll stay on the line.

01:08:17.956 --> 01:08:19.810
When you're ready,
just say I'm ready.

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:20.960
And people would do that.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.950
They'd say I'm ready.

01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:22.090
Great.

01:08:22.090 --> 01:08:22.979
Did that solve the problem?

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:23.550
Yes.

01:08:23.550 --> 01:08:24.630
Alright.

01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:26.840
You need to turn this
off, periodically,

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.507
like once a week or two.

01:08:28.507 --> 01:08:30.090
otherwise you'll get
the same problem,

01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:33.080
even if the installer told
you you didn't have to.

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:34.990
So that's how you
solve a problem.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:36.810
Observation.

01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:37.736
This is the hard one.

01:08:37.736 --> 01:08:39.569
And this is exactly
what you're alluding to.

01:08:39.569 --> 01:08:41.200
A deep understanding of humans.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:41.850
What they want.

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:43.819
What their real desires
are-- technology, culture,

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.390
manufacturing, philosophy, art,
design, and everything else.

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.515
When you want something
really radically innovative

01:08:48.515 --> 01:08:50.270
you need to understand
a lot about a lot.

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.394
And while you're in school,
you have an opportunity

01:08:52.394 --> 01:08:54.399
to learn a lot about the a lot.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:56.060
So take advantage of doing that.

01:08:56.060 --> 01:09:01.060
Steve Jobs sat in on
a calligraphy class.

01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:04.010
And that's why the first
Macintoshes had fonts.

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:06.100
Before, there were no
fonts in computers.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:07.010
But he didn't have
this experience

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.250
of what a font can do and
change meaning of something

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:11.775
and he wanted that in that
first Macintosh computer because

01:09:11.775 --> 01:09:15.670
of the experiences of sitting
in on a calligraphy class.

01:09:15.670 --> 01:09:16.750
Have more experiences.

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:20.580
Understand everything about
culture, technology, art,

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:22.399
design, philosophy.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:23.930
It'll make you
better at designing

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:25.214
very technical systems.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:31.330
Any questions about that?

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:34.606
AUDIENCE: I would actually
disagree with that last point.

01:09:34.606 --> 01:09:36.625
You get more innovation
by just trying 100 ideas

01:09:36.625 --> 01:09:37.711
and seeing what sticks.

01:09:37.711 --> 01:09:39.710
PROFESSOR: You think you
can get more innovation

01:09:39.710 --> 01:09:41.729
by trying 100 ideas
and seeing what sticks?

01:09:41.729 --> 01:09:43.812
AUDIENCE: Yeah. [INAUDIBLE]
that make great things

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.729
and have no idea
what they're doing.

01:09:45.729 --> 01:09:46.790
PROFESSOR: You think
people who make

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:48.664
great things have no
idea what they're doing?

01:09:48.664 --> 01:09:51.417
AUDIENCE: In some cases, yeah.

01:09:51.417 --> 01:09:53.125
PROFESSOR: Can you
give me some examples?

01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:54.124
AUDIENCE: Some examples.

01:09:54.124 --> 01:09:55.791
If you think of a
product like Facebook.

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:56.624
PROFESSOR: Facebook.

01:09:56.624 --> 01:09:58.340
He had no idea
what he was doing?

01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.173
AUDIENCE: Yeah, he was
doing something cool.

01:10:00.173 --> 01:10:02.630
Ended up making a lot of
money later on by [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:03.060
PROFESSOR: Making money.

01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:03.900
But that wasn't the objective.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:05.775
The objective was to
make something cool.

01:10:05.775 --> 01:10:07.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:07.185 --> 01:10:09.310
PROFESSOR: But he didn't
try 100 different designs.

01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.885
Did he?

01:10:09.885 --> 01:10:12.872
He didn't just try a 100
designs and see what stuck.

01:10:12.872 --> 01:10:15.040
AUDIENCE: They updated
code twice a day.

01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:17.165
PROFESSOR: That's not trying
100 different designs.

01:10:17.165 --> 01:10:19.270
Facebook has maintained--
its core origin,

01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:20.810
at the very beginning,
was a rating.

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:21.310
Hot or not.

01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:21.640
Right?

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.630
So like, hot or not.

01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:23.992
You would just rate people.

01:10:23.992 --> 01:10:25.700
Then you started being
able to post more.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.340
And it involved.

01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:29.510
And when it evolved to
a certain point, then

01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:32.040
it became particularly big.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:33.800
But it wasn't that
they tried 100 designs.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.466
No one sat there and said, let's
observe 100 different things we

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:39.720
could be doing for Facebook
and say, let's see what sticks.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.600
People don't often do that.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.250
It's also very
costly and expensive

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:44.770
to try 100 different designs.

01:10:44.770 --> 01:10:47.270
AUDIENCE: If you look at how
they do agent testing everyday?

01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.895
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:10:47.895 --> 01:10:49.470
But that's making
small decisions.

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:51.150
But not radically
different things.

01:10:51.150 --> 01:10:55.080
We're talking about technology
that's never been seen before.

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:56.800
A completely new type
of user experience.

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.060
Something that's never
been tried before.

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.330
Derivative things, absolutely.

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:01.570
You can do ABN testing.

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:04.200
You can test 100,000
variations in an hour

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.120
and see which ones
people used and which

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.890
ones they took longer to use.

01:11:07.890 --> 01:11:09.544
But that's for small changes.

01:11:09.544 --> 01:11:11.960
Not when you're doing something
completely radical and new

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.585
and very different
and very innovative.

01:11:16.376 --> 01:11:18.792
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
support his point a little bit.

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:21.768
I don't think that
anyone who designs

01:11:21.768 --> 01:11:25.736
these really good products
sits down one day and realizes,

01:11:25.736 --> 01:11:28.712
given everything I know about
art, technology, society, etc,

01:11:28.712 --> 01:11:30.106
this is how it should be.

01:11:30.106 --> 01:11:31.355
PROFESSOR: You don't think so?

01:11:31.355 --> 01:11:32.450
AUDIENCE: No, I don't.

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:33.570
PROFESSOR: If you were
to design something,

01:11:33.570 --> 01:11:35.992
you wouldn't think that it
was the amalgam of everything

01:11:35.992 --> 01:11:37.450
you've learned in
your life so far?

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:38.222
AUDIENCE: No, no.

01:11:38.222 --> 01:11:41.122
It wouldn't just come at once.

01:11:41.122 --> 01:11:42.580
PROFESSOR: It may
not come at once.

01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.121
AUDIENCE: Unlike
the other examples--

01:11:44.121 --> 01:11:47.390
in the other examples, you
narrowed down the [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:49.285
because you realized
this causes this.

01:11:49.285 --> 01:11:50.160
PROFESSOR: Oh, right.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:51.201
It is not a good example.

01:11:51.201 --> 01:11:51.860
Exactly.

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:52.580
That is true.

01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.234
But it is the
synthesis of everything

01:11:54.234 --> 01:11:55.150
you've learned so far.

01:11:55.150 --> 01:11:55.480
Right?

01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.146
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:11:56.146 --> 01:12:00.480
But the process of getting
to the design that you get to

01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.459
is a meandering.

01:12:01.459 --> 01:12:02.250
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:03.550
You may take a long time
to get to that design.

01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:04.000
Absolutely.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:04.490
Yes.

01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:06.073
But it is the idea
that, if you-- I'll

01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:07.290
bring this slide up again.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:13.429
If you don't have a deep
understanding of people,

01:12:13.429 --> 01:12:15.720
you're not going to design
things really well for them.

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.490
If you don't understand
how the technology works,

01:12:17.490 --> 01:12:19.573
you won't be able to make
something that's useful,

01:12:19.573 --> 01:12:21.450
that people enjoy
interacting with that

01:12:21.450 --> 01:12:22.910
takes advantage
of the technology.

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:24.390
If you don't understand
about the culture

01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:25.630
it may be the wrong
time to introduce it

01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:26.421
to a certain place.

01:12:26.421 --> 01:12:30.180
If the iPad was launched in a
poor country where they could

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.461
never afford it, then it
may not be very popular.

01:12:32.461 --> 01:12:34.460
Or a place where there
wasn't internet reception

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.129
for some reason.

01:12:35.129 --> 01:12:37.670
Or if you don't understand about
how to manufacture something

01:12:37.670 --> 01:12:39.760
like that, then it
gets very clunky.

01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.790
If you don't understand
about art or design,

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:44.300
how do you make something
that's aesthetically pleasing

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.214
and sustainable?

01:12:45.214 --> 01:12:46.880
So that's why the
idea is to synthesize.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.580
And yes.

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.620
It takes a long
time to get there.

01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.275
That's why creativity gets
better as you get older.

01:12:52.275 --> 01:12:55.660
The older you get, the
more creative you will get.

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:57.160
You don't get worse
with creativity.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.617
It gets better.

01:12:58.617 --> 01:13:00.450
Because you know more
and you have more life

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:03.930
experiences that
you can synthesize.

01:13:03.930 --> 01:13:05.030
Other questions?

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:07.012
Or comments?

01:13:07.012 --> 01:13:08.428
AUDIENCE: I feel
like it goes back

01:13:08.428 --> 01:13:11.055
to the conversation we
had about intention.

01:13:11.055 --> 01:13:11.930
PROFESSOR: Intention.

01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:13.620
The idea of intention.

01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.860
AUDIENCE: -and what
you intended it to do.

01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.635
I feel like it does require
the deep understanding

01:13:19.635 --> 01:13:22.970
of certain things depending
on what your design is.

01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:25.155
But it's like what
you said, it can

01:13:25.155 --> 01:13:27.270
evolve into different
things and that

01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:32.895
might mean you will look for
more understanding of humans

01:13:32.895 --> 01:13:36.830
and manufacturing maybe later on
depending on where the design--

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:38.520
PROFESSOR: So you'll
keep evolving that.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:39.020
Absolutely.

01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:40.895
You will definitely keep
evolving your ideas.

01:13:40.895 --> 01:13:42.190
Joel.

01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:44.315
PROFESSOR JOEL SCHINDALL:
Just to add a little bit,

01:13:44.315 --> 01:13:47.690
I hope you're not falling
into the school idea

01:13:47.690 --> 01:13:51.940
that these questions have
right and wrong answers.

01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.940
These are thought provoking.

01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:56.350
They're to get you
thinking about things.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:59.080
They're to challenge
your assumptions.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:02.120
Some of them are
absolutely ridiculous.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.280
But without looking at
that, it doesn't give you

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.360
the perspective that
you're getting at.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.862
I think you've probably done
this in other sorts of classes

01:14:10.862 --> 01:14:12.570
but it's a different
type of perspective.

01:14:12.570 --> 01:14:14.750
And to get the most
value out of it

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:17.750
you need to set aside--
by the way, the people who

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.420
are answering, I also want
to really hand it to you.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.170
Put yourself out there.

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:24.891
Throw it out even if it's--
there are not right and wrong

01:14:24.891 --> 01:14:25.390
answers.

01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:28.260
We need illustrations
of the wrong answers--

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:31.850
we need illustrations
of the wide range

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:34.990
that people come up
with answers about.

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:37.210
I think if you're sitting
here in this class,

01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:40.780
the answers that other
people are giving

01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:44.820
are a demonstration of the
wide range of reactions

01:14:44.820 --> 01:14:47.449
that people have to the same
stimuli that you receive.

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.740
And you'll receive a stimulus
and you'll say, oh, yeah,

01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:50.760
of course that's true.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.380
And someone else is going
to say, I object violently.

01:14:53.380 --> 01:14:55.990
Now that's worth knowing
because that person's

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:57.780
giving an honest reaction.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.360
PROFESSOR: The
whole point of this

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.477
is to provoke your thinking.

01:15:01.477 --> 01:15:02.935
To make you think
deeper about this

01:15:02.935 --> 01:15:04.600
and to set the
stage for what you

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.660
will be doing over the
course of the semester.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.059
It is meant to
challenge the ideas.

01:15:09.059 --> 01:15:11.350
We ask a lot of questions
about Dieter Rams' principles

01:15:11.350 --> 01:15:13.980
and you'll be
reflecting on that.

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:15.281
But these are ideas.

01:15:15.281 --> 01:15:17.530
And they're not meant to say
this is an equation where

01:15:17.530 --> 01:15:20.010
when you put something in you
get something out like this.

01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:22.160
It's not deterministic that way.

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.560
Design is a very, very
complicated thing.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.810
That's why we talk about it
for many different aspects

01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:29.680
and different approaches to
get you to think differently.

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.880
Because you'll be able to
soon become much better at it

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.662
through that process.

01:15:34.662 --> 01:15:38.316
AUDIENCE: So I know that 2.009
is a very artificial setting

01:15:38.316 --> 01:15:39.816
because you're given
a theme and you

01:15:39.816 --> 01:15:42.027
have to design a product
based on that theme.

01:15:42.027 --> 01:15:45.960
But how do you think 2.009
and that process fits with--

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:48.620
PROFESSOR: I don't know
a whole lot about 2.009.

01:15:48.620 --> 01:15:50.120
You said it's an
artificial setting.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:51.840
It's not that artificial.

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:55.550
There are companies that have
innovation labs where they say,

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:58.249
we do something with our
product in this space.

01:15:58.249 --> 01:15:59.790
Can you do something
with our product

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:01.890
that takes advantage
of it somehow?

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.160
And people have to figure
out, OK, what do I have.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:05.240
What are the resources?

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.699
How much time do
I have to do this?

01:16:06.699 --> 01:16:08.198
Do I have an infinite
amount of time

01:16:08.198 --> 01:16:09.460
or a limited amount of time?

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.899
And they do that same process,
just like you do in 2.009.

01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:14.440
PROFESSOR JOEL SCHINDALL: Blade,
let me comment on that also.

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.020
Design takes place
at many, many levels.

01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:20.120
And sometimes, you just
have a group of flowers

01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:22.170
and you're trying to
make a floral design

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:24.270
and you're very restricted
in what you can do,

01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:26.439
but there is a methodology,
there are rules.

01:16:26.439 --> 01:16:27.980
You can put the big
flowers-- I don't

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.729
know how to do a good
one, so I better not

01:16:29.729 --> 01:16:31.155
give you examples of that.

01:16:31.155 --> 01:16:32.780
And on the other
hand, sometimes you're

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:38.270
trying to do either a very
complex technical system

01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:41.170
or perhaps a complicated
political process.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:44.432
People design press briefings
for presidential candidates.

01:16:44.432 --> 01:16:45.140
It seems amazing.

01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:46.660
It seems they're
so bad it doesn't

01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:48.520
seem as if it could be designed.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.990
But it actually
is very carefully

01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:53.160
researched and designed.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.190
Now 2.009 places itself
kind of in the middle

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:57.310
of the design space.

01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:00.840
It's more creative
than just figuring out

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:03.160
how to assemble an erector set.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.460
And it does encourage you to
do some innovative thinking,

01:17:06.460 --> 01:17:11.380
but not as much-- we're trying
to go even one level higher

01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:13.570
and something that will
apply to everything you do

01:17:13.570 --> 01:17:15.790
and just, what we
call, design thinking.

01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:19.200
And it will help you
in 2.009, but it's not

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:21.910
as specifically
applied to-- 2.009

01:17:21.910 --> 01:17:23.950
is a mechanical engineering
course for people

01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:26.940
who intend to grow up and
design mechanical things.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:29.560
And so it focuses on that.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.140
This is more for people who
intend to deal with life issues

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.470
and come up with answers.

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:37.969
PROFESSOR: Whenever you have
to do anything-- in my software

01:17:37.969 --> 01:17:39.369
company, I apply
these principles

01:17:39.369 --> 01:17:41.410
to everything we do-- the
ones I'm teaching you--

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:44.880
to every aspect of it,
whether it's to hiring,

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.760
to bring people on board, to
figure out what they're going

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:50.310
to be doing the next week,
how we're going to communicate

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:52.960
internally, how we're going
to communicate externally,

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.220
which brings us to stakeholders.

01:17:56.220 --> 01:17:56.720
Cul Bono.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:57.900
What does it mean?

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.860
Anyone know?

01:17:59.860 --> 01:18:00.820
Who benefits?

01:18:00.820 --> 01:18:01.970
Who benefits?

01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:03.840
So stakeholder.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.100
Well the definition I get
off the internet-- a person

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:08.620
or group that has an investment
share interest in something.

01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:10.620
We talk about stakeholders
for your education--

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:12.405
you or your family,
teachers, school.

01:18:12.405 --> 01:18:14.530
Who else could be a
stakeholder for your education?

01:18:14.530 --> 01:18:15.669
AUDIENCE: The community.

01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:16.710
PROFESSOR: The community.

01:18:16.710 --> 01:18:19.080
What community?

01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.657
AUDIENCE: The one that you
would benefit if you go--

01:18:21.657 --> 01:18:23.240
PROFESSOR: The
community that benefits

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.731
when you go and do something.

01:18:24.731 --> 01:18:25.230
What else?

01:18:25.230 --> 01:18:26.136
AUDIENCE: Your employers.

01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:27.240
PROFESSOR: The employers.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:27.965
Yes.

01:18:27.965 --> 01:18:30.001
And actually
potential employers.

01:18:30.001 --> 01:18:30.500
Who else?

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:31.570
AUDIENCE: The clients.

01:18:31.570 --> 01:18:33.421
PROFESSOR: Clients.

01:18:33.421 --> 01:18:35.670
When you're working at the
employer you have a client.

01:18:35.670 --> 01:18:38.160
Yes.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:40.702
AUDIENCE: I think the government
or the president in general.

01:18:40.702 --> 01:18:42.784
PROFESSOR: The government
or the president, or you

01:18:42.784 --> 01:18:43.830
could say the country.

01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:45.730
The country benefits.

01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:46.320
Absolutely.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.900
Who else?

01:18:47.900 --> 01:18:49.608
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if school includes

01:18:49.608 --> 01:18:51.314
this, but your classmates.

01:18:51.314 --> 01:18:52.230
PROFESSOR: Classmates.

01:18:52.230 --> 01:18:52.348
Sure.

01:18:52.348 --> 01:18:53.910
Tell me how your
classmates benefit.

01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:55.164
AUDIENCE: The more you
bring to the table,

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.420
the more they're going to gain.

01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:57.086
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:18:57.086 --> 01:18:59.760
So when you have a certain
cohort in a business school,

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.210
if there's people with
different experiences,

01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:05.020
they can bring new
ideas and formats.

01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:07.280
That's why we have
discussions like this

01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:08.874
at the beginning
of the lectures.

01:19:08.874 --> 01:19:11.040
You get more benefit because
you hear someone's idea

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.470
that you hadn't thought
about before because they

01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:13.470
bring their perspective.

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.310
Here's a quick sketch.

01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:19.700
Just a quick sketch
of how you might

01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:22.310
go about the process of
writing out the stakeholders.

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:23.000
Flour Bakery.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.109
Who knows it?

01:19:24.109 --> 01:19:24.650
A lot of you.

01:19:24.650 --> 01:19:26.990
So this is a great
bakery, very close by.

01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:29.960
And its owner is Joanne
Chang, a friend of mine.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.454
And Joanne owns a bakery.

01:19:32.454 --> 01:19:34.370
So I'm going to say that
this is in the center

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:36.900
and this is one of the
primary stakeholders.

01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:40.180
Workers would be another primary
stakeholder of the bakery

01:19:40.180 --> 01:19:44.090
because if the bakery's
selling product they get paid.

01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:47.780
There's a whole bunch of others,
of course, that we can fill in.

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:52.460
Now we go from a secondary
one to the workers' banks.

01:19:52.460 --> 01:19:53.490
How do they benefit?

01:19:53.490 --> 01:19:55.710
Well, the Flour Bakery
gives the workers money.

01:19:55.710 --> 01:19:58.050
The money goes into the banks.

01:19:58.050 --> 01:19:59.600
So as we go through
that process,

01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.936
the bank begins to be able
to get more money into them,

01:20:01.936 --> 01:20:04.185
particularly a local bank,
perhaps, that's being used.

01:20:04.185 --> 01:20:05.560
And what's
interesting about this

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.259
is there's a big
profound effect.

01:20:07.259 --> 01:20:08.800
What we're going to
do is we're going

01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:14.060
to have you do a quick
sketch for Flour Bakery.

01:20:14.060 --> 01:20:18.750
And what I want you to
do is to do that system

01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:20.910
with much more detail,
right now in class.

01:20:23.289 --> 01:20:24.830
And if you need to,
you can use lines

01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:26.350
to clarify what's happening.

01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.480
Someone pays someone,
like pay the workers,

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:31.940
or the bank receives
cash as a result.

01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:35.890
I want you to work
in groups of three.

01:20:35.890 --> 01:20:38.300
If you have paper, please
draw this on paper.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:41.510
And then, we'll project
a few on the screen.

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:44.760
So tidiness doesn't really count
as long as you can explain it.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:48.840
And you'll have about
10 minutes to do it.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:51.600
You can work with
any people you want.

01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.510
By now, the students
are trying to figure out

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:55.430
how to map out a simple
stakeholder diagram.

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:59.984
Now this is not a very full
or robust stakeholder diagram.

01:20:59.984 --> 01:21:01.650
It's just meant to
get everyone thinking

01:21:01.650 --> 01:21:04.470
about the system
that's involved.

01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:07.227
In a stakeholder analysis
that's done really well,

01:21:07.227 --> 01:21:09.310
you'd actually phase out
all the different levels.

01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:11.610
You'd think about all the
different stakeholders

01:21:11.610 --> 01:21:14.040
and where they lie in the
spectrum of value, too.

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:16.650
Here we just want to make
sure that students understand

01:21:16.650 --> 01:21:18.080
the idea that
things are connected

01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.890
and that these connections
can seem very distant.

01:21:20.890 --> 01:21:24.200
But if they understand the
connections and the space,

01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:26.267
it can help them make
better decisions later on.

01:21:26.267 --> 01:21:29.190
And we'll be doing that in
the next slides that we show.

01:21:29.190 --> 01:21:32.650
We'll show what the students
have done on the screen.

01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:34.330
So the thing to
look for in this is

01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:36.050
to see if the students
pick up on some

01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:37.630
of the other more
subtle aspects.

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:40.460
Are they going to think about
things like legal system

01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:44.220
or the accountant
or people like that

01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:47.075
who are direct benefits
and every store

01:21:47.075 --> 01:21:51.064
has to work with their legal
people and their accountants,

01:21:51.064 --> 01:21:53.230
but it doesn't seem like
it often pops in the radar.

01:21:53.230 --> 01:21:54.580
And this is where all
these hidden costs

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.390
occur when someone's
starting a business.

01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:58.110
They think, well, this one's
going to cost this much

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:00.130
or they're making a product
that's only this expensive,

01:22:00.130 --> 01:22:02.450
but there's everything
else around that ecosystem.

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:05.830
And let's see if
they pick up on this.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:16.475
All right so let's
go over your results.

01:22:21.786 --> 01:22:23.160
Why don't we take
yours to start?

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:24.035
Does that sound good?

01:22:24.035 --> 01:22:25.440
STUDENT PRESENTER
1: Sounds good.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:26.981
PROFESSOR: You can
take care of this.

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:31.410
Let me know when you're ready.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:45.890
So you're going to
have to explain this

01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:49.330
because it's hard to get
the catch of this on here.

01:22:49.330 --> 01:22:50.660
But it's OK.

01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:51.670
Just walk us through it.

01:22:51.670 --> 01:22:54.060
In fact, use the
laser pointer-- this

01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:56.610
is the red button here at
the top-- to point out.

01:22:56.610 --> 01:22:57.902
Tell us what we have over here.

01:22:57.902 --> 01:22:59.568
STUDENT PRESENTER 1:
So immediately, you

01:22:59.568 --> 01:23:02.700
have the owner who benefits
up here and also the employer.

01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:04.384
And so from there,
their banks benefit.

01:23:04.384 --> 01:23:06.050
And that kind of leads
into the economy.

01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:08.216
PROFESSOR: Tell us about
just the first level, right

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:09.950
around here.
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:11.658
STUDENT PRESENTER 1:
And so the suppliers

01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:15.510
who supply the materials to
Flour, furniture, ingredients,

01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:17.192
and stuff like--
they benefit as well.

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:19.150
And then down here, you
have neighboring stores

01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:20.884
who benefit from the
popularity of Flour,

01:23:20.884 --> 01:23:21.925
bringing in more traffic.

01:23:21.925 --> 01:23:22.500
PROFESSOR: Neighboring stores.

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.720
Really creative.

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:26.053
They'll benefit from the fact
that it's a popular place.

01:23:26.053 --> 01:23:26.810
Keep going.

01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:28.010
STUDENT PRESENTER 1:
And so competition here,

01:23:28.010 --> 01:23:29.630
you can extrapolate,
to them being

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:31.219
driven to produce better goods.

01:23:31.219 --> 01:23:32.510
PROFESSOR: Wow, so competition.

01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:33.140
That's very creative.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:33.810
Keep going.

01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:35.393
STUDENT PRESENTER
1: And this actually

01:23:35.393 --> 01:23:37.874
feeds back in to customers who
benefit from better quality.

01:23:37.874 --> 01:23:40.290
PROFESSOR: I guess competition
is a good drive out quality

01:23:40.290 --> 01:23:41.980
from other bakeries who
aren't starting to get good.

01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.760
Flour has to get better or
lower their prices or something.

01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:45.260
Keep going.

01:23:45.260 --> 01:23:45.600
STUDENT PRESENTER 1: Right.

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.330
And so the second level
here, back to the banks--

01:23:48.330 --> 01:23:50.260
they benefit from
both the owners

01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.870
and the employers making income.

01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:57.337
And then down here, you have
friends slash the community.

01:23:57.337 --> 01:23:58.920
Say you refer a
friend and they really

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.310
like Flour, that's
a benefit for them.

01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:03.490
PROFESSOR: So it's a
benefit for the customer

01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:04.690
if I refer a friend.

01:24:04.690 --> 01:24:06.921
It's a benefit to me if I
refer you to go to Flour.

01:24:06.921 --> 01:24:08.670
STUDENT PRESENTER 1:
It's a benefit for me

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:10.770
if you refer me to
Flour and I like it.

01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:12.590
PROFESSOR: So you
get the benefit.

01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:14.250
But are you attached
to me or are you

01:24:14.250 --> 01:24:16.670
attaching directly to Flour?

01:24:16.670 --> 01:24:19.086
In other words, do you
benefit directly from Flour?

01:24:19.086 --> 01:24:20.460
STUDENT PRESENTER
1: That's fair.

01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:22.350
You could say that I
definitely benefit from Flour

01:24:22.350 --> 01:24:23.380
as well if I like it.

01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.206
PROFESSOR: So maybe
this kind of line

01:24:25.206 --> 01:24:27.685
would be a dotted line--
provides information to,

01:24:27.685 --> 01:24:28.756
and then directly from.

01:24:28.756 --> 01:24:29.255
Sure.

01:24:29.255 --> 01:24:30.960
Keep going.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.810
STUDENT PRESENTER 1: And so
naturally, the nearby community

01:24:33.810 --> 01:24:37.157
also branches off from
the neighboring stores.

01:24:37.157 --> 01:24:39.240
One more thing we have
over here is the publishers

01:24:39.240 --> 01:24:41.850
because apparently Flour sells
cookbooks and stuff like that.

01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:43.225
PROFESSOR: Flour
sells cookbooks.

01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:44.580
There's a publisher involved.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:46.234
And they love it.

01:24:46.234 --> 01:24:48.650
The more Flour bakeries that
are around or the more people

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:52.510
know about it the more
cookbooks they buy.

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:54.910
STUDENT PRESENTER 1: And so
this leads to the bookstores,

01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:55.410
I think.

01:24:55.410 --> 01:24:56.368
PROFESSOR: Book stores.

01:24:56.368 --> 01:24:56.960
Absolutely.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.310
STUDENT PRESENTER 1: And this
actually feeds all the way back

01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:59.430
to the economy.

01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:00.350
And from the economy--

01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:03.039
PROFESSOR: The economy "boomph."

01:25:03.039 --> 01:25:04.005
Giant.

01:25:04.005 --> 01:25:05.200
The beneficiary.

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:05.890
That's great.

01:25:05.890 --> 01:25:06.560
And what comes off the economy?

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.935
STUDENT PRESENTER 1: And so
this is where we got creative

01:25:08.935 --> 01:25:10.910
and said that the
government, the president

01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:13.380
benefits from the
economy being strong.

01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:15.740
And then you can even pull
out the political parties

01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:16.448
if you wanted to.

01:25:16.448 --> 01:25:17.130
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:25:17.130 --> 01:25:18.421
So political party, government.

01:25:18.421 --> 01:25:19.130
This is great.

01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:23.530
So Flour makes America strong.

01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:24.310
Forget GM.

01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:25.310
Forget Ford.

01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:26.060
Flour does it.

01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:26.560
I love that.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:27.268
It's a great job.

01:25:27.268 --> 01:25:31.830
[APPLAUSE]

01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:33.480
Who's up next on
the chopping block?

01:25:36.910 --> 01:25:38.613
Let's get this going here.

01:25:38.613 --> 01:25:41.571
You get this.

01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:44.180
I'll give you this to hold.

01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:45.770
I'll give you this
to use as well.

01:26:02.614 --> 01:26:03.530
Let's talk about this.

01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:04.210
Walk us through it.

01:26:04.210 --> 01:26:04.990
At the center is Flour.

01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:05.610
What else we got?

01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.193
STUDENT PRESENTER
2: So we have Flour.

01:26:07.193 --> 01:26:10.406
And then it first goes to
the banks and investors.

01:26:10.406 --> 01:26:11.280
PROFESSOR: Investors.

01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:12.000
Yes.

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.250
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: So banks.

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:15.790
So people who have
money in the bank.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:18.710
So it's really important that
the banks are doing well.

01:26:18.710 --> 01:26:21.790
Similarly, people
who are friends

01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:23.290
with the people
with money the banks

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:27.860
who needed to be spotted for
a meal at Flour also benefit.

01:26:27.860 --> 01:26:30.170
So we also have the workers.

01:26:30.170 --> 01:26:33.880
Their taxes go to the
government which helps America.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.600
And then workers.

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:39.580
Their families also benefit
from the making income.

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:42.032
And then it goes to
the school system.

01:26:42.032 --> 01:26:44.210
PROFESSOR: How's it go
to the school system.

01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:47.900
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: Because
the children go to school.

01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.360
And then, thus,
benefits citizens.

01:26:50.360 --> 01:26:52.830
PROFESSOR: So money goes from
Flour Bakery to the workers.

01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:55.339
The workers give money
to their families?

01:26:55.339 --> 01:26:56.380
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: Yes.

01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:58.890
PROFESSOR: And so how does
that benefit the school?

01:26:58.890 --> 01:27:01.348
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: Because
then the children go to school

01:27:01.348 --> 01:27:03.510
and get educated.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:05.630
You need people to go to school.

01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.922
PROFESSOR: How do the
families pay for that?

01:27:07.922 --> 01:27:09.630
STUDENT PRESENTER 2:
Through their taxes.

01:27:09.630 --> 01:27:11.230
PROFESSOR: Through taxes.

01:27:11.230 --> 01:27:13.104
STUDENT PRESENTER 2:
And then the government.

01:27:13.104 --> 01:27:15.650
PROFESSOR: Before it gets to
the school, where does it go?

01:27:15.650 --> 01:27:16.540
To the IRS.

01:27:16.540 --> 01:27:17.050
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: That too.

01:27:17.050 --> 01:27:18.080
PROFESSOR: And
them to the school.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:18.560
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: Yes.

01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.770
PROFESSOR: To the IRS first
and then to the school.

01:27:19.770 --> 01:27:20.310
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: Yes.

01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.490
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:21.200
That is true though.

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.408
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: And it
goes back to the citizens

01:27:23.408 --> 01:27:25.308
because then you have
an educated population.

01:27:25.308 --> 01:27:27.432
PROFESSOR: So Flour Bakery
educates the population.

01:27:27.432 --> 01:27:28.630
I love that.

01:27:28.630 --> 01:27:29.380
We'll tell Joanne.

01:27:29.380 --> 01:27:31.587
She's going to love this.

01:27:31.587 --> 01:27:33.795
STUDENT PRESENTER 2: Then
kind of going on a more fun

01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:36.700
note-- so we also had
neighboring companies,

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.170
such as Novartis who's like
a biotech drug development

01:27:41.170 --> 01:27:43.460
company which helps hospitals.

01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:47.080
And then the patients
can go to Flour.

01:27:47.080 --> 01:27:47.830
PROFESSOR: Lovely.

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:49.384
Keep going.

01:27:49.384 --> 01:27:50.800
STUDENT PRESENTER
2: Similarly, we

01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:55.260
have more customers
such as MIT students.

01:27:55.260 --> 01:28:00.370
And so our parents benefit
from us getting an education.

01:28:00.370 --> 01:28:04.940
Professors and other MIT
employees who go to flour.

01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:10.270
And also the world slash
everybody is invested in.

01:28:10.270 --> 01:28:12.150
PROFESSOR: The world.

01:28:12.150 --> 01:28:14.541
I can't wait til the next
one that says universe.

01:28:14.541 --> 01:28:15.040
That's good.

01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:15.956
Big round of applause.

01:28:15.956 --> 01:28:20.470
[APPLAUSE]

01:28:20.470 --> 01:28:22.390
We've got time for
one more example.

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:25.090
Who-- yes.

01:28:25.090 --> 01:28:26.170
Let's take your example.

01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:27.232
Cannot wait to see it.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:04.460
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: So ours is
similar to many of the others.

01:29:04.460 --> 01:29:08.149
We have some things that
other people didn't have--

01:29:08.149 --> 01:29:09.690
PROFESSOR: Point
out the differences.

01:29:09.690 --> 01:29:12.072
STUDENT PRESENTER
3: --in local gyms.

01:29:12.072 --> 01:29:13.780
PROFESSOR: Local gyms
benefit from Flour.

01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:14.100
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: They do.

01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:16.710
PROFESSOR: Tell us why do local
gyms benefit from a place that

01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:18.280
sells lots of bakery
confectioneries.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:19.600
STUDENT PRESENTER 3:
Flour is really delicious.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.933
And then people eat a lot of it.

01:29:20.933 --> 01:29:22.240
And they get really fat.

01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:24.580
And then they would like to
lose some of those calories.

01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:26.900
PROFESSOR: So the Z
Center, the MIT gym,

01:29:26.900 --> 01:29:29.882
benefits from Flour being there
because more people use the Z

01:29:29.882 --> 01:29:32.340
Center who may not otherwise
use it because they're saying,

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:34.460
I love Flour so much but I've
got to work out the calories.

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.350
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: Exactly.

01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:36.930
PROFESSOR: Local bike
shops maybe as well.

01:29:36.930 --> 01:29:38.780
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: So
their employees benefit too.

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:39.680
PROFESSOR: Their employees
absolutely benefit.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:40.090
Yes.

01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.756
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: And we also
had hospitals in that similar--

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.262
PROFESSOR: As Diabetes go up.

01:29:46.262 --> 01:29:47.470
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: Exactly.

01:29:47.470 --> 01:29:49.680
PROFESSOR: Yes, they're so
tasty they cause diabetes.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:50.010
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: Precisely.

01:29:50.010 --> 01:29:51.030
PROFESSOR: And
hospitals benefit.

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:52.040
And doctors from selling--

01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.480
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: And
the doctors' families.

01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:53.840
Yes?

01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.180
PROFESSOR: And the
doctors' families benefit.

01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:56.388
STUDENT PRESENTER 3: Exactly.

01:29:56.388 --> 01:29:59.200
PROFESSOR: Now this may sound
bizarre, but this is true.

01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:00.830
This is how it happens.

01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:05.670
Imagine that we had to work
it out for a tobacco company.

01:30:05.670 --> 01:30:08.520
All the people that benefit
from a tobacco company

01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:11.450
selling things,
including people who

01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:14.210
are injured by tobacco
because of cancer.

01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:15.030
So that's all true.

01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:17.870
What else do we have?

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:20.720
STUDENT PRESENTER 4:
We had aspiring chefs

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.610
because of the cookbook.

01:30:22.610 --> 01:30:23.540
So they can see that.

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.490
Or even aspiring
restaurateurs who

01:30:26.490 --> 01:30:28.820
see how the owner set
up Flour and maybe

01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:30.325
use it as an example
or inspiration.

01:30:30.325 --> 01:30:33.180
PROFESSOR: Brilliant.

01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:34.255
What else do you have?

01:30:34.255 --> 01:30:35.610
What else is brilliant?

01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:37.180
STUDENT PRESENTER
5: We also have

01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:40.300
how MIT is generally affected.

01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:44.580
So if students are eating at
Flour instead of the dining

01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:48.170
hall, then that's affecting MIT.

01:30:48.170 --> 01:30:50.190
That's affecting the
classes and the professors

01:30:50.190 --> 01:30:51.901
and your classmates.

01:30:51.901 --> 01:30:53.150
PROFESSOR: And maybe for good.

01:30:53.150 --> 01:30:54.000
Maybe not for food.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:54.583
This is great.

01:30:54.583 --> 01:30:55.870
This is an excellent one.

01:30:55.870 --> 01:30:57.450
Here's a question.

01:30:57.450 --> 01:31:01.910
Did anyone get lawyers?

01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:02.410
Good.

01:31:02.410 --> 01:31:03.140
Two groups.

01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:05.011
How about accountants?

01:31:05.011 --> 01:31:05.510
One group.

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:06.057
Excellent.

01:31:06.057 --> 01:31:08.140
Every business deals with
lawyers and accountants.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:09.770
Lawyers accountants
all the time.

01:31:09.770 --> 01:31:11.425
Every business, no
matter what, deals

01:31:11.425 --> 01:31:13.450
with lawyers and accountants.

01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:16.090
It should be on all of
these because, no matter

01:31:16.090 --> 01:31:19.112
what-- and particularly
as a business owner-- boy,

01:31:19.112 --> 01:31:20.570
I get on the phone
with my lawyers,

01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:22.040
I talk to my accountant.

01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.280
I can't even avoid it.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:25.220
It's not even possible
to avoid, particularly

01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:30.130
when you have to hire people and
fire people and the whole bit.

01:31:30.130 --> 01:31:32.277
That's why they're such
big businesses-- why

01:31:32.277 --> 01:31:34.340
accounting and the law
are such big businesses--

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:36.860
because everybody
needs to use them.

01:31:36.860 --> 01:31:40.100
Any other people have
examples of beneficiaries

01:31:40.100 --> 01:31:41.940
who we didn't list?

01:31:41.940 --> 01:31:43.190
AUDIENCE: Insurance companies.

01:31:43.190 --> 01:31:44.210
PROFESSOR: Insurance companies.

01:31:44.210 --> 01:31:44.710
Yes.

01:31:44.710 --> 01:31:45.240
Absolutely.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.469
AUDIENCE: The farmers.

01:31:47.469 --> 01:31:48.260
PROFESSOR: Farmers.

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:50.090
People actually grow this stuff.

01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.590
Absolutely.

01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:52.570
People grow stuff and
have more supply chains.

01:31:52.570 --> 01:31:53.490
And this is true.

01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:55.310
Flour Bakery may
have a little impact,

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:58.797
but McDonald's has enormous
impact on cattle companies,

01:31:58.797 --> 01:32:00.880
and people who supply
tomatoes and lettuce and all

01:32:00.880 --> 01:32:01.421
those things.

01:32:01.421 --> 01:32:01.950
Absolutely.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:02.940
Huge impact.

01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:04.786
Industries are built
around these things.

01:32:04.786 --> 01:32:07.642
AUDIENCE: We also listed
internet providers

01:32:07.642 --> 01:32:10.350
because they offer free
Wi-Fi to the customers.

01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:11.510
PROFESSOR: Free Wi-Fi to
the customers as well.

01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:12.510
Let's go back to slides, please.

01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.990
Thank you.

01:32:12.990 --> 01:32:13.730
This is excellent.

01:32:13.730 --> 01:32:14.410
You did a great job.

01:32:14.410 --> 01:32:15.951
Did we give them a
round of applause?

01:32:15.951 --> 01:32:18.632
[APPLAUSE]

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:23.764
You got that.

01:32:23.764 --> 01:32:25.180
This is what we
care about though.

01:32:25.180 --> 01:32:27.138
Why do we care about
doing this and why are you

01:32:27.138 --> 01:32:28.730
going to be doing
this yourselves?

01:32:28.730 --> 01:32:30.790
It's starts out with
systems thinking.

01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:32.680
Establishing a
global perspective

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.030
about the little problem
you're trying to solve.

01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:37.180
If I said, make a
calculator-- a calculator

01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.420
doesn't exist in isolation.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.170
It affects a lot of things and
can affect a lot of things.

01:32:41.170 --> 01:32:43.820
We want to maintain a
really big perspective

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:46.004
over every small
decision we make.

01:32:46.004 --> 01:32:47.420
Because of that,
we can understand

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:49.430
how to make good
decisions and trade-offs,

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:51.970
establish priorities or
reestablish them, and be

01:32:51.970 --> 01:32:53.890
able to communicate
more effectively.

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:56.170
Not all stakeholders have
the same amount of value

01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:57.000
to a company.

01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.760
Different stakeholders hold
different kinds of value.

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.804
Joanne may say, look, I
really care about my customers

01:33:02.804 --> 01:33:04.220
but she may not
say, I really care

01:33:04.220 --> 01:33:05.970
about the people
who work at the gym.

01:33:05.970 --> 01:33:08.870
So she may not say, let me
put extra fat in the products

01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:11.792
and then advertise, by the
way, with these things,

01:33:11.792 --> 01:33:13.250
if you care about
it, I'll give you

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:16.260
a discount to the
gym membership.

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:18.560
Which stakeholders
do we benefit more

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.230
and which stakeholders
benefit us more?

01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:23.024
Sometimes, in a
nonprofit, we might

01:33:23.024 --> 01:33:25.190
think we really want to get
the best thing out there

01:33:25.190 --> 01:33:27.550
no matter what because we
don't care about making profit.

01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:29.260
Other times you think, well, we
want to get the best thing out

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.910
there, kind of, but
we also want to make

01:33:30.910 --> 01:33:33.076
sure we're balancing that
out with our stakeholders.

01:33:34.989 --> 01:33:36.530
An example of this
is angel investors

01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:37.488
versus venture capital.

01:33:37.488 --> 01:33:39.410
If you're starting a
company, angel investors

01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:40.740
will give you a
little bit of money.

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.490
It's a little bit
easier to get the money.

01:33:42.490 --> 01:33:44.900
And there's far fewer strings
attached to that money.

01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:47.880
A venture capitalist will give
you money-- much more money,

01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:50.110
but they have a lot
more requirements.

01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:52.290
And so each of them need
different kinds of things.

01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:53.925
Angel investors don't need
a whole bunch of return

01:33:53.925 --> 01:33:54.940
on their investment.

01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:56.440
And a venture
capitalist says no, we

01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.576
want to make a ton of cash.

01:33:57.576 --> 01:33:58.950
So we'll give you
more, but we're

01:33:58.950 --> 01:34:01.325
going to take a lot more back
and have more requirements.

01:34:01.325 --> 01:34:02.820
So different kinds
of stakeholders

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:06.650
would allow us to figure
out which do we use.

01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:08.810
If we understand this
network very clearly,

01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:11.220
it helps us to understand
priorities and trade-offs.

01:34:11.220 --> 01:34:13.080
And then, if I
understand this diagram

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.530
and convey this to
you very specifically,

01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:17.220
it could help us align the team.

01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:20.500
So my software is sold
to people at companies.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.190
If everybody in my
company knows who

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:25.510
those people are, who makes
the buying decisions, who

01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:26.350
is going to use it.

01:34:26.350 --> 01:34:28.400
Are they the same people
or different people.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.400
How do I make sure that
the buying person gets

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.000
what they need and the person
using it gets what they need.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.580
They may need different things.

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.530
And even though the
people who use it

01:34:37.530 --> 01:34:40.220
may use 90% of the
functionality and the people who

01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:44.940
buy it may use almost
none of it, or 1%,

01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:47.150
do I want to invest that
1% of the functionality

01:34:47.150 --> 01:34:49.100
even if it costs me a
lot of time and effort?

01:34:49.100 --> 01:34:51.510
Maybe I have to.

01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:53.780
So it can reveal hidden
cost and opportunities.

01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.610
A cost.

01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:57.890
A student can get an
easy or a difficult C.

01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:00.890
From a parent's perspective,
which is better?

01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:04.200
The easy A or the
really difficult say?

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.141
Please pass the class.

01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:07.390
I'm your parent paying for it.

01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:09.650
I don't want to have to pay
for you to take it again.

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:11.570
So maybe they might
think it's really better

01:35:11.570 --> 01:35:12.642
to have an easy A class.

01:35:12.642 --> 01:35:14.350
But maybe from the
student's perspective,

01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:16.232
they think, the
harder C is-- I'm

01:35:16.232 --> 01:35:17.440
going to learn a lot more in.

01:35:17.440 --> 01:35:19.830
And it's better for
me and my future.

01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:21.330
Or an opportunity.

01:35:21.330 --> 01:35:23.420
If a company has enough
employees, for example,

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.039
a company can get
better buying power

01:35:25.039 --> 01:35:26.580
with vendors or the
gym or something.

01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:27.910
Because we have
so many employees

01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:29.910
they say, look, we want
to have our employees go

01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:31.955
to your gym or maybe
some competitor's gym.

01:35:31.955 --> 01:35:34.330
If you give a bigger discount,
we have more buying power.

01:35:34.330 --> 01:35:37.750
Or to the vendors like Walmart.

01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:41.210
Walmart doesn't pay
much for anything

01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:42.600
because they sell so much.

01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:44.320
And it's such a
valuable brand to have

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:47.080
when you're selling
something that they

01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.250
make their vendors cut
their prices way down-- as

01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:50.790
low as they can
possibly get them.

01:35:50.790 --> 01:35:51.830
And the idea is that
for them is they

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.640
pass their savings
on to the customers.

01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:58.530
For the homework, I
want you to map out

01:35:58.530 --> 01:36:00.750
primary and secondary
stakeholders,

01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:03.630
and more if you'd
like for two things.

01:36:03.630 --> 01:36:06.870
An art museum and a new
kind of battery technology.

01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:10.350
So one's a museum and
one is a technology.

01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:12.550
Starting with technology
in the center.

01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:13.714
I'm thinking about that.

01:36:13.714 --> 01:36:15.130
All the different
ways it connects

01:36:15.130 --> 01:36:16.338
to everything else around it.

01:36:16.338 --> 01:36:17.820
A new kind of better technology.

01:36:17.820 --> 01:36:19.950
If you have something in
mind, you could use that.

01:36:19.950 --> 01:36:21.241
Just let us know what you used.

01:36:21.241 --> 01:36:23.980
And if you don't really quite
know about battery technology,

01:36:23.980 --> 01:36:27.590
you could just kind of think
about what it might affect.

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:30.710
That's the objective here.

01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:34.170
Understanding your stakeholders
will make a huge shift

01:36:34.170 --> 01:36:36.020
in your ability
to make decisions,

01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:39.850
to think globally from
a systems perspective.

01:36:39.850 --> 01:36:43.520
And if you can do that
on little small projects,

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:47.464
as the projects get bigger and
more complicated and complex,

01:36:47.464 --> 01:36:49.130
you'll be able to
make better decisions.

01:36:49.130 --> 01:36:50.240
And it will help
you make decisions

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.500
when you're not too sure what
to do because at least you'll

01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:54.620
have a framework and be
able to communicate that

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:56.100
to other people on the team.

01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.900
And they can say,
yes, we understand

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:00.160
that that's an important
feature to add--

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:03.990
to spend weeks or months
adding because someone needs it

01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:05.880
in order for us to
sell the product.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:08.360
Any questions about
stakeholders or research

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:12.650
or Dieter Rams or Johnny Ive?

01:37:12.650 --> 01:37:14.192
AUDIENCE: Is the
homework for Monday?

01:37:14.192 --> 01:37:15.816
PROFESSOR: This
homework is for Monday.

01:37:15.816 --> 01:37:17.750
In fact, I will show
you on the next slide

01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:19.680
what you've done so far.

01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:20.809
We had an introduction.

01:37:20.809 --> 01:37:22.475
We went over the 10
step design process.

01:37:22.475 --> 01:37:24.620
We actually moved
Dieter Rams to today.

01:37:24.620 --> 01:37:28.340
And what's due on Monday
is the game design

01:37:28.340 --> 01:37:31.880
and the stakeholder
analysis for games.

01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.060
Have a wonderful weekend.

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:36.040
If you have any questions,

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:37.790
Thank you.

WEBVTT

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.470
ADAM MARTIN: All right, so we're
going to switch gears again

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.060
today, and we're going to move
off of kind of pure genetics

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.150
and start to talk about
molecular genetics.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.650
And I want to start with
the concept of-- let's say

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.490
you want to identify
a piece of DNA,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:40.210
purify it, and propagate
it so that you have it

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.000
for future use.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.360
And so the process of doing
this is known as cloning.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.750
And it's the process
of, if you will,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.140
purifying and propagating a
piece of DNA in an organism.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.600
So sort of the goal
for this lecture

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.530
is for you to know how if
you wanted to, let's say,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.690
identify a piece of DNA--

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.850
maybe you're interested
in the piece of DNA

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.860
that contains a given gene.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.170
How would you go about getting
that DNA in a state that can be

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.050
propagated sort of on and on?

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.930
And how can you identify
the piece of DNA you want?

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.270
And so one tool that
we're going to use

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.010
is we're going to use an
organism bacteria as a tool.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.070
So I'll draw my sample
bacteria cell here.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.670
Could be something like E.
coli, just some bacterium.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:03.280
And you'll recall, when I talked
about cells a few weeks ago,

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.580
bacteria and
prokaryotic cells have

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.560
a chromosome called the
nucleoid that's present inside.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.420
So that's the
bacterial chromosome.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.760
But bacteria can also have
extra chromosomal pieces of DNA

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.308
that are called plasmids that
exist in their cytoplasm.

00:02:26.308 --> 00:02:27.100
These are plasmids.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.360
And these extra
chromosomal pieces of DNA

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.440
replicate independently
of the chromosome.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.200
And they can persist
in the bacterial cell

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.390
and be passed on
to the daughters

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.520
of this bacterial cell as
the bacterial cells divide.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.200
So if we focus on an individual
plasmid, what a plasmid would

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.840
look like, often they have
a cassette or a gene that

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.260
confers antibiotic resistance.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.340
And that's often the reason that
these bacteria are harboring

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.510
these plasmids, because it
gives them a sort of advantage

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:16.450
if they're exposed to
a certain antibiotic

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.460
from a predator organism.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.590
So this would confer
antibiotic resistance.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.770
One common example is
ampicillin resistance,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.380
which I'll abbreviate just
amp with an R next to it.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.030
But these plasmids, for them to
propagate from bacterial cell

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.100
to bacterial cell,
they also need

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.680
to be able to
undergo replication.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:52.720
So they also have what is known
as an origin of replication,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.880
which is often abbreviated
ori, which basically allows

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.850
this plasmid to be replicated
such that copies of the plasma

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.390
are passed on to the subsequent
generation of bacteria.

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.750
And we can take advantage
of this plasmid system

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.450
in bacteria, because we
could take, let's say,

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.420
a piece of foreign DNA--

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.980
and this foreign DNA could
be of eukaryotic origin.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.620
We could take a piece
of eukaryotic DNA

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.900
and insert it inside
of this plasmid.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.780
And we can basically use the
plasma as a sort of platform

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.260
or a vector to carry
the piece of DNA

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.960
that we might be
interested in and to use

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.370
the bacteria to replicate
that DNA and pass it

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.530
on to its descendants
so that you essentially

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.110
have a clone of
bacteria, and you

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:01.150
have a clone of this DNA in
a given bacterial population.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.210
So, again, this would
have an origin and maybe

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.550
an ampicillin resistance to it.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.350
So how would you
determine whether or not

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.416
bacteria have a plasmid in it?

00:05:15.416 --> 00:05:17.110
Can you think of
an experiment you

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:22.730
could do to determine whether
the bacteria has this plasmid?

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:23.410
Stephen?

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.868
AUDIENCE: You could
add ampicillin,

00:05:24.868 --> 00:05:26.555
and it'll survive
with the plasmid.

00:05:26.555 --> 00:05:27.430
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.360
So what Stephen
suggested is that if he

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.510
wanted to know whether
or not this bacteria had

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.950
the plasmid in it, he would
add ampicillin to the media.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.190
And if the bacteria
doesn't have the plasmid,

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.940
it won't be able to grow.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.560
But if it has the plasma,
it encodes this gene

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.380
that confers
ampicillin resistance,

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.530
and it will thus
be able to grow.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:54.860
So that's exactly right.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:59.950
So you're able to select for
bacteria with a given plasmid

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:06.280
by simply growing it on media
that contains an antibiotic.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.410
I now want to go through steps
in cloning a piece of DNA.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.960
And we'll go through it sort
of as a series of ordered steps

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.980
so you can see how
the process works.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.155
I'm going to start with
a step to cut the DNA.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.585
After cutting the DNA, we'll
then mix pieces together.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.930
Once we mix the
pieces together, we'll

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:37.060
do something known
as a ligation,

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.030
and I'll explain that
to you in just a minute.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.470
And then, finally,
we'll end with selecting

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:51.140
the plasmids that have the piece
of foreign DNA that we want.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:53.650
And this is known
as recombinant DNA,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.130
because you've recombined
a piece of DNA from one

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.890
organism-- it could be
a eukaryotic organism,

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.630
like humans--

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.110
with a piece of DNA that's
from a prokaryotic cell,

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.360
a bacterium.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.940
So we then have some sort
of selection process.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.260
So we're going to go
through this step-by-step.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:20.180
And we're going to start
with cutting DNA, OK?

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.535
So, cutting DNA.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.070
And it turns out,
we've talked about--

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.130
what type of enzyme do
you think would cut DNA?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.590
Just generally, not as specific
as what's up on the slide.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.520
What type of enzyme
would cleave DNA?

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:54.282
Think about how
enzymes are named.

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:55.240
AUDIENCE: DNase?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.020
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah,
so Stephen suggested

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.590
DNase, which is a really
good suggestion, right?

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:05.090
So an enzyme that will
cut DNA would be a DNase.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:07.010
Another word for
that is a nuclease.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.950
It's some type of nuclease.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.140
And the type of nuclease
we're going to talk about

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.040
is going to be an endonuclease.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.200
We talked about
exonucleases, which

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.640
chew DNA from the ends in the
context of DNA replication.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.330
But what an
endonuclease is, is it's

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:34.590
a nuclease that's going to
recognize a fragment of DNA

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.000
and cleave it in the middle.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.740
So it doesn't require an end.

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.250
It's going to chop it
right in the middle.

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.370
And there's a type
of endonuclease,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.630
and these are called
restriction endonucleases.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.300
They are nucleases that
our natively present

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:55.070
in a lot of different bacteria.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.370
And these restriction
endonucleases essentially

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.010
look through the DNA
sequence, and they

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:06.290
recognize a specific
sequence of nucleotides

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:10.070
and make a cut right
at that sequence.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.870
So I have a few examples
to show you here.

00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:17.180
The first is this EcoR1
restriction endonuclease.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:24.760
EcoR1's from E. coli, and it
recognizes the sequence GAATTC.

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.320
So it recognizes
this six-nucleotide .

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.160
Sequence and it cleaves
the double-stranded DNA

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.985
on the top strand
between the G and the A

00:09:33.985 --> 00:09:37.880
and on the bottom strand
between the G and the A, OK?

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.790
And you can see that the
two cuts are staggered.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:45.770
So when this cut is made, it
leaves the DNA with two ends,

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:51.020
and they're sticky, because
there's a five-prime overhang

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:52.430
at each end.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.805
So each end has
this TTAA sequence.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.700
And these nucleotide
bases can base pair

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:04.910
with the complementary sequence.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:08.030
So this sequence could
base pair with a sequence

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.290
that has an end AATT.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:15.290
So these two ends that
I've generated here

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:17.210
could stick to each
other, or there

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.560
could be other ends that
have the TTAA sequence that

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.590
could stick to them.

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.880
So another example is
this Kpn1 endonuclease.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.280
And this is from a
different bacterium.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.000
But again, it cleaves the
DNA on the two strands.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.270
And this time, it
cleaves the top strand

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:40.370
farther down the sequence.

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.440
And that generates what's known
as a three-prime overhang.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.260
But again, you have an overhang.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.410
So this is what is known
as having a sticky end.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:50.840
Because again, these
nucleotides are

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.430
available to base pair with
a complementary sequence.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.560
The final type of
restriction enzyme

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.560
that I'll tell you
about is EcoR5,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.770
which is a different
enzyme from E. coli.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.650
And this generates a
break, but this time, it

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:10.700
cuts at the same position
on both DNA strands.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:14.390
And that generates an end
that's known as a blunt end,

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.010
because there's no
overhang, and there

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:20.270
are no nucleotides that
would sort of basically

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:25.890
recognize a complementary sort
of end like the sticky ends do,

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.620
OK?

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:31.130
So these are several of
many, many different types

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.680
of restriction
endonucleases that

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.825
are present in a wide
range of bacteria.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:42.770
So then, now that
you have a tool that

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.130
allows you to cut DNA,
you could then cut DNA

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.810
from two different sources.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.300
And I've outlined that here.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:56.060
The vector is what the plasmid
DNA is commonly referred to.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:59.810
So we commonly refer to
this prokaryotic part

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.500
of the plasmid, the
vector DNA, and the part

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.060
that we're trying to insert
that's the foreign DNA,

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.920
the insert.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.795
That's just kind of
the lingo in the field.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.300
So here, I have a plasmid.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.440
It looks like a plasmid.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:20.190
It has an origin of replication.

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:22.400
It has ampicillin resistance.

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.270
And it has this EcoR1 site,
which just means that this DNA

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:30.380
sequence has a GAATTC, OK?

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.260
So it's something that will be
recognized by this restriction

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:34.940
endonuclease.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:39.200
And then if you cut
this enzyme with EcoR1,

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.360
you start with the
linear piece, right?

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.060
So I, at 6:00 AM, started
engineering this here.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.570
So let's say I have
my plasmid DNA,

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.700
and I cut it at the EcoR1 site.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.500
Then I cleave it.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.770
If you cleave a circle, now you
have a linear piece of DNA, OK?

00:13:01.770 --> 00:13:04.620
But it has sticky ends, right?

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.260
And these sticky ends--

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.110
so pretend that this is
a foreign piece of DNA.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.440
This is my eukaryotic DNA.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.890
Let's pretend it carries
the gene elastin.

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.410
And this has ends, too.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:23.310
And if they're EcoR1
ends, then they

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:27.540
will be able to stick to the
sticky ends of the plasmid.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.370
And if you just
get one sticking,

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.100
now you have this
piece of DNA which

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.950
is two different
fragments in tandem.

00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:36.720
But it's going to
be moving around

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.850
in space in the cytoplasm.

00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.140
And at some point, it might
be recognized and stick

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:45.450
to the other EcoR1 end.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:49.860
And then you have now a
circular piece of DNA again,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.440
but now your
circular piece of DNA

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.080
has this piece of
foreign DNA that's

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.100
present inside the vector,
which is the sort of poster tape

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.630
here.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:02.240
So I just wanted
to show you that.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.690
So you can kind of--

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.190
when you're doing
molecular biology,

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.960
you have to imagine
the sort of end

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.270
stick sticking to each
other and how they're

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:12.870
going to sort of wrap around and
connect for the final product.

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:20.070
OK, so let's say you get
DNA, and your DNA could

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:25.290
be eukaryotic DNA from,
let's say, humans or flies

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.680
or whatever your
favorite eukaryote is.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.700
And in the genome
of that organism,

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.640
there will be many
restriction sites.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.010
But if you chop it
up, you will get

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.420
various fragments that
have sticky ends for EcoR1

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.890
on both sides.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.730
And then if you mixed the
vector and the insert together,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:51.030
you have some probability
of getting that insert

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:55.860
to be incorporated
into the vector.

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.220
And then once this is
present and ligated together,

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.140
you can then put
this into bacteria,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:02.490
and it will be replicated.

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:16.770
So we focused on cutting, but
if you mix these together,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.990
like I showed you
at the tape, you're

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.210
going to have sticky
ends that come together

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.040
and stick together.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.623
And you'll eventually
get a situation

00:15:25.623 --> 00:15:26.790
where you have your insert--

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.910
so you have your
insert here that

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:37.080
might have your gene of interest
and your vector DNA here.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.960
But when these things
initially stick together,

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.130
you don't have a single
molecule where everything

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:45.780
is covalently attached, right?

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.890
You just have these base pair
interactions between the two

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.470
overhangs as they
stick to each other

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.540
through base pair interactions.

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:58.530
So if we think about
what's going on right here,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:03.560
you have, initially, if
we're thinking about EcoR1,

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.900
a sequence that is--

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.900
oh, sorry, this
should be a C. This

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.680
is the nucleotide sequence, but
when it's sticking together,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:18.630
the top strand will have a
free five-prime phosphate

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.400
on this adenosine,
and there will

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:25.470
be no covalent bond between this
adenosine and this guanosine.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.810
So that's what the top
strand would look like.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.260
The bottom strand
would look like this,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.640
where there are covalent
bonds along the DNA backbone.

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.830
Sorry.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:41.670
Had a mutation there.

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.880
And this is incorporated
in a broader sequence.

00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:49.110
And this bottom strand will
have a free five-prime phosphate

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.160
here and a free
three-prime hydroxyl here,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.300
but there's no
covalent bond here.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.240
There's no covalent
bond here, right?

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.240
So, at this stage, you don't
have a single piece of DNA.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:05.130
You have two pieces of DNA that
are interacting with each other

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.650
through base pair interactions.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:11.290
So, eventually, you want it
to be a single piece of DNA.

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.940
And so you have to perform
a step that is known as--

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:18.460
sorry, my phosphate
got in the way.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.750
But you want to perform what's
known as a ligation, where you

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.750
take something that's
just sticking together

00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:28.020
through nucleotide
base pair interactions

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.050
and you add a type
of enzyme, which

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:34.560
is called DNA
ligase, to catalyze

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.630
the formation of covalent
bonds here and here.

00:17:39.630 --> 00:17:43.380
So DNA ligase is an
enzyme that if you

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:45.810
have a three
five-prime phosphate

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:48.300
here and a free
three-prime hydroxyl,

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.480
it'll catalyze the formation
of a phosphodiester

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.460
bond between these
two bases and the DNA.

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:00.525
So this DNA ligase forms
a phosphodiester bond.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:13.110
And you go from having no
bond there to having a bond.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:19.140
So then you eventually
would get this sequence now,

00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:26.640
where you have covalent bonds
between each of the base pairs.

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.070
And what you see here is you've
recreated the EcoR1 site.

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:35.040
So when you get two
EcoR1 sticky ends

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.220
sort of recognizing each other
and sticking to each other

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.290
and then you ligate
them together,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:44.700
you recreate that nuclease site
so that you can cleave it again

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.200
with the EcoR1 enzyme.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.450
So now, moving on.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:55.680
I'll move on right here.

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.490
So the last step is that
once we have pieces of DNA

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.270
with this insert--

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:09.270
and let's say we're trying
to find a piece of DNA

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.640
from a eukaryotic organism.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.680
We might start with an animal.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.590
We have to extract
its chromosomal DNA,

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:19.260
digest it with a
restriction enzyme,

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.200
and then we digest the vector
with the same restriction

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.190
enzyme.

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:24.920
And then we're going to make--

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.810
we're going to randomly
insert these pieces of DNA

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.320
into different vectors
such that each bacteria who

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.990
gets one of these
plasmids will be

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.810
replicating a different
piece of DNA that's

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:39.840
of eukaryotic origin.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.060
And this is what is
known as a DNA library.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.440
So this is making a DNA library.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.410
And a DNA library is
essentially a collection

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:57.840
of different pieces of DNA
that are from some source, OK?

00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.110
But different bacterial
clones will be replicating

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:05.220
a different piece of that DNA.

00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:08.010
So you can see the
challenge now is

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:11.460
to find the needle in
the haystack, right?

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:14.400
You're trying to find that
one piece of DNA which is

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:17.550
the one you're interested in.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.580
And I'll talk about
several strategies

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:23.730
that you can use to
find the piece of DNA

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:25.770
that you're interested in.

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:27.210
I'll focus on selection.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:29.100
But first, I just
want to differentiate

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.500
between two different
types of ways you could

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.940
search for a piece of DNA.

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.460
You could do a screen.

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.760
And this is similar to what we
talked about on Monday, where

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.420
you look through a whole
population of individuals,

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.610
and you look for
a given phenotype.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.360
So in the case of
flies, we talked

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.640
about how Morgan's
lab was looking

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.190
for differences in eye color.

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:54.870
And that was a
screen, because they

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.820
looked through a
ton of normal flies

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.860
to find the one they want.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.290
Another strategy
would be to do what's

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:06.810
called a selection, where you
kill off everything that's not

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.770
what you want by making
the organism grow

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:14.220
in some sort of
selective condition.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.320
And then you only
allow the organisms

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.810
to grow that are the
ones that you want.

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:21.860
So this is called a selection.

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.200
And I'm going to illustrate
several examples of selections,

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.920
just so that you get an
idea of how this works.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:34.290
So the first example I'll
give is antibiotic resistance.

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.620
And as Stephen so kindly pointed
out earlier in the lecture,

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.950
the way we can select for
bacteria that have taken up

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.220
this plasmid is to
select the bacteria that

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:56.580
grow in the presence
of the antibiotic.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.580
So let's say you had a
population of bacteria

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.200
and let's say this
started out being

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.080
sensitive to an antibiotic.

00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.680
You could transform
them with DNA

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.570
from a strain that's resistant.

00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:18.480
And maybe that resistant
strain has a plasmid

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:23.160
that has a gene that confers
antibiotic resistance, in which

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:27.030
case, if it's taken up by
this sensitive bacteria,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:34.410
if you then grow it on a
plate that has the antibiotic,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.170
you might get a colony
or a clone of cells

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.210
that has taken up
the piece of DNA

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:43.050
that you're interested in--
in this case, the piece of DNA

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:47.070
that confers
antibiotic resistance.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.180
Everyone see how that works?

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.390
So you're selecting
only the cells

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.910
to grow here that have taken
up this antibiotic resistance

00:22:54.910 --> 00:22:55.410
gene.

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.430
I'm going to use another
example now from yeast,

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.840
and it involves functional
complementation.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.490
And I'm going to
start with something

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.240
that involves the biosynthesis
of an essential amino acid.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:21.360
And then I'm going to go to a
more interesting case, which

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.050
is a case that involves an
experiment that involved

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.410
the identification of the master
regulator of cell division

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.790
in humans.

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:33.890
But we'll start with just
amino acid biosynthesis.

00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:39.090
And there are mutants of
yeast known as auxotrophs.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:44.820
And these are mutant yeast,
or mutant microorganisms,

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.360
that fail to produce
an essential nutrient.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:53.820
So an auxotroph is a
mutant that fails to make

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.050
a nutrient that's essential.

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.940
So fails to make a nutrient.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:09.630
And the opposite of an auxotroph
is called a prototroph.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:18.150
A prototroph is essentially
a normal-functioning

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:20.760
microorganism that's
able to produce

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.270
all of the essential nutrients
that it needs in order

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:26.550
to grow and survive, OK?

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.160
So this produces all nutrients.

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:41.340
And so let's say you had
an auxotroph for leucine.

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:45.990
So you had a strain that if you
didn't provide leucine to it,

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.690
it would fail to grow.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:52.080
So we'll start with
a leucine auxotroph.

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.120
And let's say you
want to identify

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.170
the gene that's defective
in this leucine auxotroph.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:06.000
You'd perform a similar
strategy to this one, where

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.620
you'd have your auxotroph
that you're transforming,

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.260
so your auxotroph down here.

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:16.740
And you would transform
that strain with DNA

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.270
from what organism?

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:24.590
If you're trying to identify
the functional gene,

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.230
what organism would
you use to produce

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:30.654
the DNA you're going to
transform into that organism?

00:25:30.654 --> 00:25:31.590
AUDIENCE: Prototroph?

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:33.440
ADAM MARTIN: Javier's
exactly right.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.390
You'd use the prototroph, right?

00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:40.470
So in this case, you would
use DNA from the prototroph,

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.120
because the prototroph has a
functional copy of that gene.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.220
You know it does,
because it's able to grow

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.680
without adding leucine.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.290
And then you could take the
auxotroph mutants that's

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.260
transformed with DNA
from the prototroph,

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.560
and you played it on media.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.460
And what should be a
property of the media?

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:06.700
Should leucine be
present or absent?

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.272
Carmen?

00:26:07.272 --> 00:26:07.980
AUDIENCE: Absent.

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.120
ADAM MARTIN: It should
be absent, exactly right.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.370
So you'd look on
plates that lack

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.010
leucine or minus for leucine.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.160
And you'd select for colonies
that now are all of a sudden

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.040
able to grow leucine.

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:27.220
So you've restored the function
of leucine biosynthesis

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.860
in this clone, and you've made
it into a prototroph again.

00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:38.540
OK, this is what's known as
functional complementation,

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.580
because you're
taking a cell that

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.610
is defective in some function,
and you're complementing it.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:51.470
You're complementing or
rescuing the phenotype, OK?

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.740
Now, even as a former
yeast geneticist,

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:59.060
I don't find amino acid
biosynthesis and functional

00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:03.300
complementation in the context
of leucine all that exciting.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.650
So I want to present
one last example that

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:13.220
involves an experiment that is
going to involve the yeast cell

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:13.940
cycle mutants.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.720
And I'm going to tell you
about the experiment that

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.210
led to the cloning of the master
regulator of cell division

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:27.830
in humans.

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:33.080
And it involves a yeast mutant,
and specifically, a yeast cell

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.390
cycle mutant.

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:37.940
And these yeast
cell cycle mutants

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.420
are what are known as
conditional mutants.

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.810
They are isolated as
conditional mutants,

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.510
meaning that these
mutants are able to grow

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.660
under certain conditions,
but not others.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:55.040
And specifically, the condition
they used is temperature,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:57.470
so they're
temperature-sensitive mutants.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:06.020
The yeast cells can grow at 25
degrees, but not at 37 degrees.

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.110
So this is known as a
temperature-sensitive mutant,

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:12.200
where you can propagate the
mutant at one temperature,

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.540
but then you can see if
you raise the temperature,

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:16.730
then it stops growing.

00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:18.530
And so you can see
the mutant phenotype,

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:21.530
because normal wild
type functional

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.170
yeast can grow at
both temperatures.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:28.190
So this is a special
type of mutant.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.440
And I'm going to tell you
about an experiment done

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:36.890
by Paul Nurse, who's an
excellent yeast geneticist.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:41.840
And what he did was he used
these yeast cell cycle mutants

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.860
to identify the
human gene for what's

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:57.860
now known as cyclin-dependent
kinase, or CDK for short.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.010
This is the master
regulator of cell division

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:05.810
in organisms ranging from yeast
all the way up to humans, OK?

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:11.210
But he used yeast as a model
system to identify this gene.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.600
And the process was
he took yeast cells--

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.820
and Paul Nurse worked
on fission yeast cells,

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.980
which are rod-shaped cells.

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:20.855
And he identified yeast mutants.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:25.370
Yeast mutants.

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:30.530
And he had a mutant in
the CDK gene of yeast.

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.700
He didn't really
know it at the time.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.710
But the yeast CDK mutant--

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:40.010
what he knew was that this
mutant was critically involved

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:42.770
in the cell cycle in
numerous types of yeast.

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.960
So he knew this is
an important gene.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.780
And what he wanted
to do was to identify

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:50.030
if humans had an
equivalent gene that

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:53.780
could function in the same way.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:57.530
So if you just have this CDK
mutant and do nothing to it,

00:29:57.530 --> 00:30:01.160
it will not grow
at 37 degrees, OK?

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.990
But what he did was to
take a DNA library--

00:30:05.990 --> 00:30:07.670
similar to what I
showed you before,

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:11.900
where you just chop up
DNA from an organism.

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.090
In this case, he's using
a human DNA library.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:17.060
And he used a particular
type of library,

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.135
but I'm going to skip
over that for now

00:30:19.135 --> 00:30:21.040
and come back to it later.

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:25.170
So he used a human DNA library.

00:30:25.170 --> 00:30:26.910
That's just a
collection of pieces

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.210
of DNA from a human source, OK?

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.780
So he's taking human
DNA, putting it

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:36.930
into a yeast plasmid,
and transforming yeast

00:30:36.930 --> 00:30:38.790
with that human DNA.

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:41.370
And he's looking
for a piece of DNA

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.330
that's able to complement
the CDK mutant,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.220
meaning the yeast
cells would then

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.250
be able to grow at the
non-permissive temperature

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.070
of 37 degrees.

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:57.390
So he then looks for, on
a plate, colonies of yeast

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:00.030
that are growing at the
non-permissive temperature

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:01.810
of 37 degrees.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:03.930
So if you didn't do
anything with this mutant,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.020
if you didn't transform in
the DNA, nothing would grow.

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:10.230
But he identified
pieces of human DNA

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:16.310
that rescued the phenotype
of this mutant, OK?

00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:24.930
And so these are yeast that
have the human gene for CDK,

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:27.690
and they now grow.

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:31.050
And this is a functional
complementation experiment,

00:31:31.050 --> 00:31:34.750
because you're rescuing
the growth of this yeast

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:38.850
now not with a yeast gene,
but with a human gene.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:43.770
And this human CDK gene is so
conserved across eukaryotes

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:47.010
that it's able to still
function in a yeast cell, which

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:48.940
is pretty amazing.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.996
So this just outlines
the experiment here.

00:31:51.996 --> 00:31:54.690
At 25 degrees,
these yeast mutants

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:57.750
can grow and form colonies.

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.900
And at that temperature,
you can transform the yeast

00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.650
with different
pieces of human DNA.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:07.530
Most of the human DNA is not
going to be what you want.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.660
You're looking for the
needle in the haystack.

00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.810
So most of these are not
going to grow at 37 degree.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:16.950
But you're looking for this guy
here that gets the human CDK,

00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:21.750
and that restores growth
to this mutant strain.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.320
So voila, you get a colony
of cells that are growing.

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:28.020
And boom, Paul Nurse
wins a Nobel Prize

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:31.440
and the rest of the yeast field,
as well, or a number of people

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.990
who are working on
cell cycle mutants.

00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:35.820
This is one of the
experiments that

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:41.370
led to the 2001 Nobel Prize
for a bunch of yeast cell cycle

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.360
geneticists.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:46.710
All right, so I've told
you about how to find

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:47.835
the needle in the haystack.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:55.500
And this was more common when we
didn't know the genome sequence

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.760
of an organism.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.420
But now I want to tell you how
knowing the genome sequence

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:04.620
of an organism would allow
you to replicate and amplify

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:11.280
a piece of DNA in vitro.

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:15.630
So I'm going to tell you about
an approach known as Polymerase

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:19.140
Chain Reaction, or PCR.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.600
And what PCR is, is
it's an in vitro method.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:31.920
So it's an in vitro approach
to essentially amplify DNA.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.880
And so let's say you
have a piece of DNA--

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.400
it could be a piece
of DNA in the genome--

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.230
and you know the
sequence of this DNA.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:51.300
And it has base pairs
between the two strands.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:53.910
So, normally, for DNA
replication to occur,

00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:56.387
what do you need?

00:33:56.387 --> 00:33:57.470
What needs to happen here?

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.260
Can a polymerase get in now?

00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:04.760
No?

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:05.750
Why not?

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:07.156
Miles?

00:34:07.156 --> 00:34:09.621
AUDIENCE: The DNA's going to--

00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:12.579
because they'll try and
[INAUDIBLE] away [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:12.579 --> 00:34:14.550
from each other, so you
have to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.550
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah, you
have to unwind it, right?

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.239
So you have to
denature it first.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.510
So if you do nature it, now you
have two single-stranded pieces

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:26.510
of DNA, right?

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.570
Now what would a polymerase
need to replicate that?

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:32.290
Yeah, Jeremy?

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.040
AUDIENCE: A prime.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:33.957
ADAM MARTIN: A primer.

00:34:33.957 --> 00:34:35.040
Exactly, right?

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.170
And if you know
the sequence, you

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:40.590
can have a company
synthesize a primer that's

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:44.520
the exact sequence here
and base pairs here.

00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:46.650
And I'll just draw the
five-prime end of the primer

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:47.699
right there.

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:51.840
And now this primer has a free
three-prime hydroxyl here.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.639
And if you added
a polymerase, it

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:56.820
would synthesize this
bottom strand here.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.515
So this is known as
the forward primer.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:03.640
And on the other
strand, you can design

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:08.150
a primer that's complementary
to these bases here.

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:10.780
Again, the five-primer
end is out.

00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.600
This would be known
as the reverse primer.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.480
And then you could
have the DNA polymerase

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.670
synthesize the opposite strand.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.460
All right, so the step here
will be to first denature.

00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:28.310
So the first step would
be to melt or denature

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:30.355
the DNA, double-stranded DNA.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.630
So you denature the
double-stranded DNA.

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:40.870
This is commonly done
above 90 degrees Celsius.

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.460
And then the next
step is once you

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.400
have these single-stranded
pieces of DNA,

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.540
you can act you can have a
primer present that anneals

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:51.730
to the opposite strands.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.850
So you can have
primer annealing.

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.880
And this is commonly done
between 50 and 60 degrees

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.670
Celsius.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.290
You have to cool it down so that
the primer can now base pair,

00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:10.600
such that not
everything is denatured.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.670
So you have to cool it
down for these primers

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:16.030
to recognize their cognate
sequence and base pair with it.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.970
And then once you have
the primer annealed

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:26.530
to the template, then you
can add DNA polymerase

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:29.080
to synthesize a new strand.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:35.440
So DNA polymerize for
new strand synthesis.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.300
And this is commonly done at
around 70 degrees Celsius.

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:45.240
And then you can repeat this
process over and over again.

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:48.160
And at each step, you're going
to double the amount of DNA

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.420
that you have between
these two primers.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.540
So let me just-- this is just
a figure illustrating this.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:57.940
It's on the handout and online.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:01.540
Basically, you have your
original double-stranded piece

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:02.870
of DNA.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.860
You denature it and allow
the primers to anneal.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.320
New strand synthesis.

00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:13.260
Then you take these new
pieces of double-stranded DNA,

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.890
denature them.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.950
The primers anneal
to those new strands,

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.540
and now you get new strands.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:22.990
And you just keep doing this
cycle over and over again,

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.620
and you essentially
amplify the piece of DNA

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:30.010
that's between the
two primer sequences.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:31.710
So this is often
used in forensics,

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:34.690
because you can have
very little DNA,

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:37.930
and just by adding
primers, you can really

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:41.080
amplify the number
of pieces of DNA

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:43.360
you have between
these two fragments.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:47.980
So you go from having very
little DNA to a lot of DNA.

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.460
OK, any questions about PCR?

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.620
I'm going to move on
to something that--

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.120
all right.

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:02.190
I've really been focused on
discovery up to this point.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:05.270
But I know that a number
of you are engineers,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:09.470
and you probably want
to engineer something.

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:10.940
And so I've had to--

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.010
I'm going to tell you
about a field that

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:19.040
is moving so rapidly, I'm
going to probably have

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.380
to totally revamp my
lecture for next year, OK?

00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:26.120
And I'm going to tell
you about genome editing.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:31.250
So the last part of this
story, genome or DNA editing.

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.420
And I'm going to tell you
about a specific type of system

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.530
called CRISPR-Cas9, which
has been in the news a lot,

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.170
and there's a lot of
excitement about this approach

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.020
in the context of
editing the human genome

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.870
and possibly curing
genetic diseases.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.690
Who here has heard
of CRISPR-Cas9?

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.040
OK, good.

00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.540
That's good.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.875
Our media is doing its job.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.080
So who knows what it is?

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.120
OK, some of us know what it is.

00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.600
I just want to just give you
a very superficial overview

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.735
of what it is and
why it's important.

00:39:08.735 --> 00:39:10.110
And I'm going to
keep coming back

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:12.270
to it during the
course of the semester,

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.710
because I think it raises
a lot of ethical questions,

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:18.120
and especially in the
context of stem cells.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.160
I need you to know the
foundation before we

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.090
get into the really good stuff.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:26.460
So, let's see.

00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:29.220
So we're going to
engineer something.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:32.710
So we're going to talk
about repairing DNA.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.860
And if we want to
edit the genome,

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.410
the way this is
most often done is

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:41.040
by making a
double-stranded break, OK?

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:45.090
So if you make a double-stranded
break in a piece of DNA,

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.770
it can be repaired
one of two ways.

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:49.770
One is by non-homologous
end joining,

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:52.200
where the two pieces of DNA
are basically just shoved

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.730
back together again.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.370
And this results,
often, in mutations.

00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:58.117
So if you're trying
to fix something,

00:39:58.117 --> 00:39:59.700
unless you're just
trying to break it,

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.770
that's probably
not what you want.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.380
But an alternative
approach to DNA

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.200
repair that organisms
have is something called

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.800
homology-directed repair.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.660
In this case, you can
break a piece of DNA

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:16.170
and add a piece of DNA that
has a different sequence,

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.350
but with homology near where
the double-stranded break is.

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:24.360
And in that case, you can
replace the original sequence

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.690
with what you
provide as donor DNA.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.150
So it gives you an
ability to essentially

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.630
change the DNA sequence
at a given locus

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:39.360
if you're able to cleave
the DNA at a specific locus.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.240
So, first, I want to
start with just a thought

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.470
experiment, right?

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:48.030
You're all thinking, OK, we need
to cleave double-stranded DNA.

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:50.820
And boy, I just gave you
a perfect tool for that.

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:54.030
I gave you all these restriction
endonucleases, right?

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.620
So what's the
problem with those?

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.260
Well, let's think
about the human genome.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.490
The human genome is
3 billion base pairs.

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:08.230
And an EcoR1 site
looks like this--

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.730
GAATTC.

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.000
So it's six nucleotides long.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.790
And if you think of
just a random sequence

00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:21.780
of 3 billion base
pairs, you would

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.890
get this sequence randomly
one out of every four

00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:28.350
to the sixth times.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:35.010
So that's going to be
one every 4,096 times.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:39.930
So if you get this in random
DNA 1 every roughly 4,000 times,

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:42.410
if you use it to cleave
the human genome,

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.760
it's going to cleave
hundreds of thousands

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.460
of places in the human genome.

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.280
So we need much more
specificity if we

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.080
want to select,
let's say, a given

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.800
gene that has a disease-causing
allele and try to fix it.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.140
Because if we use a
restriction endonuclease,

00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:02.650
we just chop up the whole
genome, and that would be bad.

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:05.490
So specificity is the
name of the game here.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:09.030
This is not
specific, and we need

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:11.790
a tool that's more specific.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.150
And that tool is going
to be CRISPR-Cas9.

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:18.870
And what CRISPR-Cas9
is, is it's essentially

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:23.060
an RNA-guided endonuclease.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:29.070
So it's RNA guided, and
it's an endonuclease.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:32.070
Restriction enzymes, right, they
have nothing to do with RNA.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:36.870
They don't use RNA to recognize
the nucleotide sequence.

00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:38.490
It's just a protein,
and the protein

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.070
recognizes the
nucleotide sequence.

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:48.015
In CRISPR-Cas9, you have an
endonuclease, which is Cas9.

00:42:48.015 --> 00:42:51.500
Let's bump this up.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.720
So the endonuclease is the--

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.700
the Cas9 is the protein.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.110
That's the endonuclease.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.440
But its selection of a target
depends on an RNA molecule

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:08.600
that it's bound to, OK?

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:14.000
So the specificity
comes, at least in part,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:20.270
from what's known as a guide
RNA, or single guide RNA.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:24.930
That's what's most often
used in genome editing.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:29.180
So this guide RNA basically
allows this enzyme

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:32.030
to find a specific sequence.

00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:34.730
And the guide RNA
is 20 nucleotides,

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:38.420
or looks for homology for
a 20-nucleotide base pair

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:39.620
sequence.

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:43.040
So you can see, already, we're
doing way better than the six

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.140
base pair recognition motif.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.910
We have 20 nucleotides.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.040
And there are other
components of the system

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.000
which increase the specificity.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.220
Then you have your
Cas9 in blue, which

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:59.350
is the endonuclease, your
RNA, the guide RNA, in black,

00:43:59.350 --> 00:44:01.640
and the template
here is in gray.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.680
And what you see
is this RNA sort

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.570
of exhibiting complementarity
to this target sequence.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:12.260
And only if there's
complementarity between the RNA

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.140
and the target will
this endonuclease

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:18.800
get activated and
cleave at this site.

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:22.220
So the RNA is sort of
serving like a guide dog

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:27.345
for this endonuclease to
guide it to a certain location

00:44:27.345 --> 00:44:27.845
to cleave.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.640
So the idea, then, is if you
want to edit the genome--

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.760
and why people are
so excited about this

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:44.240
these days is you now
have a system that

00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:48.710
might allow you to generate a
double-stranded break in one

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.230
specific place in the genome.

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:55.880
And if you can do that, then
if you provide donor DNA that

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.060
maybe has a different sequence--
if you consider a disease

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.870
allele, right?

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:03.440
Let's say you know
there's a gene that when

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.390
there's a certain allele causes
an inherited form of a disease.

00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:13.340
You could then take donor DNA
from an unaffected individual

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:16.730
and take cells from
the affected individual

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.790
and cut the locus
that's problematic

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:25.220
and get a repair of the
defective allele using

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.470
a normal allele of the gene.

00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:29.390
And that would
essentially rescue

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:32.030
the function of that gene
if it were then reintroduced

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.655
into the patient, OK?

00:45:33.655 --> 00:45:38.270
Do you see sort of
roughly how this works?

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:41.960
So this is a very sort
of broad and general sort

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.810
of conceptual framework
for how this might happen.

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:47.900
Let's say you have an individual
with a blood disorder--

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:51.350
let's say sickle cell
anemia or beta thalassemia.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:53.700
Those are inherited
blood disorders,

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:55.730
which lead to anemia.

00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:59.600
You could remove cells,
and what might be the best

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.840
are the stem cells
from a patient.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.420
And you could then take
those stem cells and use

00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:09.410
CRISPR-Cas9 in vitro
in cell culture

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:14.420
to edit that individual's cells
to repair the genetic defect.

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.700
And you could then
reintroduce those

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.910
to the patient, where
if they're stem cells,

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.520
they'd reoccupy
the stem cell niche

00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.530
and produce functional
blood cells that

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:27.810
would then essentially cure
the individual of the disease.

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.330
This is how scientists
are thinking

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.380
about the use of
the system nowadays.

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:35.090
And this hasn't really
been successful yet,

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:37.800
but there are several clinical
trials that are currently

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.990
underway, where
people are trying

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:47.390
to show that this can be used
to treat human genetic diseases.

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:50.360
So in the next year, you are
going to hear more about this,

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.040
almost undoubtedly, as we start
to hear the results of some

00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.000
of these patients.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.290
There are concerns
about this, as well.

00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.500
I don't want to overblow it.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.730
There are certainly concerns.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:03.560
We don't know this
is going to work.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.020
I mean, people have been
talking about this type of stuff

00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:08.570
since I was a
student 20 years ago.

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.900
But I feel like we're getting--
we're much more advanced now,

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:13.520
and the tools are more advanced.

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.300
And so I feel like we're kind
of getting to the point where

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:19.910
there's a much greater chance
that this will be successful

00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:23.370
these days than it
was 20 years ago.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:25.400
I just want to point
out where this system--

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.790
how it was discovered
and where it came from.

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:30.440
And I like this as an example.

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.280
Much like for the fly
genes that defined

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:37.370
major signaling pathways,
this is a discovery

00:47:37.370 --> 00:47:40.760
that came from
fundamental research

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:46.100
on, basically, the
ecology of bacteria.

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:50.060
So this CRISPR-Cas9
system essentially evolved

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:54.920
in bacteria as a form of an
arms race between bacteria

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.260
and their predators,
bacteriophage,

00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.900
which are viruses
that infect bacteria.

00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:09.410
So this is an arms
race between bacteria

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:12.020
and their vicious
predators, bacteriophage.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.400
And what CRISPR is, where
these enzymes and this system

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:27.260
evolved from, is this is a form
of an adaptive immune system

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:31.310
for bacteria, which is
pretty wild in and of itself.

00:48:31.310 --> 00:48:36.965
So CRISPR is an adaptive
immune system for bacteria.

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:45.170
If you haven't gotten your
flu shot, you should get it.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:50.580
We'll talk about human
immunity later in the semester.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:54.550
But this is where bacterial
immunity kind of--

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:56.570
I'm sneaking it in.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.910
So the way this
works in bacteria--

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:03.110
what CRISPR stands
for is Clusters

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:07.710
of Regularly Interspaced
Short Palindromic Repeats.

00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:11.060
So you can see already thank
god they gave it an acronym.

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:14.160
Otherwise, it wouldn't be
getting nearly as much buzz,

00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:16.340
because no one can say that.

00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.270
And so where this
CRISPR came from is

00:49:20.270 --> 00:49:24.660
on bacterial chromosomes
of many bacteria,

00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:28.610
there's these clusters of
interspaced short palindromic

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:33.240
repeats, and the repeats
are interrupted by spacers.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.780
And what researchers
discovered are these spacers

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.190
have sequence similarity
and identity to sequences

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:44.970
that are from bacteriophage.

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.920
So each of these
colored sequences

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:51.000
here has some type
of complementarity

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.510
to some type of bacteriophage.

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:59.310
And so when a phage infects
bacteria, or some bacteria,

00:49:59.310 --> 00:50:01.890
what happens is that
there's a system

00:50:01.890 --> 00:50:05.370
to recognize that
foreign genetic element

00:50:05.370 --> 00:50:09.160
and take a piece of it and
insert it in the genome.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.190
And that serves as a
memory for the bacteria

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:16.200
to remember that it got infected
by that particular phage.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.000
And then, later on,
what the bacteria

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.570
does is it transcribes
this region

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:25.950
and forms these mature what are
known as CRISPR RNAs, where you

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:28.920
can see there's some
sequence would recognize

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.210
a foreign genetic element.

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:36.030
So, therefore, in the future,
if this phage came around again,

00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:39.450
what would happen is
one of these CRISPR RNAs

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:42.450
would recognize the
foreign genetic element

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:45.030
through base pair
complementarity,

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:46.830
and it would know to cut it.

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:49.050
And after the
target is cut, it's

00:50:49.050 --> 00:50:51.930
then degraded by
the bacterial cell.

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:56.220
So this is a way for bacteria
to remember what viruses

00:50:56.220 --> 00:51:01.260
have infected them and to have
a defense mechanism against it.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:03.810
So it's a pretty cool system.

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.670
You know, what's also
cool about this system

00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.720
is it's an adaptive immune
system, similar to how we sort

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.140
of recognize foreign pathogens.

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:15.810
What's different about
it is this is heritable.

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.120
It's incorporated
into the genome.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.300
And the more phage the
descendants of this bacteria

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.510
see, the more of
these repeats you see.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:28.080
So this is a heritable immune
system, which, unfortunately,

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.630
we don't have.

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:32.280
So you should still
get your flu shot.

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:38.010
We'll talk about
vaccination later on.

00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:44.480
Have a good few days, and
I will see you on Friday.

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.370
We often think of
a Bernoulli process

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.700
as a stream of arriving traffic.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.410
What happens if we
merge two streams?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.300
For example, consider a
server that receives traffic

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.760
from two independent sources.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.270
How do we describe
the total traffic

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.380
that arrives to this server?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.420
Here's a precise model.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.420
We have two streams
that correspond

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.880
to Bernoulli processes with
some parameters each, p and q,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.060
respectively.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.440
And each one of these
processes receives arrivals

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.140
at certain times that
we indicate by crosses;

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.220
and similarly, for
the second process.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.330
We assume that these two
processes are independent.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.150
And what we mean by this
is that any collection

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.010
of random variables associated
with the first process

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.370
will be independent from any
collection of random variables

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.350
associated with
the second process.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.870
We now merge the two
processes as follows.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:11.260
Whenever there's an arrival in
any of the original processes,

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.260
we record an arrival
in the merged process,

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.390
as in this picture.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.150
Notice that we do not to make a
distinction between those slots

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.380
at which there was
an arrival in only

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.690
one of the original
[processes] versus those slots

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.900
in which there was an arrival in
both of the original processes.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.000
In both cases, we
just say that there

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.560
was an arrival in
the merged process,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.410
and so collisions--
arrivals in both

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.780
of the original
processes-- are counted

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.500
as only one arrival
in the merged process.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.380
Now, what can we say
about the merged process?

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.670
We will argue that
it is a Bernoulli

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.690
process with a certain
parameter that we will compute.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.460
To check the Bernoulli property
for the merged process,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.680
the first thing
we need to ensure

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.100
is the independence assumption,
independence across slots.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300
Let us look at
two typical slots.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.860
And to do this, it helps
to define some notation

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.050
that Xt and Yt be the
original processes,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.480
and let Zt be the
merged process.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.890
The random variable Zt
is determined in some way

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.450
by the random
variables Xt and Yt.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.610
If I tell you there was
an arrival in the first

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.370
and to the second
process, you can

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.230
tell whether there was an
arrival in the merged process.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.360
And similarly, the
random variable Zt plus 1

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.400
is determined in some way
from Xt plus 1 and Yt plus 1.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.290
What this is saying
is that whether we

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.850
have an arrival at
this slot is determined

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.600
by what happens in
these two slots.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.930
And whether we have an
arrival in this slot

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.310
is determined by whatever
happens in these two slots.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.320
Now, we have assumed that the
two processes are independent.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.040
So these two random
variables are

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.130
independent from those
two random variables.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.200
And furthermore, across
time, this random variable

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.270
will be independent from
that random variable.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.280
And this random variable
will be independent

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.060
from that random variable.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.450
So these four random variables
are independent of each other.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.750
Because of this, we
have Zt, a function

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.810
of two random variables that
are independent from the two

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.220
random variables that
determine Zt plus 1.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.940
And for this reason, Zt and
Zt plus 1 will be independent.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.950
This proves a pairwise
independence property

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.010
for the merged process, but
we can extend this argument

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.660
to argue that the collection of
random variables, Z1 up to Zt,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.630
is a collection of
independent random variables.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.030
So we have the
independence property.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.110
Now, let us calculate the
probability of an arrival

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.340
during a typical slot.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.120
During a typical
time slot, there

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.970
are four possibilities
for what may occur.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.820
And these possibilities
have to do with

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.440
whether in the X process,
we have an arrival

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.680
or not; and in the Y process,
whether we have an arrival

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.250
or not.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.280
The probability that we have
an arrival in both processes,

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.070
because of independence, is
the product of the probability

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.740
that we have an arrival
in the first process

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.280
with the probability
that we have

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.780
an arrival in the
second process.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.310
Similarly, there's
a probability p

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.830
of an arrival in
the first process

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.290
and no arrival in the second.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.875
There's a probability
1 minus p of no arrival

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:55.750
in the first process
and [a probability q of]

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.010
an arrival in the
second process.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.200
And finally, there is
probability 1 minus p times 1

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.830
minus q of no arrival in
either of the two processes.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.110
The probability that we have an
arrival in the merged process

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.070
is the probability
of this green event.

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:20.230
These are the cases in
which an arrival gets

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.960
recorded in the merged process.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.840
So the probability of an
arrival in the merged process

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.040
is the sum of those
three probabilities.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.770
Or another way to calculate
it is 1 minus this probability

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.990
here; namely, 1 minus 1
minus p times 1 minus q.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.190
And after you
expand this product

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.790
and do some
cancellations, you end up

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.500
with this expression, which is
the probability of an arrival

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.920
during a slot in
the merged process.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.350
Of course, this probability
is constant across time.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.280
And this, together with
the independence property,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.159
establishes that the
merged process is actually

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:01.440
a Bernoulli process.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.200
Now, let us end by
answering one more question.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.260
If I tell you that at
a certain time slot,

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.260
there was at least one arrival
in the two processes, which

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.900
means that there was an
arrival in the merged process,

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.680
what is the
probability that there

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:22.130
was an arrival in
the first process?

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:25.610
Now, the event that there was
an arrival in the first process

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.700
is this event here.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:30.560
So we're trying to calculate
the conditional probability

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.040
of the blue event given that
the green event has occurred.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.130
We use the definition of
conditional probabilities.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:41.750
A conditional probability
is equal to the probability

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.320
that both events happen,
which in this case

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.240
is the intersection of the
blue and the green event,

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.260
which coincides
with the blue event.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.159
And the probability
of the blue event

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:55.350
is the sum of these two
numbers, is equal to p.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.420
And then we divide by the
probability of the conditioning

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.630
event, this is the
probability of an arrival.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.610
But this is what we
have just calculated,

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:10.280
which is p plus q
minus p times q.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.300
ALAN OPPENHEIM: Hi.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.510
As you recall, last
time we developed

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.810
the discrete-time
Fourier transform.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.830
And one of the issues
that I alluded to,

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.379
although I didn't
say it explicitly,

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.680
is that the Fourier
transform doesn't

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.720
exist for all sequences.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.710
In fact, as we'll see today,
one of the difficulties

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.930
is the issue of convergence.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.300
That is, the Fourier
transform doesn't

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.910
converge for all sequences.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.360
And to get around
this, we'll generalize

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.390
the notion of the Fourier
transform as we introduced it

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.750
last time to what's called the
Z-transform, the Z-transform

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.170
being the discrete time
counterpart of the Laplace

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.050
transform for
continuous time systems.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:47.160
Well, let me begin by examining
just a little this issue

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.550
of convergence.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.240
We have here the Fourier
transform relationship

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.430
as we developed it last time,
x of e to the j omega given

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.890
by the sum of x of 10 times
e to the minus j omega n.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.190
And as we discussed the
Fourier transform last time,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.800
we assumed that the
sum was convergent,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.530
and-- or at least we didn't
particularly raise the issue

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.840
as to whether it is or isn't.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.800
Well, we can look at the
magnitude of x, or equivalently

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.310
the magnitude of
this sum, and ask

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.840
under what conditions
this sum will converge.

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.240
That is, under what conditions
will this sum be finite.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.220
Well, here we have the
magnitude of a sum of things

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.580
from what's called the
triangle inequality,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.430
or you can just kind
of imagine that this

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.740
is true from common sense, is
that the magnitude of a sum

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:00.600
has to be less than or equal
to the sum of the magnitudes.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.920
So the magnitude of this
sum has to be less than

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.320
or equal to the sum of
the magnitude of x of n e

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.720
to the minus j omega n.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.110
The magnitude of a product is
the product of the magnitudes,

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.190
of course.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.650
So this says that the magnitude
of the Fourier transform

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.060
has to be less than or equal to
the sum of the magnitude of x

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.670
of n times the magnitude of
the complex exponential, e

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.450
to the minus j omega n.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.530
Well, this of course we
can't say a lot about.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.170
This we can recognize as unity.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.670
It's a complex exponential.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.600
The magnitude of a complex
exponential is one.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.550
So consequently, the magnitude
of the Fourier transform

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:59.950
is less than or equal to the
sum of the magnitudes of x

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.280
of n summed over minus
infinity-- n equals

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.060
minus infinity to plus infinity.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.290
Well, that tells us then
that the Fourier transform

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.360
will converge, converge meaning
that the sum ends up finite,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.670
if this converges.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:21.200
That is, certainly if
this sum is finite,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.310
then the magnitude of x of
e to the j omega is finite.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.430
So we can say that x of e to the
j omega, the Fourier transform,

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.210
converges if the sum of
the magnitude of x of n

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.040
is less than infinity.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.690
Well, this is a condition
that's commonly referred

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.390
to as absolutely summable.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.700
The condition is that
the sequence x of n

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.070
be absolutely summable.

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.070
The way we've gone through
this, the statement

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.190
is that, if x of n is
absolutely summable,

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.900
then the Fourier
transform converges

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.540
under some sorts of conditions.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.390
And depending on how you
interpret convergence,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.520
this can be modified somewhat.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.770
But basically--
and that, in fact,

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.980
is discussed in some
detail in the text.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:22.020
But basically, the condition
for convergence of the Fourier

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.260
transform is that the sequence
whose Fourier transform we're

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.980
talking about be
absolutely summable.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.840
Now, we've seen a sum
like this someplace else.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.470
In fact, a couple
lectures ago, we

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.490
talked about stability
of discrete time systems.

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:46.300
And the statement
about stability

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.210
was that the unit sample
response of the system

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.040
be absolutely summable.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.000
That is, or was, that, if
the unit sample response

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.660
is absolutely summable,
then the system is stable.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.580
So one conclusion, which
you should tuck away for now

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.720
and we'll be bringing into
play later on in this lecture,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:16.310
is that a stable system
implies that the system--

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.820
that the frequency response,
or the Fourier transform

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.330
of the unit sample
response, converges.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.070
So this is convergence, then.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.120
And we can look at a
couple of examples just

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.910
to see how this looks
in some specific cases.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.860
Let's first of all take the
example of the sequence x of n

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.010
is 1/2 to the n u of n as an
exponential sequence which

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.400
is zero for n less than zero
because of the unit step.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:59.420
It's exponentially decaying
for n greater than zero.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.960
If we sum the
magnitude of x of n

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.575
from minus infinity
to plus infinity,

00:07:05.575 --> 00:07:11.510
we get that the magnitude, the
sum of the magnitude of x of n

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.290
is equal to two.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.790
Well, this is
something, a type of sum

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.210
that hopefully you're
familiar with carrying out.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:25.090
In any case, what we're
summing here is the series

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.220
1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, et cetera.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.470
That sums to two.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.640
So we can say that, for
this sequence, certainly,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.025
the Fourier transform converges.

00:07:37.025 --> 00:07:39.800
It's a perfectly
well-behaved sequence.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.510
A Fourier transform
converges, we

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.850
can compute the Fourier
transform, et cetera.

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.560
Well, another sequence we can
try is the sequence x of n

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.160
equals 2 to the n
times a unit step.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.710
Well, if we just
think about the values

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:02.440
that we have, at n equals
zero we have 1, at n equals 1,

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.320
we have 2, at n equals 2,
we have 4, at n equals 3,

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.600
we have 8.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:11.740
And obviously, then, the
sum of the absolute values

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:18.470
of x of n for that
particular sequence diverges.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.900
That is, the sum is infinite.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:26.240
So here's an example of a
sequence for which the Fourier

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.070
transform doesn't converge.

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.830
In other words, the Fourier
transform for this sequence

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.090
doesn't exist.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:34.750
And you can imagine
the generalization here

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.450
that, if we talk
about a sequence which

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.490
decays exponentially--
by the way,

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.419
in either direction, negative
n or positive n-- then

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.160
the Fourier
transform will exist,

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.760
whereas if it's an
exponential sequence that

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.110
grows exponentially, then
the Fourier transform is not

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:58.040
going to exist, or is
not going to converge.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.200
Well, what do we do about that?

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:07.410
There is a way around
it by essentially using

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:13.830
the artifice of
multiplying a sequence that

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.880
doesn't converge, or say
that grows exponentially

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.510
by a decaying
exponential, and making

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.230
the decay on the exponential
fast enough so that the product

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.660
has a Fourier transform.

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.380
That is, we can talk about
the Fourier transform

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:36.390
in general, not of
x of n, but of x

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:46.620
of n multiplied by a sequence
r to the minus n, for which we

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:50.730
pick r so that the
product of these two

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.950
is absolutely summable.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.240
And since we've introduced
another parameter r, then

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:01.830
the Fourier transform of x
of n times r to the minus n,

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.880
we don't want to call
x of e to the j omega.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:11.070
Let's for now think of it as
x of r times e to the j omega,

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.880
the r denoting the
complex exponential

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.790
that we're multiplying by.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.940
And then, of course,
for some values of r,

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:23.640
this sum is going to converge.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:28.110
For other values of r, this
sum is not going to converge.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.540
For example, if we
look at our example

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:37.800
two here, if I multiply
this sequence by a decaying

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.270
exponential that
decays fast enough so

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.120
that the product decays--

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.990
and what do I have
to multiply it by?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.520
I have to multiply it by
something that decays faster

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.710
than 1/2 to the n.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:11:01.560
So if I stick in here an
r that is greater than 2--

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.520
2 because there's a minus
sign here, r to the minus n--

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.360
then I'll end up with,
for this sequence,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.190
with a sum here that converges.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:15.450
So for this example, if r--

00:11:15.450 --> 00:11:19.120
any choice of r greater
than two, this sum

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.170
is going to converge.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.300
And I can talk about x
of r of e to the j omega.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.250
So that's the idea.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.150
The idea is to multiply
by an exponential that

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.220
decays fast enough
or doesn't grow

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:35.140
so fast that the product x
of n times r to the minus n

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.150
converges.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:40.030
Well, we can rewrite this
a little differently.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:44.200
We can combine the r to the
minus n and the e to the minus

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.240
j omega n.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.420
And what results is
the sum, minus infinity

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.590
to plus infinity,
of x of n times

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.500
re to the j omega
to the minus n,

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.490
just simply combining
these two terms together.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:07.210
And it's convenient to think of
this as a new complex variable,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.490
magnitude r and angle
omega, which we'll denote

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:18.050
by z, z as in the Z-transform.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.140
The Z-transform.

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:26.560
So, this essentially leads us to
the notion of the Z-transform,

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.870
where the Z-transform
of a sequence x of n

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:38.950
is defined as x of z is equal
to the sum of x of n times z

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:46.120
to the minus n, where z is equal
to r times e to the j omega.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.610
In other words, x of z is
just simply the x sub r of e

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:55.110
to the j omega that we
finished talking about.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:59.400
Well, how is the Z-transform
related to the Fourier

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:03.540
transform if the Fourier
transform exists?

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:07.420
Obviously, from what we
just finished saying,

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.320
the Z-transform is the Fourier
transform for this weighting

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.660
factor r equal to unity.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:27.600
That is, x of e to the j omega
is equal to x of z where?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:34.410
Well, for z equal to
e to the j omega--

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:39.150
or another way of saying that
is for the magnitude of z

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:40.470
equal to unity.

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:43.530
With z equal to e to the j
omega, the magnitude of z

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.170
obviously is equal to unity.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:50.310
So we have now the Z-transform.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:53.190
It's a function of
a complex variable

00:13:53.190 --> 00:14:00.240
z, which has a magnitude
r and an angle omega.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.120
And it's just simply
a generalization

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.860
of the Fourier transform.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.870
It, in fact, is
equal to the Fourier

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.690
transform for the
magnitude of z equal to 1.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:15.450
And it, in effect, corresponds
to the Fourier transform

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:21.090
of the sequence multiplied
by an exponential sequence r

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.360
to the minus n.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.450
When does the
Z-transform converge?

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.820
Well, the Z-transform converges
when this x sub r of e

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.660
to the j omega that we were
talking about converges.

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:40.320
And that converges when the
sequence x of n r to the minus

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:42.870
n is absolutely summable.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:47.610
So the Z-transform
converges if the sum

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:52.920
of x of n times r to
the minus n is finite.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.490
And for some values of r,
given a certain sequence,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:01.930
for some values of r the
Z-transform will converge,

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:06.720
for some values of r the
Z-transform won't converge.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.390
Well let's look at an example.

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:13.740
And it's an example,
I guess, that you're

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.270
seeing fairly frequently.

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:19.880
In fact, it'll keep cropping
up in a variety of ways.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.710
It's kind of a simple
one, and nice to use.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.470
That is the sequence--
our old friend again--

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:31.530
x of n is 1/2 to
the n times u of n.

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:40.110
Well, the Z-transform of x of
n, x of z is the sum of x of n

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:42.360
z to the minus n.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.060
Since this is multiplied
by a unit step,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.640
the limits on the sum are
from zero to infinity.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:53.580
So this is the sum from zero
to infinity of 1/2 to the n z

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.940
to the minus n.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.230
And that's equal to the sum from
n equals 0 to infinity of 1/2

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.550
times z to the minus 1-- just
combining these together--

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:06.130
to the n.

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.040
Now, let me point
out, incidentally--

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:12.350
and I think that by
now you've seen this--

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:15.650
this is a kind of sum,
this geometric series

00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:19.860
is a kind of sum that comes up
over and over and over again

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:21.920
in dealing with sequences.

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.970
And it's the kind of summation
that you should carry around

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.290
in your hip pocket.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:30.140
That is, you should keep
in mind, because it keeps

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.050
coming up like
standard integrals do

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:35.150
in the continuous time
case, that the sum from 0

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:37.410
to infinity of a to the n--

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:41.510
a has to be less than 1 for
convergence-- of a to the n

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:44.060
is equal to 1 over 1 minus a.

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:46.330
Just store that away.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:52.490
Anyway, summing this, then,
we end up with 1 over 1

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.960
minus this thing.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.390
So the Z-transform is 1
over 1 minus 1/2 times z

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.020
to the minus 1, which we
can leave in this form.

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.640
And sometimes, we will.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:08.270
Or, we can multiply
numerator and denominator

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:13.695
by z, in which case we have
z divided by z minus 1/2.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.690
Well, when does this converge?

00:17:19.690 --> 00:17:26.020
It converges when the magnitude
of 1/2 times z to the minus 1

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:29.780
raised to the n is finite.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.850
And that requires
that this thing

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:36.710
that we're taking the
absolute magnitude of be--

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:38.030
raised to the n--

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:42.460
be less than unity,
or that implies

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:48.010
that z, the magnitude of z,
must be greater than 1/2.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.850
The magnitude of z must
be greater than 1/2,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.000
or the magnitude of z
minus z to the minus 1

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.590
must be less than two.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.840
Magnitude z to the
minus 1 less than two,

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.530
or the magnitude of
z greater than 1/2.

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:08.020
And under those conditions,
the Z-transform will converge.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:13.270
Now, for this example, does
the Fourier transform exist?

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.700
Does the Fourier
transform converge?

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.940
How do we answer that?

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.990
Well, the Fourier
transform converges

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:23.680
if the convergence
of the Z-transform

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.820
includes the magnitude
of z equal to 1.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.870
Does it?

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:29.980
Sure it does.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:32.620
The magnitude of z must
be greater than 1/2

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:34.830
for convergence of
the Z-transform.

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.940
That includes the
magnitude of z equal to 1.

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.170
Therefore, for this sequence,
the Fourier transform

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.430
converges.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:44.470
We had already decided
that before, of course.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.800
That is obviously a
better turnout that way

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.480
this time also.

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.320
But an important notion,
then, is interpreting

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.480
the existence of the
Fourier transform

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:01.900
in terms of the region of
convergence of the Z-transform.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.630
This then defines the
region of convergence,

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:11.330
the set of values of z for
which the Z-transform converges.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:15.690
Another interesting
observation about this example

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:20.490
is that we ended up
with a Z-transform that

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.545
is a ratio of polynomials.

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:27.110
In this case, z to the minus
1 or, If we rewrite it,

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:29.970
a ratio of polynomials in z.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.580
And that's an
important observation.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.510
In fact, it is a
consequence of the fact

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.610
that we're talking
about the Z-transform

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:41.330
of an exponential sequence.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:44.730
Any exponential sequence will
have a Z-transform that's

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.550
a ratio of polynomials in z.

00:19:47.550 --> 00:19:52.260
Furthermore, any sequence
that's a sum of exponentials

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:56.250
will have a Z-transform that's
a ratio of polynomials in z,

00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.340
since the Z-transform of a sum
is the sum of the Z-transforms,

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.290
and the sum of a
ratio of polynomials

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.670
is a ratio of
polynomials and all that.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.180
But basically, the
point to remember

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:10.410
is that sums of
exponentials as sequences

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:15.780
result in Z-transforms that
are ratios of polynomials in z,

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:19.200
or in z to the minus 1.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.300
Well, for those class of
sequences, which, in fact, are

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.740
most of the
sequences we're going

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.470
to be talking about
in these lectures,

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:36.380
it's convenient to look at
the Z-transform graphically,

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:41.750
in terms of a plot
in the z-plane.

00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:44.390
So I've indicated
here the z-plane.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.370
This is the real
part of z, this axis.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:54.580
This axis is the
imaginary part of z.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.250
And I've drawn a
circle, which I've

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:02.680
called the unit circle, which
is convenient to focus on.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.310
It's the circle in the z-plane
for which the magnitude of z

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.200
is equal to 1.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.110
What's important about the
magnitude of z equal to 1?

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:13.600
Well, it's on that
circle, when we

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.670
look at the Z-transform
on that circle,

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.770
that we see the
Fourier transform.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:21.790
So it's often convenient
to make reference

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.970
to the unit circle in
the z-plane corresponding

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.960
to the place in the z-plane
where the Z-transform is

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.580
equal to the Fourier transform.

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:39.750
When we have a Z-transform that
is a ratio of polynomials in z,

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.070
it's convenient to
represent it in terms

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.080
of the roots of the
numerator polynomial

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.320
and the roots of the
denominator polynomial.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.930
The roots of the
numerator polynomial

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:58.910
we'll refer to as the
zeros of the Z-transform.

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.900
They're those values of z
for which the Z-transform

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.570
is going to be zero.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:08.100
And the roots of the
denominator polynomial

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:11.320
we'll refer to as the
poles of the Z-transform.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.480
Those are the
values of z at which

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.870
the Z-transform blows up,
just like poles and zeros

00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:22.180
of the Laplace transform in
the continuous time case.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:30.710
We'll denote in the z-plane
roots, the zeros, by a circle,

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:36.680
and we'll denote the
poles by a cross.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.360
So we have, for that particular
example, a zero at the origin,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:44.740
since the numerator
polynomial was simply z,

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.080
and we have a pole
at z equal to 1/2.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:53.610
Well, what else do we know
about this Z-transform?

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.700
We know that the
Z-transform doesn't

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.580
exist for all values of z.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.190
In particular,
for convergence we

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.480
require that the magnitude
of z is greater than 1/2.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:11.760
So I've indicated that
region in the z-plane,

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.570
with these slanted lines,
the region of convergence

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:20.920
for this particular example
are those values of z that

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.940
lie outside the circle that's
bounded by the pole at z

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:26.020
equal to 1/2.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.810
And we'll see that that is,
in fact, the way regions

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:32.320
of convergences tend to go.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.620
They'll tend to be
outside and inside poles.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.860
So the important
aspects of this picture,

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.280
there are the zeroes
and the poles,

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.430
there's the unit circle
where the Z-transform is

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.190
equal to the Fourier
transform, and there's

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:52.450
the region of convergence, which
tells us where in the z-plane

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.260
the Z-transform makes sense.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:57.350
All right.

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.850
Let's try another example.

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:06.490
Let's take the example of
x of n equal to minus 1/2

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:11.000
to the n u of minus n minus 1.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.470
Now, you saw that sequence
a couple of lectures ago.

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:20.120
It's a sequence that
is like 1/2 to the n,

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.180
but not for positive
values of n,

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.650
but for negative values of n.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.770
In other words, it's zero
for positive values of n,

00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:29.630
and it does something
exponentially

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:30.840
for negative values of n.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.230
If you evaluate the
Z-transform sum--

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.910
and I'll leave it
to you to do this--

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.500
then we end up with x
of z, the Z-transform,

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:48.820
is 1 over 1 minus
1/2 z to the minus 1,

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:50.150
just like we saw before.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.290
In fact, that's exactly
the same expression

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:57.960
as a ratio of polynomials
that we saw before,

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.450
which, of course,
we can rewrite,

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:05.430
as we did before, as z
divided by z minus 1/2.

00:25:07.821 --> 00:25:08.320
All right.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.760
Do you think that the Fourier
transform of this sequence

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:11.260
exists?

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:19.640
Well, it's 1/2 to
the n, which dies out

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.890
for negative n-- for positive n.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.600
But for negative n,
that's a sequence

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.530
that grows exponentially.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:28.840
So in fact, if you examine
convergence of this,

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.910
this sequence is not
absolutely summable.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:33.755
The Fourier transform
does not exist.

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:40.300
What's the region of
convergence of the Z-transform?

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:47.160
Well, to decide that, we need to
look at the sum of 1/2 times e

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:54.190
to the minus 1 to the n, and ask
for what values of z this sum

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:55.490
is less than infinity.

00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:58.960
In other words, for what
values of z that sum converges.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:04.210
And to do that, if this was a
sum over positive values of n,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:09.440
then we would want the magnitude
of this to be less than 1.

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:12.010
Since we're looking at this
for negative values of n,

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:16.400
we want the magnitude of
this to be greater than 1.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.860
And the conclusion is--

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:20.590
and if you don't
see this right away,

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.650
you can just fiddle with it
on the back of an envelope--

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:30.040
that this converges provided
that the magnitude of z

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.062
is less than 1/2.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:41.530
So we can look at this
example in the z-plane,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:43.990
just as we looked at
the previous example

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:45.800
in the z-plane.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.970
We first of all have
poles and zeroes.

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:51.580
We have-- well, where
do we have a zero?

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:55.490
We have a zero at z equals 0.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:58.120
So that's here.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.619
We have a pole at
z equal to 1/2.

00:27:01.619 --> 00:27:02.285
And that's here.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.020
Just like in the previous
example, the zero and the pole

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:13.030
fall in exactly the same place.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.990
What's the region
of convergence?

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:17.650
Well, the region of convergence
is for the magnitude

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.440
of z less than 1/2.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:26.110
And now, in this case,
that's inside this circle,

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.000
rather than in
the previous case,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.980
where it was
outside that circle.

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.320
So the region of convergence
now is the region

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.280
that is inside the circle,
which is bounded by that pole.

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:44.630
All right.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:48.170
This raises an important point.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:51.590
Here we had an example where
we got a Z-transform ratio

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.870
of polynomials.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:58.820
The previous example, we
got exactly the same ratio

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.980
of polynomials.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.750
How did these two
examples differ

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:04.670
in terms of the Z-transform?

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:08.270
They differed in terms of
the region of convergence

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:10.760
that we associate
with the Z-transform.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.890
The other case, the
region of convergence

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.480
was outside this circle.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.250
In this case, the
region of convergence

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.260
is inside this circle.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.900
The ratio of polynomials
for the Z-transforms

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.860
is the same in both cases.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.430
It's the region of
convergence that's different.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:28.910
So an important
point to keep in mind

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.690
is that the Z-transform
is not specified just

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:35.975
by the function of z,
it's also specified--

00:28:35.975 --> 00:28:40.100
it has to have attached to it
a little tag that tells you

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.830
for what values of z
it's legitimate to look

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:45.050
at that expression.

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.260
So it's specified by the
ratio of polynomials,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:53.480
and also by the region of
convergence of the Z-transform.

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:56.810
So here, for example, that's
the ratio of polynomials,

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:59.060
and that's the Z-transform.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:00.860
That's the ratio of
polynomials, and that's

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.180
the region of convergence.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.870
And the two together
are the Z-transform.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:10.850
Now, it often happens that
the region of convergence

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:16.460
of the Z-transform is specified
in a somewhat indirect way,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:21.050
by saying something about the
sequence that basically implies

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:23.720
what the region of
convergence has to be.

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:29.180
And we can lead
into that by stating

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.390
what some of the properties are
that the region of convergence

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:33.500
has.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.800
And I'll always be talking
now about sequences

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.530
that are sums of
exponentials, or Z-transforms

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.560
that are ratios of polynomials,
and consequently that

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.730
can be described by poles
and zeroes in the z-plane.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:50.840
OK, well, I have here the
first thing you can say.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.550
Actually, there's
a 0 thing you can

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:58.890
say that follows fairly
straightforwardly, and that is,

00:29:58.890 --> 00:30:02.080
obviously, there
can't be any poles

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:05.110
in the region of convergence
because, at a pole

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:09.310
of the Z-transform, that's
where the Z-transform blows up.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:11.140
And we know that the
region of convergence

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.990
is where the
Z-transform converges.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.810
So obviously, there are no poles
in the region of convergence.

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:19.610
However, we can make
another statement,

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:26.920
which is justified in
some detail in the text,

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.530
that the region of
convergence will always

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:36.740
be bounded by either
poles or zero or infinity.

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:40.300
For example, in this example
that we worked out here,

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:43.330
the region of convergence
goes to zero--

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.160
I mean, it includes zero--

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.610
and it's bounded at the outside,
in this particular case,

00:30:48.610 --> 00:30:51.150
by a pole.

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.880
In the example that
we had previously,

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:58.180
if we look at this example,
the region of convergence

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.110
is bounded on the
inside by a pole,

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:05.170
and it's bounded on the
outside by infinity.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.900
And that's a statement
that we can generally make.

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.390
I won't try to justify
that right now,

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.410
but the region of convergence
is bounded by poles,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.200
and in fact is bounded
by a circle that

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.960
goes through a pole.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:20.460
All right.

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.590
That's one statement
we can make.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:25.230
Now some other statements
that we can make,

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:29.130
which are all
developed in the text.

00:31:29.130 --> 00:31:31.380
That is, the proof of
them is worked out.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.790
First of all, let's consider
finite length sequences.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.870
A finite length
sequence, sequenced at 0,

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:44.910
except for a finite
number of values of n,

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:51.240
has a region of convergence that
is the entire z-plane, perhaps

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.452
with the exception
of the point z

00:31:53.452 --> 00:31:56.730
equals 0, or perhaps with
the exception of the point z

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:58.260
equals infinity.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:00.730
And that follows in a
pretty straightforward way,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:05.580
basically because the sum, in
examining absolute convergence,

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:07.980
the sum just includes
finite limits.

00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:10.890
So as long as each of the
sequence values is finite,

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:14.450
the sum has to be finite.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:18.980
A little more involved, we
have right-sided sequences.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:20.990
What I mean by a
right-sided sequence

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:26.900
is a sequence which is 0 for
n less than some value of n.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:32.820
And then goes on up to
n equals plus infinity.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.200
And what you can say about
right-sided sequences,

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:40.550
as it turns out, is that
the region of convergence

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:46.910
is outside some value, which
I've denoted by r sub x minus,

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.480
and goes to infinity.

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.590
It may include infinity or
it may not include infinity,

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:55.350
but it goes at least
up to infinity.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:57.530
So it begins at
some finite value

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.890
in the z-plane, bounded
by some circle with radius

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.170
r sub x minus, and
goes up to infinity.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.090
Well, look, if we had
a right-sided sequence,

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:12.080
how are you going to find
what r sub x minus is?

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.540
Just by looking at
the pole-zero pattern,

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.710
because we know that the
region of convergence

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:20.870
is bounded by poles.

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:23.870
We know also that the
region of convergence

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:27.680
can't have any poles,
so r sub x minus

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:32.570
has to be the circle that goes
through the outermost pole

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:34.140
in the z-plane.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:37.430
So if we have a
right-sided sequence, that

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.440
implies a region
of convergence, it

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.050
implies that the
region of convergence

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:47.220
is outside the outermost
pole in the z-plane.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:51.540
We can talk also about
left-sided sequences.

00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:54.180
Left-sided sequences
are ones for which

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.630
the sequence is zero for n
greater than some value n1.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:05.610
One And here, the region of
convergence begins at zero--

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:10.500
may or may not include zero,
depending on some issues about

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:15.690
the left-sided sequence, but
at least goes up to zero--

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.600
and then goes out to
some value r sub x plus.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.920
How do we find r sub x plus?

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.540
We do it the same way.

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.090
That is, we know that
the region of convergence

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:30.659
is bounded by poles and
doesn't contain any poles,

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:35.940
so this must be a circle
whose radius is equal--

00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.810
who's a circle that goes
through the innermost pole,

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:43.090
other than the one at z
equals 0 in the z plane.

00:34:43.090 --> 00:34:45.139
So if I have a
left-sided sequence,

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:46.739
if I know it's a
left-sided sequence,

00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:49.500
then by looking at
the pole-zero pattern

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:53.699
I can immediately infer what
the region of convergence is.

00:34:53.699 --> 00:34:57.480
Finally, we have two-sided
sequences, sequences

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:02.490
that go on to minus infinity and
they go on the plus infinity.

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:05.280
In that case, the
region of convergence

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.090
lies between two circles,
which go through two poles.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:15.540
And obviously, again, they
have to be two poles that

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:18.100
are adjacent in the z-plane.

00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.870
In other words, again, to
avoid having poles that

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:26.220
are inside the region
of convergence.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.330
And out of all
this, incidentally,

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.290
if I tell you that I
have a sequence whose

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.020
Fourier transform exists,
and I don't tell you

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.670
anything else
about the sequence,

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.210
can you infer what the
region of convergence is?

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:45.190
Well, sure you can,
because you know

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:48.380
that the region of convergence
includes the unit circle.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:53.020
And then where it's got to go
from there is to the first pole

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:56.060
that you run into heading
toward the origin,

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:58.960
and to the first pole that
you run into heading out

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.230
toward infinity.

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:03.910
So in fact, if I tell you that
the sequence is absolutely

00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:08.230
summable, or that the Fourier
transform exists, that also,

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:10.870
in effect, lets you
construct the region

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:13.600
of convergence in the z-plane.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:18.780
Well, let's just cement
this with an example.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:23.720
Let's say that I have
a Z-transform which

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:34.000
has a pole-zero pattern that has
a pole at z equal a and a pole

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
at z equal b.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.760
So this is a, and this is b.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.720
And let's consider what turn
out to be the only three

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.680
possible choices for the
region of convergence, given

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.380
this pole-zero pattern.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.420
No zeroes, to make
the example easy.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.230
Well first of all,
let's suppose that we

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:01.740
picked the region of
convergence to be less than a.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.460
So the region of convergence
for this first case

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:10.784
is inside a circle
bounded by that pole.

00:37:10.784 --> 00:37:11.450
Well, let's see.

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.190
Let's answer the
easy question first.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:18.030
Does the Fourier
transform exist?

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.740
To answer that, we
ask, is the unit circle

00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:22.480
inside the region
of convergence?

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.340
Well, it's not if the
region of convergence

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:26.050
is inside that pole.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:32.410
So for this case, the Fourier
transform doesn't exist.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:35.010
That is, it doesn't converge.

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.330
How about which sided?

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.310
Left-sided,
right-sided, two-sided?

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:45.160
Well, we can answer
that, again, because we

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.860
know, from what we
said previously,

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:55.460
that a left-sided sequence has
a region of convergence that

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.960
starts at zero and goes out
to some value r sub x plus.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.640
Well, that's the
region of convergence

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.630
that we're talking about here.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.130
So this particular
example is a sequence

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.020
for a sequence
that's left-sided.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:15.360
How about the region of
convergence between a and b?

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.080
Think of two circles
with radii a and b.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.810
And now the region of
convergence is between them.

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:23.630
Does that include
the unit circle?

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:25.720
Yeah, it includes
the unit circle.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:31.500
So for that case, the
Fourier transform exists.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.780
Is it left-sided,
right-sided, or two-sided?

00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.120
Well, it's two-sided, because
the region of convergence

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:39.790
doesn't make it to zero, and
it doesn't make it to infinity.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:44.500
So this is a two-sided sequence.

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:46.660
The final example,
or the final choice

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.740
for the region of convergence,
the magnitude of z

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.150
greater than b.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:54.540
Does the Fourier
transform exist?

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:57.420
No, because the
region of convergence

00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.430
is outside this pole.

00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.660
It doesn't include
the unit circle,

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:06.130
so the Fourier
transform doesn't exist.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:10.630
Well, we can figure
out which sided

00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:15.240
it is, either by using what
we know, or using quizmanship.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.070
Here, we had left,
here we had two-sided,

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.900
so obviously it's right-sided.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.120
In fact, it is right-sided,
because the region

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.860
of convergence starts at
some value r sub x minus,

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.520
and goes out to infinity.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:33.390
So this case, then, is
a right-sided sequence.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.540
This stresses, again,
the point that,

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:40.710
if I just specify the
pole-zero pattern, that

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:44.832
doesn't specify the Z-transform
or the sequence uniquely.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:51.990
Now, one of the properties
of the Z-transform,

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.020
which follows essentially
directly from the fact that

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:58.710
the Z-transform is interpretable
in terms of the Fourier

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:02.700
transform-- or this could
be developed more formally,

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:05.040
and we won't do that here--

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.900
is the convolution property.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.600
Namely, if y of n
is the convolution

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:16.700
of x of n with h of n, then
the Z-transform of y of n

00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:21.770
is equal to the product of
the Z-transform of x of n

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:24.650
and the Z-transform of h of n.

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:29.750
That is, z transformation,
or the Z-transform, maps

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:34.660
convolution into multiplication,
just like the Fourier transform

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:35.160
did.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.930
And that's not surprising.

00:40:37.930 --> 00:40:44.500
We typically refer to
h of z, the Z-transform

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.320
of the unit sample
response of the system,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:51.260
as the system function.

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.380
Well, on the basis of the
discussion that we just

00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:55.870
finished, there are
some things that we

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:59.350
can say about the system
function and the unit sample

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:03.830
response and regions of
convergence, et cetera.

00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:10.380
First of all, suppose that we're
talking about a stable system.

00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:13.710
Stable system, the
unit sample response

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.660
is absolutely summable.

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.450
What does that imply
about the Z-transform?

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:24.410
Well, it implies
that the Z-transform,

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:26.690
the region of convergence
of the Z-transform

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.490
includes the unit circle.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.650
That is, it implies the
Fourier transform exists,

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:33.980
or, equivalently, that
the Z-transform region

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.660
of convergence includes
the unit circle.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.610
So this is a statement
that we can make.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:44.360
Suppose that we were talking
about a stable system.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:47.510
Sorry, suppose that we were
talking about a causal system.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:51.640
If the system is causal,
well, what does causal mean?

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.470
It means that the
unit sample response

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.720
is zero for n less than zero.

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:02.400
In particular, the unit sample
response is right-sided.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:06.480
If it's right-sided, then
the region of convergence

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.990
must be outside
the outermost pole,

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:13.200
because that's what we
said about what happens

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.490
with a right-sided sequence.

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:19.080
The region of convergence has to
be outside the outermost pole.

00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.590
So you can get the
notion, then, that when

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.960
we talk about the Z-transform
of a system, in essence

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.920
we can imply the
region of convergence

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.450
by making some statements
about stability or causality.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:33.950
All right.

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.380
Let's try this
out on an example.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.230
Let's take an example
which, in fact,

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:42.960
we've talked about in some
lectures-- in a lecture

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.040
previously.

00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:48.150
Let's take the example
of a system that

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:53.130
is represented by a linear
constant coefficient difference

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:59.600
equation, y of n minus 1/2,
y of n minus 1 equals x of n.

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:05.156
To get the system function for
this, we'll take a shortcut.

00:43:05.156 --> 00:43:08.370
And in particular,
we'll use a property

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:13.350
that we haven't derived,
at least not yet,

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:17.500
but in fact you'll be
deriving in the study guide.

00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:20.616
Notice how I put everything
off to the study guide.

00:43:20.616 --> 00:43:21.990
When we get the
study guide, I'll

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.840
tell you we did it in lecture.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:30.240
Well, the property is that
if the Z-transform of y of n

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:35.850
is y of z, then the
Z-transform of y of n plus n0

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:40.090
is z to the n0 times y and z.

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:44.470
So if we take the Z-transform
of this difference equation, we

00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:50.470
have, then, y of z, the
Z-transform of that minus 1/2

00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:53.820
z to the minus 1, since
we have y of n minus 1, z

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.210
to the minus 1 y of z is
equal to the Z-transform

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.230
of the right side of the
equation, which is x of z.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:06.970
Well, the system function
is equal to y of z

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.670
divided by x of z.

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:14.370
And so we can simply solve
this equation for y of z

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:15.900
over x of z.

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:20.160
And what we get is 1
over 1 minus 1/2 times z

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.510
to the minus 1.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:25.668
So that's the system
function for that system.

00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:33.050
Well, what's the
region of convergence?

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:36.010
We don't know what the
region of convergence is.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:37.930
In fact, we're
going to have to--

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:40.030
in fact, there might
be several choices

00:44:40.030 --> 00:44:42.400
for the region of convergence.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.160
But that's not too
surprising, because remember

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.780
when we talked
about this equation

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:52.090
a couple of lectures ago and
we showed that, in fact, there

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.370
is more than one choice
for the unit sample

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:57.280
response of this system.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:03.090
And that is related to the fact
that all we got out of here

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:08.550
so far was the ratio of
polynomials that h of z is,

00:45:08.550 --> 00:45:12.135
and not what the region
of convergence is.

00:45:12.135 --> 00:45:14.690
All right, so this
ratio of polynomials

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:17.960
is 1 over 1 minus 1/2
times z to the minus 1.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.390
We've been staring at
that ratio of polynomials

00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:23.030
through a couple of
previous examples.

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:28.640
It has a zero at z equals 0,
and a pole at z equals 1/2.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:32.240
So let's take a look
at that in the z-plane.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:44.730
We have then the z-plane
here, the unit circle.

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:50.460
We have, for the example we're
talking about, a zero there,

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.640
and a pole there.

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.930
And what's the region
of convergence?

00:45:55.930 --> 00:45:58.980
Well, it seems like we can
take the region of convergence

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.670
to be whatever we want to
consistent with what regions

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.460
of convergences tend to do.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:09.660
So let's say, for example,
that the region of convergence

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.610
was outside that pole.

00:46:11.610 --> 00:46:17.020
So let's take a region
of convergence first that

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.530
looks like that.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:24.520
Well, for that case, if that's
the region of convergence,

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.250
there are some things that we
could say about the system.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:31.120
For example, is
the system stable?

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:35.350
Is the system stable if
the unit sample response

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.790
has a Fourier transform?

00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:40.660
And it has that if the
region of convergence

00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:44.280
includes the unit circle,
which it does here.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:50.300
So this particular
system is stable.

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:53.100
And is it causal?

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:56.580
Well, what we want to examine
for that region of convergence

00:46:56.580 --> 00:47:00.760
is does it imply a
right-sided sequence.

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:02.760
Well, it does, because
the region of convergence

00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.530
is outside this pole.

00:47:04.530 --> 00:47:11.820
So in fact, for this example,
the system is also causal.

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:14.490
And in fact, look, we know
what the unit sample response

00:47:14.490 --> 00:47:18.060
is because we've been working
with that example previously.

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.700
The unit sample response
here, in fact, is h of n

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:26.970
is 1/2 to the n
times a unit step.

00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:33.560
But that's not the only choice
for the region of convergence.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:37.330
We could, alternatively,
pick a region of convergence

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.070
which is inside that pole.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:42.690
That is-- let's
look at this again.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:47.830
Zero at the origin, a pole
at equals z equals 1/2.

00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:50.980
But now let's take the
region of convergence

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:54.740
to be inside that pole.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.340
If it's inside that
pole, then, first of all,

00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.840
is the system stable?

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.420
No, it's not stable, because
the region of convergence

00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.440
didn't include the unit circle.

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.540
So it's not stable.

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:10.439
And furthermore,
it's not causal.

00:48:10.439 --> 00:48:11.730
In fact, it's just the reverse.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.950
It's anti-causal.

00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:17.470
It's not causal.

00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:20.700
And in fact, we know,
again, what the unit sample

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.400
response is for that case
because we worked it out

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:31.800
previously, namely h of n is
equal to minus 1/2 to the n,

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.710
but for n negative,
not for n positive.

00:48:34.710 --> 00:48:41.820
That is, multiplied by
u of minus n minus 1.

00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:43.950
And this, by the way,
if you refer back

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:46.830
several lectures ago, is
consistent with the two

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:50.310
solutions that we got for a
linear constant coefficient

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:52.140
difference equation.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.000
And now you can see
that, for example,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.860
if I specified the
difference equation,

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:01.710
and I said that, in addition,
what we're talking about

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:04.500
is, say, a stable
system, then you

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.260
could construct the region
of convergence by saying,

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.760
all right, the unit
circle has to be

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.980
in the region of
convergence, and now I'll

00:49:10.980 --> 00:49:14.700
take the region of convergence
to go in toward a pole

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.170
and out toward a pole.

00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:18.390
Or if I said, the
system was causal,

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.830
then you could construct
the region of convergence.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:24.270
So sometimes, in stating a
linear constant coefficient

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:27.390
difference equation, we'll
basically [AUDIO OUT]

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:31.620
convergence by making
an additional statement

00:49:31.620 --> 00:49:32.860
about the system.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.710
For [AUDIO OUT]
system is causal,

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:39.330
or the system is stable,
or both if it can be both.

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:44.130
[AUDIO OUT] So this
is the Z-transform.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:47.910
Just to summarize
the key points first,

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:51.540
the Z-transform was
introduced to get around

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:55.360
the convergence problem
with the Fourier transform.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.760
The Z-transform of sequences
that are exponentials

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.530
are ratios of polynomials.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.460
That is, they can be described
in terms of poles and zeros.

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:09.150
But the Z-transform
is not specified just

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:11.220
by the ratio of polynomials.

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.000
You also need to know what
the region of convergence

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.630
is of the Z-transform
so that, in fact,

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:25.370
for several different
sequences, you

00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:27.701
can end up with the same
ratio of polynomials,

00:50:27.701 --> 00:50:29.450
but of course you'll
get different regions

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.650
of convergence.

00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:32.390
Finally, the region
of convergence

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:33.950
includes the unit circle.

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:38.240
That tells us that the
Fourier transform converges.

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:40.820
And also, we're able
to make statements

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:43.340
about a region of
convergence as it

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:45.830
relates to right-sided,
left-sided, and two-sided

00:50:45.830 --> 00:50:47.540
sequences.

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.950
Next time, we'll continue the
discussion of the Z-transform,

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.750
and in particular develop
the inverse Z-transform.

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:56.980
Thank you.

00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:59.982

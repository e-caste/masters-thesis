SCOTT HUGHES: OK.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.353
Let's move on to
the next lecture.

00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:16.770
Might have gotten a little bit
of me getting prepped here.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.360
I really have to
give a lot of credit

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.560
to the people in the Office
of Digital Learning for making

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
this entire thing possible.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.590
So I'm really
grateful particularly

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.270
to Elaine Mello, who is at home
running the show remotely right

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.770
now.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.160
This is-- a lot of people at MIT
are doing a tremendous amount

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.940
to keep this place functioning,
and everyone really

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.060
deserves a huge pat on the back.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.570
All right.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.480
So in the lecture that I just
completed a few moments ago,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.480
we described--

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.980
I described how to characterize
the gauge-invariant radiative

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.355
degrees of freedom, which we
call gravitational radiation.

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.400
With gravitational radiation,
we found at the end--

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.830
there's a formula that I will
write down again a little

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.960
bit later in this lecture,
but we essentially

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.300
found that it looks like certain
projections of a term that

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.255
involves two time derivatives
of the quadrupole moment

00:01:18.255 --> 00:01:18.755
of a source.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.500
This has in recent
years led to a--

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.600
well, we've now been
able to directly measure

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.040
this form of radiation.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.528
I'm wearing my LIGO hat in
honor of the facility that first

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:36.820
directly measured these things.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.160
And we have inaugurated
an entirely new field

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.442
of observational
astronomy based on being

00:01:42.442 --> 00:01:43.650
able to measure those things.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.160
It's pretty exciting.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.560
I hope, though,
that a few people

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.030
noticed how restricted the
analysis that I did is.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.240
I defined gravitational
waves only

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.540
in the context of linearized
theory on a flat background.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.335
We haven't talked much
about other solutions

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:13.880
to the Einstein field equations
yet, but you know it's coming.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.440
And I hope you can appreciate
that, in fact, our universe is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.620
not described by
a flat background.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.250
Many of the sources
that we study,

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.045
it is only weakly curved
away from a flat background.

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:29.420
So for instance,
our solar system

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.837
is accurately described as
something that is weakly curved

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:33.910
away from a flat background.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.760
And in that context,
much of what I described

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.470
carries over very cleanly.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.510
And so you essentially have--

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.190
in that case, you need to--

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.440
if you want to analyze things
like gravitational waves

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.980
propagating in our solar system
or through a galaxy which

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.870
has a spacetime metric, it's
also accurately described

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.680
as flat spacetime plus a
weak deviation away from it.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.183
You can take
advantage of the fact

00:02:58.183 --> 00:02:59.600
that your gravitational
wave tends

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.260
to be something
that's rapidly varying

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.240
and your solar system
and your galaxy

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.550
is something that has
very slow time variation,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.888
or it's even static.

00:03:07.888 --> 00:03:09.430
So you can take
advantage of the fact

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.805
that there's these
different time

00:03:10.805 --> 00:03:13.690
derivatives to separate terms.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.310
That actually leads
me naturally to,

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.260
what do we do if
I want to describe

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.040
the very realistic scenario of
gravitational waves propagating

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.990
not on a flat background,
but on some kind

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.700
of a curved background?

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.610
Perhaps they propagate
near a black hole

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.690
where spacetime is very
different from the spacetime

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.927
of special relativity.

00:03:31.927 --> 00:03:33.760
Perhaps we need to
describe them propagating

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.880
across a large sector
of our universe.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.530
We haven't talked
about cosmology yet,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.430
but it's the subject of the
next lecture I intend to record.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.200
And the spacetime that describes
our universe on large scales

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.570
does not look like the
metric of special relativity.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:04:00.680
So how do I describe
gravitational radiation, GWs,

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.750
Gravitational Waves, on
a non-flat background?

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.110
Schematically, you can
imagine that in this case,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.440
you're working with
a spacetime that can

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.143
be broken into a background.

00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:29.310
I'll put a little hat on
it to say that this denotes

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.972
my background spacetime.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.850
And then some kind of a wave
field propagating on it.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.890
This background
is no longer going

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.330
to be that of
special relativity.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.520
This could be
something that varies

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.660
with both space and time.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:07.020
This will be something that in
general is small in the sense

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.320
that in most of the cases,
certainly all the cases

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.220
we're going to
study in this class,

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.220
any term that involves
an h times an h

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.910
will be second order
in a very small number,

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.123
and so we can discard it.

00:05:20.123 --> 00:05:22.290
But it's still going to be
challenging to figure out

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.240
how I can even define what
a wave means in this case.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.930
So to wrap your
heads around that,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.690
think about what a local
measurement might do, OK?

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.150
So suppose I am in some
region of spacetime.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.422
So first of all,
we had a parable

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:42.130
that we looked at in
our previous lecture

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.490
where we looked at geodesics
in a spacetime that was flat

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.100
plus a gravitational wave.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.610
And of course,
geodesics are geodesics,

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.020
and so we just found that they
are unaccelerated relative

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.040
to freefall frames.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.040
That sort of is-- you
know, more or less

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.850
defines what a geodesic is,
so it was not too surprising.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.250
But we can then look at,
for example, two relatively

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:04.960
nearby geodesics,
and we can look

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.300
at how their geodesic
separation changes.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.860
We can look at the
behavior of light

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.050
as it bounces back and forth.

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.860
Something that's
important to bear in mind

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.560
is that when I make
a measurement like

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.760
that, I measure this
or some quantity that

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.830
is derived from this,
the curvature tensor

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.490
or an integrated light
propagation time.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.430
We may know that
the spacetime metric

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.398
has two vary conceptually
different contributions to it.

00:06:44.398 --> 00:06:46.190
It's got a background,
and it's got a wave.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.300
How do we-- conceptually, we
might see how to separate them,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:03.790
but how do we define some
kind of a toolkit that

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.610
allows us to separate?

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.560
How do we define the separation
between background and wave?

00:07:17.518 --> 00:07:18.310
Put it another way.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.263
Suppose what you are sensitive
to is spacetime curvature.

00:07:21.263 --> 00:07:22.930
Suppose you are
sensitive to things that

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.090
depend on the Riemann tensor.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:28.120
How do you know from your
measurement that you are

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.240
measuring the Riemann tensor
associated to the gravitational

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.020
wave and not a Riemann tensor
associated with a curvature--

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:34.560
excuse me--

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.840
associated with your background?

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.070
That is an extremely
important issue.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.357
If all I can measure is
this, but I want to get this,

00:07:46.357 --> 00:07:48.940
what is the trick that I use to
distinguish between these two?

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.008
I call this a trick
in my notes, but I

00:07:58.008 --> 00:07:59.300
don't like that term, actually.

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:00.380
This is not a trick.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.560
This is a fundamentally
important point

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.250
when you are trying to measure
some kind of a perturbation

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.450
to a--

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.918
not just to spacetime,
but to any kind of a field

00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:12.710
that you are studying,
any kind of quantity

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:15.440
you're studying which is
itself spatially and temporally

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.110
varying.

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:25.670
What you need to do is take
advantage of a separation

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:28.023
of length and timescales.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.040
When I'm talking about
general relativity

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.560
and I'm talking about
gravitational waves,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.250
I am going to use the fact
that a gravitational wave is

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.441
oscillatory.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:16.610
And as such, it varies on a much
smaller length and timescales--

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:21.020
it varies on much smaller
length and timescales

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:22.290
than the background does.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:35.190
OK?

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:37.620
It's useful to introduce
an analogy here.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:42.450
Think about a water wave
propagating on the ocean.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.370
In almost all
cases when you look

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.200
at a water wave
propagating on the ocean,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.770
it's obvious what
is the wave and what

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.147
is the curvature in the ocean.

00:09:59.147 --> 00:10:00.730
It's actually
associated with the fact

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.580
that the Earth is round.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.120
So it is clear from the
separation of both length

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.635
scales and timescales--

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:19.650
not clean-- clear
how to separate wave

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:30.810
from the curvature
of the Earth bending

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:37.710
due to geological structures
and things like that.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.450
A component of the
curvature of the ocean

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.322
that has a curvature scale
of, say, 6,000 kilometers--

00:10:50.322 --> 00:10:52.030
well, that's just the
fact that the Earth

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.050
is a sphere with a radius
of 6,000 kilometers.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:54.550
OK?

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.750
So you can kind of see that.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.550
But if you see something
that is varying

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.133
with a period of
about a second that's

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:01.120
got a wavelength
of a meter or two,

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.412
that has nothing to do with
the curvature of the Earth.

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.200
That's a wave.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.980
We want to introduce a similar
concept here and apply it

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.100
to our general
relativistic calculation.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:24.190
So let's introduce two sets
of length and timescales--

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:26.800
let's call them scales--

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.180
we will use in our analysis.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:44.470
So capital L and
capital T, these

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.780
are my long length
in timescales.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.725
These describe the
variation of my background.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:14.260
Lambda and tau are
my short scales,

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:24.980
and they describe the
wavelength in the period

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.090
of gravitational waves.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:29.990
So to put this in the context
of the kind of measurements

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:35.550
that LIGO makes, the
LIGO interferometers

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:40.200
make measurements
of behavior of light

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.080
moving in the spacetime
near the Earth.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.760
Now, there is a
component of that

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.480
that varies on a
scale that has to do

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.500
with the curvature of spacetime
near the surface of the Earth

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.470
due to the Earth's
mass distribution.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.060
That occurs on--
so first of all,

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.870
that is practically static.

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.320
It does vary somewhat
because of the motion

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.860
of the moon around
the Earth and because

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:12.890
of the behavior of the
fluid in the Earth's core.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:16.740
There are small variations there
which, interestingly enough,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.630
can be measured.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.940
But those tend to
occur on timescales

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:24.150
on the order of hours
at the shortest.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:26.250
For the moon's orbit,
the moon goes around

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.070
in a time period
of about a month.

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:32.180
The Earth's rotating.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:33.780
It's turning on its axis.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.520
And so at a particular
point, you're

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.320
sort of casing the gravitational
field of the moon as the Earth

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:44.370
rotates under it, and
so your time thing here

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.940
is on the order of
hours to about a day.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:50.040
The length scale
associated with this--

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.320
you can calculate things
like the Riemann curvature

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.560
or tensor components near
the surface of the Earth.

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.390
That has the units of
1 over length squared.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:00.630
So take the square
root and inverse it,

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.000
and you're going to find
that this varies on a length

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.978
scale that is thousands or--

00:14:05.978 --> 00:14:08.520
I should probably work this out
before I try quoting numbers,

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.150
but it's many, many, many,
many, many kilometers,

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:16.050
tens of thousands or
millions of kilometers.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.760
Tens of thousands, probably.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.310
My gravitational
wave, by contrast,

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:23.220
it's got wavelengths that
are on the order of-- they

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.890
are also on the order of
thousands of kilometers,

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.260
but there is a time
variation on them

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.680
that, for the LIGO detectors,
is on the order of seconds

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.657
at most, really
tenths of a second

00:14:33.657 --> 00:14:35.490
at the current sensitivity
of the detectors,

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.550
up to milliseconds.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.750
Way faster variation.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.890
So by looking for pieces
of what I can measure

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.482
that vary on these length
scales and these time scales,

00:14:46.482 --> 00:14:47.940
I can separate it
from effects that

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:53.490
are varying on these long time
scales and long length scales.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.237
So as I move forward
in this lecture,

00:14:57.237 --> 00:14:59.070
let me emphasize that
some of the things I'm

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.148
going to introduce here are--

00:15:01.148 --> 00:15:03.190
first of all, they're a
little bit more advanced.

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:06.930
You are certainly not
responsible for knowing

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.400
the gory details of how
some of these tools I'm

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.380
going to introduce are used.

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:12.880
All right.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.590
So the point is,
once I've introduced

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.680
these long scales and
these short scales,

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:23.050
what we can then do is we
can always remove the wave,

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:30.410
remove the oscillation by
introducing an averaging

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:31.438
procedure.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:42.870
So if you imagine that you
average over a timescale that

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.470
is several times the
wave-- excuse me--

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:54.530
several times the period of the
wave and over a length scale

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.940
that is several times the
wavelength of the wave.

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:02.120
These are taken to be
shorter than the long scales,

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.790
but longer than
the short scales.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:07.260
And so when you do that--

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:13.590
let me put it this way.

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:17.670
If I average-- so
these angle brackets

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:20.450
are what I'm going to define
as my averaging procedure.

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.950
I will make this a little bit
more quantitative in a moment.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:39.840
On length scale l
and timescale t,

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.000
the background basically
doesn't change.

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:53.630
So when I average it, I just
get the background back.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:57.480
On the other hand, my wave
oscillates a couple of times.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.410
So if I average
something that oscillates

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:03.810
over a couple of
cycles, I get 0.

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:08.250
So given what I can
actually measure,

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.980
which is the spacetime or
things related to the spacetime,

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:14.354
this averaging procedure lets
me pick out the background.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.760
The radiation is
then what I get when

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.790
I subtract that average
bit from the field.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.663
So these are all things that,
as a theorist thinking about how

00:18:05.663 --> 00:18:07.580
someone is going to go
in and actually measure

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.122
properties of the
gravitational wave,

00:18:09.122 --> 00:18:12.980
these are tools I can use
to separate one spatially

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.580
and temporally varying
quantity from another.

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:17.983
Now, here I'm going to
describe something that's

00:18:17.983 --> 00:18:20.150
a little bit more advanced
than we need to get into,

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.660
but it's important to discuss.

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:24.105
How do you actually
average a tensor like this?

00:18:24.105 --> 00:18:25.230
That's a little bit tricky.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.310
So the averaging was
first made rigorous.

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:38.280
And there have been various
other mathematical formulations

00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:40.030
of this that are
presented over the years,

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:42.613
but I like this particular one
because it's conceptually quite

00:18:42.613 --> 00:18:43.880
simple.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:51.230
It was first made rigorous by
Dieter Brill and James Hartle--

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:54.610
Hartle is the author of a
nice elementary textbook

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.680
on general relativity--

00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.330
in 1964.

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.235
And the reference is
given in the notes.

00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:04.100
And what you basically
do is to define

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.900
the average of a quantity
like the spacetime metric,

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.450
you integrate it over
some proper volume

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:18.980
in spacetime, proper 4 volume
with a particular weighting

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.600
function.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:25.700
So this is something
that is defined such

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:35.070
that if you integrate it over
that same region, you get 1.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:37.020
And it's taken to be
something that is--

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.720
you can sort of think of as a
Gaussian in all four spacetime

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.750
directions that
is peaked around--

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:49.140
it's peaked at a
particular location,

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:57.916
and it has a width of l in
all directions, l and t.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:03.760
We spent a lot of time
talking about what

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.860
makes a tensor a tensor.

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:08.020
And one of the things
that we discussed

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.000
was the fact that when I am
working in curved space time

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.010
and my basis objects
are functions,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:20.700
I can't really add a
tensor here to a tensor

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.940
there because they live in
different tangent spaces.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.680
That's a poorly
defined operation.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.700
An integral is nothing more
than a sum on steroids.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.350
So how is it that I'm
allowed to do this?

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:38.570
Well, the idea here
is this is not exact.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.780
OK?

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.820
When one does this,
you will find--

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:53.740
what comes out-- your average
tensor modulo corrections

00:20:53.740 --> 00:21:08.430
or errors that are of
order short length scale

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.212
over long time length scale.

00:21:11.212 --> 00:21:13.170
This is the best you're
going to be able to do.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.850
You're always going
to be a little bit

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.190
off when you define an
averaging procedure like this

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.248
because by definition,
an average can't

00:21:19.248 --> 00:21:20.040
capture everything.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.207
That's why you're averaging.

00:21:21.207 --> 00:21:23.650
You're trying to actually
throw away some piece of it.

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.140
So this allows us to
define our tensor calculus

00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:34.080
in this averaged way in a
very useful framework provided

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:34.650
with--

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.870
we just need to accept the
fact that there's always

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:37.620
going to be--

00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.800
it really only makes
sense in this regime where

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.210
we can cleanly separate our
length scales and our time

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.700
scales.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.962
I emphasize this because
sometimes one does an analysis,

00:21:47.962 --> 00:21:49.920
and one finds things are
really weird going on.

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.503
It's often useful
to sort of step back

00:21:51.503 --> 00:21:52.550
and say, wait a minute.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.300
I'm trying to describe
gravitational waves

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.930
in a particular regime.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.110
Are these actually
gravitational waves?

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.652
And you sort of look
at this, and you

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.190
realize you've put yourself
into a regime where

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:06.540
your perturbation is varying on
the same timescales and length

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:08.250
scales as your background.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.670
And in fact, your amplitude
is no longer really small.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.900
You sort of go, oh, crap.

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:14.910
What I've done here is
I've actually pushed this

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.900
beyond the regime in which
the radiative approximation is

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.050
valid.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.980
So bear this in mind.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:22.620
You're always
working-- you're always

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:26.880
going to be working in
this approximative form.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.170
Suppose we have now done this.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.570
We have separated length scales.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:40.240
So we now have cleanly
and conceptually

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.600
separated into background
and perturbation.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.490
Now what I would
like to do is just

00:22:55.490 --> 00:23:01.988
run through my exercise of
computing all the quantities

00:23:01.988 --> 00:23:04.030
that I need to do to
describe radiation-- really,

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:07.400
all of my quantities that I need
to do to develop and then solve

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.990
the Einstein field equations.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.470
And I'm going to do
so linearizing in h

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.860
about this curved
background rather than

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:19.430
about the flat background.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:26.720
So let's develop all of
our spacetime curvature

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:37.270
tools, all the
various quantities,

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:45.130
linearizing in h around g hat.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:50.400
So I'm still doing
linearized theory,

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:54.270
but I am not linearizing around
a flat background anymore.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.950
So to give you an
idea, I'm going

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:00.637
to do one term associated with
this and a little bit of--

00:24:00.637 --> 00:24:02.970
one term associated with this
and a little bit of detail

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.880
so you can just see what the
complications end up looking

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:06.660
like.

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:10.057
So first thing you might want to
do is compute your connection.

00:24:15.910 --> 00:24:18.452
Go back to your definition.

00:24:18.452 --> 00:24:20.910
That should be in your notes
from a couple of lectures ago.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.400
So you insert this.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.870
Here is the definition
of the connection.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:48.620
Let's now insert this split.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:54.500
So the inverse metric
is going to have

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.630
a form that looks very
reminiscent to how

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:59.630
we did the inverse
metric in linearizing

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:03.350
around a flat background,
the exact same logic.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.590
I am raising indices
using the background,

00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:09.170
so h alpha beta in
the upstairs position

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:13.410
is what I get when
I raise using g hat.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:14.680
And you get a minus sign.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.860
Again, this is sort of
like the tensor equivalent

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.230
of binomial expansion of
1 over 1 plus epsilon.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:28.860
Pardon me just one moment.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:43.713
So I'm going to get two terms.

00:25:43.713 --> 00:25:45.630
So here's the first thing
where I'm raising it

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:47.477
to the inverse metric.

00:25:47.477 --> 00:25:49.060
This is going to
split into two terms.

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.268
Let me just write them all
out for completeness here.

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.380
So let's pause for
just a second here.

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.710
So when I multiply
all of this out,

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.560
I'm going to get one term
that involves background

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:20.080
inverse metric hitting all the
derivatives of my background

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:20.580
metric.

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:28.720
I'm going to call it--

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.730
I'm going to call that
Christoffel with a hat.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:33.230
OK?

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.230
That is nothing more than
the Christoffel symbol

00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:38.585
that you would have gotten
if you were just working

00:26:38.585 --> 00:26:39.710
with the background metric.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.990
You're going to get
another term that

00:26:46.990 --> 00:27:05.540
involves h alpha beta acting
on the Christoffel symbol

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:08.000
with all the indices in
the downstairs position

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.750
and constructed
from the background.

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:15.290
Then you're going to
get another term that

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:23.580
involves your background
inverse hitting

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:28.560
various derivatives of your
wave or of your probation

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.759
around the background.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:40.582
At this point-- oh, and
there'll be a term of order h

00:27:40.582 --> 00:27:42.040
squared which I'm
going to discard.

00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:47.340
At this point, you just
have to kind of stare

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.460
at this for a little bit.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:54.030
And when you do so, you find out
something of a miracle occurs.

00:27:54.030 --> 00:28:06.620
You can write this as
background plus a perturbation

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:07.870
to the connection.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.700
I shift to the connection.

00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:13.910
And this shift-- when you
stare at and you organize all

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:28.230
the terms that appear here,
this turns out-- whoops--

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:36.950
this turns out to
look like something

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:40.210
that is very reminiscent of
the formula for the Christoffel

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:45.140
symbols, but only acting
on the h's and using

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.023
covariant derivatives rather
than partial derivatives.

00:28:53.347 --> 00:28:55.680
I don't have a good way to
prove this other than to say,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.670
you know what?

00:28:56.670 --> 00:29:01.700
Expand out all of these
covariant derivatives

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.750
and then compare these terms.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:08.390
And this ends up being what
you get when the smoke clears.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.670
I go through this
one in some detail

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:15.830
because simplifications of
this sort happen at every level

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:16.630
as we move on.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:19.610
What we're basically going to
do is sort of brute force expand

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:20.540
things.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.690
We'll find a term that looks
like just a pure background

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:26.420
piece, and then there'll
be a whole bunch

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:30.880
of little bits of crap that
are linear in the field h.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.960
And you can gather
them together and often

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.370
write them in a form that's
prettier, kind of like this,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:38.720
where it's just sort of a shift
to the connection involving

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.550
covariant derivatives.

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:44.060
There's no great algorithm for
actually working all these guys

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.230
out.

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:47.360
Basically, you just
have a bit of labor

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.590
to do to put them together.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:30:01.760
So let me write out a couple
of other examples of what

00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:02.810
follows from this.

00:30:24.490 --> 00:30:24.990
Let's see.

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.090
There's a point I want to
get to in just a moment.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.840
I'll go through that
in a bit more detail.

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.260
OK.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:39.840
So when I take my Christoffel
and I work out my Riemann

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:47.610
tensor, I find a
piece that looks

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:53.487
just like Riemann computed
solely from the background.

00:30:56.230 --> 00:31:00.090
And then I get a
correction to it.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:35.515
And to linear order in h, this
looks like when you work out--

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.030
OK.

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.440
Hang on just a second.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.440
So at this point,
we can now go ahead

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.990
and start making things like the
Ricci tensor and the Einstein

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.490
tensor.

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.300
I got slightly
ahead of myself here

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.160
because there's an important
point to make at this point.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:04.730
So now, as we move
forward, if we're

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.130
assuming Einstein's
general relativity,

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:13.670
our curvature tensors end up
coupling to the Einstein field

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:23.160
equations, a couple things
like the Ricci tensor

00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.690
and the Einstein tensor to
the stress energy tensor.

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:41.560
Accordingly, I am going to make
the following simplification.

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:56.040
Let's set the stress
energy tensor equal to 0.

00:32:56.040 --> 00:33:01.650
So the analysis which I'm
going to do in the remaining

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.610
time in this lecture, it
only describes vacuum regions

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:06.750
of spacetime.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.080
One doesn't need to do
this, and I strongly,

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.880
strongly emphasize this.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.210
Doing so makes this lecture
about one third as long

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.640
as it would be if I did not
assume this was equal to 0.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.520
So this is solely being
introduced to simplify things.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.370
And what this means is that
I am essentially describing

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:27.111
gravitational waves as I--

00:33:27.111 --> 00:33:30.620
I'm describing gravitational
waves far from their source.

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:32.370
Unfortunately, it does
mean it complicates

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.780
a little bit how they work in
some cosmological spacetimes.

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:37.590
But it is still
sufficient for me

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.650
to introduce some of the key
concepts that I want to do.

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.740
By assuming that t
mu nu is equal to 0,

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:49.590
what I'm going to do is
I'm essentially, then,

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:56.910
assuming that the
background is equal to 0.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:00.450
The background spacetime
arises from an Einstein tensor

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:02.640
that is equal to 0.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:06.360
And it's not hard to show that
this corresponds to Ricci being

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:08.250
equal to 0, and of
course, then, the Ricci

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.130
scalar being equal to 0.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:20.230
So as I move forward here,
my background Riemann tensor

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:23.290
is nonzero, but my
background Ricci tensor

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.300
will be equal to 0.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.960
And I strongly emphasize that
this is just a simplification

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.080
that I am introducing in
order to make today's analysis

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.651
a little bit more tractable.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.550
So my background Ricci
tensor is equal to 0.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:01.460
Let's compute the perturbation
in my Ricci tensor.

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:19.960
This is what I get when I
trace over indices 1 and 3.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.500
I will skip over much of
the algebra that is in this.

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:30.010
But what one finds going through
this sea of various definitions

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:33.160
is that what results
is a delta r mu nu.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.600
I will define this
symbol in just a moment.

00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:32.810
OK.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.270
So a couple of definitions.

00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:36.270
This box operator that
I'm introducing here,

00:36:36.270 --> 00:36:39.065
this is a covariance
wave operator.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:57.380
And the trace is what I get
when I contract my perturbation

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.180
h with the background metric.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:00.760
OK?

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.320
So I just want to
quickly emphasize

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:05.620
that there is nothing
very profound about what

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.090
has gone into this.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:11.050
This was all done by essentially
just throwing together

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:14.243
all the various
definitions and linearizing

00:37:14.243 --> 00:37:15.910
in all the quantities
that I care about.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:33.165
So what I would like
to do now is take--

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:44.890
I'm going to take my Ricci
tensor and my Ricci scalar.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:53.050
I will assemble them to
make my Einstein tensor.

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.350
And by requiring that
that be equal to 0,

00:37:59.350 --> 00:38:02.320
I will get an equation
that describes radiation

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.130
as it's propagating in
this curved background.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.490
But before I do this, I want
to just pause for a second

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:15.430
here and note that I'm going
to get a mess when I do this.

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:18.550
You can already sort of see I've
got some interesting structures

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:19.430
here.

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:20.830
So here's a trace.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:22.390
Here's a trace.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.370
Here is a term that
looks like a divergence.

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.830
Here is a term that
looks like a divergence.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.810
When we were doing linearize
theory on a flat background

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.340
spacetime, we got rid of
those degrees of freedom.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.560
We sort of deduced that these
were just kind of annoying

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.040
for doing our analysis.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.080
And by changing gauge, we were
able to rewrite the equations

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.270
in a way that allowed
us to get rid of them.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.470
Before I assemble
this, I want to explore

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.630
what changing gauge
means now that I'm

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:57.320
working on a curved background.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:03.440
So brief aside: let's
generalize our notion

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.037
of a gauge transformation.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.330
So what I'm going to
do is just as when

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:16.060
I was linearizing around a
flat background spacetime,

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:20.230
I began by introducing an
infinitesimal coordinate

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.286
displacement.

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:29.755
And when I did this,
I then had a matrix--

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:47.800
a matrix that affected this
coordinate transformation,

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.565
which looks like so.

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.300
Just as when I-- whoops, typo.

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:01.490
Just as when I was doing this
around a flat background,

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:06.580
I'm going to assume that these
elements tend to be small.

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.880
So let's apply this generalized
gauge transformation

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:18.660
to my metric.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.280
Something worth
highlighting at this point--

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:31.470
my metric depends
on space and time.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:32.323
It's not flat.

00:40:32.323 --> 00:40:33.990
So I have to build
in the fact that it's

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:38.250
a function of these coordinates.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:54.200
So this-- pardon
me just one second.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.400
So now I need to find the
inverse metric-- excuse me--

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:25.500
the inverse coordinate
transformation

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.955
that will essentially
give me the same thing,

00:41:27.955 --> 00:41:29.580
flipping my indices
around a little bit

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.020
and introducing a minus sign.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.520
And when I expand this out--

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:37.220
again, bearing in mind I have to
be careful about the coordinate

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:56.160
that this is being
evaluated at, OK?--

00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.790
So I'm going to get one term
here that involves my Kronecker

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:01.260
deltas hitting this guy.

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.910
Again, be careful
with that argument.

00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:38.000
OK?

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
So I'm going to get another
term that involves--

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.770
I'm going to get two
terms that involve

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:45.250
my derivative of my
infinitesimal displacement

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.290
hitting the background.

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:50.590
I'm going to get terms that
involve the Kronecker hitting

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:52.830
my metric perturbation.

00:42:52.830 --> 00:42:58.330
I'm going to discard terms
that are quadratically small.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.310
Now, here is where we need
to be a little bit careful.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:08.220
Notice I have shifted
this guy here.

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:11.747
I'm going to expand this
with a Taylor expansion.

00:43:45.543 --> 00:43:48.430
Move this a little higher so
that it's not blocking my view.

00:44:01.845 --> 00:44:02.345
OK.

00:44:02.345 --> 00:44:03.370
That looks pretty gross.

00:44:06.035 --> 00:44:07.160
We can clean it up, though.

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:28.440
If I use the fact that--

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.980
for example, looking
at one of these terms,

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:42.200
this can be written as
the covariant derivative

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:49.926
of my infinitesimal displacement
minus a connection coefficient.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:58.620
You can gather together
a whole bunch of terms.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:07.300
And what you find--

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.470
something that looks
remarkably similar to the form

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.000
that we got.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.520
By the way, I may have forgotten
to define that back here.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:47.210
My sincere apologies to those
of you following along at home!

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:49.490
My covariant
derivatives with a hat

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.260
mean this is a covariant
derivative being

00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:54.540
taken with respect to
the background spacetime.

00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.125
So just do your normal
recipe for evaluating

00:45:57.125 --> 00:45:59.300
a covariant
derivative, but compute

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.223
all of your Christoffels using
the background spacetime g hat.

00:46:03.223 --> 00:46:04.640
Carrying back over
to here, what I

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:07.070
find is that doing this
infinitesimal coordinate

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.370
transformation, it looks
just like, why did you

00:46:10.370 --> 00:46:11.750
do all these steps properly?

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:13.880
And this little bit of
doing the Taylor expansion

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.990
in the metric--

00:46:14.990 --> 00:46:18.440
I speak from experience-- it's
easy to overlook that bit.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.050
This looks just like
what we did when

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:24.530
we applied an infinitesimal
coordinate transformation

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:29.150
to a perturbation
around flat spacetime.

00:46:29.150 --> 00:46:33.680
And it tells us that there
is a kind of gauge that

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.200
can be applied to my
gravitational waves

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:42.290
around a curved background
provided I promote

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:49.120
my derivatives of the
infinitesimal coordinate

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:53.460
generator from
partials to covariance.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:47:00.350
So this defines-- if I introduce
a generalized coordinate

00:47:00.350 --> 00:47:04.320
transformation, this generalizes
the notion of a gauge

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:07.680
transformation when I'm
examining things like radiation

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.840
on a curved background.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.947
This is my generalized
gauge transformation.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:40.680
It will also prove useful for
us to have a notion of a trace

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.912
reversed perturbation.

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:59.750
So I'm going to
introduce an h bar mu nu.

00:47:59.750 --> 00:48:01.980
This will be my original
h mu nu, the perturbation

00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:03.676
around my curved background.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:10.970
And I subtract off 1/2
of the trace like so.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:14.420
If you take the trace of this in
the way that I defined earlier,

00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.840
this will give you
minus little h back.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:32.110
So again, at this
point, I'm going

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.560
to skip over a couple of
lines in my lecture notes

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.560
because they're straightforward
but a little bit tedious.

00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:45.370
What we're going to do
is take my Ricci tensor,

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.340
my Ricci scalar, my
background spacetime.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:52.520
I'm going to assemble my
Einstein tensor associated

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.800
with this metric
perturbation, but I'm

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.716
going to write it in terms of
the trace reverse [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:18.500
So let's write out delta g
mu nu in terms of this guy.

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:26.990
So assembling all the
pieces, doing the algebra.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:22.240
OK.

00:50:25.002 --> 00:50:26.960
So pardon while I just
write all that junk out.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.950
So this, again, I
hope, reminds us

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.110
of a step when we were
doing perturbations

00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:36.675
around flat spacetime.

00:50:50.048 --> 00:50:51.590
We have all these
terms that are sort

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:54.800
of annoying divergences of
that trace reverse metric

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.390
perturbation.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:00.110
And so a line or two of
algebra will justify this.

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.740
I can change gauge.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.450
I can find a gauge in
which my perturbation has

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:17.150
no divergence if I choose
these generators such

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:23.240
that they satisfy a wave
equation in which the source is

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.730
the divergence of my
old metric perturbation.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:31.460
Let's suppose we've done this.

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.370
By the way, we will call this
generalized Lorenz gauge.

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:53.440
When you do this,
what you find is that

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:56.350
your metric perturbation--

00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:21.760
oh, shoot-- is governed by
the following Einstein tensor.

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.700
And if you imagine that this
guy is propagating in vacuum,

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:28.690
what this tells you is
that the wave satisfies

00:52:28.690 --> 00:52:31.368
something that's similar to the
flat spacetime wave equation.

00:52:31.368 --> 00:52:33.160
Now, the operator is
a little bit different

00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:39.590
because you have assembled it
out of covariant derivatives

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:41.270
and with a correction,
which shows

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:43.870
that your wave is
actually now coupling

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:46.149
to the curvature of spacetime.

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:53.320
So I have a few more
notes about this.

00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.690
It's not really important
that we go through them

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:56.998
in great detail here.

00:52:56.998 --> 00:52:58.540
Those of you who
are interested, they

00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:02.020
will certainly be made
available through the website.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:05.620
The key thing which I want to
emphasize is essentially some

00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.620
of the key bits of--
an important piece

00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:12.810
of the technique, which is that
what we are doing is using--

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:16.330
we are linearizing around
this flat background.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:19.390
We have generalized our
gauge transformation

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:22.450
to allow us to simplify
the mathematical structure

00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:25.300
of this equation.

00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:28.570
And then what results is
an interesting correction

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:30.520
to the usual wave
equation that one sees.

00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:41.330
So I will also emphasize this is
a somewhat more advanced topic.

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:42.940
So one of the reasons
why I'm eliding

00:53:42.940 --> 00:53:46.720
over some of these details
is they are somewhat tedious.

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:49.930
You don't need to
know them in detail.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:51.430
It's good to be
familiar with them

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:53.320
and to be able to
follow along here.

00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:55.630
I am going to post
a couple of papers

00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:58.990
to the 8.962
website that lay out

00:53:58.990 --> 00:54:01.307
some of the foundations
of this stuff.

00:54:01.307 --> 00:54:02.890
The key thing which
I want to use this

00:54:02.890 --> 00:54:09.090
for is an important aspect
of gravitational waves

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:12.390
is that they carry energy.

00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:15.840
Electromagnetic
waves carry energy.

00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.277
It shouldn't be a surprise if
I have some kind of a source--

00:54:19.277 --> 00:54:20.360
we're in a room right now.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:22.170
There's light
shining down on me.

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:26.790
The energy that is going on
me, it heats me slightly.

00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:29.765
It is being drained from some
power source somewhere else.

00:54:29.765 --> 00:54:31.140
We're all familiar
with the story

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:34.850
of electromagnetic radiation.

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:38.380
For gravitational
waves, ascertaining

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:42.410
what the energy content
of the wave actually is

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:44.230
is a little bit more subtle.

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:52.630
And indeed, understanding that
there is an unambiguous energy

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.630
carried by these
waves is something

00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:59.140
that occupied a lot
of the foundations

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:04.180
of gravitational wave theory
for a couple of decades.

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.040
In part, this is
driven by the fact

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.260
that these things are
so hard to measure

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:09.525
that it was difficult to--

00:55:09.525 --> 00:55:11.650
this is one of those things
where if you could just

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:14.685
go out and measure it, even if
your theory was a little bit

00:55:14.685 --> 00:55:16.560
uncertain, you would
say, well, goddammit it,

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.480
it left an imprint
on my detector here.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:20.178
It must have carried energy.

00:55:20.178 --> 00:55:21.970
And so you would know
where you were going.

00:55:21.970 --> 00:55:23.553
But because there
were no measurements

00:55:23.553 --> 00:55:26.140
of these things for years
and years and years,

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.400
no one quite knew which
direction to step in.

00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:41.200
Part of what makes
this complicated

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:45.970
is the fact that when we
are in general relativity,

00:55:45.970 --> 00:55:48.790
no matter what
your spacetime is,

00:55:48.790 --> 00:55:52.180
you can always go into
a local Lorenz frame.

00:56:01.090 --> 00:56:06.190
When you do that, spacetime
is flat at a point.

00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:24.900
Furthermore, all the
derivatives associated with it--

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:29.290
the first derivatives
associated with it are 0.

00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.160
So it's sort of--

00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:35.830
how the hell can I have a
field h, a gravitational wave

00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:41.260
h that carries energy if I
am free to change coordinates

00:56:41.260 --> 00:56:44.630
and make it equal to 0?

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:47.550
Well, there's a couple of
comments I'll make about that.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:50.215
So in sort of the same way--

00:56:50.215 --> 00:56:51.590
well, let's back
up for a moment.

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:57.470
We made an analogy earlier to
the electromagnetic potential

00:56:57.470 --> 00:57:00.150
when I was describing
gauge transformations.

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:02.270
So the metric is
a quantity that is

00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:05.020
subject to gauge
transformations,

00:57:05.020 --> 00:57:07.130
but the Riemann
curvature tensor--

00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:09.550
when I linearize around
a flat background,

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:11.770
I found that the
Riemann curvature

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:14.463
tensor was invariant to
those transformations.

00:57:14.463 --> 00:57:15.880
It's a little bit
more complicated

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.330
when I linearize around
a curved background,

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:22.570
but it still remains the
case that I can never

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.460
make my curvature go away.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:27.850
It's reminiscent of the fact
that I can choose a gauge that

00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:30.460
lets my electrostatic--

00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:35.485
my electromagnetic potentials do
any number of crazy-ass things.

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:38.110
I must be getting tired because
I'm swearing a little bit more.

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:39.970
So I can let my
electromagnetic potential

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:43.540
do any sorts of crazy
things, but my fields

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.300
are the quantities that
ultimately carry energy.

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:48.560
They carry energy and momentum.

00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:50.320
So in the same way,
the fact that I

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.470
can get rid of the metric
by going into a local Lorenz

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.450
frame, that shouldn't
bother us too much.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.850
That's kind of like going
into a frame where--

00:57:57.850 --> 00:58:02.080
or it's going into a gauge where
I just make my potentials go

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:03.460
away or make my
potentials become

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:06.250
static or something like that.

00:58:06.250 --> 00:58:09.310
This is basically telling
me that the energy

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.582
must be something that is
bound up in the curvature.

00:58:19.820 --> 00:58:22.430
Furthermore, the fact that
I can always make things

00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:24.890
look flat at a
particular point--

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:37.120
I must use non-locality
to actually pull

00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.995
out and understand
the energy content.

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:50.890
This sort of means that in
a very fundamental sense,

00:58:50.890 --> 00:58:55.410
I am never going to be able
to define, in a completely

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.480
gauge-invariant way,
the notion of energy

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.760
in a gravitational wave
at an event in spacetime.

00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:07.390
I may actually come up
with gauges in which there

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:10.648
is some notion of an
energy like quantity

00:59:10.648 --> 00:59:12.190
that's defined at
a particular point.

00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:13.870
It will not be
gauge-invariant, though.

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:19.950
I am going to need to-- if
I want to really rigorously

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:22.260
define what the energy
content gravitation wave is,

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:24.052
it's going to have to
be based on something

00:59:24.052 --> 00:59:27.090
where I'm averaging over a
region that is large compared

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:29.580
to a wavelength,
but small compared

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:32.578
to the scales associated
with my background.

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:45.960
So let me sketch for you
how we can understand this.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.820
And this will conclude
with the derivation

00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:52.710
of a second quantity
that is often

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:54.000
called the quadrupole formula.

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:03.220
Again turning to my
electromagnetic analogy,

01:00:03.220 --> 01:00:06.100
the energy content of--

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.343
well, [INAUDIBLE] the content
of the energy momentum

01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:09.760
carried by an
electromagnetic wave

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.070
is described by a
pointing vector.

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.410
And the pointing vector
looks like the e field

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.840
times the b field.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:18.670
It is quadratic in the field.

01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:20.800
In a similar way, we
are going to expect

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.950
the gravitational
wave energy content

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:27.040
to be something that is going
to be quadratic in a field.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.550
So to do this
properly, we're going

01:00:29.550 --> 01:00:33.700
to need to think about how
to go in the second order

01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:52.670
in our theory, so second
order in perturbations

01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:54.035
around the background.

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:05.500
So what I'm going
to do is imagine

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:13.270
that my spacetime looks
like some background

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:16.690
plus some epsilon
times h alpha beta.

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:18.490
This h alpha beta is
what we just spent

01:01:18.490 --> 01:01:20.340
the past hour or so computing.

01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:29.920
And imagine that there is some
additional term j alpha beta.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.100
This epsilon that
I've introduced here

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:35.256
is just an order
counting parameter.

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.360
Its value is actually 1.

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.070
OK?

01:01:44.070 --> 01:01:46.260
But what it does is
it allows us to keep

01:01:46.260 --> 01:01:48.960
track of the order in
perturbation theory

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:49.680
to which I go.

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.660
So if the gravitational
waves are typically

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:55.570
on the order of, say,
10 to the minus 22,

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:56.890
here's my background curvature.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.590
These terms are all in
the order of 1 or so.

01:01:59.590 --> 01:02:02.740
These are all in the order
of 10 to the minus 22 or so.

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:05.470
These are all in the order
of 10 to the minus 44 or so.

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:12.190
What I want to do is
run this through--

01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:15.220
and let's just focus on
vacuum spacetime for now.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:18.130
Let's run this through the
vacuum Einstein equation.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:24.110
So let's expand g alpha beta.

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.920
Actually, let's not have too
much crosstalk between indices.

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:27.880
I'll call this g mu nu.

01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.170
And I'm going to require
this to be equal to vacuum,

01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:41.240
so I'll set that equal to 0.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:44.230
What I want to do
is expand this guy.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:05.220
That's a tremendous
amount of work,

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:06.720
but I'm going to
sketch for you what

01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:08.095
the highlights of
this look like.

01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:27.077
So when I expand
my Einstein tensor,

01:03:27.077 --> 01:03:28.160
I'm going to get one term.

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:36.380
That is basically just saying
that my background spacetime

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.340
is a vacuum solution.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:45.290
I'm going to get a
term that looks like--

01:03:45.290 --> 01:03:51.090
I'll call it g1 alpha beta.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:57.270
And this is going to depend
on my first-order perturbation

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:58.816
in the background.

01:04:02.290 --> 01:04:06.580
g1 is basically the
delta g that I worked out

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:10.340
in the first hour or
so of this lecture.

01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:21.340
I will get another term
that looks like the same g1,

01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:26.000
but in which my second-order
term is coming along.

01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:34.850
But I'm going to get
an additional term

01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:39.440
that results from non-linear
coupling of h to h.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.270
I'll call that g2.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.000
So I emphasize again, this
is just my ordinary Einstein

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:03.500
equation.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:09.560
This is basically telling me
my background satisfies the--

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:12.470
my background is
a vacuum solution.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:15.822
This is the linear wave
operator on a curved background

01:05:15.822 --> 01:05:17.780
that we just worked out
in the first hour or so

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.190
of this lecture.

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:21.860
This is that same
linear operator,

01:05:21.860 --> 01:05:25.340
but now applied to the
second-order perturbation.

01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:27.950
And this is something new.

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:30.320
It is very messy.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.410
It involves lots of
terms that involve

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:37.820
h hitting covariant derivatives
of h, covariant derivatives

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:41.730
of h hitting each other.

01:05:41.730 --> 01:05:44.120
I will post a paper by
Richard Isaacson that steps

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.160
through this in some detail.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:55.990
What we're going to now do is
we require the Einstein equation

01:05:55.990 --> 01:06:02.900
to hold order by order.

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.260
In other words, at
every order in epsilon,

01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:08.030
this equation must work.

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:11.260
So at order epsilon to
the 0 or at order 1--

01:06:23.535 --> 01:06:25.310
this is what I just said--

01:06:25.310 --> 01:06:26.930
the background is
a vacuum solution.

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:35.640
Groovy.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:51.650
At order epsilon, this
is my wave equation

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:52.998
on my curved background.

01:07:00.980 --> 01:07:07.250
At order epsilon squared,
now something new happens.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:39.330
Now, that is interesting.

01:07:39.330 --> 01:07:42.630
What we are seeing is
that the terms which

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:47.340
involve quadratic things with
the linear perturbation, things

01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:51.150
that are quadratic
in h are acting

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:54.730
as the source to the wave
equation that governs j.

01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:38.279
Let's try to make
some headway on this.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:43.529
Let's go back to our separation
of length in timescales.

01:08:43.529 --> 01:08:54.120
So let's define
delta j mu nu to be

01:08:54.120 --> 01:09:00.090
j mu nu minus what
I get when I average

01:09:00.090 --> 01:09:06.399
j mu nu on an
intermediate length scale.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:10.210
So lambda-- I'll remind you
that lambda and tau are sort of

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:11.800
coming along for the ride here.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.200
This is my gw short scale.

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:20.649
l is my background long scale.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.720
And so what I'm
going to do is say,

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.479
I'm going to take my j mu nu--

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:31.220
I don't really know too
much about it quite yet.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:37.819
And I do know that by
definition, my h only

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:39.740
varies on the short scale.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:40.353
OK?

01:09:40.353 --> 01:09:41.270
So I'm going to take--

01:09:41.270 --> 01:09:44.970
I'm going to do this
averaging procedure here.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.290
Pardon me.

01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.670
That's an error.

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:51.420
And so my l is my
intermediate averaging scale.

01:09:58.590 --> 01:10:01.560
So I'm going to average things
on the intermediate scale l

01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:02.490
here.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:07.410
And so this will be
something that only varies

01:10:07.410 --> 01:10:10.780
on the short scale lambda.

01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:15.970
This, I will take out everything
that varies in the short scale.

01:10:15.970 --> 01:10:17.910
This only varies
on the long scale.

01:10:29.830 --> 01:10:30.880
So this is interesting.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.380
OK?

01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:34.570
By now doing this,
let's regroup my metric.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:46.680
So this guy--

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:56.960
I'm going to first--

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:02.800
sorry, folks.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:03.758
Getting a little tired.

01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:12.530
Here are all the terms that
vary on the long scale.

01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:32.850
And here are all the terms
that vary on my short scale.

01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:49.970
With this idea than I am now--
so it's kind of interesting.

01:11:49.970 --> 01:11:52.940
What we see is that
there is a piece

01:11:52.940 --> 01:11:56.990
of the second-order perturbation
that has kind of become

01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:59.260
a correction to the background.

01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:03.950
So when I take my perturbation
theory to the next order,

01:12:03.950 --> 01:12:05.090
there's no reason--

01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:08.450
so at linear order, we define
the linear order perturbation

01:12:08.450 --> 01:12:11.690
as being only the bit that
varies on the short scale.

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:14.205
But there is no
reason why it has

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.580
to remain the case that it
only varies on the short scale

01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:18.110
when I go to the next order.

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:22.640
And any bit that does, in
fact, vary on the long scale,

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.160
bearing in mind that the
way we do our measurements--

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.740
we separate things and
lengthen time scales--

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:31.830
it's going to look to us like
a correction to the background.

01:12:31.830 --> 01:12:36.888
So with that in mind, let's
revisit the second-order term

01:12:36.888 --> 01:12:37.930
in the Einstein equation.

01:12:55.190 --> 01:13:02.910
So here is my second-order
Einstein equation.

01:13:05.577 --> 01:13:07.160
You should just
assume that these also

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:08.090
depend on the background.

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:09.941
I'm not going to write
that out explicitly.

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:24.620
What I would like to do now is--

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:28.500
let's apply this averaging
to this equation.

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:34.520
So the average of this guy
equals the average of this guy.

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.028
Does this get us anywhere?

01:13:37.028 --> 01:13:38.570
Well, it definitely
gets us somewhere

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:42.320
with this, because this
is a linear operator.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:43.270
OK?

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:46.555
So when I go and--

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.770
I should be a little
bit careful there.

01:13:53.770 --> 01:13:58.480
A useful trick which I forgot
to state-- my apologies--

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:03.550
and this trick is worked
out in the paper by Isaacson

01:14:03.550 --> 01:14:04.970
that I'm going to post--

01:14:04.970 --> 01:14:10.470
is that whenever you take the
average of second derivatives

01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:16.330
of various kinds
of fields, it is

01:14:16.330 --> 01:14:21.630
equal to second derivatives
of the average of that field

01:14:21.630 --> 01:14:28.620
plus corrections that scale as
the square of the short length

01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:31.270
scale divided by the
long length scale.

01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:35.130
So what that tells me is that at
least up to these corrections,

01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:38.520
which the separation of
length scales by default

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:42.210
is assuming is a small number,
I can take my averaging operator

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:42.930
inside here.

01:15:13.495 --> 01:15:15.370
I can't do that trick
on the right-hand side.

01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:17.370
I've not written out what
this equation actually

01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:18.660
looks like here.

01:15:18.660 --> 01:15:21.302
It's a nonlinear operator, so
it's going to be a lot messier.

01:15:21.302 --> 01:15:23.010
But this is something
that's linear in j.

01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:27.270
And so as long as I bear in
mind that I incur a small error

01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:28.980
by taking various--

01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:34.830
by taking my averaging operation
inside the differential

01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:40.890
operator, this is telling
me that the wave equation--

01:15:40.890 --> 01:15:41.390
sorry.

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:43.760
My Einstein equation
applied to this operator

01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:47.772
here is set by the
quantity that I have there

01:15:47.772 --> 01:15:48.730
on the right-hand side.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:01.635
Now, remember, my background
is itself a vacuum solution.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:33.550
Since my background
is a vacuum solution,

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:39.550
I can rewrite this whole
thing as the Einstein tensor

01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:54.930
on my background metric plus my
average quadratic correction.

01:17:05.323 --> 01:17:06.990
This is going to be
equal to the average

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:10.360
of that second-order piece.

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:14.980
This is just the Einstein field
equation with a strange source.

01:17:17.502 --> 01:17:19.919
If you look at this-- let's
make the following definition.

01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:30.260
I'm going to define
a stress energy

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:36.750
tensor for gravitational
waves as minus 1

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:42.005
over 8 pi g times the
average of this operator.

01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:51.600
What this is now telling me is
that as my gravitational wave

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.080
propagates through
spacetime, it carries,

01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:58.050
it generates a
stress energy that

01:17:58.050 --> 01:18:01.470
changes the background
in an amount that

01:18:01.470 --> 01:18:04.330
is quadratic in the
wave's amplitude.

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:31.450
Now, to get the details of
what that operator actually is,

01:18:31.450 --> 01:18:33.910
I have a formula
or two in my notes

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.100
that will be scanned
and made available.

01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:38.260
I want to cut to the
punchline of this.

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:42.790
The derivation of this is given
in a paper by Richard Isaacson

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:44.920
that I will be posting
to the course website.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:51.664
So expand out this operator.

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:59.350
Place in this the
transverse traceless field.

01:19:15.353 --> 01:19:16.145
And what you find--

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:21.280
fill it with a transverse
traceless field.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.440
That sort of simplifies
a few things,

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:52.430
and you get this
remarkably simple result.

01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:56.190
The angle brackets,
I'll remind you,

01:19:56.190 --> 01:19:58.990
they tell you that
this quantity is only

01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:03.393
defined under the aegis of a
particular averaging operation.

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.570
That aside, what we
now have is a quantity

01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:18.080
that tells us about how
gravitational waves carry

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.965
energy and momentum
away from their sources.

01:20:20.965 --> 01:20:23.090
This is known as the Isaacson
stress energy tensor.

01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:34.410
Let me comment,
especially for students

01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:37.890
who work on things related
to gravitational waves--

01:20:37.890 --> 01:20:40.470
you will encounter
many different notions

01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:43.938
of how to compute the energy,
things like energy and angular

01:20:43.938 --> 01:20:45.355
momentum and things
like that that

01:20:45.355 --> 01:20:48.120
are carried from a radiating
source of gravitational waves.

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:50.910
There is wonderful discussion
of this point in a textbook

01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:52.900
by Poisson and Will.

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:57.510
It's just entitled
Gravity, I believe.

01:20:57.510 --> 01:21:03.540
The Isaacson stress tensor
has the virtue that it is--

01:21:03.540 --> 01:21:06.000
it makes it very clear
that the waves are--

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.440
so it's a tensor.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:10.470
It makes it very clear
that it arises out

01:21:10.470 --> 01:21:15.030
of quadratic derivatives
of the wave field.

01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:19.380
And I really enjoy going
through this derivation

01:21:19.380 --> 01:21:24.630
because you can see the way
in which a term that is--

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.160
at least at the
schematic level, you

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.850
can see the way in which the
second-order contribution

01:21:29.850 --> 01:21:35.070
to the Einstein tensor leads
to a source that modifies

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:36.210
your background spacetime.

01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:37.668
That's exactly what
a stress energy

01:21:37.668 --> 01:21:39.030
tensor is supposed to do.

01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:40.488
For certain practical
applications,

01:21:40.488 --> 01:21:42.572
it turns out to be a little
bit hard to work with.

01:21:42.572 --> 01:21:44.880
And so you'll see this
discussed in some detail in some

01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:46.172
of the more advanced textbooks.

01:21:46.172 --> 01:21:49.080
I'm happy to discuss this with
students who are interested.

01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:53.280
For our purposes, this
is not of concern.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:56.460
Let me just conclude
this lecture

01:21:56.460 --> 01:22:00.780
by evaluating this for the
solution that we worked out.

01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:05.880
So let us imagine that we go
into a nearly flat region where

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:08.010
those covariant
derivatives become simple.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:22.180
And let's just compute one piece
of the stress energy tensor.

01:22:22.180 --> 01:22:25.320
So let's look at the energy
flux in a nearly flat region.

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:43.710
So what I'm going
to compute is the 0,

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:54.980
0 piece of this
which defines how

01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:56.560
power flows through spacetime.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.280
So doing this in
this region basically

01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:17.090
is going to look like the
time derivative of my wave

01:23:17.090 --> 01:23:19.850
field contracted onto itself.

01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:21.710
Let's get the total
amount of energy

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:26.000
that is flowing
through a large sphere

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:31.640
by evaluating t0 0 integrated
over a large sphere

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:33.440
of radius r.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:38.775
And for my hij, I will plug
in that quadrupole amplitude

01:23:38.775 --> 01:23:40.400
that I derived in
the previous lecture.

01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:50.970
Over dots denote d by dt.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:10.540
So if you're interested in
doing this integral yourself,

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:14.374
it's actually not that
hard, and that's a pretty--

01:24:14.374 --> 01:24:15.803
it's a salubrious exercise.

01:24:15.803 --> 01:24:16.720
Let's put it that way.

01:24:20.905 --> 01:24:22.530
So I'll remind you
that this projection

01:24:22.530 --> 01:24:25.230
tensor is built from--

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:30.350
built from the
vectors that describe

01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:32.570
the direction of propagation.

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:37.370
And a few useful
tools to know about--

01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:57.200
so should you choose
to work this guy out,

01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.300
it's worth knowing
that if I integrate

01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:03.740
ni nj over the sphere, this
can be written in terms

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:06.420
of just sines and cosines.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:08.390
These are basically
direction sines--

01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:11.420
or direction cosines.

01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.390
I get a simple result
that depends only

01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:17.990
on the value of the
indices i and j.

01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:31.450
If I integrate this over
this sphere, I get 0.

01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:35.530
And any odd power of the
ends multiplied together

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:39.503
when integrated over the
sphere will give me 0.

01:25:39.503 --> 01:25:41.920
And one more is necessary if
you want to do this integral.

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:57.050
If you integrate four of these
buggers multiplied together,

01:25:57.050 --> 01:26:01.460
you get this object
totally symmetrized

01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.111
on the indices i, j, k, and l.

01:26:14.370 --> 01:26:16.750
So throw it all together.

01:26:16.750 --> 01:26:18.090
Take the derivatives.

01:26:18.090 --> 01:26:20.140
Note that the only thing
that depends on time

01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:22.360
is that quadrupole moment.

01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:29.498
And what you wind up with is
this remarkably simple result.

01:26:29.498 --> 01:26:29.998
Whoops.

01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:53.520
This is a result
that also is known

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:54.740
as the quadrupole formula.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:04.800
It's worth comparing this
to the dipole formula

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:06.480
you get in electrodynamics.

01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.150
So the dipole formula
that describes

01:27:09.150 --> 01:27:11.760
the leading electromagnetic--
the leading power

01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:14.550
in electromagnetic radiation
that comes off of a source

01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:16.890
looks like what you
get when you multiply

01:27:16.890 --> 01:27:22.620
two derivatives of the dipole
moment with each other.

01:27:22.620 --> 01:27:26.970
The leading radiation in
gravity is quadripolar.

01:27:26.970 --> 01:27:29.418
And so rather than being
second derivatives,

01:27:29.418 --> 01:27:31.710
you have to take one more
derivative out of this thing.

01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:36.210
There are three time derivatives
of a quadrupole moment leading

01:27:36.210 --> 01:27:38.220
to this formula.

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:40.830
So this result was
actually originally derived

01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:42.030
by Albert Einstein.

01:27:42.030 --> 01:27:44.258
It's one of the first
calculations that he did.

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:45.300
He actually did it twice.

01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:48.720
He first derived something kind
of like this in, I believe,

01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:50.860
1916.

01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:52.510
And it was totally wrong.

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:54.780
He just basically
made a huge mistake.

01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:58.380
But then he did it more
or less correctly in 1918.

01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.387
So he got this right.

01:27:59.387 --> 01:28:00.220
And it was a small--

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:00.870
a small error.

01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:02.400
He was off by a
factor of 2, which

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:04.440
is a simple algebra mistake.

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.290
It's actually really
enjoyable to count up

01:28:07.290 --> 01:28:09.180
the number of minor
errors that Einstein

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.630
made in some of these works.

01:28:10.630 --> 01:28:13.240
It just makes you feel a little
bit better about yourself.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:17.370
So anyway, Einstein got
this essentially right,

01:28:17.370 --> 01:28:19.680
and then it was
hugely controversial

01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:22.740
for quite a few
decades after that.

01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:25.650
Essentially, going back to these
conceptual issues with which I

01:28:25.650 --> 01:28:28.920
began this lecture, people
just grappled with the idea of,

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:31.183
what does it mean for
gravitational radiation

01:28:31.183 --> 01:28:33.600
to carry energy in the first
place given that I can always

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.370
go into a freely falling frame?

01:28:35.370 --> 01:28:39.120
It took a little while for those
concepts to really solidify.

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.390
Once they did, though,
we were off to the races.

01:28:42.390 --> 01:28:45.690
And it's worth noting that
if I take this formula

01:28:45.690 --> 01:28:47.640
and I apply it to
a binary system--

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.132
I imagine I have two stars
that are orbiting each other.

01:28:50.132 --> 01:28:52.590
I can compute the quadrupole
moment and the time derivative

01:28:52.590 --> 01:28:53.970
of the quadrupole moment.

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:58.510
I can compute the rate at which
power is leaving these systems.

01:28:58.510 --> 01:29:02.700
Now, a somewhat more complicated
variant of this calculation--

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:03.965
well, let me back up.

01:29:03.965 --> 01:29:05.340
So you go ahead,
and you do that.

01:29:05.340 --> 01:29:08.100
You compute this for two stars
that are orbiting each other.

01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:10.290
You will do this on
a future problem set.

01:29:10.290 --> 01:29:12.870
What you find is that
gravitational radiation carries

01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:15.150
energy and angular momentum
away from the system,

01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:17.580
and it causes them to fall
towards one another, which

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.770
causes their orbital
frequency to evolve

01:29:19.770 --> 01:29:22.380
in a very predictable fashion.

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:26.190
That law that arises to
very good approximation

01:29:26.190 --> 01:29:28.500
directly from this formula--
there are corrections

01:29:28.500 --> 01:29:30.292
that people have worked
out over the years,

01:29:30.292 --> 01:29:33.600
but what you get just doing
this quadrupole formula applied

01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:38.010
to two stars orbiting each other
describes this chirp signal

01:29:38.010 --> 01:29:41.530
that I have on my hat
to very good accuracy.

01:29:41.530 --> 01:29:45.360
And this is pretty much
exactly what the LIDO detectors

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:46.500
measure these days.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.350
They measure the
evolution of systems

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:52.740
that are evolving under
the aegis of this formula.

01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:53.280
All right.

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.260
So that is all we
are going to say

01:29:55.260 --> 01:30:00.300
about gravitational
radiation in 8.962 this term.

01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:02.040
As we figure out
the way things are

01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.470
going to proceed
moving forward, I

01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:06.720
will make myself
available to answer

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.200
some questions about this.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:10.140
I do want to emphasize
as I conclude

01:30:10.140 --> 01:30:13.270
this lecture that many of these
topics are fairly advanced.

01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:15.700
I don't expect you to
be familiar with them.

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.790
But I hope you understood
the punchline of this.

01:30:17.790 --> 01:30:19.560
And I expect you
to be able to apply

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.900
some of these formulas
that arise at the end.

01:30:21.900 --> 01:30:25.400
And I will conclude
this lecture here.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.790
LORNA GIBSON: I wanted to
talk a little bit about cork

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.759
partly because cork is
kind of interesting.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.800
Cork has a structure that's
a little bit like one

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.290
of those honeycomb things.

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.280
What I'm going to do is I'm
just going to talk and go

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.600
through the slides.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.630
I'm not going to write
the notes on the board.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.070
There's only a few
pages of notes,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.427
and it's in the Stellar site.

00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:46.010
I'm not going to write notes for
this because it's just really

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.140
for fun.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.900
This first slide starts off
with historical uses of cork.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.120
Cork was used by the Romans.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.850
They used it for the soles of
sandals, the same as we do.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.360
And they used it
for stopping bottles

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.985
of wine, the same as we do.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:02.360
But they didn't realize that
you could just use the cork.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.640
They would take the cork,
put it in the wine bottle,

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.380
and then they would
use pitch which

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.450
is a tarry stuff from a tree.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.370
They would use the pitch and
seal the bottle with the pitch.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.704
In the 1600s, there were
some Benedictine monks

00:01:15.704 --> 00:01:17.620
that realized that you
could just use the cork

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.040
and not use the pitch.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.460
They were the ones who really
perfected the use of corks

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.590
in wine bottles for sealing it.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.640
So what is cork?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.570
Cork is the bark
of a tree called

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.800
Quercus suber, the cork oak.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.950
Here's a piece of the cork bark.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.727
All trees have a
layer of cork in them.

00:01:35.727 --> 00:01:37.810
But the thing that's
different about Quercus suber

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.240
is that it's very
thick and the corks are

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.600
obtained from this thick layer.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.900
Quercus suber is a
Mediterranean type of tree.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.560
It grows, Portugal
is the main place

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.190
that exports cork, but also
places like Algeria, Spain.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.830
You can grow it in California.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.390
The cork is kind of
unusual because-- let

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.000
me scoot onto the next
slide-- it's kind of unusual.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.130
So here's a little picture.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.210
I went to Portugal when I
was a graduate student doing

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.850
this project.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:05.990
Here's the cork tree here.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.680
Here's the little
mini we rented.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.500
Here's the cork
being harvested here.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.650
Cork's unusual because you can
remove the bark from a cork oak

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.780
tree and it regrows.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.580
So most trees if you did
this, you would kill the tree.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.430
But cork doesn't get
killed by doing this.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.950
What happens is
they plant trees.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.530
You have to wait something like
10 or 15 years for the tree

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.460
to get big enough
to harvest the cork.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.810
And then the first
harvest is poor quality

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.820
and they don't use that.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.819
And then you have to wait
another 10 years or so

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.060
before you can actually
harvest the cork.

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.610
So you can imagine if a cork
orchard or forest gets chopped

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.320
down to build a skyscraper,
or apartment buildings,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.810
or something, it's not an
economically feasible thing

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.170
to plant cork trees these days.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.470
So when the trees
are cut down, they

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.910
don't tend to get
replanted at this point.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.200
And there's a number of
artificial substitutes

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.700
for corks.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.070
You've probably seen wine
bundles with foam plastic corks

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.600
in them too.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000
OK.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.660
The reason it's
called Quercus suber

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.220
is that the cell walls in this
particular type of cork oak

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.880
are covered with a waxy
substance called "suberine."

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.520
That's where the Quercus
suber-- "Quercus" is "oak."

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.790
Every oak is Quercus something.
"Quercus alba" is white oak.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.130
Quercus just means oak.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.410
If we look at the
structure of the cork,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:36.030
we can see that it's got
these different views

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.170
of the cork that are seen here.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.950
This is a drawing by
Robert Hooke in the 1600s

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.510
from his book Micrographia.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.240
He was the first person to
really draw cork like this.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:49.990
You can see he drew sort
of boxy cells on this side.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.020
And then, the other
perpendicular plane, the cells

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.570
have this structure here,
sort of more rounded.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.210
And here's a little sketch
he's got of the cork tree.

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.910
Over here are SEM pictures.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.870
These two planes here
correspond to this plane

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.120
in Hooke's drawing.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.270
This plane here corresponds
to this plane here.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.373
This over here is Hooke's
actual microscope.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.880
I think the Royal Society
still has that microscope

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.779
that Hooke used in the 1600s.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.250
Some of you know
that Hooke wrote

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.500
this book called Micrographia.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.790
He got one of the
first microscopes.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:27.540
He looked at a lot of
different materials,

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.350
and he drew these
beautiful drawings.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.640
He wrote a page or two
about each of the drawings.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.770
Harvard has a first
edition of Micrographia,

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.480
and I made a little video on it.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.110
So I thought I'd show you the
video because the drawings are

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.000
beautiful.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.160
But the url's on the slides, and
so you can watch it yourself.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.330
There's more on
this and on how he

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.410
came to be so good at
making scientific apparatus,

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.870
how he came to do the
Micrographia book.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.780
At the end of it,
there's a comparison

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.590
of a number of his
drawings with modern SEM

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:00.840
images of the same thing.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.230
He had this very famous
picture where he draws a flea.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.540
Don Galler, the person
who runs the SEM for me,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.070
I had him put a flea in.

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.302
And he has essentially
the same kind of image.

00:05:11.302 --> 00:05:12.760
The thing that's
spectacular is you

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.560
can see how much of the detail
that Hooke was able to capture

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.250
in his drawings.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.700
There's some really
beautiful drawings.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.220
OK.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.480
So let's go back to cork.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.550
Hooke was the first person to
use the word "cell" to describe

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.020
biological cells, and he
described the cell in cork.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.110
That's the structure looking
at the SEM micrographs

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.110
and his optical micrographs.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.110
These are just some
more higher resolution,

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.324
higher magnification, images.

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:40.740
One of the things
that you can see

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.331
is that the cork has these
little corrugations on the cell

00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:43.830
walls.

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.110
See those little wrinkles?

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.080
All the cell walls have
those little wrinkles.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.100
This plane here is the
perpendicular plane.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.400
If you look down
into the cells, you

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.200
can see those blurry things.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.850
Those are the corrugations
in the cell walls.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.610
That's the structure.

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.150
Here's a schematic.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:01.510
Here's the cork tree.

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.520
The cork is the layer
just beneath the bark.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.400
This is a picture of how
the cells are oriented

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.130
relative to their radial,
and tangential, and axial

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.400
directions.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.240
You can think of them
as roughly hexagonal.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.823
They've got these
little corrugations.

00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:18.860
This is a schematic
of an individual cell.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.779
We measured the
dimensions of the cells,

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.570
and these are some
average dimensions here.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:25.470
Typically, the cells are
tens of microns long,

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.330
and the cell wall is
about a micron thick.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.320
Something like that.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.321
OK?

00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.820
One of the things
we're going to see

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.260
is that corrugated
structure gives rise

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.970
to some of the interesting
properties of cork.

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.920
If we load cork and just
do mechanical tests on it--

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.792
this is just a uniaxial
stress-strain curve.

00:06:42.792 --> 00:06:44.500
You can see the
stress-strain curve looks

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.750
like all these other curves
we've seen for honeycombs.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.540
There's a linear
elastic part here.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.190
There's a stress plateau here.

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.480
And then there's a
densification part here.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:55.760
Typically, the relative
density of cork is around 0.15.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.040
Something like that.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.510
It densifies at a strain of
something less than 0.85.

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:05.200
It's a stress-strain curve.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.600
And when we did our
little project on cork,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.990
we measured the properties
in the three directions

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.670
because in one direction,
it's roughly hexagonal cells.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.780
That plane is isotropic.

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:20.270
The e1,e2 plane is isotropic.

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.570
This compares the
measured values

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.640
of the properties versus
what we calculated

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.380
from the honeycomb model.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.450
And really, we just used
the sorts of equations

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.533
that we talked about in
class over the last couple

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:33.182
of lectures, apart from
loading in the x3 direction

00:07:33.182 --> 00:07:34.640
because in the x3
direction, you've

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.972
got those corrugated walls.

00:07:35.972 --> 00:07:38.180
And you have to take those
corrugations into account.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.794
So there's another complication
that I'm not going to go into.

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:42.210
But there's a sort
of modification

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.780
you can do to account for that.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.238
But you can see there's actually
pretty good agreement here

00:07:46.238 --> 00:07:48.560
between the elastic
moduli that we measured

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.930
and what we calculated.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.880
The compressive strengths down
here are not quite so good.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.870
They're off by a factor
of two, more or less.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:01.090
But they're in the right
ballpark for the cork.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.370
So those are some
of the structures,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:04.584
some of the properties.

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:06.250
One of the interesting
things about cork

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:07.860
is what it's used for.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.980
The uses of cork really exploit
the mechanical properties.

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.070
Obviously, it's used for
stoppers for bottles.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.297
I brought a champagne
cork along with me,

00:08:16.297 --> 00:08:18.755
and I brought a couple of other
little pieces of cork here.

00:08:18.755 --> 00:08:20.960
I'll pass those
around in a minute.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.460
One of the things
to look at is just

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.600
the still wine cork, which
is the one on the right,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.550
and the champagne cork,
which is the one on the left.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.210
If you notice the
still wine cork

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:32.080
is just made of
one piece of cork

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.980
that's cored out from the bark.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.650
And if you notice
these little channels.

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.580
These little channels here
are called "lenticels."

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.809
On the still wine
cork, they go this way.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.140
And on the champagne
cork, they go that way.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.390
They're oriented perpendicular.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.720
It turns out that they are
normal to the isotropic plane

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:53.480
in the cork.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.130
If you look at the
champagne cork,

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:59.360
this plane here is
the isotropic plane.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.877
If you think of that
being put into a bottle,

00:09:01.877 --> 00:09:03.460
I think part of the
reason they orient

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.120
it this way is
because it gives you

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.150
a uniform compression against
the neck of the bottle

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.940
and gives a nice seal.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.932
So that's one of the
things about corks.

00:09:12.932 --> 00:09:14.390
Another thing that's
interesting is

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:20.500
that cork has a Poisson's ratio
equal to zero if you load it

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.930
in that direction.

00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:23.450
Let's see.

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:24.700
Did I not bring that picture?

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.116
Maybe I didn't
bring that picture.

00:09:26.116 --> 00:09:27.280
Hang on a sec.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:27.780
Nope.

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.488
I guess I didn't.

00:09:28.488 --> 00:09:29.030
Sorry.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.488
I thought I brought
a picture where

00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:34.811
I had the deformation of
the cells when you load it

00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:35.560
in that direction.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.100
When you load it--
so say the cells

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.224
are corrugated this way on.

00:09:38.224 --> 00:09:41.140
When you load it that way on,
it's like having a bellows

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.514
and folding up a bellows,
or unfolding a bellows.

00:09:43.514 --> 00:09:45.180
So when you load it
that way on, there's

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.460
no expansion or
contraction this way on.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.910
And so you get zero
Poisson's ratio.

00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:52.710
And if you think of trying to
get the cork into the bottle,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.254
it's rather convenient to
have zero Poisson's ratio

00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:56.920
because you don't get
as much expansion.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.461
As you're pushing
it into the bottle,

00:09:58.461 --> 00:10:01.040
you don't get as much
expansion that way out,

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.450
pressing against it.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:05.680
In fact, if you compare wine
corks with rubber stoppers,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.550
this is a kind of
typical rubber stopper.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.420
Wine corks are always
just cylinders.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.870
In fact, even the
champagne corks

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.350
are cylinders when
they start off.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:14.725
When they put it
into the bottle,

00:10:14.725 --> 00:10:16.030
it's just a straight cylinder.

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:17.790
It gets deformed
like that from being

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.650
in the bottle for some time.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:22.140
They have straight sides and
you can just squeeze them.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.580
There's these funnel
things that wine makers

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.140
have for putting the
cork in the bottle.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.100
You can just squeeze
them into the bottle top.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.640
You can do that because
the Poisson's ratio is zero

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:34.000
and because the Young's
modulus and the bulk modulus

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.140
are both small.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.640
But if you look at
a rubber stopper,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.070
rubber stoppers always have
these tapered sides to them.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:43.810
And that's because the Poisson's
ratio of the rubber is 0.5.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:46.912
As you squeeze it in, it's
trying to move out this way.

00:10:46.912 --> 00:10:48.620
You couldn't get the
stopper in unless it

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.180
had those tapered sides.

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.690
So that's sort of an
interesting thing about cork.

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:53.190
Let's see.

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:54.680
Another application
of cork is it's

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.050
used for gaskets for the
same sorts of reasons.

00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:59.630
It's relatively compliant.

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.120
It takes up any slack
between two pieces that you

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.840
want to press together.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.800
It's often used for
musical instruments

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.804
that come in pieces.

00:11:06.804 --> 00:11:08.220
Things like
clarinets, there'll be

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.481
a piece of cork-- you
a clarinet player?

00:11:10.481 --> 00:11:10.980
Yeah?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:11.880
Yeah.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.640
One of the interesting
things about the clarinet

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.431
is that, if you can
see here at the ends,

00:11:16.431 --> 00:11:17.680
there's a piece of cork there.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.638
And I think there's a
piece of cork down there.

00:11:19.638 --> 00:11:22.370
And the other pieces
mate up with that.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.570
The cork provides a seal.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:27.410
And the way the cork is
cut, it's cut in such a way

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:30.650
that those lenticels go
radially out like this, which

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:35.340
means that the plane of isotropy
and the direction that's

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:41.040
got the zero Poisson's ratio
is that radial direction.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.140
When you're squeezing, say,
the second part onto it,

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.142
the cork does not expand
circumferentially.

00:11:48.142 --> 00:11:49.600
So as you're
squeezing it this way,

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.770
it doesn't expand that way.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.620
It doesn't wrinkle or
anything on your other part.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.150
They use the cork in a
particular orientation

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.500
for that reason, I think.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.500
So it's used for gaskets

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.590
It's also used because it's
got a good friction property.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:07.650
It's got a property that is
taken advantage of in things

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.510
like flooring and shoes.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.190
Cork has a high friction
even if it gets wet.

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.410
Some sources of friction
are from adhesion,

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:16.770
from a surface effect.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:20.450
Then if, say, the floor gets
wet, then you break that,

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.520
and it could be slippery.

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.430
But the source of
friction in cork

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:27.690
is from an energy
loss and dissipation

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:29.050
as you're deforming it.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:31.160
Imagine you have a wheel here.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:33.820
The wheel is rotating
on this cork floor.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.600
And here, a piece of cork is
getting deformed as the wheel

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.240
rolls over it.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.747
As it gets deformed, there's
some histeresis loop.

00:12:41.747 --> 00:12:43.330
Cork has quite a lot
of damping in it.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.550
There's quite a lot of energy
lost in that histeresis loop.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:50.020
What that means is that's
characteristic of the cork

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:50.590
itself.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.390
It's not a surface effect.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:57.330
That means that if you use
it for floors or for shoes,

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:01.547
it doesn't lose that friction
and damping when it gets wet.

00:13:01.547 --> 00:13:04.130
Here's some measurements we did
of the coefficient of friction

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:07.310
for cork versus doing
it dry and doing it

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:10.330
with a liquid, soapy surface.

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:12.850
You can see the soap
doesn't make any difference.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:15.430
Cork is seen as a very
attractive material

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.244
for things like flooring.

00:13:17.244 --> 00:13:18.660
It's actually not
a cheap material

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.170
to make your floors out of,
but it's an attractive material

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:22.846
for flooring.

00:13:22.846 --> 00:13:24.470
Part of the reason
it's used for floors

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:26.761
and for the soles of shoes
is because of these friction

00:13:26.761 --> 00:13:27.980
properties.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.610
Another feature of
cork is that it's

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.850
got very small cells compared to
a lot of engineering polymers.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.080
The cells are on the
order of tens of microns,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.610
whereas many polymer
foams, the cells

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.480
are hundreds of
microns or millimeters.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.500
We'll get into this
later, but this plot here

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:45.030
is really saying that
the thermal conductivity

00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:49.350
of a cellular material depends,
in part, on the cell size.

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:51.760
The cell size for foam
plastics is in here.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.150
And that for cork is down here.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.860
Because it has a
smaller cell size,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.500
it has a lower
thermal conductivity.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.090
Cork was at one point
used to some extent

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.590
for thermal insulation.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.020
If you go to Portugal,
where cork comes from,

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.240
there's hermit caves.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.930
There were these old
hermit, religious people

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:10.720
who had holed up in a cave.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.840
And they would line
the caves with cork

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.950
to try to make it a little more
insulated, a little more warm.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.130
The other place you see this
is if you look at cigarettes,

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.920
you know cigarettes have that
little brown tip on the part

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.760
that touches your lips?

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.550
That's meant to look like cork.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.300
And if you look, it
has little dots on it.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.360
The little dots are
the little lenticels.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.220
Apparently, they used cork
originally in cigarettes

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.520
as a sort of thermal insulation
between the cigarette

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.940
and your mouth.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.177
So it was used for that too.

00:14:39.177 --> 00:14:40.260
And then, one final thing.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.150
Cork's also used, obviously,
for bulletin boards.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:46.330
If you push a pin
into cork, then you

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.350
get this local deformation here.

00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:49.170
Here's our pin.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:51.215
And here's cells
locally deformed.

00:14:51.215 --> 00:14:52.590
When you pull the
pin out, you'll

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.930
recover some of that deformation
because the deformation

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:55.590
is elastic.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.550
So the hole will partly close.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:59.070
So that's my little
spiel on cork.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.770
And that's just because
it's interesting.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.160
There's no test on cork
or anything like that.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.140
OK.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.410
So are we good with cork?

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.680
Any questions?

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.770
We're OK?

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:10.000
OK.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.470
Let me scoot out of there.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.640
Then the next part
of the course,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.125
I wanted to talk about foams.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:21.390
Let me just park the cork thing.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:22.760
Let me pass these corks around.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.290
So you can play with those too.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:26.590
Oops.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:28.660
There's little bits of cork.

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:29.619
There you go.

00:15:29.619 --> 00:15:32.160
There's the champagne cork, the
rubber cork, some little cork

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.660
layers.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.140
OK.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.820
So the next part of the course,
I wanted to talk about foams.

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:44.940
And I want to talk about how we
model the mechanical behavior

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.750
of foams.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.530
If we look at the
stress-strain curve for foams,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.270
these are some examples
for foams made out

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.340
of different materials with
different characteristics.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:57.130
The polyurethane
and the polyethylene

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:01.840
here are examples of
elastomeric foams, really.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.570
This one here is an
open-celled foam.

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:05.390
This one's a closed-cell foam.

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:10.830
Polymethacrylamide is a
polymer that has a yield point.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.370
Mullite is a ceramic.

00:16:12.370 --> 00:16:14.000
You can see the
shapes of these curves

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.230
resemble the shapes that
we saw for the honeycombs.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.730
Right?

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:18.700
They look exactly
the same, in fact.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.720
And the mechanisms of
deformation in the foams

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.100
are very similar
to the honeycombs.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.180
Even though the foams have a
much more complicated geometry,

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.650
we can use some of the
ideas from the honeycombs

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:31.230
to understand how
the foams behave.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:33.070
So that was part of
the reason for doing

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.440
the honeycomb analysis.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.770
Let me back up.

00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:39.820
These curves here were
all in compression.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.570
These curves here
were all in tension.

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.120
So again, these
ones in tension also

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.010
look like the curves
for the honeycombs.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.034
Remember, in tension, we don't
get any elastic buckling.

00:16:49.034 --> 00:16:50.700
So if the foam was
made of an elastomer,

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:53.210
we don't see any stress plateau.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.330
If the foam is made of
material with a yield stress,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.040
then we get a very
short yield plateau

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:00.910
because of a slight
geometrical difference

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.870
between pulling and
compressing the foam.

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:06.369
And if it's a brittle material,
then we just get fracturing.

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.452
There's going to be some
fracture toughness that's

00:17:08.452 --> 00:17:09.800
going to characterize it.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.660
We can look at the deformation
and the failure in these foams

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.990
and look at the mechanisms.

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:19.280
And what we're going to
do is model the mechanisms

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.730
and not worry too much
about the cell geometry.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.390
So we're going to use
dimensional arguments here.

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.060
Here's a foam in compression.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.460
It was compressed from
the top to the bottom.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.260
And you can see this strut
that's circled in red.

00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:33.134
This is unloaded.

00:17:33.134 --> 00:17:34.550
And then, this is
after some load.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.340
You can see this
has bent somewhat.

00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:38.440
And then, you can see
this vertical strut here.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.880
As the load gets larger, you
can see that strut's buckled.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.500
In an elastomeric foam, you
get bending and buckling

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.250
just the same as we
did in the honeycomb.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.640
Then here's a metal foam.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.690
You form plastic hinges
in the metal foam.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.050
So here's a cell wall here.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.250
And it's a little bent to
start with at zero load.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:18:00.620
But you can see it becomes more
bent in this image over here.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.240
And here's a cell wall
that's more or less vertical.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.520
And you can see
that wall buckles.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.220
It's a plastic
buckling in this case.

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.280
There's a permanent
deformation there.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.590
Here's a brittle foam.

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.530
And you can see cell walls
in this foam fracture.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.704
So this region here is
equivalent to this region here.

00:18:17.704 --> 00:18:20.120
That little glitch there is
the same as that little glitch

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.752
there.

00:18:20.752 --> 00:18:22.710
You can see there's a
couple of cell walls here

00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:23.520
that are fractured.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.890
So we get fracture.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.720
The idea is is
that the mechanisms

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.630
of deformation in
the foams parallel

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:31.050
those in the honeycombs.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:32.611
OK?

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:33.110
All right.

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:36.322
So let me write some of
this stuff on the board.

00:18:36.322 --> 00:18:37.780
We're going to
start off by talking

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.990
about open-celled foams,
so foams where there's

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.630
just solid in the edges,
but not in the faces

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.910
of the polyhedral cells.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:45.960
Then we'll talk about
close-cell foams

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.810
where there's solid
in the faces, as well.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.130
But the open-celled
ones are easier.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.171
So we'll start with that.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.980
In compression, we see
the same three regimes

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.480
as we did before
for the honeycombs.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.410
There's a linear elastic
regime that corresponds

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:26.110
to bending of the cell walls.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.937
There's a stress plateau.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.650
And for elastomeric foams,
that corresponds to buckling.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.390
For metal foams, that
corresponds to the formation

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.520
of plastic hinges.

00:19:53.590 --> 00:20:01.180
And then, for ceramic
or brittle foams,

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.490
that corresponds to
brittle crushing, so

00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:04.840
fracturing of the cell walls.

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.337
Then, if you load the
foam up to higher strains

00:20:14.337 --> 00:20:16.712
and higher stresses, eventually
you get to densification.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:28.050
And in tension, just
like the honeycombs,

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:30.650
for the elastomeric materials
there is no buckling.

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:45.531
We can get a stress
plateau from plastic hinges

00:20:45.531 --> 00:20:48.330
if there's, say, a metal foam.

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:56.420
And for a brittle foam, we
would get a fracture toughness

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:59.630
and brittle fracture in tension.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.040
So the idea is the mechanisms
of deformation and failure

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.849
just parallel what we've
seen in the honeycombs.

00:21:17.849 --> 00:21:20.015
So we'll start off with the
linear elastic behavior.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.178
And we'll start with
open-cell foams.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.350
The initial linear
elasticity is due to bending

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.140
of the cell walls.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.340
And if the thickness of the cell
edges relative to the length

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.450
is small, the bending
dominates the deformation.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.260
But as the thickness to
length ratio increases,

00:22:06.260 --> 00:22:09.020
then axial deformations
can become important too.

00:22:30.609 --> 00:22:32.650
What we're going to do is
we're going to consider

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:33.750
dimensional arguments.

00:22:41.987 --> 00:22:43.820
We're going to set the
dimensional arguments

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.460
up so that we replicate the
mechanisms of deformation

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:47.977
and failure.

00:22:47.977 --> 00:22:50.143
But we don't worry too much
about the cell geometry.

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.990
What I'm going to start with
is considering a cubic cell.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.700
And I've arranged the
cubic cell so that the cell

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.735
edges are staggered.

00:23:39.735 --> 00:23:41.235
That's going to
give me the bending.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:51.130
The edge length
is going to be L.

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.000
I'm going to say we have
a square cross-section,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:55.690
t squared.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:12.790
Here's our idealized model
here with a cubic cell.

00:24:12.790 --> 00:24:14.350
All the members
have a length, l.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:17.460
All of them have a square
cross-section, t squared.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.770
That's an open-cell model.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:22.040
We've got just solid on the
edges and nothing on the faces.

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:24.150
The idea is that if
I bend that, or if I

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:28.100
load that in compression, so I
apply, say, a stress out here

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.820
that puts forces
on those members

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.820
there, because I've
staggered these cell

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:35.650
walls with these
ones here, we're

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.700
going to get bending
in this cell edge here.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:41.680
That bending is going
to be what we model.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:19.170
I'm going to set this
up so that one thing is

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.350
proportional to something else.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:24.130
These relationships are going to
be true regardless of the cell

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:24.720
geometry.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.997
So I could have picked
a tetrakaidecahedra

00:25:26.997 --> 00:25:29.580
if I wanted to, and I would have
had these same relationships.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.663
I'm just picking a cubic
thing because it's easier

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:33.720
to think about.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.540
So first of all, we look
at the relative density.

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:41.290
Remember, the relative
density is the volume fraction

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:41.840
of solid.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.080
So it's the volume of the
solid over the total volume.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:55.410
And that's going to go as t
squared l over l cubed, or just

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:58.894
t over l all squared.

00:25:58.894 --> 00:26:01.060
You remember for the
honeycomb, the relative density

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.950
went linearly with t over l.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:06.069
For the open-celled foam,
it goes as t over l squared.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.680
The moment of
inertia in this case

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.790
is going to go as
t to the fourth.

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.850
Remember, we have a
square section, t squared.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:21.810
So if it's bh cubed
over 12, b is t, h is t.

00:26:21.810 --> 00:26:24.290
It's going as t to the fourth.

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.050
Then what I'm going
to say is the stress

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.780
is going to go as F over
an area length squared.

00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.830
OK?

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:33.820
So if I look at my
little square thing here,

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.480
I look at having my force here.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.920
Here we have a force f.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.420
And it's acting
over an area that's

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:40.310
somehow related to l squared.

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:41.779
Right?

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:43.570
I don't know exactly
what that constant is,

00:26:43.570 --> 00:26:45.840
and I'm going to not
try to calculate that.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.900
But it goes as F over l squared.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.240
Similarly, I can
write that the strain

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.680
is going to go as delta over l.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:56.180
So the strain is going to go
as this bending deflection

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.320
here, that delta divided
by the height of the cell.

00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:03.200
And that's also l.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.570
Then I also know from
structural mechanics

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:12.340
that delta is going to go as
Fl cubed over E of the solid

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:18.054
and I.

00:27:18.054 --> 00:27:20.220
Then I'm just going to put
all these things together

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.940
to get the modulus.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.100
The modulus of the
foam is going to go

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.300
as the stress over the strain.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:31.450
If I plug in what I have for the
stress, it's F over l squared.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:34.390
If I plug in what I have for
the strain, it's delta over l.

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:41.290
So this is F over l and delta.

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:46.822
I'm going to replace
delta by Fl cubed over Es.

00:27:46.822 --> 00:27:48.280
I'm going to use,
instead of I, I'm

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.160
going to use t to the fourth.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.744
Then the F's are
going to cancel out.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:00.950
I've got that the modulus
goes as the modulus

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:05.120
of the solid times t over
l to the fourth power.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.328
Then I can put that in terms
of the relative density.

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.960
It's going to go as the
relative density squared.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.660
So I can summarize
all of this by saying

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.880
that the Young's
modulus of the foam

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.320
is some constant C1,
I'm going to call it,

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.420
times the modulus
of the solid times

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.790
the relative density squared.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:37.390
OK.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.240
So this has the
same kind of form

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.530
as those equations we
had for the honeycombs.

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:42.480
Right?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.310
There's a solid-cell
wall property.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.270
The solid module's here.

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:48.570
For the honeycombs, I put
it in terms of t over l.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.670
But the t over l was related
to the relative density.

00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:53.910
How much solid you've
got is reflected

00:28:53.910 --> 00:28:56.830
in the relative density.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.710
And then, this
constant C1 wraps up

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.640
all the geometrical
constants that I've said,

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.234
one thing's
proportional to another,

00:29:03.234 --> 00:29:05.150
and something else is
proportional to another.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.090
C1 just wraps up all of those.

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.520
OK?

00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:10.560
I'm just going to
say here C1 includes

00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:11.930
all the geometrical constants.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:25.109
We have to get C1
by looking at data.

00:29:25.109 --> 00:29:26.900
If we look at data for
the Young's modulus,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:30.129
we find that C1 is just
about equal to one.

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:38.020
People have also done more
sophisticated analyses

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.621
than this.

00:29:38.621 --> 00:29:40.120
There's a group of
people who looked

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.190
at doing a full-scale,
structural analysis

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:45.980
of an open-celled
tetrakaidecahedral cell.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:47.690
Remember, I said they
pack to fill space.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:49.640
So you can look at a unit cell.

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:52.750
They also made their cells
such that the thickness

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:55.165
along the length of the
cell was not constant.

00:29:55.165 --> 00:29:57.290
The thickness varied as
something called a "plateau

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:58.340
border."

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.210
If you have a foam that's
made by surface tension,

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:03.610
the edges will tend to
have these plateau borders.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:06.000
And the thickness will vary
along the length of the edge.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.270
So when they did all this
whole, complicated thing,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.580
they could calculate
a value for C1.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.140
They calculated 0.98.

00:30:12.140 --> 00:30:15.746
So it's very close to 1.

00:30:15.746 --> 00:30:30.870
I'll say analysis of
open-cell tetrakaidecahedron

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:46.980
cells with these plateau
borders give C1 equal to 0.98.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:47.480
OK.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.730
So that's the Young's modulus.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.021
We can also look at
the shear modulus.

00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:58.020
The shear modulus is also
going to be controlled

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.950
by bending of the cell walls.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.210
And so the shear
modulus is just going

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.340
to be some other
constant times Es

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.380
times the relative
density squared, so

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.270
a similar kind of relationship.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.930
It's just a different constant.

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:17.380
And if the foam's isotropic,
and if the Poisson's ratio

00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:25.151
is a third, then
C2 is equal to 3/8.

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:35.290
Remember, if we have isotropy,
then the shear modulus

00:31:35.290 --> 00:31:40.270
is equal to E over 2 1 plus nu.

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.530
And so you can get the C2 from
that if you say nu is a third.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.420
Then we can also get
Poisson's ratio for the foam.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.950
If the foam is isotropic, so
we'll say for an isotropic foam

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:11.530
here, nu is equal to
E over 2G minus 1.

00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.920
That's just rearranging
this expression here.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.620
And because E and G both
depend on the relative density

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.600
squared, they both
depend on Es squared,

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.590
that's all going to cancel out.

00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:26.970
So this is going to be equal
to C1 over 2 C2 minus 1.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.760
So that's going to
equal to a constant.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.980
That constant's going to
be independent of whatever

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:36.385
material the foam is made
from and the relative density.

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:55.490
The constant just depends
on the cell geometry.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.500
Remember, in honeycombs
we found the same thing.

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:11.900
The Poisson's ratio
for the honeycombs

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.472
only depended on
the cell geometry.

00:33:13.472 --> 00:33:15.180
It didn't depend on
the solid properties.

00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.180
It didn't depend on
the relative density.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:20.357
So this is an exactly parallel
thing here for the foams.

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.662
Yeah?

00:33:33.662 --> 00:33:36.000
AUDIENCE: I have a
silly kind of question.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.640
What is the difference between
foam and the honeycombs?

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.780
LORNA GIBSON: Oh.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.240
The honeycombs have
cells in a plane,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:46.720
and they're prismatic
in the third direction.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:50.510
And the foams have
polyhedral cells.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:53.140
You know what a
tetrakaidecahedron, a 3D,

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:54.730
polyhedral cell.

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:56.500
OK?

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.320
The honeycombs are prismatic.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.150
And the foams have
polyhedral cells.

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:02.110
OK?

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.740
Are we good?

00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:31.330
OK.

00:34:39.178 --> 00:34:40.969
So there's a couple
more interesting things

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.340
about Poisson's ratio.

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:43.810
The same way we
can make honeycombs

00:34:43.810 --> 00:34:45.429
with negative
Poisson's ratios, we

00:34:45.429 --> 00:34:47.689
can also make foams with
negative Poisson's ratios.

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.780
They do it the same way as
for the honeycombs, really.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:12.700
The honeycombs had
negative Poisson's ratios

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.730
if the cell walls looked like
this, this sort of arrangement.

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.520
So that sort of a thing.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.960
We said that theta was
negative for the honeycombs.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.360
And if you invert the
cell walls on a foam,

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.820
you also get negative
Poisson's ratios.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.316
And the way they do that is
they take a thermoplastic foam,

00:35:38.316 --> 00:35:39.940
and then, they load
it hydrostatically.

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.010
So they compress it in
all three directions.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.091
And they smush the
cells in on each other.

00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:45.840
And then, they heat
it up to a temperature

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.580
above the glass
transition temperature

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:49.234
while it's still smushed.

00:35:49.234 --> 00:35:50.400
And then, they cool it down.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.088
So they end up with that
structure frozen in.

00:35:54.088 --> 00:35:56.463
And if they do that, they get
a negative Poisson's ratio.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.600
I'll just say they
invert the cell angles

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.845
analogous to the honeycomb.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:36.760
They load the foam
hydrostatically

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:42.370
and heat to a
temperature above Tg.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:43.880
And then, they cool
and release it.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:14.150
I have a photograph here of a
foam with a negative Poisson's

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.690
ratio.

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:18.040
You can see how the cells
have been smushed in.

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.720
It's the equivalent of the way
it's done for the honeycomb.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.350
OK?

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.191
Are we good?

00:37:24.191 --> 00:37:24.690
OK.

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.740
That's the linear elastic
moduli for open-celled foams.

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.830
The next thing I wanted to
do was closed-cell foams.

00:37:44.830 --> 00:37:47.240
If we look at a
closed-cell foam,

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:51.820
we can idealize it in
this kind of a way here.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.690
I've set it up so that
the edge thickness is

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.590
different from the
face thickness.

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:58.600
That's really representing the
fact that in foams, many foams

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.570
are made using a
liquid, and the foaming

00:38:02.570 --> 00:38:04.680
is controlled by
surface tension.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.880
Often, the surface tension
draws material into the edges

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.930
and away from the faces.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:12.600
So the faces tend to be
thinner than the edges.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.720
When we have deformation
of the closed-cell foam,

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.650
we've got bending of
the edges the same

00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:20.410
as we did for the
open-celled foam.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:22.140
But the faces can stretch.

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.120
So they can have an
axial stretching.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:28.300
You can think of that as a
cell membrane stretching here.

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:31.960
So imagine if I either pull
on the foam or I compress it,

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.540
there's going to be some
axial load in the faces.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.760
So when we analyze
them, we have to account

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.770
for both bending of the
edges and axial deformation

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:42.980
in the faces.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:53.618
I'll just say we have edge
bending as in open-cell foams.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.757
And we also get a
face stretching.

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.080
Another thing that can happen
in the closed-cell foams

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:12.194
is we can get
compression of the gas.

00:39:12.194 --> 00:39:14.360
In an open-cell foam, the
gas can move from one cell

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:14.990
to the next.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:17.460
But in a closed-cell
foam, the gas is trapped.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:20.590
And as the volume
of the cell changes,

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.723
the gas gets compressed.

00:39:26.610 --> 00:39:28.030
So we have another effect here.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:40.530
So we'll say for polymer
foams, surface tension

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:43.113
tends to draw material to
the edges during processing.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.160
We define two thicknesses,
one for the edge

00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.960
and one for the face.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.275
And then we apply a force
to this cubic structure.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.000
And we can do an analysis
a little bit like what

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.450
we did for the open-cell foam.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.697
Let me rub all this off.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:09.360
OK.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.735
I'm going to set
this up a little

00:41:10.735 --> 00:41:13.490
bit differently than for
the open-celled foam.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:15.200
We're going to do
a work argument.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.460
We're going to look at
the external work done

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.370
by the force F going through
a deformation, delta.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.750
And that's going to have to
equal the internal work done

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:25.530
by the edges bending and
by the faces stretching.

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:27.950
So let me set that up.

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:35.410
We're going to say the
external work done,

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.355
that's going to be
proportional to F times delta.

00:41:38.355 --> 00:41:43.810
So delta is how much the whole
thing is going to deform.

00:41:43.810 --> 00:41:47.795
Then, I've got internal work
from bending of the edges.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.440
That internal work is going
to be proportional to F

00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.537
over delta times delta squared.

00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:07.120
I'm going to end up
with an expression

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.620
where everything's
in delta squared.

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.010
So I want to keep the delta
squared there for now.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.520
And F over delta
is the stiffness.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:18.700
That's going to go as E of the
solid times I over l cubed.

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:24.340
I is going to go
is Te to the fourth

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.330
here because it's
I of the edges.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.110
I've also got internal work
from stretching of the faces.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.336
That internal work
is going to be-- I'm

00:42:44.336 --> 00:42:46.085
going to run into my
other equations here.

00:42:46.085 --> 00:42:48.230
Let me put it down a little.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.060
That's going to go as
the stress on the face

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.940
times the strain in the face
times the volume of the face.

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:59.970
Or I could write that,
instead of stress of the face,

00:42:59.970 --> 00:43:02.080
I can put it in
terms of Hooke's law

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:04.740
and say it's E of
the solid times

00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.750
the strain in the face squared
times the volume of the face.

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.750
And I can replace the strain
in the face by delta over l.

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:20.120
So it's delta over l squared.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.120
And then, the volume
of the face is

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:25.800
going to be t of the
face times l squared.

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:35.910
Then I want to balance
the internal work

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:37.880
and the external work.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:41.540
I can say F times
delta is going to equal

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.980
some constant I'm going
to call "alpha" times

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.090
E of the solid times t of
the edge to the fourth,

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:54.780
that's this guy up
here, over l cubed

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:58.140
times delta squared plus
some other constant I'm

00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:05.110
going to call "beta" times E
of the solid times delta over l

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.437
squared tf l squared.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.190
So far, I've got this in terms
of the force I'm applying.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:19.250
But I want to get a modulus
of the foam out of this.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:23.070
I want to relate this force
here to the modulus of the foam.

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:25.600
I can say the
modulus of the foam

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.440
is going to be related to
F over l squared, that's

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.240
the stress, divided by
the strain, delta over l.

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:41.590
I can write the force is
proportional to the modulus

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:47.060
times the deflection, delta,
and times the member length, l.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:50.120
And then, I'm going to plug
that guy into this expression

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.140
up here.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.339
And I'm going to get a
delta squared on the left.

00:44:53.339 --> 00:44:55.130
And I'm going to get
delta squareds in each

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:56.160
of the right-hand terms.

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.909
And so I'm going to
cancel out the deltas.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.980
If I put all that
together, I have

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:10.090
the modulus in the foam
times delta squared times l.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:12.090
There's a delta here, and
there's a delta there.

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:13.256
That gives me delta squared.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.630
And that's going to
equal alpha Es Te

00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:29.350
to the fourth over l cubed
times delta squared plus beta

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:36.480
times Es times delta
squared tf, if I cancel out

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.424
one of those l squareds.

00:45:38.424 --> 00:45:39.840
So here I can get
rid of the delta

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.090
squareds in all these terms.

00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.200
And if I just divide
by l, I'm going

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.150
to have the modulus of the foam.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:59.400
I get a term here that it goes
as alpha E of the solid times

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:05.030
t of the edge over l to the
fourth power plus beta times

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:10.330
E of the solid times tf over l.

00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:17.300
Are we good?

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.451
OK.

00:46:18.451 --> 00:46:20.450
And what I'd like to do
is instead of putting it

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:22.690
in terms of te and tf, I'd
like to put it in terms

00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:25.240
of the relative density.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.752
I'm going to look at two limits.

00:46:29.550 --> 00:46:32.010
I'm going to say if we just
had open cells, if there were

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:34.920
no faces on the membranes,
if we just had open cells,

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:41.690
and we had a uniform t,
then the relative density

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.580
would go as t over l squared.

00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:55.480
If I just had closed cells,
and I had a uniform t,

00:46:55.480 --> 00:47:02.660
then the relative density just
goes linearly with t over l.

00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:07.130
The relative density is the
volume fraction of solids.

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.840
It's the volume of the
solid over the total volume.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.250
For a closed-cell
foam with a uniform t,

00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:16.390
the volume of the solid is
going to be t times l squared.

00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:18.400
And then, the volume
total is l cubed.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:21.850
So it's t over l.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:23.940
Now, I'm going to
define one more thing.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.350
If I say that phi is
equal to the volume

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:45.080
fraction of the solid in the
edges, then I can say te over l

00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:48.950
is some constant times
phi to the 1/2 times

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:50.310
the relative density to the 1/2.

00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:59.410
And I can say tf over l is
equal to some other constant,

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:03.880
c prime, I'll call it, times
1 minus phi, that's how much

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.490
is in the faces, times
the relative density.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.050
Then I could
combine all of this.

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:14.880
Can I put it in here?

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.420
Maybe I'll just
stick it down here.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:20.640
Hang on.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.140
OK.

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:24.440
Put it up here.

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.850
This is my final
expression here.

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:52.130
And this term here arises
from the edge bending.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.000
This term here arises
from the face stretching.

00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:09.610
So I think I should wait
a bit for you to catch up.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:15.630
The idea is the
edges are bending.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.240
The faces are stretching.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.080
We're looking at the
work done by deforming

00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:22.340
the edges and the
faces and equating that

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:25.264
to the work done by the
externally applied load, f.

00:49:35.462 --> 00:49:35.962
OK?

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.100
That gives us two
terms, one that

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:49.337
accounts for the edge
bending, and one that accounts

00:49:49.337 --> 00:49:50.336
for the face stretching.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.300
To be comprehensive, we
want to take into account

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:58.600
the compression of
the gas, as well.

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.864
So there's one more term
I'm going to add on to that.

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:02.090
Typically the gas effect
is only significant

00:51:02.090 --> 00:51:03.670
for elastomeric foams.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.004
If you had a metal foam
or a ceramic foam that

00:51:06.004 --> 00:51:08.170
was closed-cell, it wouldn't
really contribute much.

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.512
But just to be complete,
we'll go through this.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.230
The idea here is
we say we've got

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:43.460
a cubic element of the foam.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.020
Initially, it has a volume, v0.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:50.780
If we apply a stress,
a uniaxial stress,

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.110
there's some change in
the volume of the foam.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:56.590
So there's some volume,
v, after we compress it

00:51:56.590 --> 00:51:59.940
by some strain, epsilon.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.960
If we can figure out
what the volume is

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:03.720
relative to the
initial volume, we

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:07.230
can figure out how the
change of the amount of gas

00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:10.320
goes from the initial state
to the compressed state.

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:11.850
Then we can use Boyle's law.

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:15.330
The idea is P1V1 equals to P2V2.

00:52:15.330 --> 00:52:17.700
Then we can figure out,
using Boyle's law, what

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:18.630
the pressure must be.

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:20.005
And then, that
pressure is what's

00:52:20.005 --> 00:52:23.040
contributing to the modulus.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.750
When I do this, I'm going to
write down some equations that

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:27.509
just have the main results.

00:52:27.509 --> 00:52:29.050
There's a whole
bunch of algebra just

00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:30.310
to get from one to the other.

00:52:30.310 --> 00:52:32.426
And I'm not going to
write them all down.

00:52:32.426 --> 00:52:33.800
When I write the
equations, don't

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.320
panic if it's not obvious how
you get from one to the other.

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.150
In the notes that I'm
going to put online,

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:42.520
there's all the details of how
you get from one to the other.

00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:49.818
The idea is that we start
with a cubic element of foam.

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:01.410
Initially, before it's
loaded, it has a volume V0.

00:53:01.410 --> 00:53:03.600
Then we apply a uniaxial stress.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.847
And we say the axial strain in
the direction of the stress,

00:53:14.847 --> 00:53:15.930
I'm going to call epsilon.

00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:31.935
Just from the geometry, you can
calculate the deformed volume.

00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.400
So after you load
it, the volume is V.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.340
And that volume on loading, V,
divided by the initial volume,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.484
V0, you can show.

00:53:46.484 --> 00:53:47.650
It's fairly straightforward.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:51.610
It's 1 minus epsilon
times 1 minus 2 times

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:53.920
the Poisson's ratio of the foam.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.490
Here, I'm taking compressive
strain as positive.

00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:09.490
And if you do this
whole volume thing,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:13.030
you'll get terms in epsilon
squared and epsilon cubed.

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:14.720
But because if it's
linear elastic,

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.140
epsilon is going to be small.

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:18.050
I'm going to ignore
the epsilon squared

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:19.663
and the epsilon cubed terms.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:27.180
That's the total
volume of the foam

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.700
after and before
the compression.

00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:32.766
And then, what I want is
the volume of the gas.

00:54:32.766 --> 00:54:34.140
And the volume of
the gas is just

00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:37.580
going to be the volume minus
the volume of the solid.

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.420
And I can get that by
just subtracting off

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:41.240
the relative density.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.010
So Vg over Vg0.

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:47.740
Again, Vg0 is the volume
of the gas initially.

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:51.360
Vg is the volume of the gas
when I'm compressing it.

00:54:59.502 --> 00:55:01.710
Remember, the relative
density is the volume fraction

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:02.310
of solids.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:04.748
So I'm essentially subtracting
out the amount of solid

00:55:04.748 --> 00:55:05.789
to get the amount of gas.

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:36.190
Then we can use Boyle's law.

00:55:49.090 --> 00:55:50.610
Here, p is going
to be the pressure

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.540
after the strain and p0 is going
to be the initial pressure.

00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:15.132
The building seems rather making
unhappy noises for some reason.

00:56:15.132 --> 00:56:16.590
I'm not sure what
that's all about.

00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:25.230
There'll be some initial
pressure in the gas

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:28.160
even before the strain, or
before the stress is applied.

00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:29.270
That's p0.

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:32.140
So the pressure we need
to overcome is p minus p0.

00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:51.510
Again, I'm missing
out a bunch of steps.

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:55.890
But using that expression
and this expression

00:56:55.890 --> 00:56:57.600
and this expression,
you could find

00:56:57.600 --> 00:57:01.100
that p prime is
equal to p0 times

00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:09.210
epsilon times 1 minus 2 nu
divided by 1 minus epsilon 1

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:19.204
minus 2 nu minus the
relative density.

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:25.774
Then the contribution of
the gas to the modulus

00:57:25.774 --> 00:57:28.190
you can get by just taking the
derivative of that pressure

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:29.620
with respect to the strain.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.936
So remember, modulus
is stress over strain.

00:57:31.936 --> 00:57:33.060
It's the same kind of idea.

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:53.400
So I'm going to call it E
star g for the contribution

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.900
from the gas.

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:59.930
So that's going to
dp prime d epsilon.

00:57:59.930 --> 00:58:03.894
And that's going to equal
p0 times 1 minus 2 nu

00:58:03.894 --> 00:58:05.310
over 1 minus the
relative density.

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.490
OK?

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:17.510
As I said, I'll scan the
pages that have the details

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:18.480
and put it online.

00:58:57.170 --> 00:59:01.390
The final expression we get
combines all of these things.

00:59:01.390 --> 00:59:05.170
The modulus of the foam
relative to the solid

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:14.400
is phi squared rho over rho
s squared plus 1 minus phi,

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.230
that's the amount of
material in the faces,

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:20.776
times the relative density and
then plus this gas compression

00:59:20.776 --> 00:59:21.275
term.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:10.950
Like I said, for most foams, the
gas compression is negligible.

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:19.650
So if p0 is equal to the
atmospheric pressure,

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.630
so about 0.1 megapascal,
then the gas term's

01:00:22.630 --> 01:00:24.664
negligible, except
for elastomeric foams.

01:00:49.025 --> 01:00:50.530
So that's the Young's modulus.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:02.120
Then we can do a similar
thing for the shear modulus.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.010
And the thing to
notice in shear is

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.370
that when you shear something,
there's no volume change.

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:08.370
So if you shear it and
there's no volume change,

01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:09.680
there's no gas compression.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.513
There's no pressure
built up because there's

01:01:11.513 --> 01:01:12.717
no change in the volume.

01:01:12.717 --> 01:01:15.216
So for the shear modulus, you
just have the first two terms.

01:01:52.070 --> 01:01:54.540
And if the foam is isotropic
and you use a third,

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.380
then this constant here
is going to be 3/8.

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.880
And then, Poisson's
ratio is just

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.940
going to be a function of
the cell geometry, again.

01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.356
And roughly, we could say it's
going to be around a third.

01:02:44.674 --> 01:02:45.174
OK.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.475
Are we good?

01:03:12.475 --> 01:03:13.547
Let me wait a little bit.

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:29.639
So the idea is we're looking at
the deformation of the bending

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.680
in the cell edges, and
the stretching in the cell

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.060
faces, and the gas compression.

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:35.860
And we're accounting for
those different terms.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.120
The next thing is to compare
these model equations

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:39.910
with some data.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:42.277
And here's data for
Young's modulus.

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:44.360
Here, we're plotting the
relative Young's modulus,

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.992
so the modulus of the
foam divided by the solid

01:03:46.992 --> 01:03:48.200
against the relative density.

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:51.450
Again, these are log-log scales.

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:54.330
On this plot, everything
with open symbols

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.750
is an open-cell foam, and
everything with filled symbols

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.570
is a closed-cell foam.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:01.890
Here's our equation for the
open-celled foams, the simplest

01:04:01.890 --> 01:04:04.450
thing that goes with
density squared.

01:04:04.450 --> 01:04:06.400
And that's that
thick line there.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.380
And you can see these
are all open-cell foams.

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.320
There's some more up here.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:13.870
So that gives a reasonable
description of that data.

01:04:13.870 --> 01:04:16.370
And then, these are two
lines for closed-cell foams

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:18.590
for different values of
phi, so different values

01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:20.600
of the amount of
solid in the edges.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.950
And you can see all
the filled symbols

01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:24.380
are the closed-cell foams.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:27.160
And they're in between this
line here and this line here,

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.260
basically.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:30.350
So that gives a fairly
good description

01:04:30.350 --> 01:04:32.800
for the modulus of
the foams considering

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:35.437
how crude this model is.

01:04:35.437 --> 01:04:37.520
We're not trying to account
for the cell geometry.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.936
We're just modeling
the mechanisms

01:04:38.936 --> 01:04:40.850
of deformation and failure.

01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:44.910
And then, here's a similar
plot for the shear modulus.

01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:50.150
Here's for open-cells, 3/8 times
the relative density squared.

01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:52.820
These are open-celled
foams down here.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.560
These are closed-cell
foams up here.

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:00.220
If the amount of material
in the faces is small,

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:03.390
then you would
just get the shear

01:05:03.390 --> 01:05:06.060
modulus varying with the
relative density squared.

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:08.227
Then here's data
for Poisson's ratio.

01:05:08.227 --> 01:05:09.810
We don't really know
what the constant

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.184
is because we
don't know what all

01:05:11.184 --> 01:05:12.930
these geometrical
parameters are.

01:05:12.930 --> 01:05:14.444
But here's a value of a third.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.360
And you can see there's
a lot of scatter here.

01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:18.420
This is like less than 0.2.

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:20.900
This is more than 0.5.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.550
And the scatter really
represents differences

01:05:23.550 --> 01:05:24.790
in the cell geometry.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.840
If the foams were,
say, anisotropic,

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.970
and the cells were
stretched in one direction,

01:05:29.970 --> 01:05:33.070
then you would get different
values of the Poisson's ratios.

01:05:33.070 --> 01:05:36.230
So that's the
Poisson's ratios there.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:37.900
I'm thinking I'm
going to stop there

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.360
because that seems like
enough equations for today.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.270
And then, next time we'll
start doing the stress plateau

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:46.709
and we'll figure out the
elastic collapse stress

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.500
from buckling and a
plastic collapse stress

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:50.600
from yielding, and
so on, and so on.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.320
We'll finish doing the
modeling next time.

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.300
And we'll probably start doing
a little bit of other stuff

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.600
on foams next time.

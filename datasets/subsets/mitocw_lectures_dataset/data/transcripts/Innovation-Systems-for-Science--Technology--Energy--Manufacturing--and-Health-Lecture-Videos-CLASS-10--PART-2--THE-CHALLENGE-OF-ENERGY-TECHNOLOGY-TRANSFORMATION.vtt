00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.300
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All right,
we're going to do two in a row.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.470
And Kevin has got these.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.490
So first we're going to do
a snapshot on, gee, could

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.410
the Defense Department--

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.930
you remember those guys,
with that connected model.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.190
Could they play a role, here?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.790
Is there something
useful they can do, here?

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.130
And then the second
is on this new RPG--

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.710
fairly new-- ARPA-E
model that's come about.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.510
So this is Dorothy Robyn.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.215
She was the former
Deputy Undersecretary

00:00:47.215 --> 00:00:51.000
of Defense for something called
Facilities and Environment.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.390
And she worked for,
you know, Ash Carter.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.970
DOD had the largest--

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.660
it's the largest facilities
owner in the United States.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.460
507 installations and
bases, 300,000 buildings,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.280
2.2 billion square
feet of space.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.430
That's interesting.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.930
Right?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.760
Maybe they're a test bed.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.220
Right?

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.333
And, you know, they
do consume more oil

00:01:19.333 --> 00:01:21.000
than anybody else in
the United States--

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.990
1.7%.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.520
That's not a lot, but
still it's a lot of oil.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.130
And they spend a lot
on energy every year.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.120
So maybe they've got an
interest in some of this.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.540
So, sure enough,
DOD actually thinks

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.370
it's got an energy problem--

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.170
for some pretty good reasons.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.530
They understand that they
have a strategic problem

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.470
having to do with
worldwide energy supply.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:55.800
The United States is profoundly
dependent on its oil supply.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.640
And that is an
international market.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.730
We probably spend a third
to a half of our defense

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.190
budget on protecting
what the military calls

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.070
their "lines of
communication" around oil--

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.530
i.e., their oil-supply system.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.690
So, cleverly, the
oil industry has

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.460
managed to get the American
taxpayers to foot at least $250

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.070
billion a year, protecting
their supply system.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.670
That's pretty clever-- a signal
of a politically powerful

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.790
legacy system.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.180
So there is a deep strategic
problem around oil supply.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.040
And then there's a profound
tactical set of problems that--

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.680
you know, they've been
engaged in two Middle Eastern

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:51.840
wars in the past decade, largely
around related to oil supply.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.070
And their own
internal energy supply

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.220
lines created most
of their casualties.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.720
Right?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
That's why we lose people, in
these painful supply convoys.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.640
It forces the army in particular
into a terrible tactical

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.300
position of having to
defend these fixed points

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.090
and concentrate forces to
defend these fixed points,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.830
in an asymmetric war where
you don't want to have fixed

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.330
points.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.390
You want to be part of
communities and populations.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.880
So essentially the
oil-supply problem

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.520
has completely
counterdicted everything

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.410
the army knows
about how it should

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.110
fight asymmetric conflicts.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.510
It's forced it into
offending long supply chains

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.990
to fixed points, which is
not a tactical position it

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:37.140
wants to be in.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.140
And it's, in turn, forced
many casualties, as a result.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.820
So the Army and the Marine Corps
wants to get out of this box.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.920
They want more mobile, flexible,
tactically free forces,

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.870
to be able to sustain
the kind of models

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.400
they've developed for optimizing
their warfaring capabilities.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.770
So they've got a strategic
problem, a tactical problem,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.890
and then they've got a
big facilities problem.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.700
DOD has lots of
aging, old facilities,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.300
on old, long-established
bases, often built

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.530
in the World War II time period
or the Cold War time period.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.120
They have been, for the last--
since the end of the Cold War--

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.620
under a significant
amount of cost pressure.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.400
How can they get their
facilities' cost down?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.700
So that's where
Dorothy Robyn, who

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.580
has the facilities
responsibility at DOD, where

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.520
she came in.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.000
Interestingly, DOD every
year gets $20 billion

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.170
in something called "milcon"--

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.310
military construction.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.460
That's for rehabbing,
repairing, upgrading,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.820
and undertaking new construction
for its facilities and bases.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.720
That's, like, a
guaranteed revenue stream.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.503
And you can do a lot
of interesting things

00:04:53.503 --> 00:04:55.170
with a pretty guaranteed
revenue stream.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.780
So one of the things that
the Defense Department was

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.690
attempting to do is really
take advantage of this revenue

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.080
stream to do significant
facilities upgrades,

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.400
in terms of energy uses.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.770
And so that was one of
her major projects, there.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.200
So DOD could be a very
interesting testbed

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:21.420
and a very interesting
initial market for a suite

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:22.630
of new energy technologies.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.130
Right?

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.410
So DOD Is not going to do carbon
capture and sequestration.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.910
Right?

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.070
That's not its problem.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.050
But it sure is interested
in getting off the grid.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.610
Right?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.280
It believes it has a
terrible cyber security

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.170
problem, by being on the grid.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.390
It wants off.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.360
It significantly wants to
reduce its energy costs.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.420
It's ready to experiment
with renewables,

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.920
partly because of
the grid strategy,

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.290
probably to establish
more mobility

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:55.280
and get off fossil
fuels line of supplies.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.800
It's got an incredible
number of vehicles,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.240
both for military purposes
and unmilitary purposes.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.220
That again is another
testbed opportunity.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.510
So the idea here, as
her testimony laid out,

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.760
to one of the
armed-services committees,

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:16.310
is that DOD actually
could be a partner

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.980
in an energy-technology
strategy,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:21.800
as a demonstration and
testbed kind of center

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.470
and an opportunity to introduce
certain kinds of new energy

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.030
technologies.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.200
Huge interest in
batteries, for example.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.690
So ARPA-E was a
gap-filling attempt.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.203
The Department of Energy
innovation system,

00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:42.620
it's kind of what it looked
like before ARPA-E came along.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.120
Right?

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.410
The red stuff is the new stuff.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.920
The black and white
slides or boxes

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.150
are what was there before.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:53.030
So, before the
new stuff arrived,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.230
the Department of Energy had
big, fundamental research

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.390
organization, very
basic research

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.880
in areas like particle
physics and chemistry.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.770
Famous Vannevar Bush
basic research entity--

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.280
the DOE Office of Science.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.770
The great bulk of the
energy laboratories

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.410
reported through the
DOE Office of Science.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.540
They took up about 60% of
DOE Office of Science budget.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.680
It was about $5 billion a year.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.560
The energy labs-- one
of the largest armies

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.640
PhDs in the world.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:23.352
Right?

00:07:23.352 --> 00:07:27.820
An incredible 12,000 army--

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.700
great majority, physicists.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.820
There may be some
engineers in there.

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.260
It was on the wrong problem.

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:35.830
Right?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.770
It was on the historical
nuclear-weapons problem.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.380
So, of the 14 energy labs, the
nuclear-weapons laboratories

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.720
had about 5,000 of
that army of PhDs.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:56.800
The NREL laboratory,
renewable-energy laboratory,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.630
had 340 of the PhDs.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.130
Right?

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:02.890
You can see what the
imbalance here is.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.457
It's not the right lineup.

00:08:04.457 --> 00:08:06.040
So it was kind of,
a lot of the talent

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.990
was on the wrong set
of issues-- or at least

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.370
not the new set of issues.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.670
There was an energy-efficiency
and renewable-energy entity,

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.230
had about a $2 billion budget.

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.320
There was some other
applied-energy offices.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.610
That was the landscape.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.420
And then a huge
nuclear security kind

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:30.442
of weapons-oriented part and a
big cleanup, nuclear-cleanup,

00:08:30.442 --> 00:08:31.400
part of the department.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.940
That was kind of the department.

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.159
Something that happened
under Sam Bodman and then

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.620
Steve Chu and then
Ernie Moniz is

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.669
that that whole picture of that
department got reorganized.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.910
One of those pieces was
ARPA-E. We'll come back

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.200
to this slide in a minute.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.550
ARPA-E was organized to
bring a DARPA-like model--

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.480
a breakthrough energy research--

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.290
into a structure
that didn't do that.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.140
Right?

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.510
The applied agencies
worked primarily

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:04.700
with established industry.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.250
There was nobody really working
on the breakthrough side.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.023
So, if you happened
to think that you

00:09:09.023 --> 00:09:10.940
need a lot of breakthrough
energy technologies

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.880
to solve the climate
problem, you probably

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.290
need something like this.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.650
So an interesting
process got put together,

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:21.968
to get that assembled.

00:09:21.968 --> 00:09:24.260
You know, Max, you asked a
very good question earlier--

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.950
how come it's only $300 million,
when DARPA's $3 billion?

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.450
Those of us who were involved
in advocating and supporting

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.590
the legislation, we wanted a
much larger budget, frankly,

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.740
a $1-billion kind of
budget for ARPA-E--

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.770
and have never politically
been able to get there.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:47.000
But, nonetheless, I would
argue that ARPA-E has actually

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.400
been a pretty remarkably
successful entity.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.890
So ARPA-E does all
this stuff that we've

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:56.450
talked about for DARPA.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.790
It's got that model down--

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.120
flat, nonhierarchical,
empowered program managers.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.450
They're called
"project directors."

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.220
Streamlined approval
process for both hiring

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.990
and for contracting.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:10.160
It's right-left.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.030
It's challenge-based.

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:14.810
It only wants to
do breakthroughs.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.720
It's not going to
do incremental work.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.210
It uses island/bridge.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.350
In fact, Arun Majumdar, who
was the first head of ARPA-E,

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:27.350
who's one of the most talented
science leaders I've ever

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.340
seen--

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.880
remarkably talented
guy-- he had been--

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.660
Steve Chu, the
energy secretary--

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:37.400
he'd been Steve Chu's deputy at
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.270
So, when Arun moved
to Washington,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:44.580
he lived in Steve Chu's
basement for six months.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.540
So there was no
island/bridge problem there.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.040
Right?

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.940
[LAUGH] You know, they
were only a floor away.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.020
There was extremely good
communication between the two.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.490
That's the best island/bridge
example I know of.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.350
[LAUGH] So I try to bring it up.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.830
But, interestingly,
ARPA-E, it didn't

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:09.410
have that connected energy
system for innovation.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.100
Right?

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.600
Because the Department of Energy
doesn't do any procurement.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.060
They don't buy batteries.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.370
They don't buy electric cars.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.410
You know, they don't
buy this stuff.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.260
So DOD buys their first
round of products.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.750
It can be an initial
market creator.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.880
That's one of the
advantages DARPA's got.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.640
How does ARPA-E
function, when it

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.280
doesn't have that follow-on
capability embedded

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.660
in the department,
which it's located?

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:37.370
So it's had to come up with a
whole bunch of new approaches

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.060
that have really been
quite interesting.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.350
And I list some of
them in this piece

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:46.340
that I did with a friend and
a DARPA expert, Dick VanAtta.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.200
They did a lot of
work on how to sharpen

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.960
their research-visioning
process.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:55.070
They definitely followed that
research-visioning model.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:59.210
It's not only, is this
a cool technology,

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.090
but is this a technology
that is not only

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.360
potentially a breakthrough,
but could it actually scale up?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.720
Is it plausible-- do we
have a plausible pathway,

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.330
by which this technology could
come into the marketplace?

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:14.360
And that's definitely part
of the research visioning

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:18.020
that ARPA-E undertakes, in a
way that DARPA doesn't really

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.740
have to because it's got
military customers often.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.560
It's done a remarkable job at
building a support community.

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.190
So ARPA-E, just
for one example, it

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:32.480
does what's now become probably
the most important US energy

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.640
technology summit every year.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.760
They get 2,000 to 3,000
people showing up at this.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.208
Every major energy firm,
every venture-capital firm,

00:12:40.208 --> 00:12:42.250
they're all there for,
like, a three-day session.

00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:45.050
They have great speakers--
and amazing technology.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.120
In other words, if you
do technology for ARPA-E,

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.860
it's going to get showcased.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.925
It's going to get presented
to this energy world.

00:12:55.925 --> 00:12:57.050
It's going to be shown off.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.240
They're going to help
you take that next step.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:03.050
And, interestingly,
in the first summit,

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.140
when they put out their first,
you know, offer of-- you know,

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:08.060
for proposals--

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.310
which didn't specify areas
they wanted to research in;

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:12.440
they just had an open proposal.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.970
Hi, energy community,
out there--

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.190
send us your best stuff--

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.560
they expected to get
about 400 proposals.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:20.700
Instead, they got 4,000.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.200
Right?

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.617
Because there was
so much interest

00:13:22.617 --> 00:13:25.880
in working with a
DARPA-like thing.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.815
So they were drowning.

00:13:26.815 --> 00:13:28.190
They had to invent
a whole review

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:30.843
process, to manage all that.

00:13:30.843 --> 00:13:32.510
But, interestingly--
and they could only

00:13:32.510 --> 00:13:36.540
approve a modest number.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.890
But they invited all
the best proposals--

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:44.660
a much larger number--

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:49.160
to show up to their
first summit and present.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.520
Which helped build a community.

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.420
You know, the
community felt, hey,

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.930
these guys are going
to look out for us.

00:13:56.930 --> 00:14:01.700
And it created a whole
community interest

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.640
in what this thing was going to
be that has been really quite

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.330
successful.

00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.460
So they've got a strong
support community

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:11.660
in the venture-capital
community.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.430
They've got strong
university support.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:14.900
They've got
established companies

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:17.450
that are working with DARPA--

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:21.680
supported research and firms.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.270
It's pretty interesting.

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:25.250
The most interesting
thing they've been doing

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:30.020
is on the
technology-implementation side.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:35.780
And here, they created their
own commercialization team.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:41.130
So there are these project
managers, and they--

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.660
you know, they're empowered,
DARPA-like project managers.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:47.990
But, on their team,
they pull in somebody

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.570
from ARPA-E's
commercialization group.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:53.390
And these are people
with, like, expertise

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:56.570
in getting venture capital and
commercializing technology.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:01.010
They know how larger firms do
technology commercialization.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:03.770
They even have somebody who's
expert at military contracting,

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.300
so you might sell
it to a DOD market.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:11.000
The commercialization
team has a member that's

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.200
part of the technology group.

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.000
Right?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.990
So commercialization is
thought through from the outset

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:20.100
of an ARPA-E technology project.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.600
Because, again, they don't have
this big procurement budget.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:25.580
They've got to find more
creative ways around it.

00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:30.680
And the greatest compliment so
far to ARPA-E and its success--

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.650
DARPA has now copied the model.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:36.830
So, like, the parent has
now copied the child.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:42.290
And DARPA, earlier this
year-- or last year--

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:45.590
hired ARPA-E's head of
their commercialization team

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.110
to set up a commercialization
team at DARPA.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.260
So, interesting.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:51.440
Right?

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.540
So those are some of the efforts
that ARPA-E has been making.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.700
And Kevin and I were
talking, earlier,

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:04.130
but ARPA:E did a very thorough,
tough-minded evaluation of all

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.920
of its research budgets and
then issued reports in August

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.230
and September.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:10.047
And it's a pretty
fascinating story.

00:16:10.047 --> 00:16:11.630
You know, as we know
from this class--

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:13.547
and Kevin and I were
just talking about this--

00:16:13.547 --> 00:16:15.890
technology standup
takes a long time.

00:16:15.890 --> 00:16:17.010
Right?

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.710
1947, we do the first
mainframe computer.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:26.150
You know, 1993, the internet and
desktop computing are scaling.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.520
That's a long time.

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.430
Right?

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:32.200
Fracking happened a lot faster
than most technology standups.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.790
That was a 15-year project.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:37.430
It's paradigm-compatible
with the legacy sector,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.720
so that helped, but that
was still a 15-year project.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.530
So seven years is much
too short a timetable

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.920
to be evaluating whether
these energy technologies are

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.300
going to scale.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:48.930
But, in terms of
technology advance,

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.590
and in terms of attracting
additional funding from

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:56.020
nongovernmental sources, ARPA-E
has had a very good track

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.140
record--

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.260
as evidenced in these
August and September reports

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.180
they've put out.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.570
All right.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:05.783
All yours, sir.

00:17:05.783 --> 00:17:07.200
MARTHA: Can I just
ask a question?

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.325
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Please.

00:17:08.325 --> 00:17:10.940
MARTHA: Didn't they announce
that basically the companies

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.359
had attracted about as much
outside funding as they had

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:15.785
spent since our ARPA-E began?

00:17:15.785 --> 00:17:16.785
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:19.220
And that was composed of two
sources-- other federal R&D,

00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:19.720
or--

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.660
MARTHA: OK, OK.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.770
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: --financial
support from allied companies

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:26.128
or from venture-capital firms.

00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:28.420
And we're going to talk about
the venture-capital model

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:28.950
in a bit.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:29.690
MARTHA: OK.

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.140
Sorry for interrupting.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.520
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: No, but
it was a good point to make.

00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.260
Thank you, Martha.

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:41.390
KEVIN: OK, so, going back to
the testimony by Dr. Robyn,

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:46.430
she stated that all
these critical facilities

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:50.240
that the DOD depends on
for running operations

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.720
across the board
are so vulnerable.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:58.280
Why did they let it
get to such a point

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.150
where, you know, someone
needs to tell them,

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.790
like, hey, you know, we should
innovate in this regard,

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:04.970
to prevent all that
from happening.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.010
And, taking those
lessons learned,

00:18:07.010 --> 00:18:09.470
how should the DOD
or any department

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.747
really prioritize any proposals
that come forward to it?

00:18:17.987 --> 00:18:19.820
PERSON: Do you mind
rephrasing the question?

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:20.320
KEVIN: Yeah.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.600
So she said these critical
systems are really vulnerable.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.760
Here's my proposal.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.370
In the future, or
in anyone's opinion,

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:34.450
how should any department
and particularly the DOD

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:41.110
prioritize its resources, based
on these proposals that they

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:45.940
get, in order to prevent such
vulnerabilities from occurring?

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:47.650
STEPH: I can't
imagine that this was

00:18:47.650 --> 00:18:50.825
published without some of those
vulnerabilities being patched.

00:18:53.097 --> 00:18:54.680
MARTHA: What do you
mean by "patched"?

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.263
STEPH: Like, it does not occur
to me that the government would

00:18:57.263 --> 00:18:59.340
allow-- or, you know,
the-- what is she--

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.025
the Deputy Undersecretary
of Defense--

00:19:01.025 --> 00:19:01.900
MARTHA: To publicly--

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:05.790
STEPH: --to publicly announce
that these vulnerabilities

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.540
exist within their system,
in their infrastructure,

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.210
without them first
being patched.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:11.710
Right?

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.545
And I know that a lot--

00:19:13.545 --> 00:19:15.420
could you talk a little
bit about that, Bill?

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:15.800
Because--

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, I mean, she's--

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:17.610
STEPH: --it says that
it's hold until released.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:17.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:20.340
She's testifying in front of
the Armed Services Committee,

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.620
and they want to
know what's going on.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.620
And a witness has
got an obligation

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:29.470
to come forward with what
the state of affairs is.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.510
You know I don't think these
were probably classified--

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:37.020
I know these weren't
classified issues, because this

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.960
was an open hearing.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.010
But she's got a responsibility,
as a governmental official,

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:46.260
to tell a congressional
committee what

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.140
in fact is going on and what the
issues and vulnerabilities are.

00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:52.530
So I think she's doing her job,
and the congressional committee

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:53.500
is doing its job.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.073
It's got to probe and find
out what the problems are.

00:19:56.073 --> 00:19:58.240
I'm not sure that's a great
answer to your question.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.573
STEPH: I guess-- does that not--

00:19:59.573 --> 00:20:01.287
I guess, to follow
up, would that not

00:20:01.287 --> 00:20:02.745
set us up for more
vulnerabilities,

00:20:02.745 --> 00:20:04.740
if we openly acknowledge
that that's something

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.450
that we're concerned about?

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.270
Just-- and would
it not be a problem

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:11.250
that we will find
ourselves more into,

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:12.960
if we admit to such
vulnerabilities

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.842
in a public setting?

00:20:14.842 --> 00:20:16.300
MARTHA: Maybe it's
already obvious,

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.610
if it's been in the
press, et cetera.

00:20:20.610 --> 00:20:21.730
People dying-- yeah.

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:26.640
STUDENT: And then what they
do is particularly surprising.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.140
STEPH: I don't
disagree, but I think

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:32.300
it's different to have a deputy
undersecretary admitting it--

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.300
is my point.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.970
KEVIN: I think, following
up on that, if, you know,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.910
it's not a surprise
to anyone, why

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:44.380
are other projects prioritized
over preventing this

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.110
from happening?

00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:49.238
If it's like, oh, well,
of course, they're

00:20:49.238 --> 00:20:51.280
vulnerable to cyber attacks,
and these facilities

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:53.930
are falling apart.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.550
You know, we were just talking
about, the dependence on oil

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.090
causing a lot of problems.

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.223
Why not innovate in that area?

00:21:02.223 --> 00:21:04.681
STUDENT: Well, I think part of
it goes back to the funding,

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:05.985
from that graph.

00:21:05.985 --> 00:21:09.780
You remember that graph, the
graph about funding and oil

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.050
prices that [INAUDIBLE]
follow the same trend?

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.010
So, like, if funding
isn't really steady,

00:21:15.010 --> 00:21:17.950
you can't really
innovate very well.

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:19.810
It's hard to
maintain facilities.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.580
KEVIN: But you said
they get a $20 billion--

00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:24.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: They do
have an annual $20-billion

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.802
military-construction
appropriation

00:21:27.802 --> 00:21:30.010
that's potentially an
interesting revenue stream that

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.755
you could finance off of.

00:21:31.755 --> 00:21:33.270
STUDENT: But that's just DOD.

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:35.630
Like, other departments, they
still have these problems.

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:37.650
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right, But
DOD is the monster in the room.

00:21:37.650 --> 00:21:39.692
They're the ones that
really have the facilities.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:44.670
STUDENT: Also, I wonder
about the distribution

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:49.290
of the quality, I guess, in
facilities or infrastructure.

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.350
So I can imagine, not all
these 300,000 buildings

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:54.800
are really falling
apart and in disrepair.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:57.810
But I think maybe
it's just, they

00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:01.010
don't like that there are
a number of buildings sort

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.270
of on this lighter end of--

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.070
kind of built in
World War II-esque,

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:06.870
and they haven't really been
upgraded from a construction

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:08.180
or systems point of view.

00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.625
And I would argue that,
like, the $20 billion

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:13.000
or however they're
getting yearly

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.800
to upgrade these services is
adequate or kind of serving

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:22.140
them well, such that those
are-- like, that's your patch.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:27.720
And it's not really an issue of
national security, in a sense,

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:31.147
because this is a distributed
problem, kind of over the DOD

00:22:31.147 --> 00:22:32.730
network, rather than,
like, all right,

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.780
all of our systems in Virginia
or in this particular area

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.110
are subject to cyber
attack and are vulnerable.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.360
It seems like-- like, it's
too big of a problem for it

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:46.782
to be actual information
for her, you know,

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.240
not to be able to
testify about it.

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.907
This isn't a
national-security interest,

00:22:49.907 --> 00:22:51.540
in that it has to be protected.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.080
STEPH: Yeah.

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.080
And, to your point about
the size of the budget,

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.440
I'm looking at the 2017 report
on infrastructure management,

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.190
from the Government
Accountability Office.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.670
And it says that they expect
the DOD estimated replacement

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.310
value to be $880 billion.

00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:07.260
So.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:07.760
That's a--

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.470
STUDENT: What do you mean
by "replacement value"?

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.220
STEPH: Well, that's
what they're-- for the

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.845
infrastructure, for the DOD,
that they need to improve

00:23:13.845 --> 00:23:14.345
[INAUDIBLE].

00:23:14.345 --> 00:23:15.732
STUDENT: That's a lot of money.

00:23:15.732 --> 00:23:17.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.830
So that was just--

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:20.277
I guess that was just
released for fiscal year 2017.

00:23:20.277 --> 00:23:20.860
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.350
I mean, I don't think
it's too much an issue

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:23.080
that they released this.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.880
There's this other thing
called Zero Days, which

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.380
is actually things
that you can hack

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:27.940
into infrastructure systems.

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:29.170
And that's more serious.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.690
What they do is, they will
report it to the agency.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:35.733
And, because they know
agencies will get lazy,

00:23:35.733 --> 00:23:37.900
if you say you're not going
to do anything they say,

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.522
I'll give you x amount of time
until I do report it publicly.

00:23:41.522 --> 00:23:43.480
And I think this was an
issue that they already

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.280
knew it was OK to say publicly.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.400
And so I'm not too
concerned with that.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.850
On the issue of actual,
oh, this is a problem,

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.050
I think it's just more
that it's a big government.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.230
There's a lot of problems.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.170
And there isn't really
going to be-- you know,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:23:59.680
nothing's going to be perfect.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.750
And so they're just trying
to bring light to it,

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.390
so they can put funds to it.

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:06.110
And things do
precipitate, especially

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.870
with organizations where--

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:08.950
I mean, this happens
with people all the time.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.090
Right?

00:24:09.090 --> 00:24:10.000
You really don't know
what you're going

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.110
to do, like, a day from now.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.640
Right?

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.432
Or a lot of things will
add up, and they'll

00:24:13.432 --> 00:24:16.250
get past saturation points.

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:18.140
And it's also just
a big legacy sector,

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.938
so there is going to be issues.

00:24:20.938 --> 00:24:22.480
AUDIENCE: Didn't
you ask the question

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.210
of how should they prioritize?

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:24.990
KEVIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.150
MARTHA: Yeah.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.665
KEVIN: [LAUGH] You know,
where should those $20 billion

00:24:28.665 --> 00:24:29.290
go, every year?

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.790
MARTHA: Mhm?

00:24:32.608 --> 00:24:34.900
WOMAN: I just think it's
hard, because, to most people,

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:37.720
$20 billion seems like it
could solve a lot of problems.

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.620
Like, that seems
like a lot of money.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:42.850
But, I guess, when you spread
it across all the facilities

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.725
that they have, to
make a real impact

00:24:45.725 --> 00:24:48.940
you really need to pick
specific things to focus on.

00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:52.180
And then, I think, a lot of
politics can come into, like,

00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:55.150
who's getting the money and
how they're allocating it,

00:24:55.150 --> 00:25:00.050
because there's not enough for
every base to get an upgrade.

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.350
And so I'm sure that's
an additional challenge.

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:07.670
STEPH: The report says
562,000 facilities worldwide,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.730
at 4,800 sites.

00:25:09.730 --> 00:25:12.785
So that's steep.

00:25:12.785 --> 00:25:13.660
STUDENT: $20 billion?

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.160
STEPH: Yeah.

00:25:17.998 --> 00:25:19.440
STUDENT: It's not
too much money.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Kevin,
how about a closing thought

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.705
on Dorothy Robyn's testimony?

00:25:25.705 --> 00:25:30.270
KEVIN: Well, I'm curious to see
how the proposal she laid out

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:34.260
has progressed since
it was made in 2012.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.735
I would hope that more
people bring attention

00:25:39.735 --> 00:25:41.110
to this-- like,
hey, you know, we

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:45.430
should innovate in these other
things that aren't just, like,

00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.870
weapons.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:50.990
Because the development
of other projects

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.667
depends on the development
of those, as well.

00:25:54.667 --> 00:25:55.750
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:59.470
And I think it's fair to say
that she and colleagues at DOD

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.400
actually made significant
progress in using

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.460
these facilities as, in effect,
test beds and demonstration

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.060
centers for new technologies.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.450
And, because this is
essentially cost-saving and

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:16.780
security-related issues,
there's good reason

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:20.020
to think that, under the new
administration, a lot of this

00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:23.020
will continue.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:24.575
Let me turn to the ARPA-E piece.

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.320
Questions for us, on that one?

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.500
KEVIN: So, you know,
since you said they just

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.860
released a report, analyzing
[INAUDIBLE] projects

00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.850
on the research and the
relative success of that,

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:45.910
and because we have evidence
files [INAUDIBLE] DARPA

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:49.570
has been, why don't
we really hear

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.150
about any other DARPA qualms?

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.400
You know, they mentioned that
the Department of Education was

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.815
considering ARPA-E, that the NIH
was considering their research

00:26:57.815 --> 00:27:00.093
models depending on--

00:27:00.093 --> 00:27:04.540
[LAUGH] that sort
of mimic DARPA.

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:07.090
Why aren't innovation
models like

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:12.170
the ones in DARPA and ARPA-E
being utilized in other fields?

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.410
STUDENT: It's possible that--

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:16.040
this is just an opinion, and I
have no facts to back it up--

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:16.540
but--

00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:17.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:21.230
--it's possible that maybe
some of the challenges that

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:25.100
are solved by DARPA and
ARPA-E, they don't necessarily

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:26.840
translate as well
to social problems,

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.820
like Department of Education.

00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.010
So with education, it's
less of a technical problem.

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:36.780
And maybe a lot of it's more,
how do we manage people,

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.910
how do we determine what's a
good versus a bad student, good

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.870
versus bad teacher, et cetera.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:47.350
So I'm not sure if
it would fit as well.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.932
Again, opinion.

00:27:48.932 --> 00:27:52.100
KEVIN: To add, I think
education in particular

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.240
would also be considered
a legacy sector.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.410
And to stand up, you know, a
DARPA-like model for education

00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:59.390
would be to completely
undermine the education

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:00.980
system in the United States.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.190
And that would require
the undertaking

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:08.810
of not only the education system
in terms of national standards

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.510
but also a reframing
fundamentally

00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:15.200
at the state level of the ways
in which we conduct education

00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.310
policy.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:20.510
And that, I think, from a
reframing the conversation

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:22.490
nationally, would be
an immensely difficult

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.060
undertaking.

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:24.230
It would be politically--

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.272
I mean, I don't know if
"politically unviable" is

00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:27.950
the right word,
but it seems to me

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.050
like it would be
politically insurmountable.

00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.290
Because you're now threatening,
you know, states' rights.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:34.790
PERSON: Why does it--

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:37.910
why is it an undermining of the
education system I mean, the--

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.500
STEPH: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.542
PERSON: --defense system.

00:28:40.542 --> 00:28:42.583
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let
me just give a little bit

00:28:42.583 --> 00:28:44.900
of background, because I was
involved in some of this.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:45.870
And it never happened.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:47.995
And Congress was never
interested in funding in it.

00:28:47.995 --> 00:28:50.780
And part of it was, you know,
what does the Department

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:52.640
of Education--
which is essentially

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.740
an entitlement-administration
organization--

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.860
what do they know about
technology policy in education?

00:28:58.860 --> 00:28:59.390
Right?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.790
But, with the development
of online capability

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.730
and computer-gaming
technologies,

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.430
a whole new raft of
technology options

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.140
has entered the education field.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:13.550
So there was a fair amount
of thinking that maybe there

00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:16.760
was room for a
technology-breakthrough entity

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:17.960
in the education space.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:21.470
The education space
is also notorious

00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:24.440
for conducting
almost no R&D. Right?

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.980
Almost zero.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:26.480
Right?

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.313
It's tragic.

00:29:27.313 --> 00:29:27.980
KEVIN: I would--

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.760
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
And how are you

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.152
going to transform a
sector without, you know,

00:29:31.152 --> 00:29:33.110
undertaking technology
development and research

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:34.250
and development on it?

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:37.310
So, agree, it's
threatening, right?

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.050
Online education
and blended learning

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.390
are threatening models
to establish systems--

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:44.210
no question about it.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:48.400
But this was actually, I
think, an interesting idea.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:52.330
The problem was, who's going
to find the right technology

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:54.760
crowd that would really create
the kind of breakthroughs

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.355
that a DARPA-like
entity could do?

00:29:56.355 --> 00:29:58.147
And I think that was
more of the challenge.

00:29:58.147 --> 00:29:59.980
KEVIN: And you're saying
it's making threats

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.060
to establish education models.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:05.340
Is that necessarily a bad
thing, wherein, you know,

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:06.923
we see the US rankings
are way below--

00:30:06.923 --> 00:30:09.548
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: No, I'm not
saying it's a bad thing at all.

00:30:09.548 --> 00:30:11.430
I think the whole system
needs to be changed.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.060
But I agree with you, Kevin.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.458
And this would be a tool
to try some of that with.

00:30:16.458 --> 00:30:18.250
STUDENT: And it's the
big disruption thing.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.980
It's like-- it's like Uber.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:23.700
So imagine, like, if you really
affect the teachers' jobs,

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.840
there's all these unions.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:25.350
Right?

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.257
So, like, now a kid
can go and, like,

00:30:27.257 --> 00:30:28.840
he doesn't-- he still
needs a teacher,

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.075
but now you've kind of made
them very uncomfortable.

00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:32.700
So you can get the
amount of push-back.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.830
So, when you create
this system, you

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.288
have to figure out
how you're going

00:30:35.288 --> 00:30:37.496
to make it so that the
teacher doesn't feel offended.

00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:39.621
I mean, Kahn Academy did
a really good job of this,

00:30:39.621 --> 00:30:41.910
of, like, OK, well, now you
can spend your time doing

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.010
what you do, in the classroom.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.635
But even then, how are you
going to get mass support?

00:30:46.635 --> 00:30:48.760
And I still don't know what
their numbers are like.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:49.980
STUDENT: Why is the
kid uncomfortable?

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.570
STUDENT: Not the
kid, the teacher.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.528
Because there's unions.

00:30:52.528 --> 00:30:54.965
So this is especially
important in, like, the--

00:30:54.965 --> 00:30:56.340
Steve Case, the
guy who made AOL.

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.080
He made a book called The Third
Wave, which is, like, you know,

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.910
the internet entrepreneurs
that will affect

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.840
physical structures and not
just web 2.0 that is on Facebook

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.090
and Snapchat, the people
that would create systems

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.910
that interact with
people like Uber,

00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:10.450
they don't just
make a technology.

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:14.250
They have to focus on the
legacy history of the people

00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.280
in that organization.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.230
So, when you make
an Uber, you have

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.522
to worry about the taxi-cab
drivers who paid $1 million

00:31:18.522 --> 00:31:19.350
for a medallion.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.267
And this is how they're
supporting themselves,

00:31:21.267 --> 00:31:23.320
and now you're
going to disrupt it.

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.403
And also, what's going to
happen to these drivers?

00:31:25.403 --> 00:31:27.600
What about union problems?

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.517
How do you ensure safety, as
there's been several concerns.

00:31:31.517 --> 00:31:32.350
So it's not a tech--

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:35.585
These aren't-- I think
for DARPA and ARPA-E,

00:31:35.585 --> 00:31:36.710
there's a technology issue.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.180
Let's do the technology.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.800
For these issues,
it's more of a,

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.510
this is very much a
people technology.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:43.010
Right?

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.460
Like-- And most politicians--

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.347
Michael Bloomberg, Bill
Gates, who's a billionaire,

00:31:48.347 --> 00:31:49.180
which you all know--

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.070
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: But,
Martín, there still have been--

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.220
look, I mean, how many
technological disruptions

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:57.750
of education have there been?

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:01.316
I mean, we came up with the
printing press in, what, 1562?

00:32:01.316 --> 00:32:02.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:02.820
Right?

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:03.850
That was a big one.

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:04.670
Right?

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:06.270
Books-- we figured out books.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.330
That's about it.

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:07.890
Right?

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.870
That's pretty much the change.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.110
So applying this whole new
information-technology online

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:18.460
world to the education system,
those are profound technology--

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.530
and, I agree, social
and learning challenges

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:23.387
go with those.

00:32:23.387 --> 00:32:25.470
And they are threatening
to establish communities.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:26.640
I agree completely.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.340
But I do think,
interestingly, certainly

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:31.740
for the first time
in my lifetime,

00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:35.760
I've seen an opportunity for
significant technology entry

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:39.310
into a classic legacy sector.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:43.146
And so the idea of putting a
DARPA-like thing around that,

00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:45.220
that was an interesting idea.

00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:45.720
Right?

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.145
It just hasn't happened.

00:32:48.145 --> 00:32:49.770
STUDENT: I think I'm
going to push back

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:50.480
on this a little bit--

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:50.780
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Please.

00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.530
STUDENT: --the idea
that education doesn't

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:54.930
have a DARPA-like model.

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:57.240
Like, the rise of
charter schools, I think,

00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.020
has really disrupted how
we think about the system

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:01.878
of public education.

00:33:01.878 --> 00:33:04.170
And you used to really just
have public versus private,

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:07.620
but now you have private
and, like, quasi public

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.040
charter schools that receive
federal and state funding

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.820
but, like, do state testing
but don't do some other things.

00:33:14.820 --> 00:33:16.710
And they have the
elements that you

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:18.877
think you get in a public
education, which is, like,

00:33:18.877 --> 00:33:22.092
the group environment, but
they focus their classes

00:33:22.092 --> 00:33:23.550
and they structure
them differently

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.630
and they do a whole
bunch of other stuff,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.005
because they don't
have to adhere

00:33:26.005 --> 00:33:28.920
to kind of all of
the regulations that

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.870
come from the state and
the federal government.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:35.160
And so I would say
that education has--

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.500
it's like a distributed--
it is a distributed system,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.260
because it gets, like,
more state by state

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:40.968
than, like, really
the Federal Department

00:33:40.968 --> 00:33:42.810
of Education-mandated things.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:46.140
But also, in charter schools
and things like this,

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.498
you have opportunities for
different models that are--

00:33:48.498 --> 00:33:50.040
like, people are
already testing out,

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.370
and you're already seeing
this disruption that Martín is

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.700
talking about, where you
have these entrenched

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.790
public-education systems, but
now you're having this rival

00:33:59.790 --> 00:34:03.240
charter school that now
comes in and kind of disrupts

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.823
teachers' unions and
things like that.

00:34:04.823 --> 00:34:06.990
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All
right, so I'm going to-- you

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.070
know, I'm going to halt
our education discussion.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:09.570
Right?

00:34:09.570 --> 00:34:10.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:13.440
Because we're going to have
a whole class, next week,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.310
on education.

00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:18.960
So we can pursue this at length.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.630
This is kind of a breath
of what's to come,

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:23.500
in next week's experiment.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.300
But, Kevin, why don't you
close out our ARPA-E discussion

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.840
with--

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.132
maybe summarize what you
thought some of the key points

00:34:30.132 --> 00:34:30.870
are about ARPA-E?

00:34:34.197 --> 00:34:35.280
KEVIN: It's still growing.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.520
I think-- well, it might not
be growing [LAUGH] anymore.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.060
But it's a good proof of concept
that the DARPA model and models

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:50.760
like it are good change
agents, when they're needed.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.560
Especially in a really
established legacy sector

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.489
like energy is.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.990
My personal opinion-- I'd like
to see these kind of models

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.272
applied elsewhere.

00:35:01.272 --> 00:35:03.480
You know, I was reading,
here, that Homeland Security

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.000
intelligence and others were
planning their own ARPA models.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.635
And, even on smaller scales, I
feel like this innovation model

00:35:10.635 --> 00:35:13.303
could be really beneficial.

00:35:13.303 --> 00:35:14.345
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Good.

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:14.660
OK.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.080
STUDENT: I have
one more question,

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:16.700
because we were talking about
innovation organizations.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:17.990
I was wondering if
there was an innovation

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:20.110
organization for
manufacturing, because that's

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:21.952
a focus of yours.

00:35:21.952 --> 00:35:24.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: There are
these brand-new manufacturing

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.130
institutes.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.880
And there's 14 of these.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.130
And they are organized around
major technology challenges

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.525
in the manufacturing space.

00:35:32.525 --> 00:35:33.650
STUDENT: Could you specify?

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.710
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So, 3D printing.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:38.780
You know, what technology
advances are we going to get

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:40.250
out of that, whether it's--

00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:43.847
there's an institute
around tissue engineering

00:35:43.847 --> 00:35:44.930
and regenerative medicine.

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:46.710
There's an institute
around photonics.

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.610
There's an institute
around power electronics

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.070
and wideband-gap semiconductors.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:54.690
There's an institute
around advanced composites.

00:35:54.690 --> 00:35:57.680
So, in 14 different
interesting technology areas

00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:02.480
that could be quite powerful,
across a range of manufacturing

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.910
sectors, we are attempting
an innovation model.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:06.830
It's a public-private
collaboration.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.900
STUDENT: So they try to do best
practices in standardization?

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.442
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, no, they're

00:36:10.442 --> 00:36:12.210
attempting to do
technology development.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:13.490
So, TRA level--

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:19.100
TRL levels 4 through 7, kind of,
mid- to later-stage technology

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:22.215
development efforts, tying
that to the communities that

00:36:22.215 --> 00:36:24.090
would have to be involved
if these models are

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.820
going to get picked up.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.100
So it's an interesting-- it's
the first attempt, really,

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:33.560
in the US, other than SEMATECH,
to bring an innovation model

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:35.000
to the manufacturing sector.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.980
STUDENT: Do these
manufacturing institutes

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:39.290
follow one general
innovation model?

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.270
Or does each one
cater to whatever--

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.610
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Each one is--

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:46.100
they share a lot
of similarities.

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.060
They're all cost-share.

00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.710
They involve small
and large firms.

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:51.230
They involve university
with strong technology

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:52.670
and engineering programs.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.077
They involve community colleges.

00:36:54.077 --> 00:36:55.660
They have
workforce-development model.

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.690
So they share those pieces.

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.570
But then the particular
technology area

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.408
they're pursuing means
they're going to be

00:37:01.408 --> 00:37:02.700
organized somewhat differently.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.590
So the one MIT is leading,
on revolutionary fibers,

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:09.500
that's got a different approach
and a different kind of sector,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:13.370
frankly, than the
composite sector.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.770
So it's an interesting
attempt to bring innovation

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:20.210
into a long-standing legacy
sector where the federal

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:22.610
innovation system never
really played any role--

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:24.330
except for SEMATECH.

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:29.450
So let me turn to this
kind of Plan B idea.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:33.080
The idea here was,
you know, we're

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:37.250
not going to do a cap-and-trade
proposal anytime soon.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:38.800
So what do we do?

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.630
You know, what's the menu of
options, if we actually want

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:43.220
to deal with climate change?

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.680
And one of the
problems-- look, I

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.630
was involved in drafting the
original Senate climate-change

00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:51.298
legislation.

00:37:51.298 --> 00:37:53.090
And one of the problems
in that legislation

00:37:53.090 --> 00:37:57.710
was, we were attempting
an economy-wide fix,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.880
based upon a neoclassical
economic concept

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.900
that you could alter
prices and drive change.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.930
And it turned out to be
more complicated than that.

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:11.150
Right?

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:14.640
First of all, it's hard to get
an economy-wide model imposed.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.640
It's hard to nail
everybody at the same time.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.140
Right?

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:20.300
The political system
tends to resist this.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.100
In economic terms,
it's very interesting

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.200
to impose an economy-wide
model, but it's hard.

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.900
And then, secondly--
well, I had actually

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:35.070
worked on the original
acid-rain provisions

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.670
the Clean Air Act
of 1990, legislation

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:40.730
to develop a cap-and-trade
system there.

00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:43.340
It worked brilliantly, and
it was a stalking horse

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:46.800
for what we knew we were going
to do on the climate layer.

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:49.560
And cap-and-trade worked
brilliantly, there.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.470
It worked brilliantly, because
we already had the technology

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:54.840
solutions at hand.

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.565
They could be the
scrubbers that we

00:38:56.565 --> 00:39:00.120
were going to put on smokestacks
in Midwestern power plants.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.250
We knew the
technology was there.

00:39:02.250 --> 00:39:05.730
So a pricing system could
really drive, very quickly,

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.940
the forced adoption
of that technology.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:13.410
When we did cap-and-trade,
it took us a while

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.770
to understand that a lot of the
technologies were not close.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.840
They were still a
considerable distance away.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.570
We've talked about carbon
capture and sequestration.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:22.450
It's a good example.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:22.950
Right?

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:26.820
It's not ready for deployment
at large scale, at this point.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.740
It's still experimental.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.980
So it wasn't a great fit.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:33.773
So obviously the
industries that were

00:39:33.773 --> 00:39:35.190
going to be affected
by this, they

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:37.470
didn't know what their
pathways were going to be,

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:38.940
in many cases.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:39.630
Right?

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.753
And, look, in many
sectors, look at transport.

00:39:41.753 --> 00:39:43.545
We don't know if it's
going to be biofuels.

00:39:43.545 --> 00:39:45.100
We don't know if it's
going to be electrics.

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:46.980
We don't know if it's
going to be hybrids.

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:48.420
We don't know what it's
going to-- or maybe just

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:50.760
significant improvements to
internal combustion engines.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.382
All those pieces are still
very much on the table,

00:39:53.382 --> 00:39:54.840
in the transport
sector-- obviously

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.530
a huge economic sector.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:40:01.862
So one of the problems with
cap-and-trade and neoclassical

00:40:01.862 --> 00:40:04.320
model was that it didn't have
a sophisticated understanding

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.180
of the technology policy side.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.080
And I wish I had
understood that then, but--

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:09.663
WOMAN: [LAUGH]

00:40:09.663 --> 00:40:11.205
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
--and obviously I

00:40:11.205 --> 00:40:12.480
wasn't the only actor.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.923
And, overall, I think
a price solution

00:40:16.923 --> 00:40:18.090
is going to be needed, here.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:20.170
But meanwhile, can
we make progress?

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.830
So part of the way in
which we can make progress

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.830
is by a considerably more
sophisticated and effective

00:40:25.830 --> 00:40:28.500
technology strategy.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.210
After this book was--

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:34.197
after the book that this
chapter appeared in was written,

00:40:34.197 --> 00:40:36.030
obviously there was a
major political change

00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:37.073
in the United States.

00:40:37.073 --> 00:40:38.490
So the changes
we're going to have

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.680
to think about, if we're
going to do a Plan B

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:44.010
and I just sit on our
hands for the next decade,

00:40:44.010 --> 00:40:45.720
I think that's a
really important task.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:49.290
And we're going to have to
think about who the actors are

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:52.050
going to be that are prepared
to take on climate change.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.900
Because we can't just
afford to wipe off

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.990
4, 8, 10 years of progress.

00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:59.970
We've got to figure
out what to do so.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.770
There's a new menu of
actors, here, that's

00:41:01.770 --> 00:41:06.510
potential-- at state level, and
in regions, and in companies.

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:10.050
Because I do think this
innovation wave is under way.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.810
And Martín's point
about niche players,

00:41:12.810 --> 00:41:14.463
that's an important
economic point.

00:41:14.463 --> 00:41:16.380
You can move ahead with
that kind of approach,

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.570
in a number of technology spots.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.205
So, arguably, we're
going to need a Plan B,

00:41:21.205 --> 00:41:23.830
and we're going to have to think
about who the actors are going

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:28.740
to be in Plan B. One
thing which we did

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:32.040
do in the Department of
Energy, over the last 10 years,

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.580
is make it a much
more sophisticated

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.460
technology-implementation
organization,

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:40.390
through work of Sam
Bodman and Steve Chu

00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:43.600
and Ernie Moniz over
the past decade.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:47.490
So all these new pieces,
including ARPA-E,

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.200
Energy Frontier
Research Centers,

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:52.590
to kind of turn the focus
of the Office of Science

00:41:52.590 --> 00:41:56.370
onto new energy
technology advances.

00:41:56.370 --> 00:41:58.800
There's 45 of these centers,
now, at universities

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:00.500
across the country.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.490
Office of Science is
now really focused

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.000
on new technology advances.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.820
EERE, Energy Efficiency
and Renewable Energy,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.030
has developed a major focus
on advanced manufacturing

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.420
as a way of driving down
entry costs for new energy

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.110
technologies.

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.568
That's really
important, if they're

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:20.205
going to get in range of price.

00:42:20.205 --> 00:42:22.830
They've created something we'll
talk about in the last reading.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:26.700
They have created a whole new
way of getting, in effect,

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:31.200
substituting space for
capital, at the site of three

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.858
historic energy laboratories.

00:42:33.858 --> 00:42:35.400
We'll talk about in
the last reading.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:39.150
They have a much stronger
technology-transition office.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:41.730
They have innovation hubs
that, when your technology is

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:43.890
ready to kind of scale
up, you can actually

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.260
get a substantial
amount of implementation

00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:49.380
and late-stage applied
research money focused

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.110
on areas like batteries,
fourth-generation nuclear

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:55.470
power, and a series of
other technology areas.

00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:58.380
So all these new
innovation pieces

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.780
have been added to the
Department of Energy.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:03.510
So it's much more
technology-ready

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:04.960
than it was a decade ago.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.520
It's much more in position to
be able to work on the energy

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.830
tasks that it was assigned.

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:11.820
So that's--

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:13.380
Obviously, these
could be curtailed

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:14.640
by the current administration.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:16.128
That's a genuine
challenge, here.

00:43:16.128 --> 00:43:17.670
But at least we've
got experience now

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:19.980
with what some of
these issues are.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:22.235
There's still big
gaps in the system.

00:43:22.235 --> 00:43:23.610
The front end is
much better now,

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.527
at the Department of
Energy, but there's still

00:43:25.527 --> 00:43:28.440
big gaps-- areas like,
how do you do test beds?

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.980
How are we going to do a
technology strategy that

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.380
cuts across public
and private sectors,

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.390
for a common strategy
across players?

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.550
We haven't done that yet.

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:42.870
We need new financing mechanisms
for technology implementation.

00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:44.610
So there's a lot
of pieces that--

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:48.480
there still remain gaps on
the back end of the system.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.725
But we have made progress.

00:43:52.087 --> 00:43:54.170
And, look, let me put the
other piece on the table

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:55.665
and we'll do them both.

00:43:55.665 --> 00:43:57.075
Are both of these yours, Chris?

00:43:57.075 --> 00:43:57.575
CHRIS: Yep.

00:43:57.575 --> 00:43:58.533
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: OK.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:14.360
So this is a chapter in a piece
that just came out last month.

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:21.790
The US is very reliant on
entrepreneurial startups

00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:23.490
to bring innovation
into its system.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.940
That's been a key innovation
organizational accomplishment

00:44:29.940 --> 00:44:33.660
of the last 30 or
40 years, actually.

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:37.170
So we developed a $60-billion
venture-capital support system

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:38.670
to support startups.

00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:39.420
It's how we do it.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.540
It's a very interesting
part of our system.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:45.570
No other country really has
a system as strong as ours.

00:44:45.570 --> 00:44:47.835
The legacy sectors are
like protected castles.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:56.040
VCs don't like to
take the castles on.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.780
You can understand why.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.270
They like to innovate in
new frontier areas, where

00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:02.062
there are not incumbents,
where they're not

00:45:02.062 --> 00:45:03.390
going to get opposition.

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:08.070
So, back in 2008, when it looked
like energy prices were going

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:12.090
to be high and cap-and-trade
was coming along,

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:15.240
VCs began to ramp
up their investments

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.062
in new energy technologies.

00:45:18.062 --> 00:45:19.020
And they've now walked.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:26.110
So let's look at venture-capital
investment, nationwide.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.680
This is what venture
capital spent in 2015

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.531
its money on-- its $60 billion.

00:45:31.531 --> 00:45:34.180
Right?

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.450
Software.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:36.240
Right?

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.710
That's the long and short of it.

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:39.780
They did a fair
amount of biotech.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.040
Software was about 40%.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:43.530
That's about 13%.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:47.730
A bunch of services,
media entertainment,

00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:50.760
IT services-- that was
the bulk of the rest.

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.860
Now, you look at this
little piece down here,

00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.970
right, this piece.

00:45:53.970 --> 00:45:55.890
That's 5%.

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.440
That's hard technologies.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.290
That's energy and industrial.

00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:03.000
Right?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.623
This has profound
implications, absolutely

00:46:05.623 --> 00:46:06.540
profound implications.

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.457
So the way in which we
stand up new innovation

00:46:08.457 --> 00:46:12.430
is going to be through this
venture-capital finance system.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.030
And all they're going to
do is software and biotech

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:18.342
and a few services.

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:20.050
We've got a serious
problem on our hands.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:23.290
We're not going to have an
energy-technology revolution.

00:46:23.290 --> 00:46:27.670
But we're also not
standing up innovations

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:30.100
in hard technologies.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.650
Software and biotech
are not particularly

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:33.760
job-creating areas.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.060
Software maybe
negative job creating.

00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:36.992
Right?

00:46:36.992 --> 00:46:38.950
Are we going to have any
jobs, in this economy?

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:40.492
I mean, what's going
to happen, here?

00:46:40.492 --> 00:46:43.205
These are really,
really serious problems.

00:46:43.205 --> 00:46:45.580
OK?

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.610
We tried to do the
same chart for 2016,

00:46:47.610 --> 00:46:49.960
but [LAUGH] the Venture
Capital Association [LAUGH]

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.543
changed the way they collected
their numbers, because software

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.903
was so pervasive that they
couldn't separate it out

00:46:54.903 --> 00:46:55.570
anymore [LAUGH].

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:56.100
Right?

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.670
It was in every sector.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:59.710
So [LAUGH] 15 is
the last good set

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:03.670
of numbers we're going to get
around software investment.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.980
So, who comes to
the rescue, here?

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.260
So Rafael comes to the rescue.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:09.010
I didn't get this.

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.540
I mean, this is his thinking.

00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:15.940
And I had this
conversation with him.

00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:17.315
We had been
struggling with this,

00:47:17.315 --> 00:47:19.023
in the Advanced
Manufacturing Partnership

00:47:19.023 --> 00:47:21.010
program, the President's
advanced manufacturing

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:22.390
innovation effort.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:23.920
How are we going
to get financing

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:25.840
for companies that are going
to manufacture in the United

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.470
States?

00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:28.810
Because they're not
getting venture finance.

00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:30.850
And we looked at the
other potential sources--

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:36.100
you know, private equity, M&A
in existing company financing.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.330
They're just not significant
for innovative new companies.

00:47:40.330 --> 00:47:42.580
Venture capital is
pretty much the story.

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.983
And, you know, Rafael--

00:47:46.983 --> 00:47:48.400
I was thinking
about, how could we

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.880
do some kind of new
financing, or how could we

00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.382
create incentives for venture
capital to change all its rules

00:47:54.382 --> 00:47:55.840
and go after these
harder problems?

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:03.300
He basically said, venture
capital is doing good stuff.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.980
Software and biotech
are important things.

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:07.600
They're going to do
what they can do.

00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:13.440
Substitute space for capital.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.940
That wasn't quite
the way he put it,

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:16.898
but that was the essence
of what he was saying.

00:48:16.898 --> 00:48:20.640
And I said, Rafael, what
are you talking about?

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.930
Never had dawned on me.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:22.800
Right?

00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:27.560
Basically what he said
was, let's create really

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:32.450
technology-equipment,
know-how-rich spaces and get

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:36.350
a bunch of very interesting
hard-technology startups--

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:37.850
in other words, the
biotechs are OK,

00:48:37.850 --> 00:48:39.560
and the software
companies are OK.

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.080
Let's get some of the
rest of the crew in

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:46.280
and create places where they
get really advanced equipment

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:46.950
and know-how.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:47.450
Right?

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:49.760
So there's a lot of technology
incubators out there,

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.260
and we've got
probably eight of them

00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:53.603
right in our Boston
neighborhood, here,

00:48:53.603 --> 00:48:55.020
and some of which
are very strong.

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:58.160
They tend to be earlier-stage.

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.780
They tend to-- they
capture you when you're new

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.580
and you're really at
the business-plan,

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.370
business-development
kind of stage.

00:49:07.370 --> 00:49:09.590
There isn't really
a model to help you,

00:49:09.590 --> 00:49:12.140
when you've got to
start to scale up--

00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.600
and with that
scale-up proposition.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:19.360
So that's what his concept is.

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.850
And it happens to speak,
I think profoundly,

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:25.165
to this energy-technology
space, if we

00:49:25.165 --> 00:49:26.290
could create some of these.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:29.680
The engine that he's
now led the creation of

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:33.580
is exactly an attempt
to solve this problem.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:35.950
In other words,
his view is, we're

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.970
leading a lot of science-based
innovation developed in MIT,

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.080
just sitting on the table.

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:43.090
Because we don't have
a scale-up mechanism.

00:49:43.090 --> 00:49:49.090
Can we work on trying to create
a space where that could occur?

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:52.480
So, in effect, what venture
capital would finance--

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.090
that equipment, that
technology, that know-how,

00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:57.560
for the scale-up--

00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:00.200
can we contribute
that, create that,

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.020
and then invite the
startups in that are

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:04.880
doing hard-technology startups?

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:06.410
So there's a bunch
of other models.

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:08.660
DOE got this, big-time.

00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.210
ARPA-E began
running into a wall.

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:12.990
ARPA-E had assumed
venture capital

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:15.302
was the way in which its
startups were going to work.

00:50:15.302 --> 00:50:17.510
And then they realized their
startups weren't getting

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.730
venture money, when
venture-capital funding

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:21.110
in energy collapsed-- right?

00:50:21.110 --> 00:50:23.810
Went down 80%.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:31.810
So this band of characters
took some space right

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:34.480
at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:38.020
up on top of the hill, up
above the Berkeley campus,

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.850
on Cyclotron Road.

00:50:39.850 --> 00:50:43.000
And they created a
technology, equipment,

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.990
know-how-rich space
and provided salaries--

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:49.990
for a couple of years,
which could be extended--

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:52.730
for a crew of startups.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:54.430
They're now in
their third tranche.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.530
Very interesting.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:58.750
Very interesting companies.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.000
And it's a whole new
technology transition model

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.400
for the Department of Energy.

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.070
So, for possibly 40 years,
the Department of Energy

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:10.390
has been trying to get
these big, famous energy

00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:13.960
laboratories that are on
mesas, behind barbed wire,

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.410
to transfer their
technology out.

00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:20.170
And the folks that work
there are paid, you know,

00:51:20.170 --> 00:51:22.300
guaranteed salaries for life.

00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:25.030
And they get
entitlement-funded research.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.490
They're guaranteed
interesting scientific work.

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:30.130
And we want them to
walk out of there

00:51:30.130 --> 00:51:33.250
and, you know, not be paid
in a stand-up company?

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:34.540
I mean, good luck.

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.260
Right?

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.960
It's not an optimal
technology transfer model.

00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:42.910
And, look-- technology transfers
with people that walk, right?

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.560
Technology transfer
doesn't happen

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:49.060
by developing a list or a plan
and handing it to someone.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.760
Technology transfer
works through people.

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:54.460
You've got to really encourage
people to emigrate and move

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:57.310
with the ideas, because they
have the tacit knowledge

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:58.510
to make these things happen.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:01.568
Well, this may be a much better
technology-transfer model

00:52:01.568 --> 00:52:03.610
for the Department of
Energy than the one they've

00:52:03.610 --> 00:52:04.818
been working on for 40 years.

00:52:04.818 --> 00:52:07.390
So two other labs,
Argon and Oak Ridge,

00:52:07.390 --> 00:52:09.990
have now picked
up the same model.

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.900
Steph?

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.820
STEPH: One of the
elements I didn't

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:14.340
see in the analysis
of the models

00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.360
was the importance
of competition

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:22.420
or having that sort of
truncated time frame.

00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.948
How is it that they sort of put
pressure on them to deliver?

00:52:24.948 --> 00:52:26.740
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well all of these teams

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.750
had to compete, to get in there.

00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:30.600
So that was a very
tough composition--

00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:33.430
more than 100 actors,
100 different teams,

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:36.280
were competing to be
part of the first eight.

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.860
So that was a highly
competitive process.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:41.320
Look, if you've got an
interesting startup idea

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.960
and you're just out of grad
school or, for that matter,

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.850
just out of undergrad
school, and you've

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:49.300
got a really interesting,
small group and idea

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.190
and you want to
move it, the fact

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:53.650
that somebody would give you
space, incredible equipment,

00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:56.170
and technology,
incredible know-how,

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:58.360
and pay you a salary
for a couple of years,

00:52:58.360 --> 00:52:59.810
what could be better?

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.310
Right?

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:04.090
This is really good news,
for hard-technology startups

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:05.090
in the energy space.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:06.798
So it's been very
attractive, and there's

00:53:06.798 --> 00:53:09.250
a lot of competition to
get into these places.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.850
So competition is embedded
right at the heart of the model.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:13.460
Martha?

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.670
MARTHA: So, Bill, do
you have any sense--

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.190
well, first of all, I can't
remember how old they are

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:20.652
and what kind of track record
they have, at this point in--

00:53:20.652 --> 00:53:22.610
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So
these are all brand-new.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:24.070
This is a brand-new model.

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:24.610
Right?

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:24.960
MARTHA: Cyclotron--

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.668
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So they just accepted

00:53:26.668 --> 00:53:28.130
their third round of teams.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:29.290
So they're two years old.

00:53:29.290 --> 00:53:29.998
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:53:29.998 --> 00:53:30.570
OK.

00:53:30.570 --> 00:53:32.000
I wasn't really clear.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.930
So are they going to
be able to expand,

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.240
under this new political
climate, to other labs?

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:38.490
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: We'll see.

00:53:38.490 --> 00:53:43.532
I think-- from the sense I have
in talking to DOE friends--

00:53:43.532 --> 00:53:44.740
what's wrong with this model?

00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:48.550
I mean, you're in effect
repurposing an established

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:50.097
model at extremely modest costs.

00:53:50.097 --> 00:53:50.680
MARTHA: Right.

00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.100
So, in other words--

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.642
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Lawrence Berkeley

00:53:52.642 --> 00:53:54.360
Lab's an $800-million-a-year
operation.

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.960
You know, salaries,
for these folks?

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:57.070
That's not much.

00:53:57.070 --> 00:53:57.670
Right?

00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:59.400
And yet the opportunities
of standing up

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.608
with new technologies are
really pretty significant,

00:54:01.608 --> 00:54:02.650
supporting entrepreneurs.

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:04.750
So I think this one
is a viable model,

00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:06.212
in either political climate.

00:54:06.212 --> 00:54:07.920
PERSON: Right, so who
makes the decision?

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.298
And what stage is the
technology, when they enter?

00:54:11.298 --> 00:54:13.090
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So, you know, this guy,

00:54:13.090 --> 00:54:17.830
Ilan Gur is right out of ARPA-E.
So he's very used to-- he

00:54:17.830 --> 00:54:19.450
understands really well--

00:54:19.450 --> 00:54:21.640
he came through a whole
startup experience, himself.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:27.820
He's had startup experiences
and has his PhD in science,

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.890
from Berkeley--

00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:31.870
very talented
young technologist,

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:34.270
very sharp, able guy.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.850
He's got a whole team, there,
that's also quite able.

00:54:36.850 --> 00:54:38.890
And strong support from the lab.

00:54:38.890 --> 00:54:39.550
Right?

00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:41.490
So the lab likes this.

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.350
This is a way of
getting their stuff out.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:46.840
Look-- it's a new model, right?

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.630
The model is, have a
competition for, an effect,

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:55.340
a nerd motorcycle gang.

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:59.440
Park them outside
the barbed wire.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.680
Give them a home, and give
them the keys to go in

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:03.670
and loot the place.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:05.510
I mean, that's
essentially the model.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:06.205
Right?

00:55:06.205 --> 00:55:07.460
That's what they're doing.

00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:10.295
PERSON: So, when you say
"park them outside the fence,"

00:55:10.295 --> 00:55:11.160
is that literal?

00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:11.660
Or--

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.740
STEPH: Yeah, that's literal.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.450
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's literal.

00:55:13.450 --> 00:55:16.480
They're immediately adjacent to
these highly secure facilities.

00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:17.700
PERSON: Why don't they
just put them inside?

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.280
WOMAN: But allowed in.

00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.840
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well,
they are allowed in.

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:20.440
Yeah.

00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:20.940
Right.

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.650
There are just some
security issues, and--

00:55:22.650 --> 00:55:24.060
STEPH: --side of a
mountain, literally?

00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:25.143
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:55:25.143 --> 00:55:26.510
STEPH: And it's quite steep.

00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:28.340
So, if you're walking
and you trip, like,

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:30.113
you would fall very
[LAUGH] heavily.

00:55:30.113 --> 00:55:31.780
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
It's very beautiful.

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.412
Great views.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:34.620
STEPH: They have a great
view the bay and the bridge.

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:36.160
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Remember,
we talked about Ernest Lawrence?

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.500
This is his lab.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:38.500
Right?

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:41.800
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.660
STUDENT: My only
concern would be,

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:47.180
if the technology's too early,
they'll be based on, like,

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:48.850
the people who they
know, instead of

00:55:48.850 --> 00:55:50.900
the actual technology.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:53.800
So what would be interesting is
if it's already technology that

00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.330
shows some promise,
that way it's

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:57.190
kind of like a pseudo
right-before scale-up,

00:55:57.190 --> 00:56:00.130
where it's, I need to get my
technical abilities scaled up?

00:56:00.130 --> 00:56:00.390
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:01.723
STUDENT: That'll be really good.

00:56:01.723 --> 00:56:04.160
But the issue is, like, this
happens kind of like at MIT

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.370
with, like, Delta-V,
where it's like,

00:56:06.370 --> 00:56:08.580
it's kind of become a
Sloane-y kind of like hub,

00:56:08.580 --> 00:56:11.468
where it's like, there's people
who don't have great ideas,

00:56:11.468 --> 00:56:13.885
but they apply because they
know the right person who does

00:56:13.885 --> 00:56:15.302
if they go through,
versus, like--

00:56:15.302 --> 00:56:17.677
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: This is
a very tough-minded selection

00:56:17.677 --> 00:56:18.180
process.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.320
You know?

00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:21.370
Ilan is a real talent.

00:56:21.370 --> 00:56:23.800
He's running a
good process, here.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.010
Look, we're kind of running out
of time, here, so let me just

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:28.270
get the rest of the story out.

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:30.580
Because part of it, Martín,
speaks to the next issue

00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.080
we've got, which is--

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:35.080
one of the issues here is,
these are all early stage.

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.010
Right?

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.470
These are very talented
technology teams, right out

00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.790
of university laboratories.

00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:42.340
Here's a different model.

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:44.830
TechBridge, right
here in Boston,

00:56:44.830 --> 00:56:47.710
is part of the Boston
Fraunhofer system.

00:56:47.710 --> 00:56:50.260
And they have a different
model, but they're similarly

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.670
providing this technology,
equipment, know-how-rich space

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.130
as a substitute for VC money.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:03.010
And the idea here
is, Cyclotron Road

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.830
starts with the
technology group and then

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.170
tries to nurture the technology.

00:57:08.170 --> 00:57:11.470
TechBridge starts with
large regional companies.

00:57:11.470 --> 00:57:14.840
And it goes to them, and
it says, what do you want?

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:15.620
Right?

00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:17.620
And, typically, they don't
want disruptive stuff

00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:19.120
that's going to
wreck their business

00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.470
model-- for obvious reasons.

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.012
And they don't want to bother
with stuff that they're already

00:57:23.012 --> 00:57:24.460
doing, that they
understand well.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.080
But there are substantial groups
of adjacent energy technologies

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.950
that fit with their model, that
would be interesting to them.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:35.770
And that's what TechBridge
tries to find out.

00:57:35.770 --> 00:57:39.550
So it gets a list of,
what do you folks want?

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:42.490
And then it goes to find
talented startups in the Boston

00:57:42.490 --> 00:57:46.780
area, of which there's a lot,
and connect the right startup

00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:50.720
to the right industry player,
for a collaborative project.

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:51.430
OK?

00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:52.510
Very different model.

00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:54.250
Very interesting.

00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:57.070
The most interesting
part of it is

00:57:57.070 --> 00:58:00.720
that those folks work
together for a little while.

00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.850
They come up with kind of
the prototype together.

00:58:02.850 --> 00:58:04.510
Right?

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:06.388
But industry doesn't
quite trust the startup.

00:58:06.388 --> 00:58:07.930
The startup doesn't
know whether it's

00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:10.060
going to get robbed
by the big company.

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:11.440
Who knows, right?

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.350
They bring in the
Fraunhofer laboratories,

00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:18.250
this famous laboratory system,
and the Fraunhofer labs

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:21.730
do, for the
startup-industry combo,

00:58:21.730 --> 00:58:24.280
what they do for
German companies.

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:28.360
They do a very tough-minded
technology assessment.

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.030
They break down the
technology, they evaluate it--

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:32.710
Can this technology
be manufactured?

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.030
How would you manufacture it?

00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.613
Can you manufacture
it at a price that

00:58:35.613 --> 00:58:37.090
would actually be saleable?

00:58:37.090 --> 00:58:39.580
You know, is this
resilient technology?

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:42.060
All the kind of stuff they
do for German companies,

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:43.930
they're doing for the startup.

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:48.708
It's a very rich, sophisticated
technology evaluation process.

00:58:48.708 --> 00:58:50.500
We don't really have
anything in our system

00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:52.690
like it, so it's
pretty intriguing.

00:58:52.690 --> 00:58:54.970
And, in effect, they
certify to the company--

00:58:54.970 --> 00:58:57.880
I mean, they may say, this stuff
is worthless, throw it away,

00:58:57.880 --> 00:59:00.983
or they could say, this is
actually very interesting.

00:59:00.983 --> 00:59:02.650
Here's how you could
make it, and here's

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:04.858
the components you ought to
use and the materials you

00:59:04.858 --> 00:59:10.282
ought to think about, and here's
a pathway to a marketplace.

00:59:10.282 --> 00:59:11.740
The company, the
big company, loves

00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.657
this, because they realize
the startup may not

00:59:13.657 --> 00:59:14.690
be totally crazy.

00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:17.350
And then the startup likes
it because, in effect, it's

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:21.220
certified their technology.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:24.400
So this puts both players into
a much more informed space.

00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.260
And that's been very--

00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:28.180
it's been very
intriguing, sort of adding

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.220
this technology-validation
piece to this.

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:33.280
Remember, we talked
about the role of FDA

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:37.230
in certifying technology,
which guarantees a market?

00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:39.700
This is the first time
I've seen this played out

00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:41.050
in a US kind of model.

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:42.840
And it's kind of intriguing.

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.740
And I'll put one more
on the table for you.

00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:55.070
That's Greentown Labs, a
respected, quite capable energy

00:59:55.070 --> 00:59:58.050
incubator, full of
folks like you--

00:59:58.050 --> 01:00:00.560
you know, off the lab
bunch at a school,

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.370
with cool energy
technology ideas.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:09.570
Greentown began
understanding that there

01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:15.690
are 60-odd teams, had a
lot of neat research ideas.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.650
They had no idea
to make anything.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:18.150
Right?

01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:20.140
No idea.

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.097
You know, you weren't taught
how to make things, here at MIT.

01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:25.097
Although it is changing
with the Maker movement.

01:00:25.097 --> 01:00:25.597
But--

01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.850
University-lab-originated
technology teams

01:00:31.850 --> 01:00:34.820
don't know anything
about manufacturing.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.860
So they had an interesting idea.

01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:39.040
There's a manufacturing
extension program.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.540
Every state has one, sponsored
by the Department of Commerce

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:43.880
NIST.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.100
Massachusetts happens
to have a good--

01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:49.225
quite a good manufacturing
extension program.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:55.970
Greentown and the
MEP got together.

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:57.720
And the MEP said, hmm,
that's interesting.

01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.387
We've never worked
with startups before.

01:00:59.387 --> 01:01:02.710
We work with small
manufacturers.

01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:06.970
But maybe we could link small
manufacturers and the startups.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:10.030
And Massachusetts happens to
have still a pretty strong base

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.220
of small manufacturers.

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:14.530
They work for the defense
sector, the growing robotics

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:16.060
sector, the medical-device
sector-- which

01:01:16.060 --> 01:01:17.477
are big sectors,
in Massachusetts,

01:01:17.477 --> 01:01:21.010
and there's some
talented small companies.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:27.400
The MEP ran a survey of its
capable small manufacturers.

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.760
And the survey
results came back.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.170
83 were interested in
talking to startups.

01:01:35.170 --> 01:01:37.240
Why?

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:42.737
These small manufacturers are
tied to existing supply chains.

01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:43.570
They don't innovate.

01:01:43.570 --> 01:01:46.060
They don't do R&E. They don't
have access to innovation.

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.310
How are they going to grow
their market significantly?

01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:50.860
They're kind of
locked into a pathway.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.020
This is a route out,
for some of them.

01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.335
In addition, others like
the startup culture.

01:01:56.335 --> 01:01:57.710
They thought,
that's pretty cool.

01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.620
Let's get my employees
feeling like that.

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:00.120
Right?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.140
Maybe we'll get some stuff done.

01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:04.580
And some others thought,
gee, the startup culture's

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:06.580
important, now, in
Massachusetts, to its feature

01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:06.870
acc--

01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:08.203
[AUDIO OUT] We're good citizens.

01:02:08.203 --> 01:02:09.700
We're going to help them.

01:02:09.700 --> 01:02:14.170
So they created
this complex process

01:02:14.170 --> 01:02:17.740
of how to arrange
these exchanges.

01:02:17.740 --> 01:02:25.628
Now, the startups, they
communicate by internet things

01:02:25.628 --> 01:02:27.420
that you all understand
and I have no idea.

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:27.830
Of.

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:28.240
Right?

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:29.157
I don't what they are.

01:02:29.157 --> 01:02:31.425
But that's how they communicate.

01:02:31.425 --> 01:02:32.800
You know, I'm
exaggerating, here,

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.030
but the startups by and
large voted for Bernie,

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:38.490
and the small manufacturers--

01:02:38.490 --> 01:02:41.580
I'm exaggerating--
probably voted for Donald.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.670
And they worked by
face-to-face meetings--

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:46.270
things like telephones.

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.500
You know?

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.600
You remember landlines?

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.323
They still exist.

01:02:50.323 --> 01:02:51.990
These are completely
different cultures.

01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:54.750
How are they going to fall
in love with each other

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.940
and be able to trust each
other to do technology

01:02:56.940 --> 01:02:57.940
development together?

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.600
And there were no
incentives, here.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:02.770
There were no subsidies.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.590
The startup had to
come up with money,

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.010
to fund the advanced prototype
or the pilot production they

01:03:08.010 --> 01:03:09.420
wanted to undertake.

01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.760
So there were no giveaways
to incentivize people.

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.310
This was real money, and
both sides were at stake.

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.950
So they arranged this
four-step process,

01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:20.500
to try and bring
about communication.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.090
43 startups were interested.

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:27.870
After a year of pilot
projects, 19 deals.

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:29.100
Money changed hands.

01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.660
Things were being made.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.800
Pretty interesting.

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:34.140
So this is another piece.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.180
We've now collected a
bunch of ideas, here.

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:38.220
Right?

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:40.500
Bunch of ideas, here, that
are potentially relevant--

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:46.050
From Cyclotron Road,
repurposing an existing source

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:49.260
of strong technology
equipment and know-how,

01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.735
repurpose these energy labs.

01:03:50.735 --> 01:03:52.110
That's a really
interesting idea,

01:03:52.110 --> 01:03:53.840
because that's fairly cheap.

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:54.660
Right?

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:56.850
You don't have to build
all this new equipment.

01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:58.600
MIT is doing the same
thing with equipment

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.040
it's got, for the engine.

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:05.543
From TechBridge, the
idea of, maybe you

01:04:05.543 --> 01:04:07.710
could do this-- maybe you
could connect up companies

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.930
at the outset, with startups.

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:10.800
That's interesting.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.200
And maybe you could do a
technology validation step.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.300
And then this
third piece, here--

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:19.590
and then I'll call it a day and
let Chris lead some questions.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:21.870
But this third piece,
here, is, maybe

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:24.733
you could tie small
manufacturers and startups,

01:04:24.733 --> 01:04:27.150
because they both have a problem
that the other side could

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.650
solve.

01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:28.740
Right?

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.580
So you start to see a
pretty interesting model

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:38.520
for Rafael's idea of
substituting space

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:39.570
for venture funding.

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:40.860
This is an interesting model.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:42.650
Universities could
do this model.

01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:45.180
MIT is trying to experiment
to show other schools that it

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:46.740
could be done.

01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:50.010
Federal labs are
already pursuing this.

01:04:50.010 --> 01:04:53.100
And the DOD has 67 of
these, and Lincoln Lab

01:04:53.100 --> 01:04:56.760
is extremely interested in
this model, for example.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.790
So is Draper, just
up the street.

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.860
So, in other words, there are
ways this thing could scale.

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.660
Right?

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:06.300
So, between universities
and existing laboratory

01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:09.120
capabilities-- and then MIT's
got the idea of connecting you

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:12.480
to companies and nodes
that could help you

01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:15.300
as you develop a more
sophisticated product line.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.920
So there could be
a new model, here,

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:19.440
that would really
help with what's

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.377
become now a very significant
gap in US innovation system,

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.210
over the collapse of
venture-capital funding

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:27.850
for other than software,
biotech, and certain service

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:30.233
sectors.

01:05:30.233 --> 01:05:31.150
Chris, it's all yours.

01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:32.080
CHRIS: Awesome.

01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:35.080
So I thought this is a
really interesting article,

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.030
because you often hear
about, oh, energy, funding,

01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.780
and the whole system's
not really working,

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.780
but it was kind of hard for
me, at least, to see why,

01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:47.340
and, like, the discussion of
the neoclassical economic model

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.480
and why that doesn't
really work out,

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.580
especially for this
kind of industry,

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.560
was pretty interesting to me.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:56.250
So the way I saw it was that--

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:58.010
So there's kind of
a twofold problem.

01:05:58.010 --> 01:06:03.160
Like, we have problems in energy
revolution and the technology

01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.560
space and then also,
like, implementing

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.880
those technologies.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.260
And Reif presents this
innovation-orchards kind

01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:13.510
of framework, which
is really interesting.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:17.590
And, as Bill mentioned, we
have a somewhat robust kind

01:06:17.590 --> 01:06:23.710
of model for early, maybe
like incubator-type startups.

01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:27.480
And then we have to somehow
bridge that gap to innovation.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.220
I was just wondering, what
are your thoughts on how

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.340
we can kind of create
that smooth transition

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:37.300
between institutions that might
be providing some early seed

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:39.730
funding and then how
to transition those

01:06:39.730 --> 01:06:42.490
into later stage, whether
those be connected

01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:46.660
to, like, TechBridge or those
other models that have kind

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:50.980
of demonstrated some
pretty good ways to bring

01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.994
that implementation
process into play.

01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:00.890
RASHID: I think two things.

01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:05.720
One, I was pretty astonished
at the first piece,

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.062
particularly taking this
neoclassical view of,

01:07:08.062 --> 01:07:10.270
hey, should we do cap-and-trade
instead of carbon tax

01:07:10.270 --> 01:07:13.140
[INAUDIBLE] for
curbing emissions?

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.980
And I think it did a pretty good
job of saying that maybe, like,

01:07:15.980 --> 01:07:19.850
it's more complicated than that,
but also like the fact that we

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:24.350
were still looking to do sort
of a cap-and-trade system,

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:27.500
even in 2010, which
is relatively recent,

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.370
and classical economics has
existed for a while now--

01:07:31.370 --> 01:07:34.250
made me think,
like, is economics--

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.820
Are the solutions that
we think theoretically,

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.740
like, in economics,
are they effectual?

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:42.230
And are they just kind of
limiting us, because we only

01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:43.730
have this school
of economic thought

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.860
that says this is sort
of our solution subset,

01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.750
this is the answer?

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.610
And are there
economists out there

01:07:49.610 --> 01:07:51.440
aren't neoclassical
economists, that

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.100
may have solutions for us
that exist outside of--

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.410
that probably would be a lot
more palatable and useful

01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:00.190
than a carbon tax or a
cap-and-trade system.

01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:01.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So, Rasheed, let

01:08:01.690 --> 01:08:03.870
me build on that for
a second and just--

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:06.590
and, just to be clear,
don't get me wrong,

01:08:06.590 --> 01:08:08.750
I do think a pricing
mechan-- there is definitely

01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:10.100
a place for a pricing mechanism.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:12.120
It can help a lot.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.047
I think part of
the problem, here,

01:08:14.047 --> 01:08:16.130
is that neoclassical
economics, as we talked about

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:24.410
in the first class, hasn't been
able to develop an outlook that

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:33.915
enables it to treat technology
innovation as endogenous

01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:35.390
to economic-growth theory.

01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.890
Right?

01:08:35.890 --> 01:08:38.100
So SOLO announces
it's exogenous,

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:42.962
because it's too complex a model
for us to track the variables.

01:08:42.962 --> 01:08:44.670
And, as we've talked
about in this class,

01:08:44.670 --> 01:08:47.310
it involves history and
culture and organization theory

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:49.020
and all kinds of
other things that

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.569
are kind of outside the
parameters of what economics

01:08:51.569 --> 01:08:54.060
is normally able to
track in its curves.

01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.430
So that's a genuine problem.

01:08:56.430 --> 01:09:04.939
So when neoclassical economics
comes up with a fix to climate,

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:08.038
it misses the technology side.

01:09:08.038 --> 01:09:09.580
Because it doesn't
have sophisticated

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.580
handles to deal with it.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.979
Now, obviously economists
like Romer and others

01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:16.939
are attempting to make
technology theory endogenous,

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:18.710
part of economic
theory, but that's still

01:09:18.710 --> 01:09:20.210
an ongoing project.

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:22.720
But that's where we
ran into trouble,

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:26.930
was that the technology need
over an extended period of time

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:30.470
didn't match the timetable
on cap-and-trade.

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.779
And the solution there was
to push off cap-and-trade.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:35.602
And that's, in effect,
what we've done.

01:09:35.602 --> 01:09:37.310
I still think we need
to come back to it,

01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.080
but I think the
project at hand is

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.390
a technology-development
project and really

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:44.370
a state and local government
technology-implementation

01:09:44.370 --> 01:09:47.420
alternatives, where
we could come up

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.898
with a Plan B that helped make
progress for the next decade

01:09:50.898 --> 01:09:51.398
or so.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.942
STEPH: I also, to add
to Rasheed's point,

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:58.900
I think that's what I
was getting at last week,

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:04.030
with my point about nonmarket
solutions to market--

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:05.680
to problems that
we're approaching

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:10.348
through the lens of economics,
in the sense that, perhaps

01:10:10.348 --> 01:10:11.140
if we think about--

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:20.050
if we start our problem-solving
from a lens of promoting

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:24.163
social good, rather than
increasing capital gain,

01:10:24.163 --> 01:10:26.830
then we might be able to come up
with alternative and innovative

01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:27.850
solutions.

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.768
Right?

01:10:28.768 --> 01:10:30.310
And so I think that's
sort of where--

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.767
Reif?

01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:32.350
STUDENT: Reif.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:35.700
STEPH: Reif was coming
from, that this model--

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:38.290
and I mentioned this on our
very first day of class--

01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:40.150
very much is
similar to the model

01:10:40.150 --> 01:10:42.250
that nongovernmental
organizations and nonprofits

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:44.890
have been using for a
very long time, in sort

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:48.700
of trading or leveraging
the kindness of individuals

01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.250
and their willingness
to let them participate

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:52.090
in their spaces.

01:10:52.090 --> 01:10:54.610
And you see this happen
for political campaigns.

01:10:54.610 --> 01:10:56.170
Volunteer fellows
will go, and they

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:57.880
will live in a
supporter's house,

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.088
and then they will go on
and knock on people's doors

01:11:00.088 --> 01:11:00.880
for that candidate.

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.088
And they will do so for very
little money or no money

01:11:03.088 --> 01:11:03.640
at all.

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:06.640
And so, as someone who comes
from the nonprofit and NGO

01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:10.270
sector, and I've been
you know volunteering

01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.470
in politics since I
was really little,

01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:17.260
the ways in which you can
leverage on the sort of good

01:11:17.260 --> 01:11:21.010
and ethics of people seems to
me a much more interesting place

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:23.770
to start for research
and development

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.260
and for hardware technologies
than people would think.

01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.890
Because, if you approach it
from a lens of economics,

01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:31.690
it's very difficult
to make the case,

01:11:31.690 --> 01:11:33.940
oftentimes, that your
technology could be disruptive

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.917
and could pay off.

01:11:34.917 --> 01:11:37.000
But if you approach it
from a lens of social good,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.458
it's possible that
you could appeal

01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:40.330
to the ethos of a
venture capitalist.

01:11:40.330 --> 01:11:42.400
Because, for example,
someone like Bill Gates

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.230
is more likely to
say, I want to do this

01:11:44.230 --> 01:11:46.190
because I think it's
the right thing to do,

01:11:46.190 --> 01:11:49.450
than to make the argument that
it's a good investment for him

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:51.440
and that the ROI
will be greater.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:55.690
So I think that there is a
benefit to sometimes pivoting

01:11:55.690 --> 01:11:59.320
away from market-oriented
problem-solving

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.930
and to view it from a different
sort of lens of ethics

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:04.930
or social-good promotion.

01:12:04.930 --> 01:12:08.210
Obviously that won't always
work, but there are instances,

01:12:08.210 --> 01:12:10.000
and I think this is
one, in which that

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.620
is where we are leaning toward.

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.700
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And I will
add, Steph, to your point,

01:12:15.700 --> 01:12:18.610
that part of what has
come with the engine

01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:21.670
is a bridge fund available
to those startups.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:25.870
So Rafael and
colleagues have been

01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:29.250
able to raise over, I
think, $150 million,

01:12:29.250 --> 01:12:31.905
now, for commitments
to a bridge fund.

01:12:31.905 --> 01:12:33.280
Because, you know,
these startups

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.572
are going to need some funding.

01:12:34.572 --> 01:12:35.072
Right?

01:12:35.072 --> 01:12:35.930
It's not going to--

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.545
they save huge expenses by
equipment and technology

01:12:38.545 --> 01:12:41.290
and know-how savings,
in this new space,

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.970
but they still are going
to need to get funding.

01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:46.390
And so this bridge fund
could really help them.

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:50.870
That money was raised
from, essentially,

01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:54.750
generous rich people
in this region, who

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:59.270
were prepared to, in effect,
make a charitable donation

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:01.040
towards this thing,
thinking that it might

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.660
be helpful to the
overall innovation

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:05.570
economy in the
Massachusetts area.

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:10.010
And they have an
opportunity for return.

01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:11.950
So, if these startups
take off, there

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:13.490
is an opportunity for return.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.520
But, frankly, they're
not expecting it.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:16.860
So that has actually worked.

01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.710
And Rafael has just
been able to demonstrate

01:13:18.710 --> 01:13:23.235
that you can raise money on the
basis of that kind of approach.

01:13:23.235 --> 01:13:25.610
STEPH: And I think they're
one of the interesting models.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:26.690
And perhaps you've
looked at this.

01:13:26.690 --> 01:13:27.458
Maybe you haven't.

01:13:27.458 --> 01:13:29.000
But it's the way in
which art museums

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.833
and, in particular,
contemporary art museums

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:33.620
pursue funding from
philanthropists.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:36.510
Because it's often that a lot
of the contemporary artists that

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.690
are sort of on the
leading edge are something

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:40.635
that people are very
reticent to adopt.

01:13:40.635 --> 01:13:42.260
So the museums that
purchase their art,

01:13:42.260 --> 01:13:43.843
either for their
permanent collections

01:13:43.843 --> 01:13:45.560
or for their temporary
exhibits, often

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:48.620
allow their philanthropists
to gain some sort of benefit

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:51.560
or value from having
hosted that and having

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.880
attached their name to it.

01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.890
And, later on, it
is that, because art

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:57.110
is seen as a commodity
and luxury good,

01:13:57.110 --> 01:14:00.580
they're able to sort of gain
capital return on it, as well.

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:02.330
So I think it could
be interesting to look

01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:05.150
at the ways in which museums
and art museums specifically

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:07.536
do their philanthropy
for technology.

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:10.860
CHRIS: Sure.

01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.370
Go ahead.

01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:11.690
STUDENT: Well, I think there's--

01:14:11.690 --> 01:14:12.840
OK.

01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.420
There is also, like,
purely private-sector

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.370
market-driven models.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:22.230
I think a really good example
is Autodesk., so right down here

01:14:22.230 --> 01:14:23.230
by the seaport.

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:23.730
And--

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:24.860
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Why
don't you describe it.

01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:25.443
STUDENT: Yeah.

01:14:25.443 --> 01:14:27.720
So, Autodesk, they
basically want

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.110
to become the software
company for any CAD, CNC,

01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:33.090
anything that you want to make.

01:14:33.090 --> 01:14:36.490
And so they have a fellowship
program here, and then--

01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:39.240
so Auto-- they're MIT
startups who work in their

01:14:39.240 --> 01:14:41.700
build space at the
innovation building.

01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:45.798
And they also-- like, Pier 9 is,
like, probably the best maker

01:14:45.798 --> 01:14:46.590
space in the world.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:48.630
And they have
[INAUDIBLE] come in.

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:50.880
For them, they get a
lot of value out of it,

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.460
because these innovators
are testing their software

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:58.380
and pushing it to its
limits and giving them

01:14:58.380 --> 01:14:59.930
ideas for new features.

01:14:59.930 --> 01:15:03.960
Also, when those
startups hit market,

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:06.660
Autodesk really helped
make that possible.

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:08.460
So there's a lot
of benefit to them.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:12.790
And they give these people
working on hard technologies

01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:14.998
a really great working space
to develop their stuff.

01:15:14.998 --> 01:15:17.040
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Chris,
do you want to give us

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.570
a few closing thoughts on this?

01:15:18.570 --> 01:15:19.320
CHRIS: Yeah, sure.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.653
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You had
some very perceptive opening

01:15:21.653 --> 01:15:22.500
comments.

01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:23.000
CHRIS: Cool.

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:23.500
Yeah.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:28.500
So, I think one thing we didn't
really get a chance to touch on

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:34.050
was that climate change and,
like, the whole energy sector

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:37.110
is kind of a different beast
from a lot of different kind

01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:40.860
of sectors, because
the way you evaluate

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:45.645
how "good" a technology is,
is kind of a much longer time

01:15:45.645 --> 01:15:49.590
span than, say, I don't
know, biotech, where you can

01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:52.230
immediately see the impacts.

01:15:52.230 --> 01:15:53.670
I mean, the drug works or not.

01:15:53.670 --> 01:15:54.170
Right?

01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:55.260
You can immediately tell.

01:15:55.260 --> 01:15:58.110
But, for climate change,
sure, you can, I don't know,

01:15:58.110 --> 01:16:01.650
measure carbon emissions year
by year or something like that.

01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:05.250
But then you run the
risk of, policies,

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.710
social mindset, or
whatever, shifting,

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:11.880
once maybe you get on a trend
of seeing some improvement,

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:15.210
and then you might just
shift and completely erase

01:16:15.210 --> 01:16:18.490
what you've done in
the past year or so.

01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.840
So, definitely, the longer time
span makes it more difficult,

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:24.930
not only for funding but
also, like, development,

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:25.920
implementation.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.390
And I think a lot
of these new models,

01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:32.970
like the innovation
orchards, TechBridge,

01:16:32.970 --> 01:16:35.760
these models are
really cool and should

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:38.487
be interesting to see
how they play out.

01:16:38.487 --> 01:16:39.570
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Great.

01:16:39.570 --> 01:16:42.237
Martha, do you want to give us a
thought from MITI's perspective

01:16:42.237 --> 01:16:46.110
about some of these new models?

01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:51.743
MARTHA: So-- well,
I guess that--

01:16:51.743 --> 01:16:53.410
Bill, you kind of
caught me by surprise.

01:16:53.410 --> 01:16:54.120
I've been holding back--

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:54.395
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Sorry.

01:16:54.395 --> 01:16:55.145
MARTHA: That's OK!

01:16:55.145 --> 01:16:57.103
That's all right.

01:16:57.103 --> 01:16:58.770
I think-- well, first
of all, Chris just

01:16:58.770 --> 01:17:00.353
touched on something
really important,

01:17:00.353 --> 01:17:02.880
which is that one of
the big challenges--

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:04.560
and I think I've
mentioned this before--

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:07.140
is that, traditionally,
energy technologies take

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:09.010
decades to get adopted.

01:17:09.010 --> 01:17:12.690
And just the pie chart
on the VCs [LAUGH]

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:17.310
tells you something about
what energy technologies are

01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:19.840
competing against for capital.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:22.440
I guess that this
is a great model,

01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.480
if it could get
replicated, you know,

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.180
and even break through
energy ventures, which

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.530
is a different model.

01:17:28.530 --> 01:17:33.640
I mean, this is an earlier
stage, helping people get past.

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:38.570
It feels like
things move slowly.

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:43.050
And, like everything related
to this whole energy challenge,

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:45.750
we need to kind of
pick up the pace.

01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:47.760
And, Bill, you talked
about the states

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.780
and that there's
different players.

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:50.530
It's challenging.

01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:51.030
Right?

01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:54.150
I mean, the states just
don't have the kind of--

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:56.480
first of all, they compete
against each other.

01:17:56.480 --> 01:17:58.220
They also just don't
have the resources.

01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.970
So we'll see where we end up.

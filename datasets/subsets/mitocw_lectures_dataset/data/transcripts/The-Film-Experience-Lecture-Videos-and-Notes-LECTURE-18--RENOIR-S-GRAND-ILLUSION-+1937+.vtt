00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.960
PROFESSOR: Good evening people.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.710
I place so much emphasis on
Renoir's camera because I

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.490
think it's so
fundamentally expresses

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.390
his sense of experience.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.360
And if you become attentive
to the really quiet and subtle

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.240
ways in which Renoir's camera
is almost always in action,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.980
is a part of the
story in some sense,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.120
you can begin to capture
something of his importance

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.010
in the history of cinema.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.630
Because no director or
apprentice director, whoever

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.550
studied, looked
at Renoir's films

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.980
came away from it the
same, and his influence

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.930
is almost impossible
to fully measure.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.510
there are no
cinematic traditions,

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.380
after Renoir, that haven't,
at least in some degree,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.200
even if not directly, then
indirectly through other people

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.050
who've been influenced
by him have been

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.530
shaped by Renoir's example.

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.340
And I wanted to
give you one more

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.260
instance of Renoir's camera.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.220
This is from a film I've
mentioned, but not shown you.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.520
It's from the last of
his great French films.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.470
Some people, many
people would say it's

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.040
his greatest film, one
of the great masterpieces

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.946
in the history of movies,
the rules of the game.

00:01:40.946 --> 00:01:42.820
The only reason I don't
show it in our course

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.560
is that it's, in many
ways, a more difficult,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.140
a more complex film
then Grand Illusion.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.460
there's a grand clarity, or
simplicity of a certain kind.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.990
not a simplicity of character,
or a vision, or a theme,

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.570
but a simplicity of
intention that becomes clear,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.470
at least after the
fact in Grand Illusion.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.400
It's a more accessible film,
especially for Americans,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.650
I think.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.740
The Rules of The Game,
much more profoundly,

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.030
is a meditation
on the theme that

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.900
is also present
in Grand Illusion,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.200
as you'll see this evening, the
theme of historical transition.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.240
But it's a much more complex
and extended meditation

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.540
on what was happening
to French society

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.610
in this immense
transition that took place

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.570
at the beginning of
the 20th century.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.690
Essentially, it's a
transition, as you'll

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.310
see dramatized in the film
we're showing tonight,

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.760
Grand Illusion,
It's a transition

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.570
from an aristocratic to
a middle class culture.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.930
From an aristocratic
dispensation,

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.140
to a quasi democratic, or
more democratic dispensation.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.470
And this was a topic
which preoccupied

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.210
many directors, Renoir
especially, and is

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.250
a kind of central topic in both
Rules of the Game and Grand

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.030
Illusion.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.250
This scene from
Rules of the Game

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.400
is maybe his least
subtle in some ways.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.240
Or rather, the
subtlety is harder

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.570
to see if you're just
looking at a clip.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.090
The subtlety is involved in
the characters themselves,

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.970
who have already,
in some degree,

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.010
been established in a kind
of individuality, which

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.040
then further expresses itself in
the scene you're going to see.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.190
The basic situation of
the Rules of the Game

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.590
is a classically powerful one.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.050
it's essentially a
weekend of festivities.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.670
A marquee, a grand
figure, presumably who

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.400
owns a remarkable chateau,
invites some friends

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.840
for a weekend of games
and shooting, hunting,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.770
at his great chateau
in the country.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.420
And the film is a kind
of series of tableau,

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.560
or a series of
festivities, all of which

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.029
are cankered, or
damaged in some way.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:19.709
It's as if we have a sense
that each of the festivities

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.680
or festivals that are dramatized
in the Rules of the Game

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.300
are diminished versions of
something that, in the past,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.220
had great authority, power,
and cultural centrality,

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.150
but have become now diminished,
and even parodically reduced

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.440
versions of what they
had been when they were

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.340
part of a coherent culture.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.900
it's almost as if these
festivals and rituals have

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.440
become-- are recognized by the
film, although not necessarily

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.350
by the characters
inside the film,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.290
as vestiges of a time
that has now passed.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.840
And the most dramatic
instance of this subject,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.080
or the embodiment
of this theme, is

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.410
the scene you're going to see.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.330
It's the hunting scene.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.700
And I want you to, sort of,
at least get a sense of it,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.860
not only because it's
an important film

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.430
and I'd like to fix
it in your mind.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.440
Maybe give you a taste
of it so you'll go out

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.800
and look at the film yourself.

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.400
these two films, Grand
Illusion and Rules

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.310
of the Game are certainly
the pinnacle of Renoir's art,

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.520
and people who know
these films deeply

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.770
know something
important about film,

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.270
know something important
about what works of art are.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.846
So I want to see
for that reason.

00:05:31.846 --> 00:05:33.220
But I also want
you to see to get

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.180
one more experience,
outside of Grand Illusion,

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.280
of the way Renoir's
camera behaves.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.030
especially the way it
establishes a relationship

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.460
between character and
ground, between character

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.690
and environment.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:48.370
And here, of course,
the camera's job

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.930
is not only to tell us
something about the relations

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.580
among the characters,
and to show

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.400
us their interactions in as
economically powerful a way as

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.330
possible, but also
to give us a sense

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.300
of this grand ritual gone bad.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.107

the scene that I've shown you
may make the scene seem cruder

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:48.250
than it is.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.520
Virtually all the characters,
faces that you've seen.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.880
most of them, anyway, are
major characters in the film.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.180
And even by this
time in the film,

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.120
you've gotten to know
some of them quite well.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.780
So they've been humanized
and individuated,

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:02.440
and that makes the
brutality, to which they

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.936
are mostly oblivious, of what's
happening even more powerful.

00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:08.310
You don't hate the characters
who are doing the shooting.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:12.400
you know them for the comic,
and damaged, and ambitious,

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.240
and idealistic, and
foolish characters

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:17.690
they've already shown themselves
to be by the time they

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:18.880
get into this scene.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.130
It's almost as if they,
themselves, are also victims

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.470
of this ritual they're part of.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.900
So there's a kind of subtlety
that you can't pick up

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.910
on just watching the clip, that
is present for any audience

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:31.490
member.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.760
But I wanted you to see that
this scene, also in part,

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.270
again, to show you how
powerfully Renoir's camera is

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:44.120
able to create emotional
and intellectual responses

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.840
in the audience, in a way
that is, in some sense,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.870
diametrically opposed
to what we might call

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.931
expressionist directors like
Hitchcock or Eisenstein might

00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:53.430
do.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.940
By manipulating our
attitudes, by constant,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.350
by very rapid editing, and by
giving us high or low angle

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.910
shots that control our emotional
response because of the way

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.250
we're seeing things.

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:09.920
Renoir's strategies
can be just as powerful

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.110
in terms of emotional
and moral reaction,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.960
but Renoir's strategy
is quite different.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.900
Present the evidence, in
some sense, to the audience.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:24.100
Keep the camera at a level
that allows the full action

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.664
to be taken in.

00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:27.080
I hope you realize
that there were

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.960
relatively few
cuts in that scene,

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:32.250
and in most of Renoir's
work the number of edits

00:13:32.250 --> 00:13:35.210
is relatively small compared
to the number of scenes

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:40.290
that are extended, the amount
of long takes that we have.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:43.590
And there are certain
moments in the film where

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.320
he will vary this strategy.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.010
For example, and you
might want to watch

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.520
for this in tonight's
film, there's

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:55.010
one moment in tonight's film,
an interview between two

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:59.720
of the central characters, the
German prison warden played

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:05.260
by Erik Von Stroheim,
and the French aristocrat

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.940
named du Boeldieu, played by
an actor named de Fresnay.

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:14.590
And in this scene between
the German and the Frenchman,

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:16.060
one of the things
we recognize is,

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.540
because they belong to
the aristocratic class,

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.250
they have a lot in common.

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:23.339
They speak English, for example,
because they both know English,

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:25.380
even though one's a German
and one's a Frenchman.

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:28.030
And there is a sense in the
film, a very powerful one

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:31.590
that's established, that they
have, in some sense, a greater

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:37.390
connection to each other than
they have with other soldiers

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.530
in their own armies.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.540
And the film meditates
on these distinctions,

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.780
and especially on this
conundrum of social class,

00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.930
in rather a complex
way as I'll suggest.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:54.110
Well, in the very first
scene between Boeldieu

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:59.830
and Rauffenstein, the
German and the Frenchman,

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:04.120
Renoir uses a fairly standard
procedure, much more common

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.820
to other directors, it's
sometimes called a shot,

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.700
counter shot style.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.750
it's especially common
on American television,

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:13.870
but it's common in the
movies too, in which, when

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.930
you see characters
in conversation,

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.970
you'll get relatively
rapid cutting.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.550
And you look at one face,
then the camera will shift,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:22.050
and you look back
at the other face.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:23.380
They'll be a cut, and
you'll look-- right?

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:25.320
And you'll constantly
shift back and forth,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.980
this shot, counter shot style.

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:31.290
But he, Renoir uses this
kind of style rarely,

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:34.660
because first of all, it
involves the idea of cutting.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.180
It involves the
idea of separation.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.730
Why use shot/ counter
shot, Renoir would say,

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.000
when I can move my camera
like this and show the two

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.624
characters together?

00:15:42.624 --> 00:15:44.040
And move it around
in another way,

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.020
and show the back of one
character's head, and the way

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:46.936
the other is reacting.

00:15:46.936 --> 00:15:48.810
In other words, if
the camera's part

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:51.660
of the action, a fluid
part of the action,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.250
I can show you more about
character, Renoir would say.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.420
But in that particular
scene, he doesn't do it

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.770
in this first
extended interview.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:01.360
It lasts about two
minutes and 45 seconds,

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.360
and it uses 21 shots.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.790
21 separate shots in two
minutes and 45 seconds.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:11.390
For Renoir that's a
tremendous number of edits.

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.280
and it why would he do it there?

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.360
Because it's very unusual
for him to use this shot,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.780
counter shot style in the film.

00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:18.670
Why would he do it?

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.610
He wants to emphasize
their separation,

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.730
their isolation from each other,
their distance from each other.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.850
And there is a later
see in the film,

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:34.650
near the very end of the
film, again between Boeldieu

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.570
and another character.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:39.110
But this one between the
Boeldieu and Marechal,

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:43.230
the French working class figure
who's on the French side,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.660
just before there's
an attempted escape.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:48.730
And that scene is almost
as long, two minutes

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:50.870
and 20 seconds long,
but that scene only

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:53.140
has three separate edits in it.

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:54.220
And you might compare it.

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.950
The farewell scene is
a very obvious one,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:58.370
and you'll recognize
it when you see it.

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.960
and, of course, the
reason is that he

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.340
wants to emphasize,
insofar as it's possible,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.020
that they are together.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.960
He wants to minimize the sense
of isolation in that sequence.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.960
Again, I mention
this because I want

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.010
you to become as
attentive as possible,

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.420
without destroying your
enjoyment of the film,

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.124
to the camera's way of behaving.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.069
to summarize what
I'm trying to say

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.040
about the way the
camera works in Renoir,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.369
I want to remind you that,
even in his darkest films,

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:31.320
his camera work carries an
undercurrent of excitement,

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.290
even sometimes a kind of joy
at the sheer particularness,

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.690
the particularity of the world.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:44.240
you can sense his awareness of
human ambiguity and his wonder

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.530
at the texture of
the visible world

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:52.570
all through his films of
his so-called French period.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:54.410
And especially in
the film you're

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.380
going to see tonight, which is
in many ways in environments

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.180
that are very unpoetic right?

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.110
The entire film takes place
in a series of prison camps.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:06.270
The entire film is about
these French prisoners of war.

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.426
There is an
introduction or prologue

00:18:08.426 --> 00:18:09.800
before they're
captured, and then

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:11.240
after they're
captured we see them

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.950
in a series of prison camps.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.720
it's quite an amazing
experience, in some ways,

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.060
to watch Renoir's
camera discover

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:27.620
the complexity of a world
that seems, on the surface,

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.770
to be so unpromising,
and so uninteresting,

00:18:30.770 --> 00:18:31.970
so lacking in texture.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:39.200
we can think of Renoir's camera
as shy, timid in a sense.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.320
Capable of embarrassment, even.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.790
There's one moment in the
Rules of the Game which partly

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:48.090
involves a force
dimension, so that when

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:54.190
all the guests in the
great estate or castle

00:18:54.190 --> 00:18:55.480
go to sleep at night.

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:58.070
They sort of come
out of their rooms,

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.270
and start changing bed
partners and things like that.

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:02.710
they have various liaisons.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.050
And there's a moment when the
camera is in this long hallway,

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.987
and one of the lovers comes
out to meet another lover,

00:19:08.987 --> 00:19:10.570
and it looks as if
the camera actually

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.540
backs away in embarrassment,
and looks away as if it says,

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.330
oh, that's inappropriate
for me to be looking at.

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.670
The camera is humanized in
a very subtle, quiet way all

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:24.120
the way through Renoir's work.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.150
So we think of his camera
as shy, as embarrassed,

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.555
reluctant to overhear,
or to intrude.

00:19:30.555 --> 00:19:31.930
There are even
moments when it is

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:36.560
distracted, or drawn toward an
apparently irrelevant element.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.630
Times when the camera
hesitates, or even

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:40.750
appears to change its mind.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:43.450
An uncertain camera,
then, always adjusting

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.070
to a world that is, itself,
always shifting and changing.

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:48.900
And of course, that's
the deepest argument

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.860
for why the camera
is so restless.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.550
remember, it's not obtrusive.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:56.290
it's not like to feel the camera
swinging wildly, not at all.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.414
You have to pay attention,
sometimes you won't even

00:19:58.414 --> 00:20:00.640
be aware of the
fact of how quietly

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.380
and simply the camera-- but
it's as if the camera is always

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:04.500
making adjustments.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.680
As if it's always alive to the
changing character of what it's

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:12.340
looking at, and that very
aliveness reminds you

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:14.920
of how complex reality
is, because reality

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.895
itself is always
shifting and changing.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.710
This describes, I
think, something of what

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.660
is meant by Renoir's realism.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.560
But there's a kind of lyric
element, as I've mentioned,

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.290
even a kind of tranquility,
or pleasure, or joy.

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.970
Celebratory impulse in his
camera's gaze that qualifies,

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:40.050
or sweeteners, his realism
of space and character,

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.040
and we need to be
aware of that too.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.230
One way to crystallize
this is to suggest

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.860
that once we become
attuned to the camera's

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.630
forms of attention--
that's a good phrase,

00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:52.349
the camera's forms of attention.

00:20:52.349 --> 00:20:53.890
There's a wonderful
book about poetry

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.290
called forms of attention.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:59.960
Lyric poetry is what constitutes
a special kind of attention.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:04.710
We can say that Renoir's
camera is engaged constantly

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:05.910
in these forms of attention.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:12.380
Once we become aware of that, of
the camera's interest in that,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.000
we become aware of a quiet
continuous struggle, a loving

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.520
contest almost, between the
multiple points of interest

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:24.020
in the scene, and the camera's
reluctant gently hesitant

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.390
choices.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.110
The menu of things
to see and hear,

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:32.850
Renoir's films keep
telling us, is too rich

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:36.510
to be fully captured,
even by the most eye.

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.900
And that's what
I mean when I say

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.670
that visual style
can be understood

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:42.180
as a form of moral style.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:48.880
I want to say a few more words
about Grand Illusion, itself,

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.690
to help frame your
experience of it.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.350
It's not a complex film, but
it's a deep and beautiful one,

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:57.170
and I think you'll all
find it very memorable.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.190
First a word about the actors.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:01.690
or maybe I should
say one other word

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:05.590
about Renoir himself, because
it bears on his actors.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.520
As I implied, or I think,
suggested this afternoon,

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.950
one of the most distinctive
features of Renoir's practice--

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:13.830
if you think about the
way is camera behaves,

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.750
you can see how logically
connected these elements are--

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.790
was that he was an
improvisational director.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.860
He collaborated with his
actors, with this performers.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.610
He didn't come in with an
absolutely fixed script.

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:28.740
he's like the anti-Hitchcock.

00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.420
Hitchcock has solved
all his problems

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.720
before he's come in
to do is shooting,

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.920
Renoir has just begun the
process of making his movie.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.610
he has an idea of
the subject matter,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.960
He knows what he's doing.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.700
I don't mean that he's
working completely blind,

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.260
but he allows
discovery to take place

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:48.100
in the course of the
making of his movies,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.650
and he's very deeply
involved in collaborating

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.780
with this performers.

00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:54.810
So that, for example,
when he had already

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:58.482
begun working on
the movie-- I don't

00:22:58.482 --> 00:23:00.940
think they'd begun shooting it
yet-- but they were very far

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:03.690
along in creating the movie,
and in casting the movie,

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:06.500
when they discovered that
Erich Von Strohein, who

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.960
was that already by the
time this film was made,

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.930
a very well known
actor and director.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.910
Much, in fact, incredibly
admired director

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:22.030
--both an actor and a director,
agreed to join the film.

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:23.680
And when he agreed
to join the film,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.860
he and Renoir began
to collaborate

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.290
on expanding the role
that Von Strohein plays.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:33.840
And you'll understand what an
immensely helpful contribution

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.140
to, what could we call it,
to the ecology of the movie,

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.090
to the sense of the
movie Von Strohein made,

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:44.040
because he's one of the
dominant characters.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.310
if we try to imagine Grand
Illusion with a much reduced

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.270
role for the Von
Strohein character,

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:52.020
it's a much lesser film.

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:56.000
So you can recognize what an
extraordinary contribution Von

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:56.720
Strohein made.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:58.810
Now, he not only
made contributions

00:23:58.810 --> 00:24:01.510
to questions about the dialogue,
what the character would say,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:04.060
expanded the role, but even
made suggestions about how

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.090
the character would look.

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.980
How the character
would be costumed.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.350
I think it was Von Strohein
who emphasized, even more fully

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:15.160
than Renoir had
originally intended,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.460
that the Von Strohein
character is a war casualty.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.200
That he has ram
rod up is back, he

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.820
has to wear gloves because
his hands are horribly burned.

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.510
He's a cripple, and that's why
he's now running prison camps.

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:28.130
Because he's not useful
for anything else, right?

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:33.580
And there's the sense that he's
a damaged, wounded figure even

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:38.460
from the very beginning of the
film, when we first meet him.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.210
So that's important
in itself, but there's

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.640
a second thing
about Von Strohein

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.100
that I want to emphasize to you.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.240
it shows you how
subtly Renoir was

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.740
aware of how he
could utilize all

00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.560
the elements available
to him as a filmmaker.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.410
Von Strohein was especially
well known as an actor,

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.217
for roles in which
he would play--

00:24:56.217 --> 00:24:58.550
this was a special true in
roles he played in the United

00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:04.140
States-- in which he would play
a dangerous, scary martinet.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:07.410
There were even hints of
sadomasochism about the role

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:07.910
sometimes.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:13.620
So he would play brutal
prison camp wardens, right?

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:20.150
brutal police types, militarist
types, violent husbands.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:23.300
And, in fact, he was
understood, also, as a villain.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.660
He often played roles that
were recognizably evil roles.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.330
He came to be known as
the man you love to hate.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:35.240
That was like a sort of motto
that was attached to his name.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.259
And, when you want
your Grand Illusion,

00:25:37.259 --> 00:25:39.050
one of the things I
hope you'll think about

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:44.595
is the complex way in which
that inherited idea of the Von

00:25:44.595 --> 00:25:47.860
Strohein character is
complicated, undermined,

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:48.990
and humanized.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.090
Because, in many ways, he still
is the villain in the piece,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.230
but he's a humanized villain.

00:25:54.230 --> 00:26:00.740
he becomes a complex character,
as much a victim of history

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:03.480
as any of the other
characters in the film.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.630
So there's a sense in which,
what Renoir and Von Strohein,

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:11.505
together, are doing is
taking the persona that Von

00:26:11.505 --> 00:26:14.860
Strohein had established, and
undercutting it, undermining it

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.240
in some slight way, creating
a much greater resonance

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.440
for the character, exactly
because of the ways in which he

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.400
first that appears to fulfill
the expectations that he's

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.350
an evil villain, and
then as the film goes on,

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.700
this sense is
undermined, complicated,

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:35.290
and you realize he's a
human being with powers

00:26:35.290 --> 00:26:39.340
of generosity, although
also certain limitations.

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.280
he's a German, he's
prejudiced, he doesn't really

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.960
like the French,
especially doesn't

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:48.640
like working class people, most
especially doesn't like Jews.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:50.470
he's an imperfect
character, but you

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.400
see this he's deeply humanized.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.030
And something of the
same kind of thing

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:58.610
happens in the film's treatment
of the Jean Gabin character.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.590
He's the character who plays
Marechal, the actor who

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:05.370
plays Marechal, the working
class Frenchman who,

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:14.680
along with de Boeldieu and
the Jew played by Dalio,

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.560
a character called Rosenthal.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:19.330
These three are the
central French characters,

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:21.710
and we see them moving from
prison camp to prison camp

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:23.270
through the film.

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.970
that group is the central
group of the film.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.530
We follow them as
the film goes on.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:32.530
The Gabin character too, was,
in many ways, the most famous

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:36.050
actor, if not in Europe,
certainly and France

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:38.130
of the late '20s and '30s.

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:40.200
major, major figure.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.960
and he was especially associated
with working class roles.

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:44.460
,

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.040
And, most especially
associated with roles--

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.220
he was like an early
Jack Nicholson.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.320
An even more powerful version
of it, because he became famous

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.180
for these moments
in the films when

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:56.950
he would go nuts, when he would
have a fit, when he would start

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:59.370
screaming, or he would lose it.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:03.220
He would rant or rave.

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.590
In some films he was in he would
have a climactic scene-- this

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:10.490
may be, in fact, where
the stereotype began-- he

00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.810
would have a climactic scene.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.790
Often he would be a suicidal
proletarian, a suicidal worker

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:19.340
up against the
forces of capitalism,

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.950
or the forces of the police.

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:22.880
The Gabin character
had frequent roles

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.630
like this, in which
he would essentially

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:30.070
lose all rational control,
and rant, and rave,

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.010
and scream, sometimes die.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.880
he was so famous
for this, and this

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.120
was such a fundamental
part of his persona,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.560
that he had written into
most of his contracts

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.726
that he had to have a
scene which he did this.

00:28:42.726 --> 00:28:44.100
He had to have at
least one scene

00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:45.840
in the film in which
he sort of went

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.960
Cucamonga, in which he lost it.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.570
Now, one of the most subtle
things about this film

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.240
is, there is such a
moment in this film.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.470
Watch for it, because
it's so quiet compared

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.690
to what you might expect,
that you might miss it.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:58.990
But it's really there.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:02.130
And in fact, the way in which
it both fulfills, but also

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.900
undermines, our expectations
about this character,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.650
again, tells us
something about the way

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.210
in which Renoir and his
collaborating actors

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:16.810
were able to create
immensely nuanced meanings,

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:21.060
possibilities, out
on the raw material,

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:22.650
not only of the
story of the film,

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.316
and of the setting
of the film, but even

00:29:24.316 --> 00:29:27.630
the past history
of the performers.

00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:29.350
I want to say just
a couple of things

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:32.290
about some of the
dominant themes

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.000
in the film to help organize
your experience of it.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.390
And I'm borrowing
here, or deeply

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:42.280
influenced here, by
two critics especially,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.880
or perhaps I should
say parenthetically.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.930
You should probably assume
that almost anything I say

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:52.850
has been said by someone else
at some time in the past.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:55.080
the job of a teacher,
as I conceive it,

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.890
is not to come up with totally
original arguments every time,

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.660
because no one
can be so original

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.300
as to say everything
that's wonderful

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:04.210
about particular texts, or
about a whole phenomenon

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.420
like the movies.

00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.010
So a good teacher draws on that.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:11.550
When I really am drawing
on a prior scholar, who

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:14.740
I know has shaped the
arguments I'm making,

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.270
or has given me the
categories I'm using,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:18.594
I mention them by name.

00:30:18.594 --> 00:30:20.510
But, of course, I've
been teaching for so long

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:24.480
that much of this must not
be unconsciously absorbed

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.760
into my psyche, and I
don't always know this,

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.932
so I'm not saying that
those moments where

00:30:28.932 --> 00:30:30.390
I haven't made this
acknowledgement

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.870
are free of such influence.

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:32.900
Quite the opposite.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:35.490
But I do want to mention two
scholars who have especially

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:40.730
influenced me on Renoir, because
virtually all the things I've

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:43.550
told you about Renoir, though
I've made the ideas my own,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:44.700
come from these.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.590
One is a Frenchman named
Alexander Sesonske.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.890
And he wrote a wonderful book,
I think a several volume book,

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:57.760
on Renoir that taught me a
tremendous amount, especially

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:59.870
about his French period.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:05.480
And the other is the,
now California scholar,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.520
Leo Braudy, one of
whose essays I've asked

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.930
you to read in this course.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.830
He's written a wonderful
book on Renoir.

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.430
And, although I
have read the book,

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:17.010
I learned more about Renoir
from Braudy in conversation,

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:19.940
because he was my colleague many
years ago when we were teaching

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.830
together in the English
department at Yale,

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.640
and he's one of the
people who turned me

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:27.180
into a person interested and
movies, interested in film.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.650
So, Leo Braudy, B-R-A-U-D-Y,
Alexander Sesonske,

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:39.700
S-E-S-O-N-S-K-E, the two
principal scholars and critics

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.020
behind what I've been saying,
both this afternoon and this

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.770
evening.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.000
Dominant themes.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.610
One.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.750
The prison camp as a microcosm.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.730
There's a wonderful
passage, at one point

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.990
in the movie, where one of
the character's said "everyone

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:58.860
would die of the
disease of his class,

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.820
if the war did not
reconcile all microbes".

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.970
think about the
implications of that.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.120
the idea is that one of the
things that makes this prison

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.890
camp such a fascinating place
is that it is, in some sense,

00:32:12.890 --> 00:32:16.600
a microcosm of the larger world.

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:19.540
and especially if you
think of the prison camp

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.400
beyond just the grouping
of the French soldiers,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.870
the French prisoners
who we follow primarily,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.620
what you can recognize if you
back away, because we are told

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:32.080
about, or we meet, and
we see briefly some

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.520
of the other prisoners.

00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.550
There are Russian prisoners
and there's other kinds

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:39.730
of prisoners as well.

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:43.400
There's a sense that the prison
camp is a kind of microcosm,

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.430
at least of Europe, if not
of the world as a whole.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:49.730
And, more specifically, the
way in which the prison camp

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.820
is a microcosm for
the social striations

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:54.940
that organize outer society.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.610
There's a working class, there
seems to be a middle class,

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:01.690
you'll notice that
there's a scholar who

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:08.660
has a copy of Pindar, the great
ancient poet, who treasures

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.230
his work on Pindar-- he's one
of my favorite minor characters

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:12.840
in the film because
of his commitment

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.510
to literature despite the
war, and despite the miseries

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.140
of prison camp.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.470
And what you can see
is, in a certain sense,

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:24.580
that Renoir is delighted by the
idea that a kind of microcosm

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.360
is created.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:29.120
And if you watch the variations
amongst the Frenchmen,

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.050
and again, if you think about
that fragment of a scene I

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.660
showed you this afternoon,
of these characters at dinner

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:38.310
table in the in the
prison camp, you'll

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:43.070
begin to see more fully how
powerfully and interestingly,

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.925
complexly, he differentiates
his characters from each other.

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:48.300
Now That fragment
that you saw, I

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.780
hope you realized one of
the characters was an actor.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.880
It becomes clearer if you
watch the whole scene,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.640
but he's a very histrionic
and theatrical character,

00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.769
he bursts into song
all the time, right?

00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:00.310
And then there's
the aristocrat who's

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:04.360
looking down his monocle
very, very austerely

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:11.360
and his lip seems curled
in a permanent gesture

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:13.420
of condescension.

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.520
And so forth.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.300
Watch how richly, how
complexly, the characters are

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.969
distinguished from each
other by social class,

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.630
by profession, and so forth.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.070
I don't want to romanticize
or idealize this argument,

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:28.570
because I'm not
suggesting that when

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:30.800
he says it's a
microcosm of the world,

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.850
he wants to celebrate
that microcosm,

00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:35.070
although he's interested in it.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.690
Renoir is also aware
of the limitations.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.639
it's not as if he's
suggesting that this

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.600
is a perfect community at all.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.630
One reason is, they're
forced together,

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:45.960
but they're being
forced together

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.428
makes them share,
forces them to come out

00:34:48.428 --> 00:34:49.969
of their limitations
in certain ways,

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:52.280
to overcome certain
of their prejudices,

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.900
although night never fully.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.100
But what it also
does is reveal them.

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:59.960
And we can and we can
see how both processes--

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:04.310
the process of adjusting to
people different from yourself,

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.450
and maybe overcoming
some of your class

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:10.110
or racial prejudices-- is
a part of the experience

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.730
that the characters
in the film have,

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:12.900
but another part
of the experience

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:15.670
is that they come up against the
differences between them, some

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:17.670
of which can never be breached.

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:21.720
Let me mention one scene which
dramatizes this ambiguity very

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.580
deeply.

00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:27.510
There's one moment in the film,
very powerful moment I think,

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:31.750
in which the character
played by Gabin,

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:33.480
the Marechal
character is wounded

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.050
in a early part of the film.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:38.870
in fact, in the dinner
scene that I showed you

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.720
this afternoon, you'll see
that, at a certain point,

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:44.310
his comrade sitting at the
table cuts his meat for him

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.920
because his hand is injured.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.640
And, I don't know if it's in
this scene or subsequent scene,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:50.940
there's a moment when
another character in the film

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.540
washes Marechal's feet.

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.790
Why is foot washing
instantly a symbolic thing?

00:35:57.790 --> 00:35:59.336
Who knows the answer?

00:35:59.336 --> 00:36:01.320
AUDIENCE: Cause, like,
Mary washed Jesus' feet.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.195
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:36:02.195 --> 00:36:06.040
There's a scene in the Bible,
in the 12th chapter of John,

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.400
in which Mary or Martha,
I can't remember which,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.050
washes Christ's feet.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.690
And then, in the
very next chapter,

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.050
at The Last Supper
Christ, himself,

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.390
washes the feet
of his disciples.

00:36:19.390 --> 00:36:23.830
And in fact, the washing
of feet is, in Catholic

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:27.340
and in certain other
Christian rituals,

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.181
an actual official ritual.

00:36:29.181 --> 00:36:31.180
It used to be much more
common than it is today,

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:34.800
but it's still done in
certain Catholic countries

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:38.720
at the advent of Holy Week.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.550
so it's a deeply symbolic act
in which Christ, himself, is

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.580
washing the feet
of his disciples,

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:45.760
and the message he
gives is everyone,

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.100
you should now do
this to your Fellows.

00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.930
The implication being no one
is better than anyone else.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:58.760
a radically democratic invasion,
in some sense, of God's love.

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:02.190
And where has this practice been
recently, very dramatically,

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.310
and publicly revived?

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:04.860
Who's been doing it?

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.240
The Pope, the new pope.

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.680
Haven't you read about this?

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.920
The new pope has been
doing this, washing

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.940
the feet of parishioners,
a symbolic gesture in which

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.470
God's emissary on
earth is behaving

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:21.740
with the humility that
Jesus Christ, himself would.

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:28.790
So the foot washing scene in our
film has this sort of resonance

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:32.220
to it, even though there's no
openly religious reference.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.400
but it has a similar
kind of significance.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:37.440
And they are carrying on
a kind of conversation

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.970
as the feet are being washed.

00:37:38.970 --> 00:37:43.186
And what you feel is,
boy, what a moving scene.

00:37:43.186 --> 00:37:44.810
the man who's doing
the washing doesn't

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.970
feel that he's being
condescended to,

00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:49.852
or that he's being diminished
in any way by doing it.

00:37:49.852 --> 00:37:51.310
The man whose feet
are being washed

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.070
is not embarrassed
to have it happen.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.060
What a scene of
solidarity and community.

00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:00.780
And you could wax
very poetic about what

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.820
a scene of community, and
yet, watch how the scene ends.

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:09.900
There's a moment at which,
as he's drying his feet,

00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.125
Marechal asks the foot washer,
what do you do for a living?

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:15.750
at some point during
their conversation

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:20.570
he says I am a cadastre.

00:38:20.570 --> 00:38:22.710
What that means is something
like city planning.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:24.020
He's a city planner.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:26.730
And so the Marechal character
hears this and they go on,

00:38:26.730 --> 00:38:28.899
at the very end of
the scene, Marechal

00:38:28.899 --> 00:38:30.440
turns to his foot
washer and he says,

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.030
what does that mean, cadastre?

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:35.320
The implication being
that they're vocabularies

00:38:35.320 --> 00:38:36.830
aren't even the same.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.114
what it dramatizes is the
distance between them.

00:38:39.114 --> 00:38:41.530
He's been sitting there having
this conversation with him,

00:38:41.530 --> 00:38:42.946
but he didn't even
say, gee I have

00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:44.720
no idea what that word
means, I certainly

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.440
have no idea what
you do for a living.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:49.260
It's a way of reminding us,
yes they've come together,

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.550
yes they're sharing
space, yes they're

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:56.070
doing something that
dramatizes human solidarity,

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:58.440
and yet also how
separated they are.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.000
Again and again in
the film we have

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:05.390
this sort of double experience,
in which we see characters

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:08.540
make contact with each other, or
even sacrifice for each other,

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.370
and at the same time we're
aware of their differences.

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.060
Watch for this.

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.510
It's very powerful and moving.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.990
It's a form of moral realism,
in which the film refuses

00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:21.450
to simplify what it wants to
say about human experience.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.980
Very powerful example of
this in the relationship

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:27.410
between the Jew, Rosenthal,
who's proud of his wealth,

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:30.390
he's the heir of a
department store fortune.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.960
but because he's a Jew, and
because he's nouveau rich,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.340
he can never be part
of the aristocracy,

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:40.110
his relation to the Marechal
character's very complex.

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:42.240
Marechal, as I mentioned
this afternoon,

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.420
retains a kind of French
working class characteristic

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.590
antisemitism.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.650
And there are moments
when you can feel

00:39:49.650 --> 00:39:51.260
the hostility between them.

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.509
When the two of them finally
try to make an escape

00:39:53.509 --> 00:39:55.300
from the prison, and
they actually are away

00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:56.800
from one of the
prisons for a while,

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.810
and you see the Rosenthal
character hurts his foot.

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:01.900
And there's a moment in
which it looks like, gee,

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.190
if the Marechal
character stays with him,

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:06.120
he's putting himself
in danger as well.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.790
And they get into a fight.

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.900
And Rosenthal says, go
away, leave me alone!

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.782
And Marechal says,
all right I will!

00:40:13.782 --> 00:40:15.490
it's a very wonderful
scene, because they

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:17.140
start singing at each other.

00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:19.180
it's a form of
singing hostility.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.950
So there's a comic
dimension to it.

00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:21.940
it's really rich.

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.880
But what is also
being dramatized

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:27.570
there are the limitations
of the characters.

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:31.350
Marechal's antisemitism
rises, comes to the surface.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:32.850
Their hostility
toward each other

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:34.350
comes to the surface
at that moment,

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:36.310
although of course,
they also overcome it.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:39.140
And there are many other
such moments in the film.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:41.160
The relationship
between de Boeldieu

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:48.140
and his German counterpart,
the aristocratic German,

00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:52.090
is also a version of
this kind of thing.

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.580
as I've already implied,
a second central theme

00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:56.540
of the film has to
do with what we might

00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:59.550
call barriers and boundaries.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.310
There's the barrier
of social class,

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:02.730
which I've mentioned already.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.930
There's the barrier of
language and culture, right?

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:08.650
The Germans and the
French are at war.

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:11.160
The Russians don't speak the
same language as the Germans,

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.150
the English don't speak the
same language as the French.

00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:18.150
again and again what separates
people is dramatized for us,

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:20.640
although there's also a
longing the film to transcend

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.970
these boundaries, they
can't always be transcended.

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:25.670
Sometimes these
boundaries are shown

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:31.145
to be foolish and trivial,
or at best, unhelpful.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.080
there are many examples in
the film, both of language

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:40.330
and of geography, as
well as of social class,

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:43.002
but let me mention
just two of them,

00:41:43.002 --> 00:41:44.710
There's one wonderful
moment in the film.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:47.126
The French prisoners have been
digging a tunnel, an escape

00:41:47.126 --> 00:41:48.180
tunnel.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.860
And they've almost
completed the tunnel

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.130
when the Germans come
and say, all right we're

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.171
moving you out of your
barracks and we're putting

00:41:53.171 --> 00:41:55.470
these English prisoners in.

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:57.500
and so the French are
very unhappy about this,

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.416
because they've almost
completed their tunnel.

00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.040
So, at great danger to
himself, the Marechal character

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:06.400
breaks ranks, does
a kind of trick

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.820
where he drops a
suitcase, I think,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.660
and he bends over to try to pick
it up to give them an excuse

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.880
to talk to the English prisoners
who are going to change places

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:15.457
with him.

00:42:15.457 --> 00:42:17.040
He wants to tell me
English prisoners,

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.327
there's a m you could escape.

00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:21.660
But it turns out he's not
able to give them the message,

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:23.710
because the English
don't understand French

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:25.780
and he can't speak English.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.795
So the English Prisoners
end up going into the--

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:29.170
without ever
knowing that there's

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.860
a tunnel waiting for them that's
almost ready to be completed.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:37.290
An example of the
barrier, the way language

00:42:37.290 --> 00:42:39.480
separates people,
that in many ways

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.630
can be said to be frustrating.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:42.420
One more example.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.920
At the very end of
the film, there's

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.405
a moment when the two
characters, Marechal

00:42:47.405 --> 00:42:50.690
and Rosenthal are making their
escape across a great field,

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:52.850
a great white field of snow.

00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:55.830
And they're running across the
field, and the camera backs up,

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.860
and we see them being
watched by German soldiers.

00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:00.510
One of the soldiers
picks up his rifle,

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:01.884
he says they're
making an escape,

00:43:01.884 --> 00:43:03.160
and starts to aim at them.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.430
Then, all of a sudden, he stops.

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:07.680
watch for that how it happens.

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.763
I think his partner says,
wait a minute, hold off.

00:43:09.763 --> 00:43:10.810
Why doesn't he shoot?

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:14.250
And then we see Marechal
and Rosenthal disappear

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.990
across an invisible boundary,
and the German says, well

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.220
they've crossed the border.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.740
They're no longer in
Germany, I can't shoot them,

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:24.016
they're now in Belgium.

00:43:24.016 --> 00:43:26.390
But the fact is there's no
boundary there, it's all snow.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.120
It's a snowy field.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.130
How arbitrary that boundary is.

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.870
But again and again the
film we have this theme

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.390
of barriers and boundaries.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.240
What separates us?

00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:39.380
And also, one last thing about
the question of social class.

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.040
Maybe the most
disturbing and powerful

00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:44.970
insight that the film has
about social class, one

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:47.010
that Americans tend to resist.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:48.986
But I encourage you
not to resist it.

00:43:48.986 --> 00:43:50.610
Those of you not from
the United States

00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:52.465
will, perhaps, understand
this more easily,

00:43:52.465 --> 00:43:55.090
although Americans
need to understand it,

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.180
is the extent to which
one's social class

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.240
shapes one's identity.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.530
That is to say, one of the
things we feel in this film

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.930
is that de Boeldieu's nature
is a function of his having

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.300
been raised as an aristocrat.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.800
There are wonderful
scenes between de Boeldieu

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.860
and Marechal, where
Marechal says to him,

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:12.970
there's a wall between us.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:16.090
And you're so undemonstrative.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:18.550
Marechal doesn't trust
him because he belongs

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:21.780
to a different class,
even though, of course,

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:23.010
they're Frenchmen after all.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:27.760
And in the end, nationality
trumps class in this film,

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.030
as you'll see.

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:34.090
But in this sort of distinction
or difference between Marechal

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:38.510
and de Boeldieu, we have another
expression of this sense,

00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:41.740
of this idea, of this
recognition that one's

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:45.720
personality, itself, what
one likes and dislikes,

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.510
ones fundamental
nature is in part

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:51.390
shaped by the class
into which one is born.

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:53.430
We're not born utterly free.

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.820
We don't have absolute
choice in what we become.

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.950
Our characters are
shaped, controlled,

00:44:59.950 --> 00:45:02.990
by the circumstances
in which we live,

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:05.490
and the film profoundly
understands that.

00:45:05.490 --> 00:45:08.890
It understands our desire
to breach those limitations,

00:45:08.890 --> 00:45:11.660
to go beyond them, and
it celebrates our impulse

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:12.530
to do so.

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:14.700
But it also
recognizes the degree

00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:19.280
to which we remain confined
within personalities that

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.970
are partly controlled
or shaped by forces far

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:25.070
beyond our individual control,
and that are especially

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:28.570
located in the social
class to which we belong.

00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:30.780
Finally, as I mentioned
this afternoon,

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.700
the theme of
historical transition

00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.220
is at the heart of
this remarkable film.

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:38.180
And you'll understand very
clearly what is going on there.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:40.890
Again, dramatized
even more complexly

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:46.180
and fully in Rules of the Game,
it's a central topic here.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.260
aristocratic traditions
are giving way

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.930
to modernity in this film.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:52.820
And we're aware of them
in all kinds of ways.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.890
Even in the nostalgic
way in which

00:45:54.890 --> 00:46:01.070
de Boeldieu and Rauffenstein
carry on their conversations.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:04.070
they have experiences in
common because they belong

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:08.740
to the aristocracy, a class
that transcended, in some sense,

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.010
at least in part,
transcended national origins.

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:16.570
That aristocratic
dispensation is disappearing.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:20.160
In fact, this first World War
completely obliterated it,

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:22.140
and Renoir's not the
only one who said this.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.860
apart from
scholarship, there are

00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.860
a number of wonderful
novels, for example,

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:31.660
that deal with
the transformation

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.120
of European society because
of the First World War,

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.300
and Renoir's film
is one such text.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.760
Renoir's maturity.

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.220
This is another way of
talking about the complexity,

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:50.640
or the richness of his films.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.430
I simply want to
remind you, at the end,

00:46:52.430 --> 00:46:55.470
that one way to think
about what Renoir is doing

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:59.300
is to recognize that
his visual style is,

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.550
in some sense, an embodiment of
the ambition not to simplify.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:08.240
To be as fluid and as
attentive to the world

00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.610
as it's possible to be.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:13.780
And one could say
that that visual,

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.890
that commitment to the way the
camera acts toward the world,

00:47:16.890 --> 00:47:21.640
is a version of a larger kind
of maturity or complexity

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.340
that's revealed in the
content of his work, as well.

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.340
Take the characters.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:27.680
I've already mentioned
the key point here.

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.470
The way in which
the characters are

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.450
both flawed, full of
weaknesses, but also

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.090
attractive in certain ways.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.660
The way in which a
Rosenthal is marred

00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:39.970
by his pride in his
family's wealth.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:41.880
The way in which
the Gabin character

00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:45.340
is marred by his antisemitism
and his lack of education.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.490
The way in which the
de Boeldieu character

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:51.680
is damaged, or limited,
by his aristocratic

00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:56.390
reserve, and his impulse
toward a kind of condescending

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:59.300
superiority, which you
could see articulated

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.910
in the very first
moment you see him,

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:02.590
at the very beginning
of the film, where

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:07.720
he's tsk tsking about the
incompetence of his own troops.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.490
So there's a
complexity of character

00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:12.590
that reflects the maturity
of the film's vision of life,

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.120
and there's a complexity in
the story, because think of it

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.840
for a minute.

00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:18.719
This is a war story, but it's
a war story without battles.

00:48:18.719 --> 00:48:20.510
Some people have said
it's the happiest war

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:21.860
story they ever saw.

00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.390
One way of organizing
the film is

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:27.140
to see it as a series of
meals, in which character

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.730
sit down at table and
share convivial thoughts.

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:32.760
It's not a sufficient
way of thinking about it,

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.530
but it's a partial way
of thinking about it.

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:38.860
so, although it's
as film about war,

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:41.920
about the consequences of
war, it doesn't show shooting.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.340
And in fact, although
it's a war story,

00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:49.070
it's about most deeply, human
community and human solidarity,

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:52.030
and about historical transition.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:54.860
Well, one way to crystallize
all of this, or to summarize it,

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.840
is to remind you of the
complexity of the title-- Grand

00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:00.010
Illusion.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:01.760
the title seems to
me to have at least

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.910
four separate implications,
or four separate ways

00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:07.575
of understanding.

00:49:07.575 --> 00:49:09.780
It's a measure of what
I've called multiplicity,

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:11.550
or complexity.

00:49:11.550 --> 00:49:13.360
what would the title mean?

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.380
What is the grand illusion
to which the title refers?

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:18.660
Well, one is surely this.

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:21.620
Remember, the film was made
on the eve of World War II

00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.680
even though it is ostensibly
set in World War I.

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:28.010
And, in fact, it was
recognized as an anti-war film.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.820
It was banned in
Germany and in Italy.

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.570
President Roosevelt
in the United States

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.200
said anyone who loves
freedom should see this film.

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.780
I think he was right.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:39.280
The Title.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.610
One of the things about that
war, that first World War, some

00:49:42.610 --> 00:49:44.760
of you will know, was it
was identified especially

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.620
by the American President
Woodrow Wilson as the war

00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:49.450
to end wars.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.780
So one deep grand,
but horrible, illusion

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.530
is that this is the
war to end wars.

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:58.280
That there won't be anymore
wars after this one.

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.430
A second possible meaning
of the title is this.

00:50:01.430 --> 00:50:04.300
one of the central events in the
film, I haven't mentioned yet,

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:07.860
and it's, maybe, the most
memorable interlude in the film

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.590
is, after Marechal and
Rosenthal make their escape

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:14.180
from one of the prison
camps, they're on the run.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.110
They're in Germany, and
it's the middle of winter.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:21.800
And they managed to
find safety in the home

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:27.070
of a German woman whose husband
is away at the war, perhaps

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:27.570
dead.

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:30.990
And she is there
trying to manage a farm

00:50:30.990 --> 00:50:36.430
with her young daughter Elsa,
and Marechal and Rosenthal

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:41.550
spend the winter with them,
and it's an idle in the winter.

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:42.410
It's very moving.

00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:45.300
And, again, the barriers of
language are present there.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.070
At the very end of
their idle in the woods,

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:52.360
we have Marechal say to the
child, --I called her Elsa,

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.570
I think it's Lottie.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:51:00.320
He looks at the girl and, in
bad German, he says [GERMAN].

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.702
He says blue eyes.

00:51:01.702 --> 00:51:03.410
But he's very proud
of himself for having

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.470
been able to articulate
two German words.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:07.500
But the fact that he's
done that is a mark

00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:09.242
of his having reached out.

00:51:09.242 --> 00:51:11.200
And the implication, more
than the implication,

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:15.360
is he becomes the woman's lover.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.950
while they are what
while they spend

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:20.300
the winter in this way--
and the German woman,

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:24.700
at a certain point, when they
first take refuge in her place,

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.215
a German soldier searching for
these guys, comes to the door,

00:51:28.215 --> 00:51:30.090
comes to the window and
speaks to the window.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.970
And the widow protects them.

00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.887
So a second grand
illusion may very well

00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:36.470
be, look, this is a
very lovely story,

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.700
but how believable is it?

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.340
French soldiers on the
run from a prison camp

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.470
find a farmhouse in which
a German widow takes them

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:49.110
in and protects them
from the German soldiers.

00:51:49.110 --> 00:51:51.740
It's a nice story, but
is it a grand illu--

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:54.970
if it is an illusion, maybe it's
a grand one, a wonderful one.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.760
Not just a large one,
but a valuable one.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:03.680
So that's a second way in which
the title resonates for me.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:05.490
The third grand
illusion has to do

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:08.220
with the community of the
prisoners, the solidarity

00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:11.450
and community that's dramatized
in the film in the end.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.341
The de Boeldieu character
sacrifices himself

00:52:14.341 --> 00:52:15.840
for the good of the
other, something

00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:18.860
that we might find surprising
at first, given his distance

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:21.720
from the other characters.

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.840
and there is a sense all
the way through the film,

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.890
that a kind of
community or solidarity

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:28.800
has been established
amongst the men,

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.610
especially amongst
the Frenchmen.

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:35.240
And especially that a kind of
friendship between Rosenthal

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:38.070
and Marechal has been forged.

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.700
Well, again, maybe
that's a grand illusion.

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.030
The idea that you can
transcend social class,

00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:47.530
that you can transcend the
ethnic prejudices into which

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:54.570
you were born, and with which
you've been brainwashed.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:57.490
So that's another kind of
potential grand illusion.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:53:00.380
And then finally, the
fourth example I would give.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:02.470
the fourth nuance
that one could add

00:53:02.470 --> 00:53:05.930
to the title, the grand
illusion of movies themselves.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.030
What are movies but
grand illusions, right?

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.970
They're two dimensional,
not three dimensional,

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:13.860
but when we watch
them we feel we've

00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.740
entered into a real world.

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:18.530
The grand illusion
of movies themselves

00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:21.800
is part of what the
title alludes to.

00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:24.180
Well, something of the
complexity and maturity

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.070
of Renoir's vision
of experience,

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:30.760
sense of human character,
and sense of history

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.660
is embodied, then,
in the complexity

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.070
of the title of his movie.

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:07.390
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.950
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.260
We've been talking about
antidifferentiation

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.980
or integration by substitution
and also by a method

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.670
that Professor Jerison
called "advanced guessing".

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.300
So I have a few problems
up on the board behind me.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.770
Three antiderivatives
for you to compute.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.290
So the first one is e to the 2x
times cosine of the quantity 1

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.550
minus e to the 2x dx.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:37.080
The second one is 4x times the
quantity 5 x squared minus 1

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.240
raised to the 1/3 power.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.040
And the third one
is tan of x dx.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.980
So why that you
spend a few minutes,

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.300
try to compute those
antiderivatives yourself,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.140
come back and we
can see how you did.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.640
All right, so welcome back.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.470
We have these three
antiderivative,

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.140
so let's take them in order.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.870
So this first one that I wrote
is the antiderivative of e

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.250
to the 2x times cosine
of the quantity 1

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.240
minus e to the 2x dx.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.060
So this problem seems to
me like a good candidate

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.280
for a substitution.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.100
So we have this clear sort of
nested function thing going on.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.360
We have cosine of 1
minus e to the 2x.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.120
And then out front
we have something

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.840
that looks a lot like the
derivative of this 1 minus

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.720
e to the 2x.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.080
So I'm going to try this
with substitution then.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.510
And I think there are,
you know, a few choices

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.220
of substitution
but a natural one

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.540
is to sort of find the most
complicated inside piece.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.485
So in this case, that's
this whole thing, 1 minus e

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.500
to the 2x.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.730
So I'm going to take,
for my substitution,

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.620
I'm going to take u equals
1 minus e to the 2x.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:09.570
And so that means du is equal
to minus 2 e to the 2x dx.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.090
OK, so that's my substitution.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.860
And when I put my substitution
into this integral,

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.720
what do I get?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.520
Well, so I have
cosine of 1 minus e

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.890
to the 2x just
becomes cosine of u.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.610
Now e to the 2x dx, that's very,
very close to this du here.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.330
So what's different is
that here I have a minus 2.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.070
So actually e to the 2x dx
is du divided by minus 2.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.890
So this is cosine u times
du divided by minus 2.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.920
Now another way to
get to this point

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.560
is you could solve
this equation for dx

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.550
and substitute it in and also
solve this equation for e

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.990
to the 2x and substitute
it in and things

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.120
should work out more or less
the same if you try that out.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.869
So actually you won't
even need to make

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:09.910
that second substitution.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.770
You'll just get some
nice cancellation there.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.450
It's even simpler
than what I just said.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.450
OK, so we do this
antiderivative,

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.840
we've made this substitution.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.250
So now we have just
the antiderivative

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:20.980
of a cosine function.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.480
All right, well
that's not that bad.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.540
Because we know that the
derivative of sine is cosine.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.450
So the antiderivative
of cosine is sine.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.010
So this is equal to-- so that
minus 2, that 1 over minus 2

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.130
is just going to stick around.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.766
So it's 1 over minus 2 sine of
u plus a constant of course,

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:41.890
plus an arbitrary constant.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.170
And OK, and so, but my
original function was

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.760
in terms of x, so I want
to bring everything back

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.990
in terms of x.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.460
And so I need to substitute
back in, get rid of u

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.420
and replace it with x.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.300
So here that's a--
I'll just go back

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.600
to what my substitution was and
I replace all my u's with it.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:09.670
So this is minus 1/2
sine the quantity 1 minus

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.250
e to the 2x plus a constant.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.750
All right, so this
is the antiderivative

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.980
of this first expression here.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.120
OK, so now, how
about the second one?

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.310
So the second one, we could
also do it with a substitution.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.570
This is also sort of a prime
suspect for advanced guessing.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.097
So we see here that we have
some, this polynomial raised

00:04:39.097 --> 00:04:39.680
to some power.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.750
So this is 5 x squared
minus 1 to the 1/3.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.585
So how can we get from a
derivative, something like 5

00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:48.890
x squared minus 1
quantity to the 1/3?

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:53.390
Well if you started off with
5 x squared minus 1 to the 4/3

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.250
and took a derivative, you would
have this 5 x squared minus 1

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.500
to the 1/3 coming out.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.750
And you would also have some
stuff coming out in front

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.620
by the chain rule.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.990
Well what kind of stuff?

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.450
Well you know, it would
be some derivative

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.070
of this quadratic
polynomial, which would

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.270
be some linear polynomial.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.860
And indeed, that kind of
matches what we have out front.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:21.170
So a good guess for
advanced guessing,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.770
is that we can look at-- so d
over dx of 5x squared minus 1,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.100
quantity, to the 4/3.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.840
So OK, so this derivative we
can compute by the chain rule.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:45.712
So this is 4/3 times 5 x squared
minus 1 to the 1/3 times-- OK,

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:47.170
so now I need to
do the chain rule,

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.110
I need to take the
derivative of the inside.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.220
Well that's-- OK, so the minus
1 gets killed by the derivative,

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.020
so 5 x squared,
that becomes 10x.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:05.790
So I can rewrite this
as 40x over 3 times 5 x

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.960
squared minus 1 to the 1/3.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.250
So this looks very
much like the thing

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.846
that we were interested in.

00:06:13.846 --> 00:06:13.862
Right?

00:06:13.862 --> 00:06:13.942
We were where'd it go?

00:06:13.942 --> 00:06:14.566
Oh, here it is.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.340
And the thing we were
trying to antidifferentiate.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.960
So the difference is just
this constant out front

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:24.170
is a little bit different.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:28.480
So here I have 4, whereas
when I took this derivative

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.820
I had 40/3.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.910
So I need to correct for that.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.360
And the correction
is just to say,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.140
instead of starting with this
5x squared minus 1 to the 4/3,

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.840
I need to start with
some multiple of it

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.060
to make the constant work
out right in the end.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.470
So in this case I was off
by a multiple of 10/3,

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.870
so I need to correct by
multiplying through by 3/10.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.200
So we get that the
antiderivative that we want.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:00.970
The antiderivative of 4x
times the quantity 5 x squared

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:07.460
minus 1 to the 1/3
dx is equal to,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:12.880
well it's equal to 3/10 of this.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:18.910
5x squared minus 1 to the 4/3.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.660
OK, so that's our second
antiderivative, which

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.627
we got by advanced guessing.

00:07:23.627 --> 00:07:24.960
Now let's look at the third one.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.250
So the third one is tan x.

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:29.870
Now I sort of promised you
by asking this question

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.770
in this section on substitution
that there's, you know,

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.410
some substitution you can make.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.520
But it's not sort
of obvious just

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.700
from looking at tan x what
should be substituted where.

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.310
At least it isn't obvious to me.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:45.054
But one thing that
can help often

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:46.970
when you don't immediately
see a substitution,

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.100
is to try rewriting
things in equivalent ways.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.760
So sometimes you
can do some algebra

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.220
or some other manipulation.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.954
In this case there's a very
simple sort of rewriting

00:07:55.954 --> 00:07:56.620
that you can do.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.000
Which is that tangent of x
can be expressed in terms

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.520
of sine and cosine of x.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.145
So we can rewrite the
antiderivative of tan

00:08:05.145 --> 00:08:18.090
x dx as integral sine
x over cosine x dx.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:21.170
OK, so now what do we see?

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:26.690
So, I see in the
denominator a cosine of x.

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.610
And then up top I
have a sine x dx.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.890
So sine x dx, that's really
close to the differential

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.310
of cosine of x.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:40.990
So I'm going to try
this substitution.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:46.310
And I'm going to try the
substitution u equals cosine x.

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:49.160
So if I make the
substitution I get

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:55.900
du is equal to minus sine x dx.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:58.600
Which is, OK, so now
if I plug these values

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:06.410
in with this substitution, this
integral becomes the integral,

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:14.190
well it's minus 1
or minus du over u.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:20.140
That's a nice simple
antiderivative to have.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.590
So we've seen this before.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:23.910
So this is just a logarithm.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.430
So the minus sine
comes out front.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.425
So this is minus ln
of the absolute value

00:09:30.425 --> 00:09:32.490
of u plus a constant.

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.510
And now we had this,
that u was cosine of x.

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.210
So this is minus ln
of the absolute value

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.910
of cosine of x plus a constant.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.780
Now this should look
a little bit familiar.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.510
Because in one of
Christine's recitations

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:50.350
earlier, she had you compute the
derivative of ln of cosine x.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.670
And in that case you saw
that that derivative was

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:54.360
equal to minus tangent of x.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.520
Just like it should be.

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.150
So, all right, so there we go.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:03.410
That was three examples
of antidifferentiation

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.070
by substitution and
advanced guessing.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.575
So I'll leave you with that.

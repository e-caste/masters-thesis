00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.460
MICHEL DEGRAFF: So you think
that the ultimate reason

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.095
for these policies is racism?

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:32.298
So rasicm on its own
is the driving factor?

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.567
Because there's been arguments
that perhaps the racism

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:39.858
itself is a result of other
factors, like economic control.

00:00:39.858 --> 00:00:41.274
Think in the case
of Haiti, right?

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:42.842
Or the Caribbean in general.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.144
So what came first?

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:47.247
Was it the racism first, or
then the need for slaves,

00:00:47.247 --> 00:00:50.717
which in turn triggered racism?

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:53.953
NOAM CHOMSKY: It's
a complicated story.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:01:02.662
I mean, racism grew partly
out of the Enlightenment.

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:07.033
If you go back to the 16th
century, say in Europe.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.270
We're talking about Europe now.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.208
There was the beginnings
of the age of exploration,

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.377
exploring the world.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:21.314
The Spanish going to
South America and so on.

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.186
One of the things
that was happening

00:01:24.186 --> 00:01:29.277
was that Europeans-- recall that
you go back a little further,

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:31.257
to say St. Augustine.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:34.727
It was widely believed in
Europe that nobody could

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.197
live south of the equator.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:39.666
For one thing, they would
be standing upside down.

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:40.934
That would be impossible.

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.435
So the idea that
there were actually

00:01:42.435 --> 00:01:45.604
people there was kind
of novel, anyhow.

00:01:45.604 --> 00:01:51.077
But as the age of
exploration continued,

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.481
Europeans were finding
creatures of a kind

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:58.751
that they had never seen
before, like orangutans.

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:02.388
And Africans-- blacks and so on.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:04.057
And there was a
crucial question.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.760
Remember, these were
deeply religious societies.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.164
You either had a soul or
you didn't have a soul.

00:02:11.164 --> 00:02:12.732
That's critical.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:17.237
So the question arose, which
of these creatures have souls?

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:21.007
Can be converted to
Christianity and saved?

00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.376
That was the dominant issue.

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:27.947
And was there a distinction
between, say, orangutans

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.683
and black natives who they saw?

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:31.885
How do you distinguish them?

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:33.186
Can you distinguish them?

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:38.124
And there were all kind of
debates, including language.

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:44.364
In fact, one of my favorite
comments was by Louis Racine.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:47.200
He's the son of the
famous dramatist who

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.204
argued that apes
did have language

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.940
and they were more
intelligent than humans.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.309
And he had a proof, actually.

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.279
He said the proof
is they don't speak.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:01.548
And it's a good argument.

00:03:01.548 --> 00:03:03.183
He said, they don't
speak because they

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:06.219
know that if they spoke, we
would turn them into slaves.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:07.687
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Wow.

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.522
NOAM CHOMSKY: So
therefore, they keep quiet,

00:03:09.522 --> 00:03:12.525
but they're really
smarter than we are.

00:03:12.525 --> 00:03:17.030
But that's the kind of argument
that was taken seriously.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.301
So what came first?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.936
What does it mean?

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:30.143
The all integrate-- Take right
now the racism that's surfacing

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:33.079
is in considerable
measure a reaction

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.296
to the neoliberal policies
of the last generation, which

00:03:38.296 --> 00:03:42.522
have simply undermined a very
large part of the population.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:45.825
In fact, for a majority
of the population,

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:49.095
conditions have
stagnated or declined

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:54.267
during the period that
began basically with Reagan.

00:03:54.267 --> 00:03:56.836
So just take a look
at the numbers.

00:03:56.836 --> 00:04:02.075
So in 2007-- that's
right before the crash.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.777
And if you go back
to that time, there

00:04:04.777 --> 00:04:10.083
was great euphoria among
economists and intellectuals

00:04:10.083 --> 00:04:13.152
about the wonderful
economy that we had.

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:14.454
Everything had been solved.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:15.922
There's no more problems.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:19.559
Great moderation,
perfect, and so on.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:21.661
1979.

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:26.032
Real wages for American
workers were actually lower

00:04:26.032 --> 00:04:30.870
than they had been in 1979
before this grand experiment

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.605
was initiated.

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.340
And you see the same in Europe.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.510
Now, that's a large part of
the reason for the anger,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.481
the contempt for institutions.

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.616
The fear, and so on.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.019
And a lot of it
shows up in racism.

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:49.188
The racism is kind of an
underlying phenomenon,

00:04:49.188 --> 00:04:53.326
but it surfaces when you
have to blame somebody.

00:04:53.326 --> 00:04:56.029
And there's very
interesting work on this.

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.799
If you haven't seen it,
there's a really fine book

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:04.470
by a sociologist named
Arlie Hochschild.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.739
I forget exactly
what it's called,

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:13.413
but she's a Berkeley University
of California sociologist

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.548
comes from a liberal background.

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:17.617
She really wanted to
understand, to see

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.819
if she could understand
what has always

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.456
been regarded as
a strange paradox,

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:26.125
that the people
who are suffering

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:33.266
the most from these
neoliberal policies

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:36.269
are the ones who
most support them.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:37.770
It's very striking
when you look.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.773
We saw it in the last
election, in fact.

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:44.089
The people who voted for
Trump-- the working people--

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:46.665
are voting for their
class enemy who's

00:05:46.665 --> 00:05:49.892
kicking them in the face
at every opportunity.

00:05:49.892 --> 00:05:51.517
And the more he kicks
them in the face,

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.519
the more they support him.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.655
So what's going on?

00:05:55.655 --> 00:05:57.023
And it's very widespread.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.260
She went and lived and she
picked an ultra-red county

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.695
in Mississippi.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.898
The Bayou area of Mississippi.

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.535
And she went to live there for,
I think, five or six years.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:13.106
And just integrated
herself into society.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:15.942
Got to know the people.

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:17.110
Had respect for them.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.579
And she should,
instead of contempt.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:21.575
She became part of the society.

00:06:21.575 --> 00:06:22.949
And she got to
understand the way

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.550
they were looking at things.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.586
And the way they were
looking at things,

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:32.258
she describes with an image
that they accepted as accurate.

00:06:32.258 --> 00:06:36.129
The image of people
standing in a line.

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.197
So we're all standing in line.

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:41.234
Behind us are our parents
and our grandparents.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.034
And they worked hard.

00:06:43.034 --> 00:06:44.670
They did everything
the right way.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.838
They're religious.

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:47.240
They're conservative.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.475
They had families.

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:51.411
Each generation gets
a little better.

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.079
That's the American way.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:55.648
But all of a sudden,
the line stalled.

00:06:55.648 --> 00:06:57.150
We've stopped.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.885
Now, there are
people ahead of us

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:02.255
who are shooting into
the stratosphere.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.389
Multimillionaires.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.257
But that's OK.

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.092
That's the American way.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.195
The problem is the
people behind us.

00:07:09.195 --> 00:07:11.964
The federal
government, its role is

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:14.801
to take those people
who are behind us,

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:19.238
who don't want to work, who
are worthless, and so on.

00:07:19.238 --> 00:07:21.441
And the federal government
takes them and puts them

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:27.447
in front of us with affirmative
action programs, and soup

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:29.549
kitchens, and things like that.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:31.751
I mean, it's all a
complete fantasy,

00:07:31.751 --> 00:07:34.620
but this is the way
people see the world.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:38.157
And you can understand why
they see the world that way.

00:07:38.157 --> 00:07:39.926
These are people
who heard Ronald

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:43.029
Reagan, an extreme
racist incidentally,

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:48.201
give his disquisitions
about welfare queens driving

00:07:48.201 --> 00:07:51.826
in limousines to the welfare
office-- black, of course--

00:07:51.826 --> 00:07:53.773
to pick up your
hard-earned money.

00:07:53.773 --> 00:07:58.211
They're just saturated with that
kind of stuff from talk radio,

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.646
from Fox, everything they hear.

00:08:00.646 --> 00:08:03.316
So these people
behind us are being

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:06.886
pushed by the federal
government in front of us.

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:09.589
And we're stalled.

00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:11.757
Well, they are stalled,
but it's not because

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:14.126
of those people behind them.

00:08:14.126 --> 00:08:17.591
And you take a look
at that amalgam

00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:19.799
and you can see why these
people hate the government.

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:22.134
We don't want the government,
even though the government

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.236
is keeping us alive.

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.737
In fact, if you
look at it, they're

00:08:24.737 --> 00:08:27.673
getting more subsidies from
the government than anyone.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.643
Like Mississippi is
subsidized by New York.

00:08:30.643 --> 00:08:34.347
It's the way
transfers take place.

00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:35.982
But these are all
kind of hidden.

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.616
You don't see the subsidies.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:40.886
What you see is these
people behind us

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:46.893
who are maybe getting
some Medicaid,

00:08:46.893 --> 00:08:49.795
let's say, something like that.

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:52.098
That's what you see.

00:08:52.098 --> 00:08:57.970
A well-designed doctrinal
system, propaganda system,

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.873
can focus your
attention on that.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:04.076
I think we're going
to see more of that.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:10.516
Trump, his promises about
bringing jobs back, obviously

00:09:10.516 --> 00:09:12.118
not going to work.

00:09:12.118 --> 00:09:15.688
What happens when his
constituency recognizes

00:09:15.688 --> 00:09:18.324
that they're just getting
kicked in the face?

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:21.494
Well, what's going to
happen is scapegoating.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.663
It's going to be
necessary to turn

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:27.300
their attention to somebody
who's doing that to them.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.669
The Jews, the Muslims,
the immigrants,

00:09:29.669 --> 00:09:31.971
the blacks, whoever it may be.

00:09:31.971 --> 00:09:34.307
And that could lead to
a really ugly period

00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:37.043
unless there's some
reaction, strong reaction.

00:09:37.043 --> 00:09:39.478
And the reaction ought to
begin before it takes place,

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:41.847
not after it takes place.

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:44.517
But you can see what's
very likely to happen.

00:09:44.517 --> 00:09:47.720
And there's plenty of
examples in history,

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.956
like the Nazis for example.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.792
Plenty of examples
in our own history.

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.460
Many.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.164
Race riots back in our own
history are often like this.

00:09:58.164 --> 00:10:00.166
Take, say, the Irish.

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:04.370
When the Irish came in
the late 19th century,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.441
they were regarded as
black, dark-skinned.

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:11.010
They were treated like blacks.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.347
There were signs in Boston
restaurants saying, no dogs

00:10:14.347 --> 00:10:17.116
or Irish, things like that.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:23.889
They finally whitened, became
integrated into the society.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:28.094
But the racist treatment
of Irish was miserable.

00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:30.496
In fact, there are some
hidden stories there,

00:10:30.496 --> 00:10:32.531
which aren't so pretty.

00:10:32.531 --> 00:10:35.835
Like take gynecology.

00:10:35.835 --> 00:10:39.538
Gynecology was developed by
professors at Harvard Medical

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:40.673
School.

00:10:40.673 --> 00:10:44.176
Their pictures are up
on the walls and so on.

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:45.478
How did they do it?

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:46.979
Well, you had to experiment.

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:49.749
So who'd you experiment with?

00:10:49.749 --> 00:10:52.385
People who were good subjects.

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:55.955
Black women, of course,
and Irish women.

00:10:55.955 --> 00:10:57.923
They were the
experimental subjects

00:10:57.923 --> 00:11:03.562
who were used to develop the
modern scientific understanding

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.164
of gynecology.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:08.634
This kind of thing just
runs all through history.

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:12.104
Everywhere you look, you find
one or another aspect of it.

00:11:12.104 --> 00:11:14.507
And getting back to
Michel's question,

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:17.076
I don't think there's
a chicken/egg issue.

00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:20.513
They all interact.

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.648
MICHEL DEGRAFF: One other
place where they interact

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:25.084
is with language, right?

00:11:25.084 --> 00:11:28.454
So you mentioned
the one drop rule.

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:32.491
In Haiti now, when you look
at, say, the politics there.

00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:34.427
Let's say it's put on a zenith.

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:38.030
And you can see how based on
the way you speak, what you say

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:39.365
is being discarded.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:43.102
And we could call it
the one accent rule.

00:11:43.102 --> 00:11:47.873
So if you shoot any
creole phonemic pattern

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:49.975
in your French, then
you're discarded.

00:11:49.975 --> 00:11:51.744
And I think that's
also true in the US.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:53.412
So in the US, there
was this famous case

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:56.048
of Rachel Jeantel,
when she was testifying

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:59.952
in the trial of Zimmerman,
who had killed Trayvon Martin.

00:11:59.952 --> 00:12:03.689
That's how the Black Lives
Matter movement got launched.

00:12:03.689 --> 00:12:06.826
And she was discarded
by the jury.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:07.960
Why?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.897
Because she spoke with
black English accent.

00:12:11.897 --> 00:12:14.934
And she was judged
to be untrustworthy.

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:16.736
And the jury never
mentioned the testimony.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:19.238
And she was a star
witness for the trial.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:22.074
So there is a
linguist at Stanford,

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:25.377
John Rickford, and
one of his students

00:12:25.377 --> 00:12:27.980
who wrote a beautiful
piece, actually showing

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:30.316
how because of
the way she spoke,

00:12:30.316 --> 00:12:36.155
what she said was given no
credibility by the jury.

00:12:36.155 --> 00:12:39.158
And this is why I think
that perhaps one could think

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:43.929
of race alongside language
as one of these tools

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:47.700
that you can use to create
this illusion of hierarchies.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.101
And maybe you're right.

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.972
The two might reinforce
each other, but perhaps

00:12:52.972 --> 00:12:57.977
this push for economic
control and imperialism

00:12:57.977 --> 00:13:00.880
in the case of the Caribbean
colonization and slavery,

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.450
they become enlisted
by these larger forces

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.852
to impose these hierarchies.

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:09.855
If you go say in
French, the [french]

00:13:09.855 --> 00:13:11.357
that the French
came up with, which

00:13:11.357 --> 00:13:18.297
we saw coming back up with
Marine Le Pen, for example.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:23.002
NOAM CHOMSKY: We've all seen
that in our own experience.

00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:26.505
When I was in college,
one of my fellow students

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:29.742
was one of the rare
black students, who

00:13:29.742 --> 00:13:37.383
had managed to develop not just
a straight American accent,

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.752
but an elite to American accent.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:41.253
So when he talked
over the phone,

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:43.055
you thought you were
talking to a Harvard

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:46.292
professor, or an Oxford
professor, or something.

00:13:46.292 --> 00:13:47.760
We brought him to MIT.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.395
We appointed him, in fact.

00:13:49.395 --> 00:13:53.499
But when he came, he was
staying in our apartment

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:56.068
while he was looking
for a place to live.

00:13:56.068 --> 00:14:02.007
And he would call places that
were for rent around Cambridge.

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:03.909
And they'd say, sure.

00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:04.612
Come over.

00:14:04.612 --> 00:14:06.278
But as soon as he
went over, it suddenly

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:07.746
turned out that
the place had just

00:14:07.746 --> 00:14:11.183
been rented five minutes ago.

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:13.485
But over the phone, he was fine.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:16.355
But not in person.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:20.092
The picking up of
a fake acc-- it

00:14:20.092 --> 00:14:22.661
shows up in many strange ways.

00:14:22.661 --> 00:14:25.564
So for example, at Harvard
in the early 1950s,

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:28.534
there was a wave of Anglophilia.

00:14:28.534 --> 00:14:31.604
And people-- men, of course.

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:34.707
No women-- dressed
in English clothes

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:37.109
and affected British accents.

00:14:37.109 --> 00:14:40.012
And if you kind of just
listened and walked around,

00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:42.514
you might have thought
you're maybe in Oxford,

00:14:42.514 --> 00:14:44.250
not in Cambridge.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.785
But these things
happen all the time.

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:49.255
They can be very
pernicious when it's

00:14:49.255 --> 00:14:56.595
a part of the population
that's vulnerable and deprived

00:14:56.595 --> 00:14:59.498
and under external
pressures for other reasons.

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:03.569
Of course, African Americans,
as I said, it's 400 years.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:06.170
It's not something sudden.

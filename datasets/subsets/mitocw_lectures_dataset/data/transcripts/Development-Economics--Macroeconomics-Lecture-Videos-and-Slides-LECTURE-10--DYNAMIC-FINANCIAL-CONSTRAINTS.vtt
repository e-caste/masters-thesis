ROBERT TOWNSEND: So we've
had a mix of lectures

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.520
in terms of focusing on
specific topics and the details

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.650
of models with notation.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.700
Sometimes that's coupled with
an overview of the literature

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.255
to put the paper in context.

00:00:45.255 --> 00:00:47.995
Sometimes-- and today
will be an example--

00:00:47.995 --> 00:00:49.620
we're just going to
try to do one thing

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.040
and do it reasonably
well, although there

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.390
is a lot of material today.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.250
There are other things that were
listed on the reading list--

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.370
Cynthia Kinnan's job
market paper, for example.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.360
As we go through this, I'll
point out what she was doing

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.240
and how that compares to
what we're doing today.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.760
I deliberately decided not
to go through her paper

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.430
on the front end of this because
it just chews up more time.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.090
And there's been
that macro lecture,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.040
and maybe the
labor lecture was--

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.080
filled a lot of material.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.120
And I'm sort of in the
mood of doing a smaller

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.490
thing well today rather than
trying to cover too much.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.610
So there is a
background, though,

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.470
and that is constraints.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
We've been talking about
constraints all semester.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.370
Consumption
smoothing literature,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.170
including not just
full insurance,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.280
but permanent income,
buffer stock, those.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.080
We did the standard
incomplete markets literature.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.790
There's private
information stuff.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.360
We have mentioned it in
class from time to time,

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.640
have not done too
much explicitly,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.340
although the Ben Moll paper
and the others that lecture

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.560
were macro models
based on assumptions

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.440
about information structures.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.770
Limited commitment we've
actually done quite a lot--

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.910
not just how it affects
consumption, but also

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.320
in those macro models.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.870
So anyway, there's a consumption
literature out there.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.320
There's a bunch of investment
literature out there

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.890
which includes adjustment
cost, sensitivity of investment

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.920
to cash flow, structural
modeling, and just

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.140
outright reduced-form
empirical papers.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.620
And I've already mentioned
some of this macro literature,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.150
like incomplete markets.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.460
Some of these papers we covered
in class, not all of them.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.080
And finally we
get to this, which

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.000
is small but growing
literature trying to test

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.350
across different models.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.250
Most of the above
pick one thing to do

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.810
and try to do it really well.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.190
Some compare across
maybe two models and some

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.270
even more than two.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.550
So I could probably add two
or three more References.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.360
There just isn't
that much out there

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.590
that systematically are agnostic
about what the underlying

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.660
constraint is and set
out to discover the best

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.070
fit against the data, and hence
what the obstacles really are.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.730
So the point is we're not going
to just look at investment,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.800
not just look at consumption.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.380
Largely we will look
at both together.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.780
We're not going to look
at just incomplete markets

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.790
or endogenous
information-constrained

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:55.300
markets.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:02.380
We're going to test for them,
both classes within and across,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.110
and talk about how to do it
and what kind of data we need.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.780
The tools-- we're solving
these dynamic models.

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.360
We can allow any number of
financial information regimes.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.240
We're going to use
maximum likelihood

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.370
to estimate the parameters,
which allows us to be more

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.910
general in a couple of ways.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.900
First of all, we can back out
all the structural parameters,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.810
not just the parameters that are
in a particular Euler equation.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.440
And likewise, we can have more
than one equation, so to speak.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.350
We can look not only at
consumption Euler equations,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.165
but investment rate
of return equations.

00:04:53.165 --> 00:04:56.210
So again, I think in
my mind, at least,

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.610
these are familiar
themes that we've

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.920
been covering in bits
and pieces in each

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.810
of the various lectures.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.700
What was Cynthia doing
in her job market paper?

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.040
She was looking at various
financial information regimes,

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.770
but focusing on the
Euler equations.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.800
And as you go from
full risk sharing

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.230
to limited information
about output

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:27.690
to moral hazard,
constrained insurance,

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.770
the form of the Euler
equation varied from one

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.340
to the other, including what
variable should or should not

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.560
show up as lags.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.460
And the basis of
her task was to see

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:45.420
whether lagged inverse
marginal utility was

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.740
a sufficient statistic.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.570
I'll say more about
that as we go through.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.820
So there's a long
list of regimes.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.590
I think part of
the point of this

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.910
is that the technology
is available to test

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.720
almost any regime subject to
computational constraints.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.780
So under incomplete
markets, we get out

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.670
of autarky, which is
the worst, savings

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:17.470
only as in buffer stock,
maybe borrowing up to a limit.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.670
We've talked about that
in the natural borrowing

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.000
limit and other limits, and
then a single risk-free asset,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.700
which is like permanent
income, unlimited borrowing

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.530
and lending.

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.950
And then we have the
endogenously determined

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:40.140
incomplete regimes, namely moral
hazard, limited commitment,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.290
hidden output,
unobserved investment,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.300
and the least constrained
regime, the full information

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.800
regime.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.250
So there's six or
seven of them here.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:53.380
And we're going to
go through tools

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:57.520
that allow you to test one
against the other pairwise

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:05.310
for any pair depending on
what data you want to use.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:11.010
So there is a mechanism
design contract theory

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.340
part which we've been putting
off until today, largely.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.500
There is dynamic programming
as in value functions.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.290
We have been seeing
versions of that

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.850
through various other lectures.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.320
There's linear programming.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.310
I'm going to say
why momentarily,

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.050
although we were
already starting

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:34.740
to do that when we did
Rogerson's paper on labor

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.360
supply.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.860
And although it was probably
hard to figure it out,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.060
that's what Victor Zorn
was doing in the TA session

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:42.645
last Thursday.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:51.500
And maximum likelihood, which
sounds familiar, anyway.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.170
So we compute, we estimate,
and we test, basically.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:00.110
We can do it on actual data.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:04.160
I'm going to focus on the
contrast between the urban data

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.170
and the rural data.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.620
We can actually use
it on simulated data.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:15.980
So I vote for this
technique, which is generate

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:17.660
the data from the model itself.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.690
Then you know for sure
what's generating the data

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.670
and see whether
you get back what

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:26.000
you put in in terms of
the financial regime

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.240
and the underlying parameters.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:37.320
And the results are reassuring
subject to measurement error.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.590
One comment-- that you have
to be patient to get to the--

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:45.730
get through the next
45 minutes or so--

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.970
the criticism of
maximum likelihood

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:50.590
is it's kind of black boxy.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:56.350
You don't really know, other
than trying to fit histograms--

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.705
it's not like you're
focusing on ROA

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:03.070
and how it varies with
wealth or transitions

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.570
in the capital stock, or for
that matter, the time series

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.317
that the model is generating.

00:09:09.317 --> 00:09:10.900
But I'll come back
at the end and show

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.550
you the pictures
of the actual data,

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.870
and you'll get-- you've
seen it, actually.

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:20.110
But I'll remind you parts
of it, and you'll see why--

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.480
what it is that makes
it difficult for some

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.490
of these financial regimes to
fit the data and hence what

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:31.140
the obstacles seem
to be out there.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:35.180
We use the Thai data because
we have both the consumption

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:43.560
and the asset and income data,
and using both is helpful.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.250
But that doesn't mean these
techniques are limited

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.960
to rather special databases.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.510
Mostly if you have
surveys of firms,

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.320
they would not ask about the
consumption of the owner.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.440
Fortunately, the
reverse is not so--

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.100
is less constraining, which
is household-level surveys

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:07.120
done by the World Bank,
Living Standards Measurement

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:13.670
and the FLS, Family Life
Cycle in Mexico and Indonesia,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.170
and so on.

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.650
They do typically ask
the household a lot

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.450
about their enterprises.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:29.950
But we've done this in Spain
with just data on investment.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:36.020
So the techniques work even when
you don't have the consumption

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:36.710
data itself.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.930
And one of the main
findings, reassuringly-- it's

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:48.560
not like we always get
the same thing back.

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:52.580
For one thing, we don't
get full risk sharing much.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.780
Sometimes we do.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.640
It will not surprise
you when we get it

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.870
given the other papers
we've discovered in class.

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:03.050
The big interesting
thing is there

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.860
is a difference between the
rural data and the urban data.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:12.020
And the rural data, fairly
limited financial regimes,

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.630
like savings only or
limited borrowing,

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:25.310
they fit the best when you use
the investment and income data.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.320
But in the urban
areas, even when

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.660
you use the investment
and income data,

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.855
you get something less
constraining like moral hazard.

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.720
So arguably, the
information problem--

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.390
or if you believe
in missing markets,

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:45.150
they're more missing
in the rural areas

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:48.630
than they are in
the urban areas.

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.130
All right.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:59.220
So here's the model, utility
over consumption and effort.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:03.940
Output is stochastic.

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.070
Instead of writing
output as a function

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:09.310
of effort and
capital plus a shock,

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.640
this is a more
general histogram.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.666
You've seen it at
least once before,

00:12:15.666 --> 00:12:19.505
the probability of any
given output given effort

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:20.005
and capital.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.990
Households are
either on their own

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.850
or entering into contracts
with a financial intermediary.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:36.415
It's partial equilibrium facing
some exogenous outside return.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:46.700
And you can think about
financial intermediaries

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:53.000
as being competitive
if you want.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.160
You could also think
about it as a stand-in

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.390
for the community as a whole.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.320
I'll show you where
this stuff matters.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.070
And you're going to
solve this contracting

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.950
problem for many
dates, even potentially

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:12.100
over an infinite horizon.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:12.600
OK.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.080
And finally, how many
people do we have?

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:18.890
You could actually think
about this as a risk-neutral

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:21.940
household running a business--

00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:24.700
sorry-- risk-averse
household running a business

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.180
facing a risk-neutral
intermediary as if they're

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.390
only two people.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.120
But a lot of what
we do is easier

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.902
to interpret when there is
a continuum-- many, many,

00:13:36.902 --> 00:13:41.000
a continuum of
household enterprises.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.960
Because then we can talk about
the fractions of households

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:47.480
who took effort,
had certain capital,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.600
and experienced
a certain output.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.400
That actually
eliminates uncertainty

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.680
from the point of view
of the intermediary

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.900
because all these
things average out.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:57.822
Yes, Matt.

00:13:57.822 --> 00:14:00.830
AUDIENCE: Can they re-contract
each period [? for the ?]

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.630
[? consumer? ?]

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:06.110
PROFESSOR: Here we're
largely ruling it out.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.750
There is some limited
commitment in the sense

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.100
that they can walk away
and go into autarky.

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:17.090
That's about as close
as we get in this paper.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.060
I kind of know something
about how to extend it,

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.762
but it's not going to
be in the lecture today.

00:14:22.762 --> 00:14:24.220
AUDIENCE: So how
do you get-- just,

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.720
do you get time
variations in those data,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:31.670
or is it just a cross-section?

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:34.536
PROFESSOR: It's both a
cross-section and panel.

00:14:34.536 --> 00:14:36.960
You use both aspects.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:40.170
The best way to think about
having multiple intermediaries

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.620
is there's ex-ante
competition among them

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.090
to service households,
but there's

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.430
something committing
households once they sign up

00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:50.110
to a long-term agreement.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:02.080
So what's the initial state
for a household saying?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.900
Well, for sure at least
the initial capital stock

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.020
when we visit them in
the baseline survey.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.010
And then the second
argument depends

00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:15.930
on the financial regime.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.640
If it's like
borrowing and lending,

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.630
then it's their current assets
or their net indebtedness.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.820
Or if it's one of
these contract regimes,

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:34.380
it's essentially some utility
constraint, some reservation

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:39.210
utility as if it had been
promised in the past.

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:40.500
And I'll say more about that.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:43.770
That's the key to handling
the dynamic incentive problem.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:50.530
Clearly, something like
unobserved utility is not seen,

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.490
so we're going to have
to parameterize it

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:57.990
with the mean and the variance
and estimate this unobserved

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:04.890
distribution of debt or
promises in the population.

00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:08.640
Timing-- OK, so those
are initial states.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.660
Then capital is
used in production

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.300
along with effort,
which may or may not

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.160
be observed depending
on the regime.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.000
Output is realized.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.890
There is this pre-existing
financial contract which

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:27.090
determines the debt, say,
that they can take on,

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:33.000
or savings for tomorrow, or
transfers as an insurance.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.720
And finally, after
that financial stuff,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:42.110
they eat some and
invest the rest.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:45.240
So it's kind of like a
standard neoclassical setup.

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:50.730
Capital today, you
produce with labor,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.450
then you can either
eat or invest.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:58.250
The fancy stuff is happening
with the financial part, which

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.820
is the difference between
what you have available

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.170
and what you either
give up or get depending

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:09.349
on the financial contract.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.579
Capital depreciates.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:11.599
That's pretty standard.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:13.970
And of course, then you
go to the next prime--

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:17.510
next period with all these
prime variables on them,

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:20.630
so the transition
from the state today

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:26.500
to the state tomorrow with a
financial contract in between.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.339
OK.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:38.100
In particular,
we're going to talk

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.100
about what goes on within
the period in terms

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.880
of the effort, which
is induced or assigned,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.920
the output, which
happens through Mother

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.360
Nature, the decision
for capital tomorrow--

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.630
and I'll go more into this
promised utility for tomorrow.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.300
This pi thing is
like the probability

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.260
of this whole quadruple.

00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.650
And it looks daunting.

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:09.940
Now, from a statistical point
of view, it's like a histogram.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:14.425
If you had a finite
number of values that q,

00:18:14.425 --> 00:18:17.350
z, k prime and w
prime can take on,

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:22.570
then you just have a bunch of
points in dimensional space.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:29.050
And then you can talk about
what mass, what height of a bar,

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:33.410
of a histogram bar that
those values take on.

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.730
So statistically, it's an easy
way to summarize the data.

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.890
From the point of view
of a financial contract,

00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.710
there's a lot of degeneracy.

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.500
So it's not true, for
example, typically

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.560
that effort is random.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.670
For a given set of parameter
values given incentives,

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:54.792
there's one effort
that's going to happen

00:18:54.792 --> 00:18:56.000
and none of the other happen.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.550
That's not
inconsistent with this.

00:18:57.550 --> 00:19:00.760
It's just an extreme case
where almost everything is zero

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.600
except for one point of
effort, and that's one.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.170
It's also true that there might
be a functional relationship

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:12.430
between consumption and output,
maybe a nice, smooth function.

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.560
Or if you want to
grid it up, you've

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.580
got a series of dots
that lie on a line.

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:24.490
So then we talk about the
probability of Q and C

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:27.310
as if know it was a shotgun.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:31.420
But in practice, all the mass
is going to lie on that line.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.760
So you're used to
thinking about,

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.380
let c be a function of q.

00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:38.110
Let effort be assigned.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:40.950
We'll take care of how much
capital is invested, et cetera.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.920
OK.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:55.080
It is true also that capital
might be indivisible.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.280
We've talked about this.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.380
You get project ideas.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.636
You may or may
not want to do it.

00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:03.562
The equipment is really
chunky, building that warehouse

00:20:03.562 --> 00:20:04.270
for the chickens.

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:09.910
So that's actually
more realistic.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:12.730
And then the probability
is kind of serious, which

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.070
is, what is the probability
you're going to do it,

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:18.670
or what fraction of the
population are going to do it?

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:21.520
When we talk about
fractions of the population,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.220
you should be
reminded of Rogerson.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.040
There it was you work
overtime or you work

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.930
or you don't work at
all, and the issue

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:30.880
was what fraction of
people are working.

00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.420
So that was the first
experience in this class where

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:36.950
we had a probability number.

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.370
And when we have
non-convexities,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:43.360
this is the generalization of
it to [INAUDIBLE] probabilities

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:45.490
on--

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:47.170
potentially on more
than one thing.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:55.280
And there's a reason, and I'll
show you when we write it down.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.470
It turns everything into a
linear programming problem.

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.220
I'm going to talk about
particular utility

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.380
functions, particular
production functions.

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.460
But really, we don't
need to assume--

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.770
that's both the strength
and limitation of this.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.410
I'm not going to show you a
lot of closed-form analytic

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.270
solutions.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:17.738
But on the other hand, we can
solve anything numerically.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:24.590
And Cynthia, again,
just to alert you,

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:30.260
was backing out
from Euler equations

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:34.670
with first-order conditions,
which Lagrange multipliers are

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.330
binding and why and so on.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:40.070
So it's not like you can't--

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.410
you can, in principle,
do both, actually.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.520
You don't necessarily have to--

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.020
OK.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.780
So let's just think
about a standard problem

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:48.800
without the lotteries.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.160
This is the autarky problem.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:22:00.050
Household enterprise
has a realized output q,

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:03.560
depreciated capital
from last period.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.660
Actually, it's to qi
it's already realized.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.610
In autarky, there's nothing
left other than deciding on what

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:11.870
to eat and what to invest.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.960
So this is the capital
stock for tomorrow.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:15.590
Oh, sorry.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:18.840
And then there's this effort z.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.520
z is entering in this utility.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:24.080
It's also entering in
this production function.

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.450
You want expected utility?

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:25.950
Fine.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:29.340
Just sum up over all
possible outputs,

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:32.550
taking into account
Mother Nature's way

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:36.560
of determining stochastically
what those outputs are.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.720
And whatever you decide
to take over to tomorrow

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.320
enters in the value
function tomorrow.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:45.820
OK?

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:49.480
So we're looking for this
infinite horizon solution.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.290
We're looking for a
value function that's

00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:54.850
like a fixed point that
solves the functional

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.020
equation like this.

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.010
Now, again, when qi
is realized, you still

00:23:07.010 --> 00:23:08.580
have to decide on investment.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:13.580
That's why i is on
both k prime and q.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:19.610
But z is determined
before output is realized.

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:20.930
So that's just one number.

00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:22.630
You with me?

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.702
OK.

00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:28.050
It looks-- this is an
equivalent problem.

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:34.160
And this looks familiar,
except the i's are missing.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.180
So it's output plus depreciated
capital less investment

00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.910
for tomorrow, deciding
on [INAUDIBLE],,

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:46.370
but now we've taken this
deterministic-looking problem

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.600
and just replaced it with
this probability object.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.720
But it allows all
these special cases.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.640
Anything that can
solve this solves

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:04.880
this subject to grids,
subject to approximating

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.300
with a finite number
of outputs, et cetera.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.510
All right.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:17.920
Now, it looks here as
if the choice object

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:24.630
is this probability number
including the probability

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:27.680
of output, but how can that be?

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.300
Because Mother
Nature plays a role.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.620
So we kind of have to constrain
these histograms to respect

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:41.620
the relationship between kz
and q, and namely, this object.

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.350
We don't want to
lose this object.

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:48.280
Well, it's a fancy way of
saying the probability of event

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.360
A conditioned on event b
times the probability event b

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.910
is the same thing as a
joint event a, comma, b.

00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:00.570
So this was the probability
of q bar and z bar

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:02.740
because I summed
over everything else.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.010
This is a probability
of c bar given z bar,

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:08.650
and then this is, summing
over everything else,

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:10.990
the probability of z bar.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:12.160
So it's a cute trick.

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:19.400
So we're not going to
cheat on Mother Nature.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.500
We're constrained to
follow Mother Nature.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:31.670
Another thing to-- say
what's the dimensionality?

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:36.800
Well, the state variable
is k, so the question is,

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.290
how many little k's are there?

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.830
If we grid up k in the
small, medium, and large,

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.100
there's three of
them, for example.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:45.470
It could be 10.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:49.380
That's our choice in
terms of the grid.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.490
But whatever it is, we've got to
solve this functional equation

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:57.390
v and find the fixed
point by iterating.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:00.090
OK?

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:03.900
And the larger is the
dimension of this,

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:06.790
the harder it is to do that.

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.290
Jan.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:13.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
formulations [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.040
In the second case,
as in the agents

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.130
can do some randomization
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:20.130 --> 00:26:21.735
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I should have--

00:26:21.735 --> 00:26:23.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] is
the first case [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.527
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.590
If we don't get the grid
right-- for example,

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:34.200
if we have a continuum of
values of z, and so on,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.470
then we have to make sure
that the solution here

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:39.690
is on a grid point down here.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:42.300
Or to put it the
other way around,

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:54.640
if the grid is serious
then the household

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.270
may want to optimize in terms
of choosing a probability.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:01.210
And in that case, this is
not just going to replicate.

00:27:01.210 --> 00:27:02.320
This allows more.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.620
So if it wants to, we
can find a solution,

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.570
but it may choose to
find something else.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.970
There are grid lotteries,
but it's too easy

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.250
to detect them in the output.

00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:22.220
You've got medium
effort and high effort,

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.770
and then the thing is putting
probability on both of those.

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:27.950
They're like adjacent points.

00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:29.540
So it's clear
where the program's

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:31.820
trying to get something in
the middle that's just not

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.850
available.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:39.130
And if the grid is serious,
then, as in Rogerson,

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:40.630
that's fine.

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:42.880
If we think the grid
ought to be not there,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.710
and it's just meant to
be an approximation,

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:46.960
then you probably want to
slice and dice it a bit more

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:50.515
and search more intensively
between those adjacent points.

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:56.260
AUDIENCE: For the
second problem,

00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:02.818
is it possible that the solution
[INAUDIBLE] random contract?

00:28:02.818 --> 00:28:04.110
PROFESSOR: It is possible, yes.

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.800
AUDIENCE: But in reality,
why the agent can randomly

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.680
choose a [INAUDIBLE]
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:12.390
the first formulation,
a agent can not

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:13.675
choose a random contract.

00:28:13.675 --> 00:28:16.003
And in the second
one, you can choose.

00:28:16.003 --> 00:28:16.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:19.920
I agree with your point.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.320
You think it's
infeasible to randomize?

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.480
AUDIENCE: So I think
if your assumption

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.890
is that the [INAUDIBLE]
agent can do randomization,

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.740
then I agree that these
[INAUDIBLE] formulations

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:33.220
are equivalent.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.720
But if you don't assume that--

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.420
PROFESSOR: I am assuming they
can do the randomization.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.960
And again, as in
Rogerson, it's a way

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.145
to smooth out the
non-convexities.

00:28:46.145 --> 00:28:47.520
That's the main--
you know, we've

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.600
turned non-convex problems
into a linear program.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.960
Oh, why is it a linear
programming problem?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.440
Well, these pis are
the choice variables.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:01.480
It's tempting to say, oh, no,
it's supposed to be k and z.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.190
No, no, no.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:04.650
It's the probability of
[? qt ?] So this is just

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:09.570
a number, this utility, if you
were to do a certain quadruple.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.950
And this is the probability
of that quadruple.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:18.000
So these are the fundamental
policy variables.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.220
And what is the
dimensionality of them?

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:23.880
Number q cross number
z cross number k prime.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.535
So this can get pretty
big pretty fast.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.710
And how many
constraints there are?

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:35.600
Well, in this case, just the
one, although probabilities do

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.600
have to add up.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.440
But essentially, one constraint.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.520
Well, not quite.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.970
It's for every q bar and z bar.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:48.030
So actually, there's number
q cross number z constraints

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:48.530
here.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.470
I'm not going to belabor this.

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.220
But when you go through
the other regimes,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.410
you're going to keep an eye
on how many constraints there

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:58.340
are and so on.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:01.190
And eventually,
we'll get to regimes

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:05.180
that are actually nice and
challenging to compute.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:05.930
Here's the--

00:30:12.135 --> 00:30:14.260
AUDIENCE: I still don't
understand exactly what you

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.220
mean when you say that the
pis are the choice variables

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.440
and the q and the k's and
the z's are just numbers.

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.120
I mean, they still
ought to be consistent.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.250
So when you choose a
pi, then you're doing--

00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:32.070
PROFESSOR: Suppose you had
a continuous consumption

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:36.000
schedule, so c is
a function of q.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.630
And then the paradigm
is either you work hard

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:42.960
or you work very little,
so there's just two.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.850
So if you choose
not to work hard,

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:47.610
that's going to be
reflected in output.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.940
But you're still facing
that consumption schedule.

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.030
Or you could work hard
or potentially randomize

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.640
across working hard or not.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.610
So the randomization
could be in the effort.

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.700
AUDIENCE: So the
pis are functions?

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.454
I'm choosing a function.

00:31:06.454 --> 00:31:07.310
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.730
AUDIENCE: I'm
choosing a function.

00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:16.060
PROFESSOR: Actually,
here, it's so general

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.560
that you don't
see any functions.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:21.280
You're just choosing mass
points over a finite number

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.850
of q's, z's, and k primes
without constraints.

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:27.810
AUDIENCE: I am, quote
unquote, [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.642
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:28.642 --> 00:31:30.850
AUDIENCE: Isn't it more like
choosing a distribution,

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.325
though, instead of saying--

00:31:32.325 --> 00:31:33.700
PROFESSOR: If
these were-- yeah--

00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.320
if these were a
continuum, then this

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:38.310
would be like a density, a
multi-dimensional density.

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:40.130
But I don't know how
to compute those.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.130
AUDIENCE: It's not-- so
correct me if I'm wrong,

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:44.150
but it's not that I can
put anything next to it.

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:47.230
I have to plug in
to the u next to it

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.930
the corresponding
stuff in there.

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.690
But then I just compute every
single thing inside there

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:55.060
and choose the best one
after I compute everything.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.200
So we specify the grids.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:04.800
So we know the set of
feasible choices for all

00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:07.530
the quadruples qzk prime.

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:11.880
For any particular one, we
know what this real number is.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:18.080
You use Matlab code to
generate these weights.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.260
In this case, it's a weight on
it on the objective function,

00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:25.580
or you use codes to
generate this guy,

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.620
and then there's weights
on the constraint set.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.542
So

00:32:28.542 --> 00:32:30.000
AUDIENCE: So now
I understand that.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.030
But then, in some sense,
I don't understand

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:38.610
what the difference
from the first case is--

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.450
like, for on the first problem.

00:32:44.890 --> 00:32:47.270
That the probability
of q given k

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:50.170
and z could, in
principle, be non-linear.

00:32:50.170 --> 00:32:52.840
And so we're just--

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:54.970
PROFESSOR: It's the extra
gain from randomization.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:33:14.280
I mean, suppose--
take the point of view

00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.740
that there are a
continuum of-- well,

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:18.690
so far we don't have
the social planner.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.570
I mean, this is just an
individual optimization.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:24.780
But I will try to
answer your question.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.860
When we have a village-wide
resource constraint,

00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.620
we've got to decide how
many resources to use up

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.490
in investment and how much to
leave over for consumption.

00:33:35.490 --> 00:33:37.410
And it may be that you
don't want everyone

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:39.090
doing a large, chunky project.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.920
You want to just take
some people to do it

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.810
and some people not.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:46.320
And then you know whatever
is produced as output,

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:49.350
use that some of that
for consumption and some

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:51.060
to save for tomorrow.

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:55.620
So from a social
perspective, you rarely

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:57.330
want everyone doing
the same thing.

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:59.610
You want to choose the
fractions or people doing

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:01.535
one thing or the other.

00:34:01.535 --> 00:34:02.160
Does that help?

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:08.800
All right.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.560
So this is with
borrowing and lending,

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:16.100
so it's essentially
almost the same,

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.010
except you can add to
your current resources

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:22.219
by borrowing, except
you've got to pay back

00:34:22.219 --> 00:34:24.960
your loan from yesterday.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:28.429
So now you've got two ways
to intertemporally reallocate

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.130
consumption, one through
the capital stock,

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:36.710
the equipment, and the other
through financial borrowing

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.810
and lending.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:41.000
And it's already
written in lotteries.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.389
By the way, it enhances
the state vector

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:49.030
from the capital stock to
the current debt as well.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:02.750
Now we can knock
off savings only.

00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:06.830
That's where a basically,
if B means borrowing,

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:14.570
then basically, it
can't be positive

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.210
if you're not going to allow it.

00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:19.520
Or you could allow
some small amount

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:24.480
and have a positive
but low amount

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.950
that you could borrow as b max.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:30.240
So we can do savings
only, et cetera.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.280
If you don't want to limit
borrowing at all, that's fine.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:37.930
Then you just let it
take on any value subject

00:35:37.930 --> 00:35:39.050
to [? grade ?] issues.

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:39.590
Yep?

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.715
AUDIENCE: When you do this
kind of stuff in Matlab,

00:35:41.715 --> 00:35:44.200
to do these different scenarios,
is that just [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.650
one line of code?

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:47.570
PROFESSOR: Which?

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:50.240
AUDIENCE: Like, to
have [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:53.003 --> 00:35:53.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:56.190
Well, actually, you can almost
generate it from the grid,

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.440
because you might have a
large set of possible values

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.240
for borrowing.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.960
That would be the
unrestricted problem.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.090
If you want savings
only, then you just

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.360
cut off all the positive
borrowings or anything

00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:11.320
in between.

00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:14.530
So this one you can handle
in terms of generating

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:15.460
the underlying grid.

00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:24.500
Now we get to these
mechanism design models

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.030
including full information.

00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:35.240
Now we're going to have to
go back to the households

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.140
as a group dealing with
this financial intermediary.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.070
The main thing is this--

00:36:49.545 --> 00:36:51.670
let's look at the household
because we were looking

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:54.070
at households a minute ago.

00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:59.560
Now it's as if they surrendered
all their output to the bank--

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.750
bear with me-- but
they get some of it

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:05.150
back in terms of transfers.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:08.030
Actually, a more
natural way to write it

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.810
would have been give them
q and let them pay back

00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:14.840
loans, state-contingent loans.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.370
It's equivalent.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:21.490
The transfer can be
positive or negative.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.080
And it's kind of the
basis of consumption,

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:27.410
but it's adjusted, as
usual, by investment.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:31.350
So then the contract has to
solve for these transfers,

00:37:31.350 --> 00:37:33.270
and the transfers
are a function of q.

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:39.350
Now, as I said, the
way this is written,

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:43.370
the q ends up with
the bank, but the bank

00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:44.530
is paying the transfer.

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:50.410
So this is basically a surplus
generated from households.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:54.670
What fraction of households
have output q greater than tau,

00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:57.010
so the bank is getting
money from them?

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.377
Well, that's this pi.

00:37:58.377 --> 00:37:59.210
That's the fraction.

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.580
Well, you know, it's
infinite horizon.

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.800
So this is the surplus
generated today--

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.580
or if negative, the loss--

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.280
summed up over all
surpluses and losses

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.460
depending on who's
at what states

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.110
and what the contract assigns.

00:38:19.110 --> 00:38:21.820
And then you have
tomorrow's profits.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.830
This is a small, open economy.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:28.920
There's an interest
r, 1 plus a little r.

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:32.700
So this is just the
present value of tomorrow.

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:36.030
So this is surplus
today plus profits today

00:38:36.030 --> 00:38:37.860
plus profits tomorrow.

00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:42.795
So it's as if the bank is trying
to maximize overall profits.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.310
Now, what's the constraint?

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.680
Why not just screw
the households?

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.445
Well, the answer is--

00:38:54.445 --> 00:38:55.820
it's not quite
right, but you can

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:59.370
think about this as a
reservation utility.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:00.860
So you can't take too much away.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:05.300
Otherwise, the households
will cry foul and walk away.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:06.260
OK?

00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:09.760
Actually, technically,
this promise

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:13.940
was predetermined from
the previous period.

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:17.660
Or equivalently, part
of the control variable

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:21.970
is the promise from
tomorrow on, w prime.

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:26.710
It's easy and yet
amazingly powerful.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.870
So just think about incentives.

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.970
You have long-term contracts.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:32.150
Should I work today?

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.450
I can get rewarded or
penalized depending

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.310
on what my output is today.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:38.200
But it's not just
a static contract.

00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.850
There's tomorrow too.

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:42.340
So maybe my history
of observed outputs

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.520
will be used tomorrow in terms
of the insurance and credit

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.160
contract I'm going to
get, which in turn could

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.980
be used in the third period.

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:51.580
And we're like, oh, my god.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.820
That's a really big object.

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:55.870
But no.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:57.400
What do the
households care about?

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.670
They only care about
their expected utility.

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.880
If I'm looking
forward to tomorrow,

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.740
I don't have to solve
tomorrow's problem

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:09.960
as long as I know what the
utility consequences will be.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.790
So this is kind
of a reduced form

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:16.560
way of handling the
multi-period incentive problem.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.740
What I'm saying is the
household's expected utility

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:26.050
is the utility outcome from
today plus the expected utility

00:40:26.050 --> 00:40:26.550
tomorrow.

00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:32.410
It's not only--
it's the probability

00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:35.570
of being assigned w prime
tomorrow jointly with output

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:36.070
today.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:39.370
So now, not only is
consumption moving up and down

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.710
with output today--

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.470
and it will move when
there's limited insurance--

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:49.720
but also, tomorrow's utility
will vary up and down.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:53.620
And because you have concave
utility and this force

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:56.500
for inter-temporal smoothing,
you won't just do one,

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.300
and you won't just do the other.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.090
Actually, you'll load as much
into the future as possible.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.600
Front loading is a bad thing.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.650
The longer the horizon,
the more powerful

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.855
the incentives, because
you've got the whole future.

00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:15.520
So there's a lot of
economics behind this sort

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:18.970
of innocuous-looking
two-period problem

00:41:18.970 --> 00:41:21.205
where w prime captures tomorrow.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:24.390
All right.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:31.900
That's actually the
full insurance problem,

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.020
and then we can
add moral hazard.

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:42.240
So basically, what this says
is if z bar is assigned today

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.200
in the contract and the
guy actually does it,

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:51.000
he has to be wanting
to do it relative to--

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.885
and the bank wouldn't
know even though z

00:41:54.885 --> 00:41:59.290
bar is being recommended, the
guy is doing z hat, shirking.

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.110
So this is a standard
moral hazard constraint.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.350
Of course, the
inequality makes them

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:12.840
want to do the recommendation.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:18.700
But the program has to
evaluate any possible deviation

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.690
a shirking agent
might do and make

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:23.850
sure the utility
consequences for the agent

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:29.610
are worse than following
the recommended plan.

00:42:29.610 --> 00:42:31.290
Now, again, because
we've embedded

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.440
Mother Nature in
this pi thing, we

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.390
have to re-normalize
the probability.

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:39.400
I actually showed you this once.

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.990
But I'm sure with discounting,
you can't remember backwards.

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:45.960
More on that next Tuesday.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.500
But we just adjust
the likelihood

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:54.950
to reflect the fact that now z
hat is taken rather than z bar.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:58.460
And it's not maybe obvious
where this is coming from.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.890
It is nevertheless true.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:03.560
You just have to write out all
the conditional probabilities

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.207
and start summing up.

00:43:06.207 --> 00:43:07.790
I can give you a
reference if you want

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:09.870
to see where it's written out.

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:11.190
Questions?

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.000
Yes.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:13.610
AUDIENCE: I just
want to make sure

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.140
that I understand
this formulation.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.480
So I think the [? language ?]
of this formulation

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:22.140
is that if you don't have this
formulation, first of all,

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:26.870
you need to solve the
incentive-compatible contracts

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.120
one by one.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.320
And in this case, the
randomizing contract

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.330
is like randomize your wealth.

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:38.180
So you may need to
solve one problem.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.535
So I [INAUDIBLE] you randomize--

00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:40.910
PROFESSOR: Well,
actually, you're

00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:43.250
suggesting a simplification
that we're not

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:46.100
using, which is any random--

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.710
oh, you mean the w, the promise?

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.060
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.370
I think the advantage of
the second formulation

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:54.310
compared to the first line--

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:57.330
in the first line, you
need to solve first

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.540
all the incentive-compatible
contracts,

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:02.270
and then you'll do an
optimal randomization

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:03.750
among these contracts.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:04.420
Right?

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:05.540
Here you can just--

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:10.260
x and t, you can randomize
over this z and the k,

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.480
and that will give
you a similar result.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.450
So essentially, you only need
to solve one linear programming

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:18.350
problems instead of a lot.

00:44:18.350 --> 00:44:19.020
Is that--

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:19.853
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:19.853 --> 00:44:21.030
PROFESSOR: Well, I guess.

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:24.690
We're searching jointly
over all the possibilities.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:32.860
Now, it's true on the one hand,
it's just a linear programming

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.040
problem.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:39.930
So we can just get the best
code available and use it.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:43.200
On the other hand, there's lots
of variables, lots of states,

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.420
lots of constraints.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.832
So it's not like
it comes for free.

00:44:47.832 --> 00:44:52.440
If I knew something analytically
about the underlying contract,

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:53.730
it would be good to use it.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:00.930
But if I don't know,
then I could just

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:03.240
guess wrong and put
some functional form

00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.230
which is incorrect.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:07.440
And that's why-- that's
what's good about this.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:14.030
I don't-- now, what was
Victor talking about?

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:18.940
Victor was talking about going
back to deterministic contracts

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:23.200
and then solving them with a
nonlinear optimization problem

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.905
and then comparing that
solution to these linear codes.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.750
And I'm not sure if he
showed you at the end,

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:37.210
but when the grids
are really coarse,

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:38.960
the linear program
seems to work,

00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:41.680
but it can be a really
bad approximation.

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.750
So there's still trade-offs.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.555
It's not a miracle.

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.090
Other questions?

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:54.340
All right.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:58.030
So now we can do
limited commitment.

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.820
So this is what I mentioned.

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.430
You can go into autarky.

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:06.970
You can decide to do that
after your output is realized.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.880
It's like, I'm not paying
into the risk-sharing group.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.380
Great.

00:46:11.380 --> 00:46:12.970
You financed my project.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:20.060
I'm the big boss now, and I'd
just as soon be on my own.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:24.040
So what we say is--

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:27.760
first of all, we compute the
value function for autarky.

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:28.510
Well, that's cool.

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:29.350
We already did that.

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.520
That was the first
financial regime.

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.580
So we already know this guy.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:35.530
And then the
contemporary situation

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:40.730
is you've got output
plus depreciated capital,

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:43.160
and then you could walk away.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.180
No transfers.

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.740
They're gone.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.680
You just keep it
all and decide maybe

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:51.830
what you want to
carry into tomorrow.

00:46:51.830 --> 00:46:55.775
So we can call the solution
to this thing omega.

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.650
By the way, the z
is already foregone.

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:03.000
You've already
made that decision.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.540
It was in disutility part.

00:47:08.535 --> 00:47:09.660
You've already got capital.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.490
You already got funding.

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:13.260
Now you have output.

00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:17.240
Can't go backwards,
but you can walk away.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.230
So this is basically
the maximizing utility.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:24.900
And we make sure that
if you follow the plan,

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.610
you're not going to
be tempted to do that.

00:47:29.610 --> 00:47:32.220
So compute v, then compute this.

00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:35.610
Then we have this, and then you
impose this as a constraint.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.720
So this is a limited
commitment constraint.

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:41.370
We've talked about
collateral constraints.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.000
It's very related to that.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.410
You can walk away,
but you might--

00:47:46.410 --> 00:47:48.980
with collateral, you have
to sacrifice something.

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:49.488
Not here.

00:47:49.488 --> 00:47:51.155
They actually keep
all of their capital.

00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:58.690
If we had financial savings,
then they would lose that.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.378
They would lose the stuff
they had in the bank.

00:48:01.378 --> 00:48:03.155
AUDIENCE: So what
keeps me from doing

00:48:03.155 --> 00:48:04.780
that is that the
continued valuation is

00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.130
going to be on that side?

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:12.700
This is playing ball, and this
is being tempted to pull out.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.940
It doesn't mean that it isn't
binding on the solution.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:17.560
This can do damage.

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.990
It could be a binding constraint
and have a big Lagrange

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.190
multiplier.

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.450
So the solution
will look different.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:28.120
But you never see the
out-of-equilibrium event

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.300
that they walk away.

00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:33.030
But the damage can be done.

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:34.680
Not getting a whole
lot of capital,

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.390
not having a whole
lot of insurance--

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:38.870
those things happen.

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:42.950
I mean, again, it's rich
guys who would prefer, say,

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.743
not to pay into the system.

00:48:45.743 --> 00:48:46.910
They're going to be tempted.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:52.010
So you start eliminating
the people that pay in,

00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:54.400
and that starts limiting
the insurance, et cetera,

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:54.900
et cetera.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:04.770
And then finally, we
have this hidden output.

00:49:04.770 --> 00:49:08.370
So here, the idea is income
is produced, all right,

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:12.420
but the outsiders
don't see what it is.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:12.920
OK.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:16.510
But then you say,
well, tell me anyway.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.410
Send me a message.

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.890
So the idea here
is q is actually--

00:49:22.890 --> 00:49:30.510
q bar is actually realized,
and the business says so.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:31.150
Believe me.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.440
My profits are low.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.500
Or-- and they are low.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:44.260
Or q bar is realized, but we
have this counterfactual where

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.212
he says something else about q.

00:49:47.212 --> 00:49:48.670
Maybe in that
particular period, it

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:52.330
was advantageous to say profits
are really, really high,

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.690
or it could be vice versa.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:57.310
When they're high, you say high.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:59.210
When they're low,
you're tempted--

00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.710
sorry.

00:49:59.710 --> 00:50:00.970
When they're low, you say low.

00:50:00.970 --> 00:50:04.230
And when they're high,
you're tempted to say low.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:05.170
All right?

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:09.940
This allows for any q that they
will, quote, tell the truth.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.720
Well, great.

00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:12.430
It's just another inequality.

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.070
No problemo.

00:50:15.070 --> 00:50:17.780
We know how to
generate constraints.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.780
But again, it will
do different damage.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:27.420
There's going to be consequences
for the underlying contract.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.810
And remember, the goal
here is to get to the data.

00:50:31.810 --> 00:50:34.320
You can assume these
parametric utility functions--

00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:39.540
constant relative risk aversion,
power sigma, disutility

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:46.240
of effort, a power
of Frisch elasticity.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:47.350
OK?

00:50:47.350 --> 00:50:50.020
So 3-- we're going to
be limited, actually.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:54.160
We're going to estimate
sigma and theta, xe equal 1.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.080
Here's a production function.

00:50:56.080 --> 00:50:59.170
We actually load in
an observed histogram.

00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:02.500
But you can do constant
elasticity of substitution

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:03.340
if you want.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:03.840
Yep?

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.493
AUDIENCE: So you [? test ?] one
where you can verify a state?

00:51:07.493 --> 00:51:09.160
Because now the output
is hidden, right?

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:09.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:10.270
I didn't do it.

00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:13.010
AUDIENCE: Why not?

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.220
PROFESSOR: I forgot about
costly state application.

00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:17.590
But anyway, it's doable.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.440
Hong's working on it.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.960
And these other things,
like the discount rate,

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.250
the depreciation rate,
the outside interest rate,

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:30.090
and so on.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:32.600
So this is very much in
the spirit of calibration.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:35.600
These numbers are
similar to numbers

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.720
you've seen in various
papers in the classes trying

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.800
to be somewhat realistic.

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.410
Yep.

00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:45.580
AUDIENCE: When we're [INAUDIBLE]
looking at the matrix p of q

00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.535
given c an dk.

00:51:46.535 --> 00:51:51.857
Is that just for setting up
the moral hazard constraint?

00:51:51.857 --> 00:51:52.440
PROFESSOR: No.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:54.100
We need that in general.

00:51:54.100 --> 00:51:55.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:59.540
PROFESSOR: So we're going to say
that we see effort even though,

00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:04.370
in the models, sometimes
it's unobserved.

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:06.860
I mean, the question is what
an outside lender would see,

00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:10.450
not what the households tell
us when we interview them.

00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:12.190
So anyway, we take
the stand that we

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:15.820
see a good version of
it, and capital as well,

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:16.960
and we see output.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.480
And I think that--

00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.020
let's see where that is.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:24.240
Oh, my god.

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.320
It's way-- there it was.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:32.610
So there is an
empirical histogram

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:35.910
of capital, labor, and output.

00:52:35.910 --> 00:52:39.750
I don't know if you really
get a three-dimensional view

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:41.280
of that thing.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:44.700
I can kind of see it's bending
over here, and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.950
flip on me.

00:52:45.950 --> 00:52:50.700
But-- so we can load that
in, or we can actually say,

00:52:50.700 --> 00:52:54.840
no, no, no, it's CES, some
elasticity of substitution,

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:59.026
and estimate whether it's
[INAUDIBLE] for linear

00:52:59.026 --> 00:53:02.050
or stuck in between.

00:53:02.050 --> 00:53:02.747
Yep?

00:53:02.747 --> 00:53:04.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:09.470
On graphic views, is there a
way to understand [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.580
whether those--

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:14.340
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but
it's kind of hard

00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:17.160
because I don't know
what this thing is doing.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.250
It doesn't look visually
like it kept going down.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.260
It may actually come back.

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.470
By the way, it makes my point.

00:53:25.470 --> 00:53:29.070
We don't have to assume
any kind of concavity

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:31.950
in the underlying primitives.

00:53:31.950 --> 00:53:35.880
If it has this sort of
scallop shape, wonderful.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.830
Bring on the lotteries.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:41.460
Then it will span the arc line.

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.950
We can even allow
risk-loving households here.

00:53:43.950 --> 00:53:45.750
I mean, there's
really no restriction

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:47.100
in the underlying perimeters.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:51.970
We have parameterized utilities
to make people risk-averse,

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:55.620
but in principle, we don't
have to put restrictions

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.610
on what we load in.

00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:01.620
OK.

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.320
So preferences, technology--

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:08.920
I'll just say a few words
about dimensionality.

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:13.240
As we go through autarky
savings, full information,

00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.730
moral hazard, et
cetera, you can start

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:17.650
counting the number of
linear programs that

00:54:17.650 --> 00:54:22.030
need to be solved, the number
of variables in each program,

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.520
the numbers of constraints.

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.640
I didn't even dare show you
this unobserved investment one,

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.590
but the hidden output
is getting up there too.

00:54:31.590 --> 00:54:35.260
We actually have a technology
to compute these things

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.780
with hundreds of
thousands of constraints.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.750
I mean, the commercial
code is CPLEX,

00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:44.350
and there's open freeware
that's comparable to it.

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:48.100
It's the latest
Princeton interior point.

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.430
It's not just a
simplex algorithm.

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:54.460
You can use it as a
student, actually.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.530
It cost me a couple
thousand dollars.

00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:02.920
But anyway, so we can
handle fairly large numbers.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:08.600
Now, that said, what's
the tension here?

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.910
Well, you're going
to see not only

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.830
do you have to iterate
off the value functions

00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:17.930
and solve the linear program
at each iteration and solve--

00:55:17.930 --> 00:55:19.340
this is just one step.

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:25.340
But then we don't even know
what the parameters are.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:30.470
So then we got to do it for all
the set of possible parameters

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:33.770
and generate a likelihood.

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:36.740
So these guys start to get
demanding not because you can't

00:55:36.740 --> 00:55:39.860
solve it once in
20 or 30 seconds,

00:55:39.860 --> 00:55:45.620
but because you've got to do it
hundreds and hundreds of times.

00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:48.890
So you can understand
why there's

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:52.760
a big interest in having
relatively efficient code.

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:58.370
It starts to constrain you in
terms of the kinds of problems

00:55:58.370 --> 00:56:01.970
you really want to consider.

00:56:01.970 --> 00:56:03.260
All right.

00:56:03.260 --> 00:56:08.400
So how does it work
computationally?

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:13.980
Well, once you solve for the
optimizing policy pi star,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:16.530
you have a transition
function, basically.

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.990
You start with promised
utility and capital

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.930
today, integrate
out over everything

00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:24.990
else other than capital
and utility tomorrow,

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:27.030
and you get the
probability of that.

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.970
So you get this
Markov object, right?

00:56:29.970 --> 00:56:32.280
It's simple enough
conceptually--

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.160
the probability of states
tomorrow given states today.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:40.700
So that's kind of the
underlying dynamic engine

00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:44.590
that's chugging along for each
one of these financial regimes.

00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:48.470
And then any time you
pick up certain w and k

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:51.680
in the solution, you can
generate the contract,

00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:54.950
because that's the stuff
that we just integrated out.

00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:55.910
But it's still there.

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:58.430
You can still use it.

00:56:58.430 --> 00:57:03.440
So we can generate
histograms, CQ configurations.

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.180
We can have two cross-sections.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.190
We can have panel.

00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:09.680
There are some limits in terms
of the length of the panel

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.775
that we can actually use.

00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:15.700
You still with me?

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:22.480
We've got to estimate
some parameters,

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.380
so we're going to have
these underlying structural

00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:27.840
parameters.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.450
We don't see, say, the
distribution of promised

00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:34.200
utility, so we're going to
imagine that's generated maybe

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.810
like a normal distribution
with a certain mean

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:40.140
and a certain variance, and
we have to estimate those.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.090
Better yet would be
a mixture of normals

00:57:42.090 --> 00:57:45.010
which can approximate
any old thing you want,

00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:47.760
but that raises the dimensions.

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:52.290
And we're trying to be lean in
terms of numbers of parameters.

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:55.020
So what do I mean by likelihood?

00:57:55.020 --> 00:57:58.260
The probability of
getting observables y,

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:03.120
which could be in a
static cross-section,

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:06.990
values of consumption, output,
investment, and capital.

00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:10.140
What's the probability of seeing
a particular configuration

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.430
like that given the
observed capital today

00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:16.770
as a function of these
underlying parameter values?

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:26.170
So because the model is
already using lotteries,

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:28.960
you already get the
probability of these objects.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:34.260
It just sort of comes
for free as part

00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:36.990
of the optimizing solution.

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:41.220
Now, the next thing is, do
we see things perfectly?

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:44.100
No, not necessarily.

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.200
We can put in--

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.600
let me jump a second.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:55.950
We can put in measurement
error and say if c star at j

00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:58.590
were the true value,
we don't see it.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.090
We see some measured
version with error.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.070
So this is classic
econometric contamination,

00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:06.600
classical measurement error.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:12.260
We can put that on
everything that you like.

00:59:12.260 --> 00:59:18.970
And then the program
would say, what

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:23.590
is the probability
the underlying output

00:59:23.590 --> 00:59:26.530
and consumption would
be c star and q star?

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.870
That we generate from the code.

00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:32.470
And then we can say, well,
what we see is c having q hat,

00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:35.870
so that could come from
any c star and q star.

00:59:35.870 --> 00:59:38.530
So you get a new sort of
distribution of observables.

00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:46.340
Well, that's what I
just said in words.

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:58.970
Well, what's the point
of the likelihood?

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.390
We actually have the
data, and we see people

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:05.180
with a certain capital stock
getting a certain output

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.640
and having a
certain consumption,

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.930
investing a certain amount.

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:11.380
These are our observables.

01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:15.190
And so we see the
histogram in the data,

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:18.310
and now we have a
histogram in the model.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:20.980
So we can say, does it--

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.480
what parameters would
best rationalize the data

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.050
if the data came from
that financial regime,

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.130
a particular one?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:46.490
So let me-- so I said
we have these data.

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:51.380
This is Kansas and the Rocky
Mountains for Thailand.

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:58.700
A mixed metaphor, but
it's also the investment.

01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.510
Consumption is,
again, pretty flat,

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:04.820
so it's going to
suggest a regime where

01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.500
there's a lot of
consumption smoothing

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.600
against income fluctuations.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.010
On the other hand,
investment isn't flat.

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.920
And I haven't even shown you
the transitions in the capital

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:16.890
stock.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:37.300
So when you-- you pick the
rural data, and you use, say--

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:40.780
say choose consumption
and output only.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:46.690
There's a tie.

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:50.620
If you believed it was moral
hazard regime-- for example,

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.990
it's estimating the
degree of risk aversion

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:57.010
at 1.02, the Frisch
elasticity at 1.6.

01:01:57.010 --> 01:01:59.860
It's got a certain mean and
variance of this underlying

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.310
unseen distribution of promised
utilities and an estimate

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:04.390
of the measurement error.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.110
And it does this for
each financial regime

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:14.720
against the same data.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:18.920
And then we use this sort
of information criterion,

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:23.270
which Vong created,
which allows testing

01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:26.160
across non-nested regimes.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.630
In this case, it's a tie.

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:34.640
But if you went to the
investment data alone,

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.780
it would be savings,
savings only.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:42.590
So in the rural data,
we get a limited regime.

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:45.870
I probably won't have time
to show you the Monte Carlos.

01:02:45.870 --> 01:02:47.750
The Monte Carlos are like this.

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:50.210
You pick a set of parameter
values, maybe the ones

01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:52.700
we estimate in the
data, for example,

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.120
and then generate the
data from the model,

01:02:57.120 --> 01:02:58.490
and then go through all of this.

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:03.140
And depending on the degree
of measurement area--

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:07.070
error that you use to
contaminate the data, you can--

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:09.530
especially when you use joint
consumption and investment

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:14.070
data, you pretty much
get back what you put in,

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.260
which is reassuring.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.670
But it's a bit black boxy.

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:19.010
We don't have an analytic proof.

01:03:22.850 --> 01:03:28.790
So if you use consumption data
alone, two cross-sections,

01:03:28.790 --> 01:03:32.180
you can use two-year panels.

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.120
Then there's-- in
the rural data,

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:37.850
it's kind of hard to
pin down too much.

01:03:37.850 --> 01:03:40.220
In terms of the regime,
moral hazard is in there.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:42.110
Sometimes full
information is in there.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:44.090
Limited commitment is in there.

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:48.080
But again, when you use
the investment data alone

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:51.140
or use the joint data,
it's pretty clear

01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:55.520
that savings only, no
borrowing, buffer stock model

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.040
is the one that the
data like the best.

01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:08.380
But when we-- if we
use the network alone--

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.750
you're saying, well,
you've contradicted-- no.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:13.310
Like, what Cynthia
and I do, and so on,

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:17.260
we can actually get the
full information regime out

01:04:17.260 --> 01:04:18.700
of the consumption data.

01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:22.270
So that's very reassuring
because in those other papers,

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:25.140
we didn't use this method.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:30.610
There's a lot of consumption
smoothing among the networks.

01:04:30.610 --> 01:04:33.330
And if we go to
the urban data, we

01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:40.410
get this result that even when
we use the investment data,

01:04:40.410 --> 01:04:43.560
it's the moral hazard regime,
not the limited savings

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:45.620
only regime.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.910
So they're different across
the two specifications,

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:53.600
although it is true that if you
used the investment data alone,

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.900
it would still like savings.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.120
So there's still this--

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.860
and we've talked about this--

01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:05.750
money doesn't flow from
unproductive to productive

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:12.730
people the way these relatively
unconstrained regimes would

01:05:12.730 --> 01:05:13.390
imply.

01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:16.690
However, if you looked at
the consumption data jointly,

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:18.430
then it's one likelihood.

01:05:18.430 --> 01:05:22.120
And it decides in the urban area
that, oh, well, moral hazard

01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.820
actually fits better
than savings only,

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.750
but the reverse is
true in the rural data.

01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:33.550
So although the investment
data doesn't fit perfectly well

01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:43.870
in the urban data,
the verdict is

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:47.600
we do a ton of
robustness checks.

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:48.820
And I'll skip it.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:53.350
So let me just--

01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.500
I really want to say
something about heterogeneity,

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:05.480
but I'd rather show you three
slides before I quit-- namely,

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.980
in the actual rural data,
this sort of diagonal

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:15.020
here represents the persistence
of the capital stock.

01:06:15.020 --> 01:06:17.970
So it doesn't move much.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:19.750
It moves very slowly.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:24.060
You can hardly see
mass off the diagonal.

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:28.710
In the urban data,
it's still sluggish,

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:32.640
but at least you
can move away more.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:35.020
If you have this wonderful
financial regime,

01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:37.680
you're going to adjust almost
instantaneously to the observed

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.400
productivity.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.910
So this speed of adjustment
of the capital stock

01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:44.610
is really the thing
that's kind of pushing

01:06:44.610 --> 01:06:47.940
the likelihood toward
limited financial regimes.

01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:51.330
By the way, these are
the best-fitting regimes

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:53.610
through the lens
of the model, which

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:57.944
still have an excessive
amount of smoothing.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.110
These are the time series--

01:07:05.110 --> 01:07:09.550
levels of consumption over time,
levels of the capital stock,

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:10.870
levels of income.

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.270
We did not use all of this data.

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:15.940
This is like setting aside
certain things in the data

01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:21.070
and then looking after the
fact as a new criterion.

01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:22.890
And we're doing pretty well.

01:07:22.890 --> 01:07:27.970
The standard deviations,
we do less well,

01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:31.540
but for obvious reasons that
there are stuff in the tails

01:07:31.540 --> 01:07:35.020
that the model doesn't like.

01:07:35.020 --> 01:07:39.040
But if we smooth
off 1% of the tails

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.470
and kind of get rid
of it, we actually

01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:45.230
bring the standard deviations
generated by the model much,

01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:50.740
much closer to the data.

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:55.300
And we can actually use
the level on borrowing,

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.800
which we didn't use [? an ?]
[? estimate, ?] and got really,

01:07:57.800 --> 01:08:00.510
really close to that.

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:04.200
And finally, here is
this data on the return

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:10.290
on assets with these low-wealth
households having high returns.

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:15.140
And the savings only
regime which fits best

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:17.877
is trying to do that.

01:08:17.877 --> 01:08:19.710
And this is the urban
data, which is already

01:08:19.710 --> 01:08:21.330
a little more
dispersed, but it still

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:26.100
has this low-wealth,
high-return guise.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.359
And it can generate
that somewhat

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:31.560
with this moral hazard.

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.330
So these are the
familiar objects

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:35.189
that we've been looking at.

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:42.420
And finally, let me
just end with this.

01:08:45.670 --> 01:08:46.170
Sorry.

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:48.212
I guess that discussion
at the beginning of class

01:08:48.212 --> 01:08:51.000
took a chunk of time.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.240
So if you believe
the structural model,

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.300
you can do policy evaluation.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:58.640
And here we're doing
something simple

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:02.220
like just changing
the interest rate.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:07.310
Now, the point is some people
win, and some people lose.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:11.870
And also, who are the
winners and the losers

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:15.020
depends on the financial regime.

01:09:15.020 --> 01:09:19.689
So this is the consumption
equivalent welfare gain

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:23.990
of lowering the interest rate.

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:27.200
Negative and positive--
this is as we

01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:28.880
vary the level of
current savings

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:30.590
and the level of assets.

01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:34.970
But this is what it would look
like if it were not the savings

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:38.840
regime, but the borrowing regime
at the estimated parameters

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.240
we get.

01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:44.330
And then this is the
difference of those two.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:47.490
So it's another
difference and difference,

01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:50.210
but it's a difference
in the welfare criteria

01:09:50.210 --> 01:09:52.399
across two financial regimes.

01:09:52.399 --> 01:09:56.490
And the point is it
matters quite a lot,

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.690
if you did this interest
rate subsidy, what

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:04.700
the financial regime is in
terms of who wins and who loses.

01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:08.580
These are non-trivial
gains, and so on.

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:09.080
All right.

01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:11.240
I'll quit there.

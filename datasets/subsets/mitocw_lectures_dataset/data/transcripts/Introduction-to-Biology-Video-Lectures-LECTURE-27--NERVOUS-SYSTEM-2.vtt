WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Good morning. Thank you. So,
I want to continue today on the

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
theme of neurobiology. Last
time we spoke about the action

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
potential mechanism. Today
I'd like to go from action

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
potential to the synapse. But
let me briefly remind us what we

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
say. So, I'm going to give
section zero a recap here.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The relevant things that we said
last time was there's a membrane

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
potential which at rest is about
minus 70 millivolts as the membrane

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
potential, and that's what we work
with. That membrane potential is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.000
set up by concentration gradients.
More calcium, more potassium on the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
inside. More sodium on the outside.
More calcium on the outside. And

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I'm also going to mention chloride,
there's more chloride on the outside

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
at 116 millimolar, four
millimolar on the outside.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
These concentration gradients are
set up by various different pumps.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They're there all the time. Then
we have this resting channel.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So, here we have transporters.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We have a resting potassium channel.
It means that it's open all the

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
time. It's not
activated by anything.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That allows potassium to leave.
Potassium leaves until it builds up

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
this membrane potential about
minus 70. At that point it is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
electrically unfavorable for more
positive charges to go out into the

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
more positive environment.
Notwithstanding the greater

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
internal concentration.
And we reach an equilibrium

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
potential of minus 70. We
then have some voltage-gated

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
channels.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And the voltage-gated channels
come in two flavors here.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We have the voltage-gated sodium
channel. The voltage-gated sodium

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
channel opens itself up
around minus 70. Oh, sorry,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
around minus 50. So, if
you can get up to minus 50

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it opens up. Then your sodium
rushes in. It shifts the membrane

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
potential from minus
50 to zero to plus 50.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The channel shuts. Somewhere
around plus 30 or so

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000
opens the potassium channel, the
voltage graded potassium channel,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and allows the potassium to rush out
and restore the resting potential.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The effect of this is that,
if this is zero here, we have

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a resting potential. If we
climb up a little bit above it

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
we shoot up and then we come back
down. And then a millisecond or so

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
later another action potential
could go down that same neuron.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And, last of all, if we look
along the length of an axon,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
an action potential here causes
charges to migrate over which

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
launches an action potential here
which causes charges to migrate over

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which etc., etc. propagates
an action potential down

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the length. It's
a beautiful system.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And then the very last thing was
that by insulating this we were able

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to make the conduction velocity
go faster by effectively making the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
effective length be shorter there
being a whole bunch of electrically

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
insulated regions. So,
that's it. It's a beautiful

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
piece of engineering. How do
we know any of this is true?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
As an interesting
side point,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I might just mention that
when this was worked out,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
this was worked out by two
folks called Hodgkin and Huxley.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Hodgkin and Huxley won a Nobel
prize for this beautiful work on

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
this squid giant axon which is
the fastest axon that there is.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And here we're not talking about
the giant squid somebody raised last

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
time. It's an ordinary squid.
It has one big fat axon. It's

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
sufficiently big that you can just
like stick a wire in the middle of

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it and all that.
It's a very big axon.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's a very, very
high diameter axon.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And they were able to measure
these things electrically.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And on the basis of the electrical
measurements they made in different

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
kinds of solutions, they
were able to infer the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
existence of sodium channels
and potassium channels.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But this all happened mid 20th
century. And they certainly

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
couldn't see any. They
couldn't clone them.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They couldn't see anything. And
so the notion that there were

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
individual molecular channels that
swung open, did all this stuff was

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
an indirect inference, maybe
kind of a little bit like

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Mendel's inference of a gene
or Sturtevant's inference

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of genetic maps. But more
recently people have come

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
along with an extraordinary
technology, also these people won a

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Nobel prize for this because it was
way cool, which is called the Patch

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Clamp. The patch clamp is the
following ridiculously simple

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000
technology. Suppose I were
to make a glass pipette.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So, this is a cross-section
of a glass pipette.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So, it goes around like that.
And I could bring it up really

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
tight up against the membrane.
And suppose I did it in such a way

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that I could get a really great
seal and I just have a teeny patch of

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
membrane. Suppose that teeny
patch of membrane had just

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
one channel in it. And
now, so this is a pipette,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
suppose I were to rip off that
patch of membrane from the cell,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
poor cell, and have a glass pipette
with a little patch of membrane on

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
its end with a single
isolated ion channel. Now,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
if I measured the current through
this channel by putting it in an

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
appropriate solution,
maybe I ripped off a resting

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
potassium channel, OK? If
I put this in a potassium

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
solution and I apply a current,
I apply a voltage difference, I

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
should be able to see a current.
And you can actually measure a

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
current. Even more cool, if I
do this and I've ripped off a

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
voltage-gated sodium channel, then
it turns out that I ought to be

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
able to study its properties by
changing the voltage on it and

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
measuring the current as
a function of the voltage.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And, well, it turns out that if I do
this I'm able to measure in resting

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
or in these voltage-gated channels
current flows conductivities,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
actually, what I'm really measuring
is the conductivity of the channel

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
like this, I can see the channel
opening and closing and opening and

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000
closing quantily. I
can measure quantily the

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
conductivity. That's not quantum
mechanics. It's just quanta

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
measurements of the conductivity.
What would happen if I had two

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
channels that had been ripped
off? Now I'd see it go like this.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Well, maybe another one opens.
Oops, now one closes. Now the

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
other one closes. And
quite remarkably you can get

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
this. So, you can study single
molecule, single molecular channels.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
You want to know how this channel
opens and at what voltage it opens?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Just dial in the voltage and see if
it's open. Do you want to know how

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
long it stays open? Just
turn it on and see how long it

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
stays open. It's really cool.
You want to see if any other

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
chemicals could affect it, any
ions, any other intracellular or

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
extra cellular
chemicals? You can do it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, the ability to study isolated
single channels came along with

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
patch clamping. And what
it allows is a tremendous

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
study of the biophysics
of individual channels.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And, whereas, before people had to
look at the total conductivity of an

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
entire axon. Now they're able,
and from that infer the behavior of

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
single channels, now what
they can do is study the

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
behavior of single channels and
synthetically build up a picture of

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the total conductivity of an axon
from its individual components and

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
see if the components we've
identified are sufficient to explain

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the behavior that we see.
Anyway, that's patch clamping.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Lots of fun. So, now, what I
want to turn now to is signaling

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:59.000
at the synapse.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, we have our cell body here.
It's got its dendrites on it.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Here's our axon. We've
managed to get an action

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
potential started on it and
it moves all the way down.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Now we get here to one
of the synaptic terminals.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The electrical signal makes it all
the way to the synaptic terminal,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000
but how does it affect
the post-synaptic cell?

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Well, let's get a
close-up of that.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Here we go. Here's the synaptic
terminal. We've got our action

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
potential coming.
Action potential coming.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And then it gets here.
Action potential's arrived.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I would like to release
chemicals into the synaptic cleft,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the space between the pre
and the post-synaptic cell.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:20.000
I'd like to spill out chemicals
that are neurotransmitters.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So, the pre-synaptic cell
conveniently has vesicles,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:37.000
little membrane-bound vesicles
with prepackaged neurotransmitters.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
OK? These prepackaged
neurotransmitters have been

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
conveniently synthesized by the
cell and they're just sitting there

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
waiting to be released in
response to an action potential.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
When the action potential comes,
it causes these synaptic vesicles to

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:08.000
fuse --

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
-- with the membrane. And
in fusing the insides become

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
continuous with the outsides,
here's a little fusion picture here,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the neurotransmitters
leak out. OK?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
How does it do that,
though, mechanistically?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
How in the world does an action
potential cause these vesicles to

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
fuse with the membrane? Well,
somehow it's got to read out

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
electrical activity into some
kind of a chemical activity

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
intracellularly.
Here's what it does.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
When the electrical signal comes
down, remember originally the

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
membrane potential is negative,
but when an action potential comes

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
by what does it do to the
membrane potential? It reverses it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:19.000
It makes it positive inside briefly.
OK? So, this is the sign of an

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
action potential,
an AP coming down.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
In this membrane we have us
another voltage-sensitive channel.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
This voltage sensitive channel is
a voltage sensitive calcium channel.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
OK? Who would like to design a
voltage-sensitive calcium channel?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
What should it do? What would you
like to have its opening and closing

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
properties be?
When does it open?

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
At a positive charge. So,
when you get to a positive

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
membrane potential it swings
open. And then what does it do?

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Lets calcium move. Which
way does calcium want to go?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
In because it's more out. So,
what's going to happen is in

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
response to the action
potential calcium will rush in.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Now, calcium, you will recall,
was in vanishingly small traces

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
inside, 0.1 micromolar we said.
And influx of calcium is a very

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
serious matter and it is
sensed by variety of proteins.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
In particular, there is,
floating around in the

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
cell, a protein here called a
calcium-dependent protein kinase.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The calcium-dependent
protein kinase

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
is a protein that is capable
of putting a phosphate group.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Its kinase puts a phosphate
group on other proteins.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, the calcium-dependent protein
kinase over here will go along and

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
catalyze the addition of a
phosphate group to other proteins.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So, it will enzymaticly catalyze
this. But it only does so in the

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
presence of calcium. So,
when there's calcium in the

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
cell, the calcium-dependent kinase
is activated and it runs around and

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
sticks phosphate groups on
specific target proteins.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You know where one of those target
proteins lives? In the vesicles.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The vesicles happen to
be a target for this. So,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
the vesicles have a protein on them.
And in one of these extraordinary

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
coincidences in molecular biology,
the protein on the synaptic vesicle

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
happens to be called,
coincidently, synapsin.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
OK? It's not actually entirely
a coincidence that it's called

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
synapsin. It was named synapsin
because it was found on the synaptic

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
vesicles, obviously. And
so what happens is when the

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
action potential comes down it
causes the calcium channel to open

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
in response to positive
voltage. Calcium comes in,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
actives at the kinase. The
kinase phosphorilates synapsin.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And now the phosphorilated form of
synapsin likes to bind to something

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
in the membrane. That's
it. How many of you still

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
know what a Rube Goldberg machine
is? Good. OK. This is one of these

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
just great, well, others
of you should look it up on

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
the Web because they're just great
cartoons, the Rube Goldberg cartoons

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
about the machine where the rooster
crows startling the cat which tugs

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
the thing with causes this to flop
which causes the eggs to go in the

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
pan which causes the thing
to cook which causes whatever.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And I always think about these
in terms of great molecular Rube

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Goldberg machines. So,
this is the Rube Goldberg

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
machine that gets this
synaptic vesicle to fuse there.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
OK? Good. Every bit of
neurobiology has a molecular

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
mechanism to be explained like
this. So, now let's go onto the next

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
bit. How does this
signal gets sensed at

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
the next cell?
What are we up to?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Number three. So, let's
look at a specific junction.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Instead of looking at the
junction between two nerve cells,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000
let me start with the junction
between a nerve cell and a muscle

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
cell, the neuromuscular junction.
OK? So, I've now replaced my

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
post-synaptic neuron by a
muscle fiber here. This is

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:38.000
a muscle fiber. So, when
it spritzes out the stuff

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
the neurons that innervate
muscle fibers, actually,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I'm going to expand that a bit,
the neurons that innervate muscle

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:57.000
fibers, here's the muscle, and
I'll put it at some distance

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
here, muscle, spray out a
particular transmitter in response

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to the calcium influx. And
that transmitter is called

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
acetylcholine,
henceforth ACH.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Acetylcholine is spritzed out into
the synaptic cleft and comes out.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And what do you think
acetylcholine is going to do?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
I've got to send the chemical
signal to the next cell.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I've got to somehow send
that signal to the surface.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
It's going to bind to
something on the next cell.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
You know the deal, right?
So, it's going to have to

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
bind to a protein on this cell.
And, remarkably, what it binds to

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
is called an acetylcholine receptor.
OK? Very reasonable stuff. An

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
acetylcholine receptor. The
acetylcholine receptor happens

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.000
to be an ion channel, but
it's not a voltage-gated ion

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
channel. It's not an ion channel
that opens in response to the

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
voltage. It's an ion channel that
opens in response to acetylcholine.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
It's what we'd call a ligand-gated
ion channel because it's gated by a

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:31.000
ligand, acetylcholine. So,
this guy here is a ligand-gated

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:39.000
ion channel which, when
acetylcholine binds to it,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000
swings open. And what it
does is it allows in sodium.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Bingo. Now, when sodium comes in
what happens? Action potential.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:04.000
But what a second.
This is a muscle.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:12.000
All membranes have
the machinery to

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
have an action potential? Nah,
liver cells are pretty passive.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
You do this to a liver
cell it kind of sits there.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
But muscle cells do have an
action potential mechanism.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
They do respond here like a neuron,
an action potential. And so what

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
happens when I open up some sodium
channels to the resting potential

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
of my muscle? What was
the resting potential of my

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
muscle? About minus 70. What
happens when I open up these

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
ligand-gated sodium channels?
Sodium rushes in. What does it do

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000
to my membrane potential?
It makes it more positive.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
What does that do? It triggers
an action potential spreading

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
throughout the muscle. And
because the muscle has an

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000
action
potential --

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
-- all you have to do is manage to
get this going in a little patch of

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
the muscle and it spreads
throughout the muscle fiber.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
One neuromuscular synapse will be
sufficient to activate the muscle,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
in principle, because you have
this action potential mechanism.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And then when the action potential
fires in the muscle it actually

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
causes other channels to open,
including some calcium channels.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
The calcium channels cause calcium
to come in. The calcium causes your

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
muscle to contract because of
sliding of actins and myosins and

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
things like that.
That's how it works.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000
That's this Rube Goldberg machine.
All right. So, let's get ready.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Let's fire. Let's send a
neuromuscular signal down.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Contract. Now here's the problem.
I've got all this acetylcholine

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
sitting around in my synapse
activating the ligand-gated sodium

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
channel causing sodium to come in,
but I would like to relax my muscle,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
please. What are we
going to do about this?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:24.000
I could trigger
another channel,

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
and maybe it could be a delayed
acetylcholine activated yeah,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, that's
possible. I could have it close

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
itself. These are all perfectly
reasonable possibilities,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
and we're going to refer them
to the engineering committee.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
What else? You could get rid of
the acetylcholine some other way.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
It turns out the latter
is the solution here.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
We would like to have some enzyme
that chews up the acetylcholine.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.000
How about acetylcholinesterase?
So, let's put acetylcholinesterase,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
ACHE, acetylcholinesterase
in the synaptic cleft.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Then when I spritz acetylcholine
it gets to the other side,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000
but very rapidly the
acetylcholinesterase is degrading it.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
And so it has a very short time
of persistence in the synaptic

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
cleft. OK?
That works. So,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
that's how I run a
neuromuscular junction. OK?

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
So, acetylcholinesterase
is very important. Now,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
again, as with many of the
things I've talked about,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
we really know these things are true
when we're able to inhibit them in

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
different ways. So, I
want to take a moment and

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:03.000
talk about drugs and toxins.
Because they help us to probe these

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:11.000
different processes.
Anybody ever have fugu?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Does anybody know what fugu is?
What's fugu? It's a blowfish.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Right. It's a puffer fish eaten
in sushi, and it's an extraordinary

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000
delicacy. And why is that? Right.
Because it's one of the only

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
sushis where you really have to
worry about improper preparation,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
not just giving you food poisoning
or a stomachache or something like

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
that, but it's lethal prepared
incorrectly. The reason it's lethal

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
incorrectly prepared is because
the blowfish has a specific poison

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
called tetrodotoxin.
So, if you eat sushi,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
so, in fact, chefs in Japan
require a license to prepare fugu

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
for customers. Every
once, every couple of years

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000
some famous actor or personality
prepares his or her own fugu and

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
dies from it and it's in the papers.
Seriously. This has happened to

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:22.000
people. They're able to do this.
Anyway, tetrodotoxin, tetrodotoxin

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:29.000
is from puffer fish, fugu.
Why does this stuff kill you?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It turns out that what tetrodotoxin
does, this wonderful poison from

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:43.000
this sushi, is that it irreversibly
binds, irreversible binding and

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:50.000
inhibition of voltage-gated
sodium channels.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Why would this be an
inadvisable thing to have?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Suppose you irreversibly bound to
and inhibited your sodium channels,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
your voltage-gated sodium
channels, what would you be unable

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
to accomplish? An
action potential.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:14.000
This is ill-advised to be unable
to accomplish an action potential.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
You can imagine that what it leads
to then is a paralysis and a very

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
serious one, and if it's
irreversible this is not a good

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000
thing. There are other things.
Has anyone ever fired poison darts

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
in South American
jungles? [LAUGHTER]

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Well, if you have, you
would have tipped them with

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
qurare. Qurare is used to make
poison darts. What qurare does is

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:55.000
it reversibly binds,
still not good, but it's a

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:02.000
reversible binder to the
acetylcholine receptor and it

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000
prevents it, it blocks the
binding of acetylcholine.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Your acetylcholine receptors,
therefore, cannot respond to your

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
acetylcholine.
What will that do?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
A flaccid paralysis because
you're unable to move your muscles.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
So, if you were trying to shoot
prey in the forest and you send the

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
poison dart that has qurare,
it will cause the animal to then

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000
flop over. Yes?
Snakes. Ooh,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:43.000
what kind of snakes?
Venomous steak snakes,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
yeah. [LAUGHTER] Like bungarus
snakes, the really poisonous ones.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.000
So, it turns out, great question,
that they make something called

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
alpha-bungerotoxin.
Venomous snakes,

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000
next thing on my list, exactly.
The only improvement they

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
make here is that this is
an irreversible binder to the

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
acetylcholine receptors. Very
impressive stuff. Different

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:27.000
stuff. We'll come back to
jellyfish. But, basically,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
everything you know out there that's
noxious is being noxious in some way

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
that affects molecular biology.
Not all of it affects the nervous

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
system. Those of you who like to
collect mushrooms may wish to avoid

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
amanitas mushrooms.
They make amanitas.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Amanitan is an irreversible
binder that affects polymerase,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
RNA polymerase. Not a good
thing to lose either. So,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
all parts of this course have
interesting poisons that will affect

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
it but we'll focus on the poisons
effecting neurobiology today.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And then there's a human made thing.
Do you remember the, well, those of

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
who have heard of World War I,
nerve gas or, in particular, who

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000
remember the attack in the
Tokyo subways with sarin,

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000
a particular kind of nerve gas.
Do you know what that stuff does?

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It is a potent inhibitor of
the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
What would happen if I inhibited
your acetylcholinesterase?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
The muscles tense up and I'm
unable to relieve them because,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
just like I was doing there,
because my acetylcholine is not

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:49.000
broken down in the synapse.
So, this is a nice menu of

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
interesting poisons and fun facts
to know and tell and good things to

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
avoid. There are more drugs and
things that we can come back to.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
So, now let's talk about,
let's move onto other synapses.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Let's take a look at
nerve-nerve synapses.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:16.000
So, we looked
at a nerve muscle

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
synapse. What were the properties
of this nerve muscle synapse?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Well, it had the property that a
single neuron innervates a single

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:35.000
muscle fiber. All right? This
was a one-to-one single fiber,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:42.000
sorry, single
neuron, single fiber.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:52.000
When we get to nerve-nerve synapses,
they're more complex. Multiple

00:30:52.000 --> 00:31:02.000
different nerve terminals may
synapse upon the same neuron,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:11.000
as I indicated last time. There
might be a thousand different

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
nerve terminals synapsing on the
dendrites of a postsynaptic cell,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:23.000
but let's look at one of them for a
moment. Then we'll come back to how

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
a thousand can work
together. So, here's one.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
And here's my dendrite
that I'm synapsing on here.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
The nerve terminal releases into,
sorry, into the synaptic cleft some

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:47.000
neurotransmitter. It turns
out there's a wide variety

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000
of neurotransmitters that get
released while the neuromuscular

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000
junction involves acetylcholine.
One example that might be involved

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
here is something called
glutamate. What's glutamate?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
It's an amino acid. Glutamic
acid. It's the ion of

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
glutamic acid. That actually
is a neurotransmitter.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Ever have monosodium glutamate.
Does anybody get a headache from

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:20.000
monosodium glutamate? I
do. That's because it's a

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.000
neurotransmitter. It
messes with brain chemistry.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
So, glutamate.
Glutamate is released.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And what is does is there is a
channel on the post-synaptic cell

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000
that binds glutamate. And
it, too, is a ligand-gated ion

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
channel. And it could be,
for example, a sodium channel.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Other neurotransmitters
might use other channels.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:03.000
What happens if I spritz some
glutamate on a dendrite of a cell

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:11.000
that has a glutamate-activated
sodium channel?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
What will happen in that dendrite?
Sodium will rush in causing the

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
membrane potential to become
depolarized and then positive and

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
then causing an action potential?
No. It turns out that that last

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
bit doesn't happen because the
dendrites don't have the action

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
potential machine. The
action potential machinery is

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000
interestingly confined to the axon.
It's not found on the dendrites.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:58.000
So, when we spritz with glutamate,
what will happen is if this is a

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:06.000
glutamate-bearing synaptic terminal
the membrane potential here will

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
become locally positive.
But it is not an explosive

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.000
regenerative action potential
because there are no voltage-gated

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
sodium channels that are going
to open in response to that local

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
depolarization. So, it
became a little positive

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
over in this corner of the neuron.
Now, if it gets a little positive

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
over in this corner of the neuron,
you know, it's going to draw some

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
negative charges from over
here, right, to offset that local

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
positivity. But if it's just a
local little patch of positive then

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000
it draws a little bit of negative
charge. But is that going to be

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.000
enough to depolarize over here?
No. So what do you want to do?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Have more. Suppose I
have two glutaminergic

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
synapses and they fire,
it might be. Probably not.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Maybe they have to fire at the same
time. Maybe if I have a hundred out

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
of a thousand. Imagine
that I have a hundred

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000
different glutaminergic synapses
that fired simultaneously then what

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.000
will happen? I'll get positive
charges at all of them.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
And maybe that's enough to draw some
negative charge away from the axon

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:37.000
and start an action potential going,
or maybe not. Maybe you need two

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
hundred. What if they don't
fire at exactly the same moment?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Well, the minute one fires
it makes it locally positive,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000
but then it starts restoring itself
so that if they're separated in time

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
they're not as effective as
if they happen simultaneously.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
So, we have an extraordinary
complex analog integration

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
circuit here. The analogy
integration circuit

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
depends on the temporal
arrival of these signals.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And what else does it depend on?
The number of the signals. So,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
let's get this down. We're
going to integrate the

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:36.000
signals here.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
It'll depend on their timing,
the number, and the geometry,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
because it turns out that doing
it at different places in the,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
now, I drew my dendritic tree,
the dendrites as all these little

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
hairy spikes coming off the cell
body, but the dendrites are vastly

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
more complex than that. Some
cells have elaborate dendritic

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
trees. The
dendritic tree,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
the dendrites of some neurons,
here's the cell body, can go off in

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
all sorts of wonderfully complex
patterns. And it may be more

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
effective to hit synapses close
to the cell body or synapses on

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
different parts of the tree.
And so that the entire shape of

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
that dendritic tree can have an
effect, and where you're hitting it

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:29.000
has an effect. So, whereas
the action potential is

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
a very simple thing, which
you might say just replace it

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
by a wire for our computer
modeling studies, goodness,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
nobody has actually succeeded in
building a perfect model of the

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:47.000
integration properties of an
dendritic arbor for a single neuron.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
They can get guess
and approximations.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000
So, there's an amazing
integration that's going on here.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
But it turns out that it's
more complex than that because,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000
you see, I said that we had these,
say, glutamate neurotransmitters

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
here that were causing
positive charges to rush in.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:18.000
It turns out there are other
neurotransmitters that activate

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000
other channels in the membrane.
And, for example, there are some

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
neurotransmitters that activate,
like glycine, another amino acid

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:43.000
activates ligand-gated
chloride channels.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
So, glutamate, one amino
acid activates sodium

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000
channels. Sodium rushes in.
Glycine activates chloride channels.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:00.000
What will chloride
do? It can come in.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
What will it do when it comes
in? Negative. Oh, my goodness. So,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.000
when glycine is spritz on the
post-synaptic cell chloride comes in

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:18.000
and the cell becomes locally
more negative. These are called

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:28.000
inhibitory synapses.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
By contrast those that admit
positive ions excitatory synapses.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Neurons can have
both inhibitory and

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:47.000
excitatory synapses
on their dendrites. So,

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
the postsynaptic cell will
be receiving positive signals,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
positive ions coming in from
excitatory synapse and negative

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
signals, inhibitory signals
with negative ions coming in.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
The integration of charge in the
dendritic arbor is an integration

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
problem of the timing,
number, geometry and sign,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
positive or negative, of
these activation signals.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
That's what's going on. And
what happens is the neuron

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
integrates these signals,
positive and negative. So,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.000
we'll make this one a glycine
neuron, negative, negative, negative.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
All that integration takes place
right over here in the region of the

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
cell called the axon hillock,
which is the first place that the

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
action potential mechanism is found.
And, of course, that integration is

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
nothing more and nothing less than
figuring out whether the membrane

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
potential gets above minus 50. If
it gets above minus 50 it fires.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:59.000
OK? Yes?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Does the nucleus participate in
the, in what way would the nucleus

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:11.000
participate?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
It's an interesting question. I
mean the nucleus does, in a sense.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
The geometry of that cell body
there has some effect on the

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
electrical properties and all
that, but if you think about the

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000
timescales. How often do neurons
fire? At a frequency often of about

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
a millisecond. So, that
means everything I've just

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000
old you, this complex integration
problem is occurring within

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
a millisecond. The processes
in the nucleus that I

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
think about typically of
transcription and translation and

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
all that are operating several
orders of magnitude more slowly than

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
that. You know, they'll
operate, even in the best of

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
circumstances, at seconds,
and often at more than

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
that, minutes before you could get
transcription and translation and

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
stuff like that going.
So, the nucleus, I think,

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:58.000
for the most part, better get its
act together by producing stuff and

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000
getting it out to the periphery,
but probably through the expression

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
of the genome can't do much in
a relevant millisecond or so.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
But I wouldn't be shocked if some
neurobiologist knows better than I

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
do that nucleoli do something.
I mean there are many cleaver

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
things that are going on. I'm
sure a cell has wasted anything,

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
but with respect to the operations
we've talked about probably not.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
OK? But I'm always reluctant to
say something never happens in any

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
possible way. All right. So,
now how does all this get stuck

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:28.000
together? Well, not
only do we have this

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.000
complex integration within
the dendritic arbor but,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:39.000
of course, the neurons are stuck
together into circuits themselves.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
If we had more time I would
draw the circuit that you use to

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
integrate complex functions in
calculus, but not having much time

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
I'm going to just go for a
much simpler circuit here.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I'm just going to go back to
nerves and muscles. And here we go.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Suppose I tap right here
below your knee. What happens?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
There's a reflex. Let's
at least get that going,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000
OK? What happens is when I
tap there above your patella,

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000
here's your kneecap here,
there's a sensory neuron.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
The sensory neuron brings out
a signal and it goes into the

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
spinal column here.
This is a reflex.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000
It doesn't need to go up to your
brain. You don't need to think a lot

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
about it. And it goes into the
spinal column here into the dorsal

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
root ganglia. This
is a cross-section.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
The, sorry, sensory neuron comes
in here. And what it does is that

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
sensory neuron makes a synapse,
and actually another synapse, and it

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
makes a synapse on a motor neuron.
The motor neuron comes back and

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:13.000
synapses on that very muscle. It
is the simplest possible circuit.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000
I sense, I send one sensory
signal up into the spinal cord,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:32.000
there's an excitatory positive
synapse onto a motor neuron,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:42.000
this motor neuron fires and
contracts my muscle so I go back.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000
At the same time, this
guy makes another synapse,

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:55.000
a positive excitatory synapse on a
little cell that is an interneuron,

00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.000
that's an intermediate neuron. That
intermediate neuron makes a synapse

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.000
on a second motor neuron, but
this is an inhibitory synapse.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:17.000
That motor neuron
sends its process

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:23.000
out and is affecting the opposite
muscle. So now what happens?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Let's get this straight.
I hit over here.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
And the signal goes back to my
spinal cord. The sensory neuron

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
causes one motor neuron,
directly by firing on it,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.000
to contract. It causes an
interneuron to fire that inhibits

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000
the opposite motor neuron.
What happens if you inhibit the

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
opposite motor neuron?
You relax the contraction,

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
or you at least don't
contract the opposite muscle.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
So, what happens is you send a
positive signal to the muscle on one

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:03.000
side and you inhibit the signal
to the muscle on the other side.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
It's a very simple circuit.
It's got one sensory neuron.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
Two motor neurons. One interneuron.
It's got two positive excitatory

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
synapses. It's got one
negative inhibitory synapse.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000
That's about it. Presumably,
everything else that goes on in

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:23.000
daily life is basically the same
thing. This is probably what eating

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
lunch is like, falling
in love is like and things

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
like that, although the details
remain to be worked out for exactly

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
how that stuff works. There
is a large collection of,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
I give you the simple examples
because obviously we don't know a

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
lot of the complex examples.
There is a lot more to this.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.000
If had time in the course we could
go into what's known about more

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
circuits. I joke. We know
about the circuits that

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
help you see vision, that
allow you to pick up signals in

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
your retina, transmit them back and
reconstruct things with positive and

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
negative signals that allow
you to see a straight line,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
for example, and
recognize a straight line.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000
And there are patterns of cells that
send positive signals and negative

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000
signals, and when you integrate them
you can get a signal if and only if

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
there's a straight line at
this angle in your visual field.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
And people know about that kind of
stuff, but some of the more complex

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
stuff we don't know about.
There are lots and lots of

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
neurotransmitters,
glutamate, glycine,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000
histamine, serotonin. ATP
can be a neurotransmitter.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Adenosine can be a neurotransmitter.
There are peptide neurotransmitters.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Endorphins, oxytocins and even gases.
Nitrous oxide is a neurotransmitter.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
And then some of the drugs you
may know work by affecting these

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:44.000
neurotransmitters. Prozac
and the general class of

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors. Prozac effects a

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
specific process with
a neurotransmitter.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
There's a neurotransmitter
serotonin. After it's fired out,

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
instead of acetylcholesterase being
in the synapse destroying it or some

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000
other enzyme destroying it,
it's taken back up by the cells.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
If you could inhibit the process
by which you take up your serotonin

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
again, the serotonin would last
longer in your synapse and you would

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:15.000
be happier, give or take, roughly
speaking to the extent that

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000
more serotonin is a good thing.
And that's what Prozac does.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Actually, it's one of the things
Prozac does. There's good evidence

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000
now that Prozac does other things,
too, including causing neuronal cell

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
growth, but that's
a whole other story.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
There are things like cocaine.
Cocaine is a bad thing because it

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
inhibits certain sodium
transporters and other things.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And if you go through all of the
different psychoactive drugs they're

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
affecting different parts
of these processes. So,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
for Friday I've invited a colleague
who is a real neurobiologist,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
I'm not a card-carrying neurobiologist,

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
to talk about some of the more far
out things of learning and memory.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Andy Chess who's a good friend and
a colleague is going to talk about

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
learning and memory. And then
have a good time with him,

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:07.000
and I'll see
you subsequently.

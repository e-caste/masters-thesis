WEBVTT

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.460
ADAM MARTIN: And so I wanted
to start today's lecture

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.710
by continuing what
we were talking

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.380
about in the last lecture.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.540
So I'm just going to
hide this real quick.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.410
And so we're talking about the
fruit fly and the white gene

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.250
and the white mutant, which
results in white-eyed flies.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:46.620
And we talked about how if you
take females that have red eyes

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.990
and cross them to males,
the white-eyed male,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:01.710
then 100% of the progeny has
red eyes in the F1 generation.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.379
And so I asked you
guys, would you

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.800
get the same results if you
did the reciprocal cross?

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.680
So what if we took
white-eyed females

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.670
and mated them to
red-eyed males?

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.310
So what about this?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.090
Actually, I'm going to
move this over to over

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.450
here so that maybe
it's more visible.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.050
So what if we have
white-eyed females

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.990
and crossed this
to red-eyed males?

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.910
So let's unpack this sort
of a little bit at a time.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.910
So what's the genotype of
these white-eyed females here?

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:51.867
Miles?

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:57.460
AUDIENCE: So if you designate
the eye gene as the letter A,

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.890
a female would be X
lowercase a, X lowercase a.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:01.950
ADAM MARTIN: Yes.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.700
So Miles is exactly right.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.940
So the dominant
phenotype is red eyes,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.090
because the gene encodes
for an enzyme that's

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.660
important for the production
of the red pigment.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:26.310
And so X lowercase a here would
be a recessive mutant that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.060
lacks the pigment.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.730
And because it's a
recessive allele--

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.180
because you need only
one copy of this gene

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.920
to produce the pigment.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.420
So the recessive allele
results in the white phenotype.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.080
Therefore, this has to
be homozygous recessive.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.710
How about this red-eyed male?

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.005
Yeah, Ory?

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.502
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you have
a Y and then an X capital A?

00:02:53.502 --> 00:02:54.210
ADAM MARTIN: Yes.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.640
So this would be this
phenotype, right,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.960
where capital A is the
gene that produces--

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.605
is a normal functioning gene
that produces the pigment.

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.180
So then in your F1
here, are you going

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.762
to see something similar to
this or something different?

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.075
AUDIENCE: Something different.

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:17.700
ADAM MARTIN: Different, great.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.870
Who said different?

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.810
Javier?

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.175
Do you want to propose
what you might see?

00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:22.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.110
For the males, they're
going to inherit the Y

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.740
gene from the father
and the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:29.840
ADAM MARTIN: Exactly.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.720
So the males are going to
get the Y from the father,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.210
and they're going to get
one X from their mother.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.480
So all the males are going
to be of this genotype

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.910
here, which means they're
going to have what color eye?

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.860
Javier is exactly right.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.140
That means they're going
to have white eyes.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.580
So all the males
will have white eyes.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.652
And what about the females?

00:04:02.652 --> 00:04:04.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.862
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:04:05.862 --> 00:04:06.750
AUDIENCE: Red eyes.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.630
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.610
So Ory is saying the males are
going to get red eyes, right,

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:11.710
because they're--

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.320
or the females are going to
have red eyes, because they're

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.740
going to get the X chromosome
from their father, which

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:24.010
has the dominant gene that
produces the red pigment.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.010
So all the females are
going to be heterozygous,

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.870
but have a functional
copy of this gene.

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.640
So all of the females
will have red eyes.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.010
OK, does everyone see how--

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.150
now, how would this compare with
Mendel's crosses and pea color?

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.940
Would there be a difference
in Mendel's crosses

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.670
if you switch the
male versus the female

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.890
if these were autosomal traits?

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.290
Ory is shaking his head
no, and he's right, right?

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.400
In that case, it doesn't matter.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.490
You can do the
reciprocal crosses,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.930
you get the same result. But
because this is sex linked,

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.740
which one is the male and which
is the female is relevant.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.890
And this actually
relates to something

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.090
that we just saw
on the MIT news.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:15.870
I just got this
email this morning,

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.330
but it came out I
think yesterday,

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.550
which is that biology-related
research in the mechanical

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.180
engineering department--
specifically, the CAM lab--

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:32.700
they've been able to
design a 3D sort of model

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.750
for ALS disease, which is also
known as Lou Gehrig's disease.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.570
And so what they've
done in the CAM lab

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:44.610
is to take cells from either
patients that have ALS

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.580
or from normal
individuals, and they coax

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.710
these cells to become neurons.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.860
Here, you're seeing a neuron
in blue and green here.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.220
And you see the neurites
extend from this neuron.

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.410
And they have a model
where this neuron can then

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.580
synapse with a muscle.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.450
And so they're using this
3D sort of tissue model

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:12.690
to model ALS and to look
for drugs that might affect

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:17.100
ALS, potentially curing ALS.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.430
And so last night, I
started reading about ALS

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.540
and was pleased to find
that there's actually

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.080
a very rare X-linked, dominant
form of the disease that

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.810
can be passed on from
generation to generation.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.780
And the inheritance pattern of
this X-linked, dominant version

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:39.930
of ALS would have an
inheritance pattern

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.580
that's similar to what we
observe for the white mutant

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.480
in the fruit fly, right?

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.000
Whereas, if you have
an affected father,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.690
and this is a dominant
mutant on the X chromosome,

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:56.010
then all of his daughters
will get that X chromosome

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:00.960
and be affected, whereas the
sons will all be unaffected.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.170
However, if you have the
reciprocal situation,

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.080
where you have an affected
mother and an unaffected

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.770
father, then the
sons and daughters

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.710
get the disease randomly.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:18.750
So this is a sort of form of
inheritance, which is relevant

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.530
if you're considering human
disease and some forms of it.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:26.220
Most versions of ALS,
well, are sporadic,

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.640
but inherited forms are
usually autosomal dominant.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.450
So this is a rare case here.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.090
But I thought it was interesting
in that it's relevant to what

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.700
we've been talking about.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.060
So now, just to recap--

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.290
here, I'll throw this
up so everything's up.

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.030
So in the last
lecture, we talked

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.250
about Mendelian inheritance.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.350
And we talked about when
you take two parents that

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.610
differ in two traits
and you perform a cross,

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:16.155
you get a hybrid individual that
is heterozygous for both genes.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.930
And now this is
the F1 individual.

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:24.840
Let's say we want to know
what types of gametes

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.250
this F1 individual produces.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:34.679
We can perform a type of a cross
known as a test cross, where

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:40.440
we cross this individual
to another individual that

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:48.240
is homozygous recessive for
both these genes, which means

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.000
that you know
exactly which alleles

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.770
are coming from this parent.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:56.520
And they're both recessive,
so you can see whether or not

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.010
the gamete produced
by this individual

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.860
has either the dominant
or the recessive allele.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:05.630
Let me see.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.664
I'll boost this up.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.890
So now we can consider the
different types of progeny

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.410
that result from
this test cross.

00:09:18.410 --> 00:09:22.580
And some will have the
two dominant alleles

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.580
from this parent
and will, therefore,

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.080
be heterozygous for
the A and B gene.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:35.480
And it would exhibit the
dominant A and B phenotype.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:39.420
I think that is what
I'm showing here.

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.200
So if the chromosomes,
during meiosis I,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.070
align like this, then
the two dominant alleles

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:50.180
segregate together,
and you get AB gametes.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.800
And you also, reciprocally,
get these lowercase a

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.060
and b gametes, as well.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:00.080
So that's the other class here.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.330
So you can get these
two classes of progeny.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:08.270
And the phenotypes
of these two classes

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.210
will resemble the
parents, right?

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.970
So these are known
as parental gametes.

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:20.030
So these are the parentals.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:23.030
But you know because
Mendel showed

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.180
that if you have genes
and their alleles

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.510
on separate chromosomes,
they can assert independently

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:30.780
of each other.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:36.230
So an alternatively
likely scenario

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.880
is that the chromosomes
align like this,

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.420
where now the
dominant allele of B

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:44.660
is on the other
side of the spindle.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.270
And therefore, these
chromosomes are

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.960
going to segregate like this
during the first meiotic

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.340
division.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.960
And that gives rise
to gametes that

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.885
have a different combination
of alleles than the parents.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.610
So you have some
that look like this.

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.100
So each of these would be
different classes of progeny.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.470
And you have one last class
that would look like this.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:23.080
And so neither of these look
like the original parents,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.840
and so they're known
as non-parental.

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:35.050
And so if these two genes
are behaving according

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:37.570
to Mendel's second
law, where there's

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.070
independent assortment--

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.180
if you have
independent assortment,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.390
what's going to be the ratio
of parental to non-parental?

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:55.580
Rachel?

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.450
AUDIENCE: One to one.

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:58.200
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah,
Rachel says one to one,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.530
and I think a number of
others also said one to one.

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.630
So you have 50% parental,
50% non-parental, right?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.580
Because it's equally
likely to get

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:11.030
either of those alignments
of the homologous chromosomes

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.590
during meiosis I.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.930
So now I'm going
to basically break

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:21.230
the rules I just explained
to you in the last lecture

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:24.650
and tell you about an exception,
which is known as linkage.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.570
Gesundheit.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:34.970
And in the abstract
sense, linkage

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.580
is simply when you
have two traits that

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.670
tend to be inherited together.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.040
So just considering probability.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.730
So you have traits
inherited together.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.390
They're exhibiting what
is known as linkage.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.860
But that's an abstract
way to think about it.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.980
It's just based on
probability, right?

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.640
So a physical model
for what linkage is,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.680
is that you have chromosomes.

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.780
The genes are on
the chromosomes.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.020
And for two genes to
be linked, those genes

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.920
are physically near each
other on the chromosome.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:16.700
So the physical model
is that two genes

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.130
are near each other
on the chromosome.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.750
OK, so let's consider
again these generic genes,

00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:38.480
A and B. If A and B
resulting from this cross--

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.260
if these two happen to be
on the same chromosome,

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:45.570
now they're physically
coupled to each other.

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.460
Then they're going to tend
to be inherited together.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:52.400
No matter how these
align, they're

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.080
always going to
go together during

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:56.070
the first meiotic division.

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.770
And that's just going to only
give you the parental gametes.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.880
So if there's linkage,
you're going to have--

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.325
let's consider the case where
you have complete linkage.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.570
If you have complete
linkage, 100% of the gametes

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:16.790
are going to be
parentals, and you're

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:19.190
going to have 0% non-parental.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.520
That's if the genes
are really, really,

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.610
really close to each
other, and maybe you

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.200
don't count so many progeny.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:33.950
You won't see any
mixing between the two.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.790
But there is a phenomenon
that can separate these genes,

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:39.440
and it's known as crossing over.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.920
And another term to describe
it is recombination.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.980
So the alleles are
getting recombined

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.180
between the chromosomes.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:54.590
Recombination.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:01.970
And what crossing over or
recombination is, is it's

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:08.700
a mixing of the
chromosomes, if you will.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:11.510
Or it's an exchange of DNA.

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.570
So there's a physical
exchange of DNA from one

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.230
of the homologous
chromosomes to the other, OK?

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:26.660
So you can think of this
as an exchange of DNA

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:30.945
between the homologous
chromosomes, OK?

00:15:30.945 --> 00:15:31.820
And that's important.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.120
It's not an exchange between
the sister chromatids,

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.252
but between the
homologous chromosomes

00:15:37.252 --> 00:15:38.585
that have the different alleles.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.520
And what's shown here is
a micrograph showing you

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.970
a picture of the process
of crossing over.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:54.660
You can see the centromeres
are the dark structures there.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.780
And you can see how the
homologous chromosomes

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.490
intertwine.

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.700
And there are regions where
it looks like there's a cross.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.570
Those are the homologous
chromosomes crossing over

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:11.700
and exchanging DNA such that
one part of that chromosome

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:15.270
gets attached to the
other centromere.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:20.580
So I'll just show you in
sort of my silly cartoon form

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:23.170
how this is, just
to make it clear.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.800
So let's say, again, you
have these A and B genes,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.530
and they're physically
linked on the chromosome.

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:31.740
During crossing
over, you can get

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:36.030
an exchange of these alleles,
such as a bit of one chromosome

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.290
goes to the other homologous
chromosome and vice versa, OK?

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.750
So now you have the
dominant A allele

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:45.910
with the recessive b
allele and vice versa.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:50.190
So now during meiosis I--

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:52.230
after meiosis II,
this will give rise

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:57.420
to two types of gametes, one
of which is non-parental.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:00.150
And the same for
the one down here.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.370
You get two types of gametes.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.264
One is non-parental-- the
lowercase a, uppercase B

00:17:06.264 --> 00:17:06.764
gamete.

00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:14.930
So this happens if there's
incomplete linkage.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:17.720
That means there can be a
recombination event that

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.550
separates the two genes.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:27.079
And I'm going to give you
an example of a case where

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.470
data was collected with what
fraction of each class there

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:31.280
is.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.590
So now we're
considering an example

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.610
where you have a linkage.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:40.980
So A and B are on
the same chromosome.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.910
And so we'll consider a
case where, in this class,

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:47.600
there are 165 members.

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.800
For this one, there is 191.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.896
So I'm kind of--

00:17:51.896 --> 00:17:54.110
line down like this.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:56.720
And then for the first
recombinant class,

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.710
23 individuals.

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.510
And for the last, there
are 21 individuals.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.810
So you can see there are many
more of the parental class

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:07.790
than the recombinant
class, but we

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:15.320
can calculate a frequency,
or recombination frequency,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.415
between these two genes.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.690
And in this case, the
recombination frequency

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:34.730
is 44/400, which is
equal to 11%, OK?

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:38.570
So 11% of the progeny
from this cross

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:42.928
had some sort of crossing over
between the A and B alleles.

00:18:42.928 --> 00:18:43.970
It would've been up here.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:55.900
Now, this frequency
is interesting,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:19:02.230
because it is proportional
to the distance that

00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:05.500
separates these two genes.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.450
So this recombination
frequency is

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:12.760
proportional to the linear
distance along the chromosome

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.600
between the genes.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.740
Now, it also depends on
the recombination frequency

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.710
in a given organism or in a
given part of the chromosome.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:37.570
So when you're comparing
recombination frequencies

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.460
between different
organisms, there's

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:42.522
actually differences
in the real different--

00:19:42.522 --> 00:19:43.480
they're not equivalent.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.120
You can't compare
them, basically.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.310
And also, there are
regions of the chromosome

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.740
where recombination happens
less frequently than others.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:56.020
And so, again, you can't
compare distances along those.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:20:00.460
But overall, you can use
this as a distance in order

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:08.350
to map genes along the
linear axis of a chromosome.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.490
And maps are useful, because you
can see where stuff is, right?

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:17.770
So in this example here, I'll
highlight a couple of places.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:19.700
Here's Rivendell.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.880
Here's Lonely Mountain.

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.070
Here's Beorn's house.

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:27.970
So let's say we are
able to determine

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:31.750
the distance between
Rivendell and Lonely Mountain,

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.260
and the distance between Lonely
Mountain and Beorn's house,

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:38.280
and the distance between
Rivendell and Beorn's house.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.520
You'd be able to get a
relative picture of where

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.410
all of these places are
in relation to each other.

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:49.840
So this is a two-dimensional
map I'm showing here.

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.850
It's not one dimensional,
but chromosomes

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:56.590
are one dimensional, so it's
a bit more accurate, OK?

00:20:56.590 --> 00:21:01.000
So this idea that
recombination frequency can

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.660
be used to measure
distances between genes

00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:08.690
and that this could be
used to generate a map

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:12.040
is an idea that an
undergraduate had

00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:16.030
while working in Thomas Hunt
Morgan's lab back in 1911.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.360
And what I find
fascinating about the story

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.120
is this guy basically
blew off his homework

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.880
to produce the first
genetic map in any organism.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.680
So the person who did it
was Alfred Sturtevant,

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.020
and he was an
undergraduate at Columbia

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:34.360
working for Thomas Hunt Morgan.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.120
And I'll just paraphrase
this quote here.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.750
In 1911, he was talking
with his advisor, Morgan,

00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:42.850
and he realized
that the variations

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.760
in the strength of linkage
attributed by Morgan

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:49.090
to differences in the
separation of genes--

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:52.060
so Morgan had already
made this connection,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.270
that the recombination
frequency reflects

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.180
the distance between the genes.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.700
But then Sturtevant
realized that this

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.910
offered the possibility
of determining sequences

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:07.440
in the linear dimension of the
chromosome between the genes,

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.740
OK?

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.080
So then-- this is
my favorite part--

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.090
"I went home and spent
most of the night,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:15.490
to the neglect of my
undergraduate homework,

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.120
in producing the
first chromosome map."

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.440
And this is it.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.350
So the first chromosome map was
of the Drosophila X chromosome,

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:25.900
which we've been talking about.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.550
There's the white
gene, which we've

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:30.070
been talking about in
the context of eye color.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.870
There's a yellow body gene here.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.750
There's vermilion, miniature,
rudimentary, right?

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:39.200
These are all visible phenotypes
that you can see in the fly.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.200
And you can measure
recombination

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.765
between various alleles
of these different genes.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.650
All right, so now I want
to go through with you

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:57.150
an example of how you can make
one of these genetic maps.

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:59.690
And it's essentially
the same conceptually

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.030
as to what Sturtevant did.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.700
And it involves what is
known as a three-point cross.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.465
So a three-point cross.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.030
So there are going to be
three genes, all of which

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.340
are going to be
hybrid, and I'll start

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.560
with the parental
generation that

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.280
is little a, capital
B, capital D.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.580
And we'll cross
this fly or organism

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:34.770
to an organism that is capital
A, lower case b, lowercase d.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:35.501
Yes, Carmen?

00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:37.543
AUDIENCE: So when you
write the gametes up there,

00:23:37.543 --> 00:23:40.598
does that imply that they
were analogous parents?

00:23:40.598 --> 00:23:42.140
ADAM MARTIN: So what
I'm writing here

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:44.910
is the phenotype, basically.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:50.270
And so these are homozygous
for each of these, yes.

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.950
I could also write this as--

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:00.410
but I'm not going to draw
the chromosomes, because it

00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:04.730
kind of gets more confusing.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:07.600
I'll draw the
chromosomes here in F1,

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.080
because we have now, basically,
a tri-hybrid with one

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.570
chromosome that looks
like this, right?

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.930
They got that chromosome
from this individual here.

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:19.820
And another chromosome
will look like this.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.810
See?

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:30.110
So this F1 fly is heterozygous
for these three genes,

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:34.430
and it has these two
parental chromosomes.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:40.580
So now we can look at the
gametes that result from this

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:47.240
fly by doing a test cross,
just like we did before.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.940
And so we want to cross
this to a fly that's

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.610
homozygous recessive
for each of these genes.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.120
And now we can look
at the progeny.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.430
And just by looking
at the phenotype,

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.650
we're going to know the
genotype, because we

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:07.070
know all of the
flies from this cross

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:11.150
have a chromosome from
this individual that

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:15.860
has recessive alleles
for each gene.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:20.270
So we can consider now
this first one here.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:24.170
That's one potential
class of progeny.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:27.230
Another class would be this one.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:31.160
And these two, you can see,
resemble the parents, right?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.027
So these are the parental
classes of the progeny.

00:25:36.027 --> 00:25:36.860
So this is parental.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:45.760
All right, now you can
consider all other combinations

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.790
of alleles.

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:50.650
And so I'll quickly
write them down.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:52.360
You could have something--

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.380
progeny that look
like this and this.

00:25:56.380 --> 00:25:59.380
These are just kind of
reciprocal from each other.

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:05.130
You could have progeny that
look like this and this.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:14.350
And the last class
would be this and this.

00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:17.290
So all of these progeny
that I drew down here

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:18.820
are recombinant,
because they don't

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:22.840
resemble the parents, right?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.210
Because there are three
genes, now there's

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:29.860
many more ways to get
recombinant progeny, as opposed

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:32.710
to having just two genes, right?

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:34.630
So you can have many
different combinations

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:36.550
of these different alleles.

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:41.260
And so now I'm going
to give you data

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:44.780
from a cross with
three such genes.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.100
So you might get
580 individuals that

00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:59.830
look like this, 592 like this,
45 and 40, 89, 94, 3, and 5.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:04.720
So this is data that is,
I believe, from fly genes.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.970
I've just ignored
the fly nomenclature,

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.710
because it's confusing, and just
given them lettered names, OK?

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:16.900
But this reflects data
from some cross somewhere.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.110
So now we want to know--

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.960
let's go back to our map.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.090
We want to make a map, OK?

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:26.720
And so to make our
map, we're going

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.490
to want to consider
all pairwise distances

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:33.350
between different genes.

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:36.310
So we'll start with
the A and B gene.

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:38.120
I'll write over here.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:42.910
So let's consider
the A/B distance.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:44.830
And remember, to get
a distance, we're

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.110
looking at the number
of the frequency which

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:51.250
there is recombination
between these two genes, OK?

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:55.720
So we now have to look through
all of these recombinant class

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.180
of progeny and figure
out the ones that

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.840
have had a recombination
between A and B, right?

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.980
So on the parent chromosome,
you see little lowercase a

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:11.290
started out with capital
B and vice versa.

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.690
So any case where we
don't have lowercase

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:19.030
a paired with capital B, there's
been some type of exchange.

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.850
So here, lowercase
a's with lowercase b.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:23.440
So that's a recombinant.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.590
Here, uppercase A's
with uppercase B.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:28.180
That's a recombinant, too.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.130
So we have to add all these up.

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:33.700
So 45 plus 40.

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:34.390
How about here?

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:37.440
Recombination here or no?

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:37.940
Yes.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:38.780
I'm hearing yes.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:39.860
That's correct.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.640
Here, recombination, yes or no?

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.900
Carmen's shaking her head no.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.490
She's exactly right.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.505
So we just have to-- these are
all the recombinants between A

00:28:49.505 --> 00:28:54.770
and B. So it's 45
plus 40 plus 89

00:28:54.770 --> 00:29:04.430
plus 94, which equals 268
over a total progeny of 1,448.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.050
And that gives you a
map distance of 18.5%.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:12.320
Because this method was
developed in Morgan's lab,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.570
this measurement is also
known as a centimorgan.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:18.350
It was named in honor of Morgan.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.605
So that's what I refer to when
I have lowercase c capital

00:29:21.605 --> 00:29:23.960
M. That's a centimorgan.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.340
So you can also use
centimorgan here.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.440
All right, so that's
A and B, but now we

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.960
have to consider
other distances.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.615
So how about the A/D distance?

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.590
And again, we have to go
through and figure out

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:48.260
where the alleles for A and
D have been recombined, OK?

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:54.080
So little a is with
capital D, and upper case A

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.210
is with lowercase d.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:59.950
So we have to find all the
cases where that's not the case.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.750
Here, this is lowercase
a with capital D

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:05.510
and capital A with lowercase d.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.625
This is parental from the
respect of just the A and D

00:30:08.625 --> 00:30:13.610
genes, but all the rest of
these guys are recombinants, OK?

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:18.920
So this is 89 plus 94
plus 3 plus 5, which

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:26.870
comes out to be 191 over 1,448.

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:30.670
And this is 13.2 centimorgans.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:39.570
So that's the distance between
A and D. Distance between A-B,

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:42.060
distance between A-D.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:48.490
So the last combination,
then, is just B and D.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:53.360
So if we consider
the B/D distance,

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:57.080
again, we have to look for
all cases in which lowercase

00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.140
b and d become
separated and uppercase

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:03.380
B and D become separated.

00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:05.600
Here, they're separated.

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.150
Here, they're separated.

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.700
Wait, no, not here, sorry.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.260
Here, they're not separated.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.430
Here, they are separated.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.720
Everyone see how I'm doing this?

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.618
Are there any
questions about it?

00:31:22.618 --> 00:31:24.660
You can just shout it out
if you have a question?

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.430
So this distance is
6.4 centimorgans.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:38.730
Everyone see how I'm considering
every pairwise combination

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:40.800
of genes and then just
ignoring the other one

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.870
and looking for
where there's been

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.740
a recombination in the progeny?

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:49.260
So now that we
have our distances,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:51.810
we can make our map, right?

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:57.600
So the two genes that are
farthest apart are A and B, OK?

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.320
So that's kind of like here,
Rivendell and Lonely Mountain.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:04.560
Those are the two genes
that are at the extremities.

00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:07.860
So I'll draw this out.

00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.950
It doesn't matter
which way you put it.

00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:14.340
We're just mapping these
genes relative to each other.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:18.460
But B and A are the farthest
apart from each other.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:24.960
Now if we consider the
distance between B and D,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.380
that's 6.4 centimorgans.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.020
So it appears that
D is closer to B

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:37.050
than it is to A, because it's
13 centimorgans away from A, OK?

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:40.510
So D is kind of like
Beorn's house here.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:43.140
It's closer to Rivendell than
it is from Lonely Mountain.

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:49.720
So we'll put that in there.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.680
This distance is
6.4 centimorgans.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:59.170
And then the distance
here is 13.2 centimorgans.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:03.340
As far as I know, no one of
the field of genetic mapping

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.950
has been assaulted
by large spiders,

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:08.800
but the field is still young.

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:13.780
So one thing that should be
maybe bothering you right now

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.680
is if you add up the
distance between B and D

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:22.780
and D and A, you don't, in
fact, get 18.4 centimorgans.

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:28.042
Instead, you get
19.6 centimorgans.

00:33:28.042 --> 00:33:32.800
This is 19.6 centimorgans.

00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:37.870
So it seems like, somehow,
we are underestimating

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:39.520
this distance here, OK?

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.800
So we seem to be
underestimating this.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:52.380
So why is it that we are
underestimating this distance?

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.930
Well, to consider that,
you have to sort of look

00:33:55.930 --> 00:34:00.930
at how all of these
classes were generated.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:02.680
So now I'm going to
go through each class,

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.140
and we'll look at
how it was generated.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.690
I'm also going to--

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.030
well, I'll just draw
new chromosomes.

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.460
So we have to draw
this order now.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.830
We have B, D, a.

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:22.020
So the first
chromosome is B, D, a.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.270
That's right, B, D, a.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:33.730
The other chromosome
is b, d, A. So now we

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:36.040
look and see how this
recombinant class was

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.260
generated.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.510
So this is lowercase a.

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:48.810
We'll start with b-- lowercase
b, lowercase a, but capital D.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:52.139
So it's capital D, lowercase a.

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.690
So that recombinant results
from this chromosome here, where

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:58.080
there's crossing over,
and little b gets

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:01.315
hooked up to big D and little a.

00:35:01.315 --> 00:35:02.970
See how I did that?

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.250
And then if we
consider this class,

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:13.230
this is uppercase B, lowercase
d, capital A. So these two

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:17.760
classes of progeny result
from a single crossover

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:19.710
between B and D, OK?

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:24.760
So this is a single crossover
between B and D genes.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.080
And now we can go through and
look at how this is generated.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.940
So to get all recessive
alleles on the same chromosome,

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.970
there would be a crossover here.

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:42.400
And so this is a single
crossover between D and A.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:49.320
So a single crossover
between D and A. Now,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.450
these last couple
classes of progeny

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:55.950
are interesting in that they're
the least frequent class.

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:59.430
And so when we consider
how they're generated,

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:02.400
we'll start with uppercase B.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:08.720
Let's see if I can
get rid of this.

00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:16.700
So uppercase B,
lowercase d, lowercase a.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:20.570
And so what this last class is,
is actually a double crossover.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:28.570
So this is a double crossover.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:31.240
And it's least frequent
because there's

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.260
a lower probability of getting
two crossovers in this region.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.560
But now you see that
even though it doesn't

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.310
look like there was
recombination between A and D,

00:36:42.310 --> 00:36:43.720
in fact, there was.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.060
There were two
crossovers, and it just

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:48.940
looks like there was no
recombination, if you didn't

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:55.630
see the behavior of gene D.

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.910
So if we take into account
that there are actually

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:03.550
double crossovers
between B and A,

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.980
then if we add that
into our calculation

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:11.770
here, where you add in
3 plus 5 multiplied by 2

00:37:11.770 --> 00:37:16.060
because these are both
double crossover events, then

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.690
you get the 19.6
centimorgans that you

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:23.590
would expect by adding up
the other recombinations, OK?

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.320
How is that?

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:30.660
Is that clear to everybody?

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:35.970
You're going to have to make
maps like this on the problem

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.020
set and possibly the test.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.976
So make sure you can
given-- yeah, Ory?

00:37:40.976 --> 00:37:43.184
AUDIENCE: I realized that
you immediately [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:43.184 --> 00:37:45.017
overestimated the
difference between A and B

00:37:45.017 --> 00:37:48.590
and not overestimated
B to D or D to A?

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:50.360
ADAM MARTIN: It's
because when you

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.690
have two genes that
are very far apart,

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.000
you can have
multiple crossovers.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.050
And when you have
sort of crossovers

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.580
that are in pairs
of two, then it's

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:05.447
going to go from one
strand back to the other,

00:38:05.447 --> 00:38:08.030
and so you're not going to see
a recombination between the two

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:10.280
alleles.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.720
So it's an underestimate,
because if you have multiples

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.610
of two in terms of
crossovers, you're

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:20.367
going to miss the
recombination events.

00:38:20.367 --> 00:38:21.200
You see what I mean?

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:28.330
You understand that you can miss
the double crossover events?

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:28.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I get that.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.002
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah, right?

00:38:30.002 --> 00:38:31.660
So then you're going
to underestimate

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.330
the number of crossovers
that actually happened

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:35.500
in that genetic region.

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:45.520
All right, now I want to end
with an experiment that, again,

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.610
makes the point that genes
are these entities that

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:54.550
are on chromosomes.

00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:56.710
So just like you
can have linkage

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.380
between two genes on
the same chromosome,

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.290
you can also have
linkage between genes

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:05.350
and physical structures
on chromosomes,

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:06.400
like the centromere.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.370
So you could have
genes like A and B

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:14.980
here that are present
on the chromosomes

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.930
and present very
near the centromere

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.470
of those chromosomes, OK?

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:24.100
So they could be right on
top of the centromere, OK?

00:39:24.100 --> 00:39:27.220
And to show you how
this manifests itself,

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:31.390
I have to tell you about
another organism, which

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:35.620
is a unicellular
organism called yeast.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.050
And yeast is special
and that it can

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.830
exist in both a haploid
and a diploid form.

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:44.050
So it has a lifecycle
that involves

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.485
it going both as a
haploid and as a diploid.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:54.490
And so you can take yeast--

00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.870
and we'll take two
haploid yeast cells.

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:03.220
And much like gametes, these
can fuse to form a zygote.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.260
So, in this case, I'm taking--

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:09.370
again, we'll consider two
generic genes, A and B.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.160
And we'll make a diploid yeast
cell that is heterozygous,

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:17.440
or hybrid, for A and B.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.350
And what's great and
special about yeast

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:25.030
and why I'm telling you about
this is because as opposed

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:30.040
to flies and us and
other organisms,

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.040
the product of a
single meiosis is

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:40.040
packaged in this single
package, if you will.

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.500
So the yeast can
undergo meiosis,

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:47.500
and the product of
a single meiosis

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:51.640
is present in this case,
where each of these

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:59.680
would represent a haploid cell
that then can divide and make

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.790
many cells.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.480
But this is the product of a
single meiosis in a package,

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.170
OK?

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:09.280
So you can actually
see the direct result

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.350
of a meiotic division, a
single meiotic division.

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:17.425
So this is the product of
a single meiotic division.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.810
And that's special because
when we make gametes,

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:27.370
we have individual cells.

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.010
All the products of
meiosis are split up,

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:33.190
and then just one randomly
finds an egg and fertilizes it.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:35.800
So you don't know
which of the gametes

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:37.570
are from the product
of a single meiosis.

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:45.190
And so being able to see the
product of a single meiosis

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.980
allows us to see
things like genes being

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.800
linked to physical
structures on the chromosome

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.680
like the centromere.

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.540
So if we consider this
case, these two genes

00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:58.030
are both linked
to the centromere.

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.980
And during metaphor
phase of meiosis I,

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:03.270
they could align like
this, in which case

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:07.750
you would get spores
that are parental

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:10.300
for both dominant
alleles or parental

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.880
for both recessive alleles.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.760
So each of these cells
is known as a spore.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:18.950
So I'll label
spore numbers here.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:20.960
So this is spore number.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:27.340
And in this case,
you get two spores

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.040
that are dominant for both
alleles and two spores that

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.040
are recessive for both alleles.

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.020
Because there are two types,
it's known as a ditype.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:42.790
And this is a parental ditype,
because you have two types

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:43.930
of spores .

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:53.580
And they are both parental

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:57.030
An alternative scenario
is that these chromosomes

00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:58.950
would align differently, right?

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:02.190
So you get parental
spores there.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:06.030
However, alternatively, you
could have this configuration,

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.550
where this is now flipped.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:13.380
And during meiosis I here,
these chromosomes move together.

00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.510
And they, again, produce
two types of spores,

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.910
so it's a ditype.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.940
But in this case, all the
spores are non-parental.

00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.830
So another scenario
is you get this.

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.350
And because there are two
types and they're non-parental,

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.300
this is known as
non-parental ditype.

00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:47.200
That's a non-parental ditype.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:55.330
And if these genes are linked
to the centromere completely,

00:43:55.330 --> 00:44:02.590
then you can only get these
two classes of packages, OK?

00:44:02.590 --> 00:44:04.630
So if these genes are unlinked--

00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:10.900
so the two genes are
unlinked, but both

00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:22.410
linked to the centromere,
then you get parental ditype--

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:28.420
50% parental ditype, type
50% non-parental ditype.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:32.890
So I'm abbreviating
parental ditype PD

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:34.720
and non-parental ditype NPD.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:43.180
So what has to happen to
get another type of spore?

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:45.190
And another type
of spore would be--

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:48.160
you could have spores that
are all different genotypes

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:54.670
from each other and that
you have A cap dominant A/B;

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:59.500
dominant A, recessive b;
recessive a, dominant B;

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.510
and lowercase a and b.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:05.605
And this is known as tetratype,
because there are four types.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:10.570
So how do you get
this tetratype?

00:45:10.570 --> 00:45:11.580
Anyone have an idea?

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:16.800
Yeah, Jeremy?

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.900
AUDIENCE: You're crossing over.

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:26.760
So one of A and B would switch
in one of the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.130
ADAM MARTIN: Where would
the crossing over happen?

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:34.050
AUDIENCE: Between the two
[INAUDIBLE] one [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:46.486
ADAM MARTIN: Between
the allele and what?

00:45:46.486 --> 00:45:47.360
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.235
ADAM MARTIN: The crossing over
would occur between the gene--

00:45:50.235 --> 00:45:51.210
AUDIENCE: Oh, and
the centromere.

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:52.918
ADAM MARTIN: And the
centromere, exactly.

00:45:52.918 --> 00:45:54.090
Jeremy is exactly right.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:57.450
So Jeremy said that in
order to get a tetratype,

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.850
you have to have a
recombination event,

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.340
but this time, not
between two genes,

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:05.130
but between a gene
and the centromere.

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:07.620
So at least one of
the genes has to be

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:09.475
unlinked to the centromere.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.020
And in that case, now
you get a meiotic event

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.870
that gives rise to four spores.

00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:21.990
And there are four
different ways to get this.

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:31.560
So if you have two genes
unlinked and at least one

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:40.650
is unlinked to the
centromere, then you

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.350
get a pattern where
you have a 1 to 1

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:46.840
to 4 ratio between all
these different events.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:51.630
So you have a 1 to 1 to 4
ratio between parental ditype,

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:53.850
non-parental ditype,
and tetratype.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.440
And we can see this in yeast.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.710
If you have two genes that
are linked to the centromere,

00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:05.330
you only get parental ditypes
and non-parental ditypes,

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:08.910
where virtually everything
else gives rise to tetratypes,

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.445
except if they're linked.

00:47:10.445 --> 00:47:11.820
What happens if
the two genes are

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:17.730
linked to each other,
irregardless of the centromere?

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.910
If you have two genes that are
linked, what's going to be--

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.859
what are your progeny
going to look like?

00:47:23.859 --> 00:47:25.340
AUDIENCE: Parentals.

00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.630
ADAM MARTIN: You're only
going to get the parentals,

00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:28.380
or you're going to get
a lot of parentals.

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.420
Javier is exactly right, right?

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:33.800
If the two genes are
linked, the parental ditypes

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.320
are going to be much greater
than any of the other classes.

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:44.180
Now, this might seem
esoteric, but I like the idea

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:48.380
that you can have linkage
between a gene and something

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.810
that's just the place
on the chromosome that's

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.730
getting physically pulled.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:54.680
It all makes it
much more physical,

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:59.630
which I think is
nice to think about.

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:01.530
All right, we're almost done.

00:48:01.530 --> 00:48:03.560
I just have-- yes, Natalie?

00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.000
AUDIENCE: Can you go over
what the PD [INAUDIBLE]??

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:09.740
ADAM MARTIN: Yes.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.960
So PD is parental ditype.

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:13.990
So this is the parental ditype.

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:18.020
It's a class of
product here where

00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:22.130
you get four spores that are
each of these genotypes, OK?

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:25.520
So each of these 1,
2, 3, and 4 would

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:31.160
represent one of these cells
from a single meiotic event.

00:48:31.160 --> 00:48:33.802
Does that make sense, Natalie?

00:48:33.802 --> 00:48:35.260
Does everyone see
what I did there?

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:44.660
So these 1 2 and 3 are the
spores of the meiotic event

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.390
right here.

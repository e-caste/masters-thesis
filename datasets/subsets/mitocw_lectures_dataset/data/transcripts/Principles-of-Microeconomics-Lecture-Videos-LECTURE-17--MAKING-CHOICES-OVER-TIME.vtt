JONATHAN GRUBER:
Today, what we're

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.760
going to do is continue our
discussion of factor markets

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.160
by essentially talking about
how capital markets impact

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.418
real world decisions.

00:00:23.418 --> 00:00:25.460
So last time, we talked
about the capital market.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.002
We talked about,
essentially, the way

00:00:27.002 --> 00:00:29.420
that firms finance
their capital is

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.330
by going to a pool of
savings that individuals

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.530
decided how much to make.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.720
Individuals make it
into temporal choice

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.115
on how much to save.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:38.990
Actually, technically,
they can make a choice

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.880
about how much to
consume each period.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.040
That then yields an
amount of savings.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.930
And then based on
that pool of savings,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.870
firms borrow at some
interest rate, i,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.480
and they decide
how much to invest.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.640
Now, today we're going
to talk about a number

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.800
of interesting
applications that arise

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.535
from capital markets that are
important in the real world.

00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:58.910
And I'm going to
start by talking

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.310
about the concept
of present value.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.340
Present value.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.510
Now, the key insight when we
think about capital markets

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.110
is that $1 tomorrow is
worth less than $1 today.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.085
$1 tomorrow is worth
less than $1 today.

00:01:18.085 --> 00:01:21.210
That's because if you
had the dollar today,

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.520
you could productively invest it
and have more than $1 tomorrow.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.387
So $1 today is worth
more, because you

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:29.720
could do something productive
with that $1 if you had it

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.550
today.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.820
What that means is that
dollars in different periods

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.090
are worth different things.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.840
You can't just add them up.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.160
OK, the analogy I like
is thinking about--

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.950
imagine you had a pound of
apples, a pound of steak,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.630
and a pound of gold.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.270
You wouldn't just add them up
and say, I have three pounds.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.347
That'd be useless.

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:49.930
You'd want to know
what each is worth,

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.790
and you'd want add up
the dollar value of them.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.390
It's a similar thing with
money received over time.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.910
You can't just say, I'm
getting $1 today, $1 next year,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.680
and $1 five years from now.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.200
They aren't the same thing.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.950
Money received at
different points of time

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.080
are worth different
amounts, because money

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.300
received in the future forgoes
the possibility of investing it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.800
today.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.430
So what do we do
to deal with this?

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.110
Well, in economics,
we deal with this

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.830
by the concept of present value.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.840
Present value is the value
of every period's payments

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.743
in terms of today.

00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:28.410
So the way we deal with the fact
that money in different periods

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.010
is worth different amounts is
by what we call discounting it

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.660
back to today.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.670
We essentially
take future dollars

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.330
and discount them back to
today to get present value.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.200
We discount them, because
future dollars are worth less.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.240
So let's think of it this way.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.247
Suppose that the
interest rate is 10%.

00:02:49.247 --> 00:02:50.080
Let's do an example.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.000
Imagine the interest
rate, i, is 10%.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.650
And let's say that you want
to have $100 next year.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.420
Next year, you
want to have $100.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.800
Well, how much do you have
to put in the bank today?

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.540
Well, we can solve the
equation, which is that you want

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.420
the amount you put in the bank
today-- let's call that y--

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.330
times one plus
the interest rate,

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.580
because that's what you make
by having it in the bank,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.990
equal to 100.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.090
That's the equation
we want to solve.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.315
The money amount
you put in today, y,

00:03:27.315 --> 00:03:28.690
times one plus
the interest rate.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.010
You want that to
be equal to 100.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.740
So what that says is
that y equals 90.9.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.350
If you put $90.90 in the bank
today at a 10% interest rate,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.460
you will have $100 tomorrow.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.150
More generally, we say
that the present value

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.530
of any future payment
is the future value,

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.740
the amount you get in
the future, over one

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.560
plus i to the power
little t, where

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.890
t is the periods in the future.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.750
So money received t
periods in the future today

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.930
is worth the amount you get
in the future over one plus i

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:09.440
to the t.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.412
So that is our general
formula for how

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:16.620
we think about present value.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.750
Take all the future payments,
and you discount them

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.540
back to today by dividing
by one plus i to the t.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.770
Now, that works well if there's
one future payment coming.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.720
But what if, as in
many cases, there's

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.180
a whole stream of
future payments coming?

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.880
Well, the logic
then is the same.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.850
You just want to take
each future payment

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.100
and discount it by how
far it is in the future.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.400
So suppose that you say that
you want me to loan you $30

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.020
and that you'll pay me back $10
each of the next three years.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.360
And suppose the
interest rate's 10%.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.202
Well, I will say no to that.

00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:55.660
Because I will say,
if you're going

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.470
to pay me back $10 each of
the next three years, then

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.540
what is the present
value of that?

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.745
The present value is
next year's $10 over 1.1,

00:05:06.745 --> 00:05:10.180
because the interest rate is
10%, plus the $10 the year

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.360
after that over 1.1 squared,
plus the $10 the year

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:27.070
after that over 1.1 cubed,
which if I add it up, is 24.87.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.250
So I am losing money.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.370
If I give you $30 today
and if you give me

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.010
$10 back each of the next
three years, I'm losing money.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.540
Why?

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.207
Because if I had
simply taken that money

00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:40.380
and invested it in
the bank, I would've

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.550
had a lot more than
the $30 I'm going

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.560
to get from you
after three years.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.640
OK, so the money that
comes in the future

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.790
must be discounted
back to today.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.770
That's the key insight
of present value.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.120
You can't just add it up.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:56.160
You've got to put
it in today's terms

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.083
by discounting it
by the interest rate

00:05:59.083 --> 00:06:00.250
and how far into the future.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.827
Yeah.

00:06:00.827 --> 00:06:02.910
AUDIENCE: So aside from
just the change in value

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.765
that's caused by interest, how
do you take into consideration

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.120
the fact that the value
of the currency itself

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.230
hasn't changed over time?

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.200
JONATHAN GRUBER: We're
assuming now inflation is zero.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.617
So we're assuming
right now, we're

00:06:12.617 --> 00:06:13.742
not dealing with inflation.

00:06:13.742 --> 00:06:15.960
We're assuming a world
where prices don't change.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.050
We'll come back to
inflation in a few minutes.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.010
But for now, just assume
that prices don't change.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.990
OK, so basically,
essentially, the formula

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.030
then for the present
value, your general formula

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.870
for present value
you need to know

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.195
is that present value equals--

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.550
if you get a flat
stream of payment

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:44.860
f for a number of periods,
it's f times one over one

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:52.900
plus i to the one
plus one over one

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:58.900
plus i squared plus
one over one plus i

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.980
cubed plus dot dot dot dot
dot dot for how many periods

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.520
you get it.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.770
So if you're getting a payment
f over a certain number

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.370
of periods, you've
got to discount it

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.510
by how many periods
you're going to get it.

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.640
Or more generally,
a common formula

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.530
we'll ask you to
use in this class

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.120
is to think about the
formula for perpetuity.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.590
A perpetuity is a flat
payment you get forever.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.400
So if we take the infinite
sum of this equation,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.080
we can summarize it as present
value approximately equals

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.430
f over the interest rate.

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:35.720
So if I promise you to pay you
forever a certain amount f,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.980
that is worth f over
the interest rate.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.280
So in other words, if
the interest rate is 10%,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:44.340
a promise to pay you $10
forever is worth about $100.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.840
That's just the Infinite sum.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.700
If you've read A
Beautiful Mind, John Nash

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.230
can do that in his head.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.440
But I can't, but that's
just the formula.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.190
So basically, that is the
general formula for perpetuity.

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:01.380
And that makes life easy.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.588
We'll give you a
lot of examples.

00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:05.130
Because if I say I
want you to pay me

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.260
for eight years in
the future, I've

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.677
got to write out
eight terms here.

00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:08.730
It's a pain in the ass.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.947
So what we'll say
is money forever,

00:08:10.947 --> 00:08:12.530
and then you'll just
use the shortcut,

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.350
which is the present
value for perpetuity.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.360
It's just f over i.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.670
Questions about that?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:20.744
Yeah?

00:08:20.744 --> 00:08:23.517
AUDIENCE: Does this also assume
the rate of change over time?

00:08:23.517 --> 00:08:25.100
JONATHAN GRUBER:
That's a great point.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.420
Yes, I'm assuming constant
interest right over time.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.930
Now in reality, you'd want to
have each period's interest

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.929
rate here, and then you
can't use this formula,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.820
because the interest
rate itself is changing.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.530
Very good point.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.559
OK, now the other way
to think about this

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.877
is instead of
thinking just-- this

00:08:41.877 --> 00:08:43.669
will be easy for most
of you, but just it's

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.110
useful to think it through.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.060
Let's flip it on its head and
not think about present value.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.530
Let's think about future value.

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:50.250
This is a useful tool as well.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.620
Let's flip it on its head.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.560
OK, so let's think
about the value

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.450
of a future stream of payments.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.800
Well, by the same logic we
wrote before, future value--

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.600
by the same logic
we wrote before,

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.120
if you're going to
have money that's

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.240
tiers in the future, the
future value of that money

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.430
that you're going to get--

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:13.502
if you're going to basically
take your money and invest it,

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:14.960
you're going to
have money that you

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.000
are going to invest
today and put it

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.780
in the bank at
some interest rate,

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.190
then the future value is the
amount you put in times one

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:24.770
plus the interest rate to the t.

00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:26.570
So I've simply
reversed that formula,

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.350
present value, future value.

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.312
So basically, future value,
if you put money in the bank

00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:32.770
at some interest
rate, you're going

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.540
to get to have over time
that money times one

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.330
plus i to the t.

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.630
Now, the reason we write this
formula out and flip it for you

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.930
is because I want to highlight
the key feature here that I

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:47.430
want to drill into your heads.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.560
One of the, I don't
know, I guess 10 things

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.840
I most care you leave
this course thinking about

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.360
if you're not going to major
in economics or remembering--

00:09:54.360 --> 00:10:00.120
is the beauty of
compounding, which

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.820
is that with a
formula like this,

00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:05.410
you earn interest
on your interest.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.093
If you leave money
in the bank, you

00:10:07.093 --> 00:10:09.510
don't just earn interest on
the initial amount you put in.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.460
You earn interest on the
interest you earn over time.

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:15.250
OK, and this can be quite large.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.733
So let's do a
simple example just

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:19.650
to show you how big this
can be and to get you

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.858
all thinking about what you
should do with your money

00:10:21.858 --> 00:10:23.520
when you get a job.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.910
OK, imagine you plan to
work full time from age 22

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.228
to age 70.

00:10:29.228 --> 00:10:30.770
A little daunting
to think about now.

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.450
Probably, most people
will retire after 70

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.310
by the time you guys
retire, but let's just

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.840
think about 22 to 70.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.360
And let's say that you can save
at a constant 7% interest rate.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.180
Inflation is zero.

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.430
The interest rate is constant.

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:44.060
Make life easy.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.940
7% interest rate.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.870
And let's consider two different
plans you have for savings.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:51.650
Plan one.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.210
Plan one is that
you're going to save

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:02.400
$3,000 a year for the first
15 years that you work

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.337
and then stop saving.

00:11:04.337 --> 00:11:05.920
3,000 a year for 15
years, then you're

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.920
going to leave that in
the bank, leave it alone,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.020
never save anymore.

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.210
Just let that money
sit in the bank.

00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.580
Well in that case,
what will you have?

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:19.650
Well, after the first 15 years
of putting $3,000 in the bank

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:26.652
every year, if you work out the
math, you will have $75,000.

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:31.520
$75,387 after 15 years.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.220
OK, now that's not
just 15 years times--

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.960
that's bigger than
15 times 3,000,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.080
because you're earning
interest along the way.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.443
OK, that's those 15 years.

00:11:39.443 --> 00:11:41.360
Then, you're just going
to let that sit there.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.560
And that's going to sit there.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.768
Remember, after 15 years--
you started working at 22.

00:11:44.768 --> 00:11:46.250
You're only 37 years old.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.132
That's going to then sit
there for the next 33 years.

00:11:50.132 --> 00:11:51.340
You're not going to touch it.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:52.715
You're not going
to save anymore.

00:11:52.715 --> 00:11:54.710
What that means
is after 33 years,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:02.140
this turns into $75,387
times 1.07 to the 33rd.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:07.760
OK, after 33 years, or $703,000.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.550
703,010.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.830
OK, so you save $3,000.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.830
It's not a lot of money.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.210
You guys can make
a lot of money.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:19.110
$3,000 for 15 years, and then
you never have to save again.

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:21.420
Contrast that with a
different approach.

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.920
Let's say you say, look.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.530
That's stupid.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.030
I'm young.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.630
I'm going to party.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.120
I'll worry about retirement
when retirement is closer.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.290
I'm going to save nothing
the first 15 years,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:30.795
and then I'm going to
save $3,000 every year.

00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:32.670
The first 15 years I'm
going to save nothing,

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.160
then I'll save
$3,000 every year.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.220
OK, well if you do
that and do the math,

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:45.900
you end up with when
you retire, $356,800.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.910
Think about this for one second.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:53.410
In this case, you saved for
more than twice as many years.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:59.230
You saved for 33 years, and
you ended up with half as much.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.680
That's the miracle
of compounding.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:04.110
The earlier you
save, the more money

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:05.400
you can make along the way.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.540
And that's why you guys need
to start saving right away.

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.160
Yeah?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.327
AUDIENCE: What was plan two?

00:13:10.327 --> 00:13:13.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Plan two was I
do nothing the first 15 years,

00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.338
then I save $3,000 a
year for the remaining 30

00:13:16.338 --> 00:13:17.130
years of my career.

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:25.660
So literally, in plan
one, I save for 15 years,

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.040
and then I stop.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.905
Here, I save for 33 years.

00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:30.280
But by starting
earlier and using

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.780
the miracle of
compounding, I end up

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.320
with twice as much money.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.088
OK, now this is
actually pretty--

00:13:35.088 --> 00:13:36.880
this is one of the few
things in this class

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.838
my kids could understand
when they were little.

00:13:38.838 --> 00:13:41.427
Because have any of you been
to the Boston Science Museum?

00:13:41.427 --> 00:13:42.510
Have any of you guys been?

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.150
OK, there's a little kid area,
where they've got this ramp.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.360
And you can essentially
drop balls down a ramp.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.610
And one ramp is
flat and then steep,

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:52.488
and one ramp is
steep and then flat.

00:13:52.488 --> 00:13:54.780
And of course, the one that's
steep and then flat wins.

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.710
It's faster.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.335
And that's just
because of compounding.

00:13:57.335 --> 00:13:59.160
That's because acceleration
is compounding.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:01.785
OK, so basically, the
point is that the earlier

00:14:01.785 --> 00:14:03.660
you start saving, the
more money you'll have.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.070
And that's why you guys
should pay attention

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.940
when you're offered a
job and offered a 401k

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.150
and not think, retirement,
I'll never retire.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:12.030
You say, no, I want to save now,
because the more I save now,

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:15.270
the more that will compound
by the time I retire.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.162
OK, now you can
actually see this.

00:14:18.162 --> 00:14:19.620
It's not just MIT
students who have

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.790
to think about this but
professional athletes.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.330
So probably, none
of you have heard

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.670
of Bobby Bonilla Any of you
guys heard of Bobby Bonilla?

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:28.693
OK, well if you were 25
years ago in this class,

00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:30.110
if you were into
sports, you would

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.277
have heard of Bobby Bonilla.

00:14:31.277 --> 00:14:34.770
He was a pretty good
player in his time.

00:14:34.770 --> 00:14:38.058
And he retired.

00:14:38.058 --> 00:14:40.350
But by the end of his career,
he was kind of a slacker.

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.517
He wasn't really worth much.

00:14:41.517 --> 00:14:43.020
He was playing for the Mets.

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:44.520
And the Mets said, look.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.050
In 1999, they said, look.

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.397
We basically want to pay
you off to leave the team.

00:14:48.397 --> 00:14:49.230
You have a contract.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:51.690
We're just going to basically
pay the remaining 5.9 million

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.480
on your contract in
1999, give you the money.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.220
Most athletes would've said
great, I'm off to Vegas.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.470
Bobby Bonilla didn't.

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:59.310
He said, well, look.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.590
I've got enough money
right now, but I

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:02.920
might need the money later.

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:07.410
So instead, why don't you defer
the money at an 8% interest

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.680
rate and pay me
starting in 2011 when

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.840
I'm getting close to
retirement and need the money?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:13.660
They were like, great.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.130
That's really great.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:14.700
We don't have to pay you now.

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.660
That's great.

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:19.830
Well Bobby Bonilla, by the time
his payments started in 2011,

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.400
they'd grown to $30 million.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.985
And every year on a certain
day-- it just passed recently.

00:15:24.985 --> 00:15:26.130
They call it Bobby Bonilla.

00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:27.990
Bobby Bonilla, who's
now like 70 years old,

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:31.740
gets a million dollar check
from the Mets every year.

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.470
Because he was patient enough
to put this off and get

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.660
the virtue of compounding.

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.450
So this is sort of-- if Bobby
Bonilla, a stupid baseball

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.380
player, can do it,
you guys can do it.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.830
So make sure that
you guys are saving

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.510
when you start your jobs.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.700
OK, questions about that?

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.420
OK, now let's get a
little bit realistic,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.510
and let's recognize that in
life, prices aren't constant,

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.780
but rather we have inflation.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.080
And how does that affect
our thinking here?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.460
How does inflation
affect the way

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:05.350
we think about this problem?

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.310
Well, it turns out, it
actually adds one step,

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.590
but it's actually a pretty
easy step to put in.

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:12.880
It actually turns out
that you can add inflation

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.437
without doing a
whole lot of work.

00:16:14.437 --> 00:16:16.270
So let's talk about
first what inflation is.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:20.010
Inflation is the rise in the
price level year over year.

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:23.020
Technically, the inflation
rate is a percentage concept.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:26.950
It's the percent rise in the
price level year after year.

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:28.810
You might say, the
price level of what?

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.590
Of a banana?

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:30.550
Of a computer?

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.300
Of what?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.550
Well, what the
government does is they

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:37.270
form something called the
consumer price index, the CPI.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.200
Did I talk about the CPI yet?

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.250
OK, I'm sorry.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.740
I just hate repeating myself.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.150
OK, so they form something
called the consumer price

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.650
index.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:46.000
What's the consumer price index?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.640
Literally, the government
every quarter, I believe--

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.020
it may be every month--

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.250
goes out and gets the prices of
a basket of hundreds of goods.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:59.080
They literally say, what does a
banana cost this month compared

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.250
to last month?

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.040
What does a laptop cost
this month compared

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.630
to last month, et cetera?

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:07.060
So they go out, and they
price this bundle of goods.

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:09.825
And then literally, they
just ask, how has the price--

00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:11.200
they then take a
weighted average

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.236
of that bundle, where the
weights are consumer spending.

00:17:14.236 --> 00:17:16.569
So consumers spend a lot more
of their income on housing

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:17.580
than bananas.

00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:19.955
So the price of housing gets
a lot more weight in the CPI

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:21.660
than does the price of bananas.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.700
Essentially, a weighted
average of prices in society,

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.650
and then they create an index.

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.440
1982 is normalized
to one, and they just

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.570
say how much in
percentage terms did

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.890
that weighted average
bundle go up in price?

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.090
OK, and you can see
that in Figure 17.1.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.600
Here's historical CPI.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.640
So basically, what
you see is, this

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:44.345
is the level of the CPI,
which is sort of meaningless.

00:17:44.345 --> 00:17:45.960
What we care about
is inflation, which

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.770
is the year to year
percentage change in the CPI.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.390
And what you can see is,
basically it's going up.

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.670
Prices are going up.

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:58.590
It went up very steeply if
you look from 1970 to 1980.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.920
The slope there was much higher
than the slope before or after.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.360
We had very rapid
inflation in the 1970s.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.032
It then has then
since flattened,

00:18:07.032 --> 00:18:08.490
and inflation has
been much slower.

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:11.160
And inflation averages
about 3% a year.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.545
OK, so basically, that's
how we measure inflation.

00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:18.080
Now, the question
is, how does that

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.230
affect our thinking
about present value

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:23.210
if there's actually inflation?

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.260
And the bottom line is, we
don't care about dollars.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.250
We care about how
many goods we can buy.

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:31.900
Therefore, it
doesn't matter what's

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:35.820
happening to how
much money we have.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.400
It matters what's happening
to how many goods we can buy.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.740
Therefore, what we
care about is not

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.930
what we call the
nominal interest rate.

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.380
We care about what we call the
real interest rate, r, which

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.335
we define as the nominal
interest rate, which

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:49.710
is what we've been
talking about,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:53.013
we see advertised on a bank,
minus the rate of inflation,

00:18:53.013 --> 00:18:54.555
which for some reason
we use pi, even

00:18:54.555 --> 00:18:55.920
though that's also profits.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:58.580
So sorry about that.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.810
OK, so we define the
real interest rate

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:07.280
as the nominal interest rate
minus the inflation rate.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.060
The real interest rate
is the nominal rate

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.320
minus the inflation rate.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.900
And what the real
interest rate measures

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.600
is how much more I
have in terms of goods

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.525
I can consume, not
how much more I

00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:19.650
have in terms of dollars,
which actually in the end

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.360
doesn't matter.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.550
OK, so suppose that I'm going
to save $100 at a 10% interest

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.117
rate.

00:19:27.117 --> 00:19:28.200
Let's go a simple example.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.120
I save $100 at a
10% interest rate.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:34.200
OK, then next year, I have $110.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.520
But that's irrelevant.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.170
What I want to know is, how
many goods can I buy next year?

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:39.750
So for example, let's say
you spend all your money

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.500
on Skittles.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:42.180
That's all you buy.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:46.050
OK, and let's say Skittles
cost $1 this year.

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:49.343
And there's no inflation,
so they cost $1 next year.

00:19:49.343 --> 00:19:51.260
Then, what that means
with a 10% interest rate

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:54.930
is you can buy 10 more
bags of Skittles next year.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.960
This year, your $100 could
buy you 100 bags of Skittles.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.810
Next year, your $110 can
buy 110 bags of Skittles,

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.180
so you are 10% richer.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.548
But now, let's say the price
of Skittles goes up 10%.

00:20:07.548 --> 00:20:09.090
Well, what that
means is you can only

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:10.800
buy the same amount
of Skittles next year

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:11.925
as you could buy this year.

00:20:11.925 --> 00:20:15.360
You could buy 100 bags this
year and 100 bags next year.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.550
So it doesn't matter that
you have $110 next year.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:18.600
Who cares?

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.715
You only get the same
amount of Skittles.

00:20:20.715 --> 00:20:22.590
What you care about is
the goods you can buy.

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:23.430
We wrote down utility.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:25.230
We didn't put dollars
of utility function.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.282
We put consumption.

00:20:27.282 --> 00:20:28.740
So the interest
rate you care about

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.190
is the real interest rate.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:33.420
If the nominal interest rate
is 10% but inflation is 10%,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.490
then the real
interest rate is zero.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.900
You can't buy any
more goods next year.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:39.900
All the money you made
by putting it in the bank

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.250
got eaten up by how much
more expensive things are.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.460
So what that means is,
all the math we've done

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.133
and everything we'll talk
about all goes through.

00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:52.550
You just need to be thinking
about using the real interest

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:55.330
rate, not the nominal
interest rate.

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:58.510
But otherwise, everything
we've done goes through.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.070
You just need to
essentially think

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.140
about this in terms
of how many goods

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:05.380
you can buy, not how
much money you have.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.090
Now, this isn't quite--

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.060
let me just take two minutes
and do a little macroeconomics--

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.970
this isn't quite as
simple as it sounds,

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:16.510
because of course, you
see in the bank, i,

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:17.740
in the bank window, i.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.240
You don't see pi.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.240
You don't see inflation.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.715
That's what we revealed ex post.

00:21:21.715 --> 00:21:23.590
So really, technically--
you don't know this.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:25.182
It's just for those who care.

00:21:25.182 --> 00:21:26.890
You don't have to know
this for the test.

00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.345
Technically, what you really
want is expected inflation.

00:21:30.345 --> 00:21:32.470
When you think of putting
in the money in the bank,

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:34.180
you know you'll learn 3%.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.680
The real interest
rate is that minus

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.780
what you think inflation
is going to be.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.580
So it actually
becomes complicated.

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:41.690
It's not as simple.

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.120
Ex post, it's easy to find
the real interest rate.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.040
Ex ante, it's not
so easy, because it

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.500
depends on what you think
inflation is going to be.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.730
So there's some tricks there.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:52.105
There's also a bunch of tricks
in measuring the inflation

00:21:52.105 --> 00:21:53.070
rate.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.760
So for example, like I said,
the Bureau of Labor Statistics

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.730
goes out and has a bundle of
600 goods and gets their prices.

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:00.620
But what is a good?

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:01.940
I mean, a banana is a banana.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:04.220
But a laptop, what
the hell is a laptop?

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.540
How much ram does it have?

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.240
What's the graphics card?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.020
How fancy is the display?

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.690
Well, the Bureau
of Labor Statistics

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:13.982
doesn't go out and price
literally hundreds of laptops.

00:22:13.982 --> 00:22:16.090
It prices one or two.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.470
And the problem with
that is the following.

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:21.860
Let's say you find that
today, a laptop is 1,000,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:23.980
and tomorrow it's 1500.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.120
But it can do--

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.540
let's say today, a laptop is
1,000, and tomorrow, it's 1500.

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.280
But it can do a ton more stuff.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:33.560
Well, we would say
inflation's 50%,

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.443
but that's not really right.

00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:37.610
Because the good you're
consuming is not the laptop,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.990
it's the computing
ability of the laptop.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.000
And that's gone up.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.270
So to say inflation's
50% is wrong.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.370
Inflation's 50% minus
the quality improvement

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:49.290
of the better laptop you got.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:50.320
Think of it another way.

00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.750
Imagine laptop prices didn't
go up, but ram doubled.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.880
Would you say
you're no better off

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.640
buying a laptop with twice as
much ram at the same price?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.180
No, you're better off.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:04.530
But our inflation concept would
say, no, you're the same off.

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.160
So the trick here is,
it's simple in practice,

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.020
and we'll pretend it's simple
just to say r is i minus pi.

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:12.040
But two tricks-- a,
it's expected pi,

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.860
which is hard to guess.

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.613
And b, inflation is
really hard to measure,

00:23:16.613 --> 00:23:19.030
because there's things like
quality bias and other things.

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:20.790
There's a whole field of
macroeconomics worrying

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:23.290
about inflation measurement,
so we won't spend a lot of time

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:23.800
on it.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.860
But it's just sort
of interesting just

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:29.730
to talk about how at high level
we go through things here.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:31.250
Like everything
else in this class,

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.730
largely, we get it right.

00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:35.160
Largely, expected inflation
is not too badly modeled

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.660
by last year's inflation.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.640
And quality bias, we
can model and stuff.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.380
So this isn't a bad
model, but it just

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:41.880
points to some of
the subtleties you

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.255
have to deal with
in reality when

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:47.260
you try to implement these
basic sort of formulations.

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:51.490
Now, with that in mind,
I'm going to now say,

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:54.080
let's assume inflation
is zero again.

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.800
So we'll go back
and use i, and we'll

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.670
use i interchangeably with r
for the rest of this course

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:02.050
unless asked differently.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.300
Unless told definitely,
assume inflation is zero,

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.850
so i and r are interchangeable.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.430
With that in mind, let's
go to the next topic, which

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:13.780
is taking these tools, how do
we model choices over time?

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:19.050
How do people model?

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.368
How do people make
decisions over time?

00:24:22.368 --> 00:24:23.535
And there's a simple answer.

00:24:23.535 --> 00:24:26.940
So this is tricky, because
if I said to you, hey,

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.870
I'm going to give--

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.060
do you want $30 or $50?

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.188
You would say, I want $50.

00:24:31.188 --> 00:24:32.730
But actually, you
shouldn't say that.

00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:34.830
You should say, over what period
of time am I getting the 30,

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:37.170
and over what period of
time am I getting the 50?

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.620
If it's today, I want 50.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.280
But if the 50 is 20 years in
the future and the 30's today,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.150
I might want the 30.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.240
What that means is, you
have to evaluate choices

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.670
in present value terms.

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.590
You can't just add
up the money, you

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.710
have to evaluate those choices
in present value terms.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.720
And then, you need
to pick the option

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.578
with the highest present value.

00:24:57.578 --> 00:24:59.370
So once again, let's
come back to athletes,

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.100
because athletic contracts
deal with this all the time.

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.600
Let's imagine an
athlete considering

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.810
two different contracts.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:11.190
Contract one, contract
a, pays $1 million today.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:27.760
Contract b pays 500,000 today
and 1.5 million in 10 years.

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.790
OK, now when you read
it in the newspaper,

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.540
you'll see this guy
got offered a million,

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.602
this guy got
offered two million.

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:38.060
That's what the
newspaper will say.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.422
But that's wrong,
because these are

00:25:40.422 --> 00:25:41.880
paid at different
periods of times,

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.088
so they're different amounts.

00:25:43.088 --> 00:25:48.560
Indeed, the present value of
the first contract is what?

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:49.310
$1 million.

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:50.050
It's today.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.280
What's the present value
of the second contract?

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.410
Someone tell me how
I'd write that down.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:57.020
I'd write down the present
value of the second contract.

00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:57.540
Yeah?

00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:02.060
AUDIENCE: 500,000
plus 1.5 million

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:06.912
over one plus whatever the
interest is based on the time.

00:26:06.912 --> 00:26:08.460
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:11.190
Which is one plus the
interest rate to the 10,

00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:13.560
because you're getting
it in 10 years.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:17.640
So essentially, that means
that whether it's a better deal

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:20.160
or not depends on
the interest rate.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:24.110
Indeed, if the
interest rate is 7%,

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.470
and the interest
rate is 7%, this

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.880
has a present value
of 1.3 million.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.600
So it's a good deal.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:36.270
If the interest
rate was 14%, then

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:44.530
this deal would have a
present value of 0.9 million.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:46.245
So it's a worse deal.

00:26:46.245 --> 00:26:48.120
So whether or not this
a better or worse deal

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.780
depends on the interest rate.

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:52.130
Why is that?

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:54.980
Why is this a worse deal the
higher the interest rate?

00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:00.652
AUDIENCE: Because if he'd
gotten the money earlier,

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:02.860
he wouldn't have benefited
from being able to collect

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:04.110
that interest earlier.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:06.610
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly, he
could have invested it earlier,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.250
gotten the compounding, and
had way more money in 10 years.

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:13.680
So the higher the interest
rate, the more you

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:16.260
want to get your money
upfront and save it,

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:19.930
the less valuable is
money in the future.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.790
Now, essentially,
what this says is

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:23.690
that you have to always use
present value to bring things

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.565
into current dollars.

00:27:24.565 --> 00:27:26.470
Now, this is not an
abstract concept.

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:28.970
Let's take Max Scherzer, who's
a pitcher with the Washington

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:30.320
Nationals.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.720
Max Scherzer a
couple of years ago

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:40.410
signed a seven year $210
million contract, which

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.870
he was able to brag was the
second highest ever signed

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.870
by a pitcher and the 10th
highest contract ever signed

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.100
by any baseball player.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.510
Seven years, 210.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:52.320
But in fact, that
contract was not--

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:55.460
we're going to pay you $30
million a year for seven years.

00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:57.210
It was, we're going
to pay you $15 million

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:59.040
a year for 14 years.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.840
You're going to
play for only seven.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:03.320
We're going to pay
you over 14 years.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.060
So in fact, in
present value terms,

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:06.500
that was worth somewhat less.

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.060
If you use the
current interest rate

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.850
when he signed it
which was about 4.7%,

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:14.030
it was only worth
actually 166 million.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:15.990
Not too shabby, but
suddenly it drops

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.540
to the 20th most
valuable baseball

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.970
contract and about
fourth among pitchers.

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:22.860
So Max Scherzer was able to feel
better about himself that he

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.777
signed this valuable
contract, but in fact, it

00:28:24.777 --> 00:28:26.068
was worth less than he thought.

00:28:26.068 --> 00:28:27.830
I mean, shed no tears
for Max Scherzer.

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:28.940
He's doing fine.

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.838
But it was worth
less than he thought.

00:28:30.838 --> 00:28:32.630
Or maybe an example
that's more in our mind

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:36.080
with the Mega Millions--
think about a lottery winner.

00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.020
So if a Mega Millions
winner gets $290 million,

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:45.110
which sounds like a great deal,
that's paid out over 20 years.

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:48.040
So it's not $290 million,
it's 14 and and a half million

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.400
for each of 20 years.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.990
So in present value terms, if
we think about a 7% interest

00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:58.470
rate, then that's not 290
million, it's 164 million.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.660
Once again, not too shabby.

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.430
OK, but a lot less than
the advertised amount.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:09.520
So we have to take these dollars
and put them in present value.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.860
So now, here's an interesting
question for that.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.740
If you look at the
recent lottery,

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:18.525
you had a choice of one
person won 1.6 billion,

00:29:18.525 --> 00:29:20.900
one person one that, a person
in South Carolina won that.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.870
And they were given a
choice of the 1.6 billion,

00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:25.870
which is paid actually
over 30 years,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.980
or a lump sum they
could get right away.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.710
How should they decide which
of those options to take?

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:34.960
How should they decide whether
to take the 1.6 billion

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.240
paid over 30 years,
so 1.6 over 30, paid

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:41.050
in equal installments over
time versus just getting a lump

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:41.980
sum today.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.260
Not of 1.6 million,
but a lower amount.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.120
How should they
think about that?

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.520
AUDIENCE: They should
evaluate the present value.

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.420
JONATHAN GRUBER: They should
add the present value.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.710
They should say, well, what
do I think the interest

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:51.800
rate is going to be?

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.970
If I think it's going
to be really low--

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.300
let's say the interest
rate is going to be zero.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.164
Then which deal should I take?

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.627
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:00.627 --> 00:30:02.710
JONATHAN GRUBER: I should
spread it out over time,

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:04.630
because the money in the future
is worth the same as today,

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:06.620
so I might as well
take the 1.6 billion.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.330
But if I think the
interest rate is

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.730
going to be higher, than I
should take the money upfront

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.770
and invest that money
and earn my own interest.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.255
So essentially, it
becomes a debate

00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:15.130
of what you think the
interest rate is versus

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.922
what the state thinks
the interest rate is.

00:30:16.922 --> 00:30:19.870
They're setting those two to
be equal under some assumption

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:20.745
of the interest rate.

00:30:20.745 --> 00:30:22.245
I don't know what
number they chose.

00:30:22.245 --> 00:30:23.500
Whatever number they chose.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.720
It was some number they chose,
because this is our assumption

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.470
of the interest rate.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:27.520
You've got to decide, do you
think the interest rate's

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.730
going to be higher or lower?

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.250
If you think it's going to be
higher than the state thinks

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.940
it is, then you want the money
upfront, and you'll invest it.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.440
If you think it's
going to be lower,

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.700
than you should take the money
over time, because the state is

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.158
giving you basically
a better deal.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:42.440
Do you understand that?

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.830
OK, so now armed
with this, let's

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:51.260
go and think about how do firms
make investment decisions?

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:55.990
How do firms make
investment decisions?

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:05.320
Remember, investment
is about the delay

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.980
of current consumption
for future assumptions.

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:10.930
It's about putting
some aside today

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:13.360
by spending money on a
machine which will deliver

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.830
you benefits in the future.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.070
Now, this adds one
wrinkle to what we've

00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:21.418
done so far, which is that we've
only talked about money that's

00:31:21.418 --> 00:31:23.710
always positive, some amount
you get get in the future.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:25.020
When you're making an
investment decision,

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.490
it's a little bit
more complicated,

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:29.200
because you're actually
spending money today

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.005
to make money tomorrow.

00:31:31.005 --> 00:31:32.380
So in that case,
we talk about we

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:35.200
call net present value,
which is the same thing,

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.210
it just allows for
negative values.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.160
Net present value,
which is essentially

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:42.370
saying in every period,
you want to account

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:46.690
for the cost of that period and
the benefits of that period,

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:49.960
and you want to invest only
if the net present value is

00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.490
greater than zero.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.160
So for example,
think about a project

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:58.180
that has a stream of payments
in every period of r sub i,

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.050
every period it's got a
stream of payments of r sub i,

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.402
and a set of costs
that's c sub i.

00:32:03.402 --> 00:32:05.235
The costs are the upfront
investments, maybe

00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:06.810
the maintenance of the machine.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.360
Whatever it costs to run it.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.130
Then, the net present
value of that investment

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:22.330
is r0 minus c0, comma r1
minus c1 over one plus i--

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:30.740
over one plus i plus r2
minus c2 over one plus i

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:34.550
squared plus dot dot
dot for as many periods

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.310
as the investment lasts.

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:41.930
That's the net present
value of an investment.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.570
So basically, what
you want to ask

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:48.350
is, take each period's costs
of benefits into account.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:51.480
On net, is it greater than zero?

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:55.800
OK, so the key point is
that basically, sometimes

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:58.950
investments which
have upfront costs

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.810
can be valuable as
long as the long run

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:02.550
benefits are large enough.

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:06.570
So if you think about an
investment that's got 100--

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:10.980
so think about a simple, trivial
example of the first period

00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:15.600
you buy a machine,
and it costs $100.

00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:18.520
So c0 is 100.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.590
And let's say for every
period thereafter,

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:26.330
that machine will deliver
you revenues, revenue i--

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.310
revenues for i
greater than zero--

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.170
of 200.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.870
But it will have
maintenance costs, costs i

00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.970
greater than zero, of 50.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:39.310
So what's the net present value?

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:45.060
Well, the net present
value is simply minus 100.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.620
And let's say the machine
is going to last forever.

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:52.840
Minus 100 plus 150 over i.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:54.090
Think about that for a second.

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:05.210
Basically, what we're saying
is, you're throwing 100 at it

00:34:05.210 --> 00:34:06.936
today, so that's negative.

00:34:06.936 --> 00:34:08.519
But every period in
the future, you're

00:34:08.519 --> 00:34:11.752
going to net $150, because
you're going to make $200

00:34:11.752 --> 00:34:13.210
and you have $50
maintenance costs.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:14.668
And we have the
formula, so we just

00:34:14.668 --> 00:34:16.159
apply the formula
for perpetuity.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:18.770
We have a set of future
payments of $150,

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:24.190
so your net present value is
minus 100 plus 150 over i.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.100
So let's think about, look
at this formula for a second.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:28.510
What does that say?

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.300
What is the relationship
between whether the firm's going

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.550
to want to invest and
the interest rate?

00:34:35.833 --> 00:34:37.375
What does this imply
the relationship

00:34:37.375 --> 00:34:39.920
is between a firm's desire for
investment and the interest

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.420
rate?

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.489
If the interest rate
goes up, will firms

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.719
want to do more investment,
or less investment, and why?

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:47.719
Will firms want to be
more eager to buy machines

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.460
or less eager to buy machines,
and why, as the interest

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:50.150
rate goes up?

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:50.922
Yeah.

00:34:50.922 --> 00:34:51.980
AUDIENCE: They'll be less eager.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.147
JONATHAN GRUBER: Less eager.

00:34:53.147 --> 00:34:54.719
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:55.505
JONATHAN GRUBER:
They'll be less eager.

00:34:55.505 --> 00:34:56.719
Say it again, because why?

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.344
AUDIENCE: Because if
they're borrowing.

00:35:00.562 --> 00:35:02.520
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah,
or I think an easier way

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.392
to think of borrowing,
just think about,

00:35:04.392 --> 00:35:05.600
they've got a bunch of money.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.000
Apple's got a bunch of money
today they're sitting on.

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.690
If they buy the machine, they're
going to get this return.

00:35:10.690 --> 00:35:13.190
If they don't buy the machine,
they could put it in the bank

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.130
or invest it in Apple stock
and get some interest rate, i.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:19.760
The higher the interest rate,
the less they want invest.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.990
Or think of it this way.

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:26.220
The interest rate is the
opportunity cost of investment.

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:28.460
The more the firm invests
in their machines,

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.030
the less they can earn saving
through some other mechanism.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.150
And the price that
they pay by foregoing

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:38.110
that other savings is i.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:38.740
Yeah.

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:41.520
AUDIENCE: So does that mean if
you're looking at a machine,

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:43.808
it's better to try to
then push the cost further

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.100
into the future, because then
they can't also divide by

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.460
the [INAUDIBLE] sign?

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.790
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Basically, you always want

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:51.700
to try to make as much
money early as you can

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.242
and make the cost
as late as you can.

00:35:53.242 --> 00:35:58.480
For any given amount, you'd
absolutely like to do that.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.980
That's why we'll talk about
this in my public finance class.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:02.840
We talk about why, when
you're paying taxes,

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.110
you always want to try to
find shenanigans that allow

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.985
you to pay your taxes later.

00:36:06.985 --> 00:36:08.360
So for any given
amount of taxes,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.808
the later you pay
it, the less it

00:36:09.808 --> 00:36:12.350
costs you, because you get to
earn the interest along the way

00:36:12.350 --> 00:36:15.500
and then pay it later on.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.840
This is a key
macroeconomic concept.

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:20.240
You'll often hear in the
news, high interest rates

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.843
are bad for business.

00:36:21.843 --> 00:36:23.510
And you might have
thought, why is that?

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.645
This is why.

00:36:24.645 --> 00:36:27.020
High interest rates are bad
for the economy, you'll hear.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.030
Why are high interest
rates bad for the economy?

00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.730
You might say, wait a second.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:30.850
That makes no sense.

00:36:30.850 --> 00:36:33.067
A high interest rate means
I earn more on my savings.

00:36:33.067 --> 00:36:34.400
Why is that bad for the economy?

00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.900
It's bad for the
economy, because it

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:38.140
lowers the demand for capital.

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.760
Because the higher
the interest rate,

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.420
the less firms actually
want to invest.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:46.650
The more they just want to stock
their money away in the bank.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:52.450
So that is the key question.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:55.560
Now, then let me ask
another question.

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.845
If you're a firm, what's
the right i to use?

00:36:59.845 --> 00:37:02.220
If you're a firm thinking
about this investment decision,

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.270
we know the higher i is,
the less you want invest.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:06.230
But what is i?

00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.438
Once again, forget inflation.

00:37:07.438 --> 00:37:08.360
Inflation is zero.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.880
What's the right what we
call firm discount rate?

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.097
The discount rate is
the amount by which

00:37:15.097 --> 00:37:17.430
firms are going to discount
future dollars to bring them

00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:18.180
back to today.

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.575
How does the firm think
about what i to use?

00:37:21.575 --> 00:37:22.700
What i should the firm use?

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:27.860
Your Apple.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.610
Yeah, go ahead.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.943
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] i that
makes that positive, right?

00:37:30.943 --> 00:37:32.527
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, they don't want

00:37:32.527 --> 00:37:34.287
to invest unless it's positive.

00:37:34.287 --> 00:37:35.120
That's a good point.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:37.315
But the way that is,
they write down the math,

00:37:37.315 --> 00:37:38.610
and they plug in an i.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:41.720
What i do they plug in?

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.220
Yeah.

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.290
AUDIENCE: Is it published
by the government?

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:47.340
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, i might be.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.870
But there's not one answer.

00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:53.420
What's the general answer
the firm wants to use?

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.082
What's the general answer?

00:37:55.082 --> 00:37:56.790
That the firm-- if
you're a firm thinking

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:58.290
about making an
investment, you want

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.380
to discount that investment.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.040
What do you want
to discount it by?

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.040
Yeah.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.380
AUDIENCE: The opportunity
cost of the next best return.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.830
JONATHAN GRUBER: The next
best thing you could do.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.892
So if I'm thinking about
buying this machine,

00:38:09.892 --> 00:38:11.350
when I discount
it, I want to think

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:14.290
about what's the next best thing
I could do with that money?

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:16.227
That's the discount
rate I want to use.

00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:18.310
So in a world where firms
either can buy a machine

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.790
or put it in the
bank, it's easy.

00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:21.040
It's the bank interest rate.

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.390
But life's not that easy.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:24.995
Firms have dozens
of investments.

00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:26.370
So for every
investment, you want

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.167
to discount it by
the next best thing

00:38:28.167 --> 00:38:29.250
you can do with the money.

00:38:29.250 --> 00:38:30.340
It's the concept of
opportunity cost.

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.940
That's why it's the very first
thing we taught in this class.

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.857
Opportunity cost is
always what drives things.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.190
Questions about that?

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.450
Now, this isn't just for firms.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.240
This same math applies
to consumers as well.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.070
Let's think about me.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:49.440
A number of years
ago, I had to decide

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:53.190
whether to insulate
my ancient house.

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.580
Let's write down the numbers
to think how this worked.

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.110
I had heating
bills at that time,

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:01.200
back when gas was
cheaper, of about $2,000

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:06.630
a year was my heating
bills for the house.

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:09.300
The best estimate
I could get was

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.090
that if I insulated
my house, I would

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.180
lower my heating costs by 25%.

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:20.850
So my heating costs would
fall by $500 per year

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:23.610
if I escalated my house.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.220
But to insulate my house, I had
to pay the guy to insulate it.

00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:36.790
And the insulation cost $4,000.

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.482
How do I think about whether
I should insulate or not?

00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:41.940
How do I think
about that decision?

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.357
What equation
should I write down?

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:46.780
Yeah.

00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:52.753
AUDIENCE: Minus 4,000
plus 500 over i.

00:39:52.753 --> 00:39:53.795
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:58.955
I should say, I'll
assume I'm going

00:39:58.955 --> 00:40:01.390
to own the house forever, or
at least long enough that I

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.320
can treat it as forever.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.830
And I write down that formula.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:06.950
And what that formula
says is that if I

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:12.370
think the interest rate is less
than 12.5%, I should insulate.

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.770
If I think the interest
rate is more than 12.5%,

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.320
I should just invest the
money and use the returns

00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:20.222
that I invested to pay
my higher heating bills.

00:40:20.222 --> 00:40:22.180
So it all depends on what
the interest rate is.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.330
So that's why-- I did it.

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.580
I insulated.

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:31.400
So the same logic
we can think of

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:37.473
is basically, essentially
the same idea as firms.

00:40:37.473 --> 00:40:39.890
You want to think about the
upfront costs and the long run

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.620
returns.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.030
And here's a fun
economics question.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:47.790
What if I don't intend to
hold the house forever?

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:50.250
I would argue I should
still use this formula.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.860
Why?

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:52.850
Yeah?

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:55.472
AUDIENCE: Because whenever
you decide to sell the house,

00:40:55.472 --> 00:40:56.430
you increase the value.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:57.972
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Exactly, because I'm

00:40:57.972 --> 00:41:00.183
increasing the value of an
asset that I'll then sell.

00:41:00.183 --> 00:41:01.600
So presumably, by
insulating, I've

00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.470
raised the price of my house.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:04.780
How much have I raised it by?

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:08.403
Exactly 500 over i, so I'm going
to insulate and sell next year.

00:41:08.403 --> 00:41:09.820
I should still
insulate, because I

00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:13.430
should get 500 over i
more dollars for my house.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:14.680
So in fact, it doesn't matter.

00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:16.870
If you can sell an
asset, then actually

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:18.822
your horizon is always infinite.

00:41:18.822 --> 00:41:20.530
It's not just the
short horizon, which is

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:23.360
kind of an interesting insight.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:25.490
So the last thing I
want to talk about

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.400
is the fact that these
decisions are not

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.740
just relevant-- you guys
are like retirement,

00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:33.560
business machines, insulation--
god, you're old, John.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:35.220
I don't care about
any of this stuff.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.220
Well, let's talk about
something you care about,

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.210
which is going to college.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:40.680
Let's talk about your decision.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:43.263
You've already made it, but
you've got a little sibling,

00:41:43.263 --> 00:41:45.180
and they're deciding
whether to go to college.

00:41:47.955 --> 00:41:49.560
And they're not
going to go to MIT.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.750
They're going to go to
a more typical school.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.780
And they've got to decide
whether to go to college.

00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:59.070
Well in fact, their decision
is an investment decision,

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.115
just like any other
investment decision.

00:42:01.115 --> 00:42:02.490
What they're
investing in is what

00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:06.240
we call their human capital.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.590
When you get education, you're
investing in yourself, just

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:12.660
like you invest in a machine.

00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.030
Because you are,
you hope, raising

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.960
the value of what you can
do, of what you can earn,

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.510
by investing in learning stuff.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:24.530
Well, that human
capital investment

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:27.800
has the same features
of any other investment.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:31.380
There's an opportunity
cost, which is what?

00:42:31.380 --> 00:42:34.020
What's the opportunity
cost of investing your time

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.853
in going to college--
what's the opportunity

00:42:35.853 --> 00:42:37.720
cost of going to college?

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.250
AUDIENCE: You could get a job.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:39.550
JONATHAN GRUBER: You could--

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:40.270
there's two.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:41.995
One is, you can get a job.

00:42:41.995 --> 00:42:43.870
AUDIENCE: You could also
invest your tuition.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:45.950
JONATHAN GRUBER: You
could not pay tuition.

00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:47.575
So if you think about
going to college,

00:42:47.575 --> 00:42:49.410
you're sacrificing two things.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:52.090
All that money
you're paying, you

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.013
could basically invest instead
of giving it to some college.

00:42:55.013 --> 00:42:57.430
And you could be out earning
money instead of sitting here

00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:59.190
listening to me.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:03.492
OK, so if you think
about that, it actually

00:43:03.492 --> 00:43:05.450
becomes a harder decision
than you might think.

00:43:05.450 --> 00:43:07.610
So let's think about
a simple example.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:10.420
Let's imagine that if
you don't go to college,

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:13.240
you work from age 18 to 70.

00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.260
And if you do go to college,
you work from age 22 to 70.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.960
So we're going to
ignore grad school.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.210
Four years of college, you
either start working at 18,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.410
or you start working at 22.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:25.100
And let's say college
costs $35,000 a year.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.910
Obviously, not MIT.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:33.170
OK, let's say college
costs $35,000 a year.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:45.070
And let's say that if you
worked starting in high school,

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:55.650
you could have earned $20,000.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.955
You could have
started at $20,000

00:43:58.955 --> 00:44:02.690
if you'd gone to work at age 18.

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:04.760
Well, we can actually
graph what this

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.520
looks like in figure 17.2 17.2.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:16.080
If you think about age
18, from age 18 to age 22,

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.270
that's the green area.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.310
If you go to
college, you give up

00:44:20.310 --> 00:44:25.810
the $35,000 in tuition and the
20,000 you could have earned.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:29.740
The bottom line is
basically-- the red line

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:32.050
is your lifetime earnings
if you go to high school,

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.210
if you don't go to college.

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:38.920
The blue line is your
lifetime earnings

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.630
if you do go to college.

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:43.840
Empirical estimates
suggest that at age 22,

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.170
the typical college
graduate earns $45,000.

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:49.240
Yes, you're not the
typical college graduate.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:51.520
The typical college
graduate earns $45,000.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.935
And the typical high school
non-college education person

00:44:54.935 --> 00:44:57.100
earns $28,000.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:00.450
So at age 22, you come
out of college earning 45,

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:02.920
and if you'd not gone
to college, you earn 28.

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:06.760
Not you, but a normal person.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.730
But moreover, knowledge you earn
more when you leave college,

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.150
your earnings grows faster.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:13.900
So if you're college
educated, it not only

00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.960
means you earn
17,000 more at 22,

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.270
it also means your
earnings grows faster.

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:24.230
So that by age 51, the average
college educated person

00:45:24.230 --> 00:45:27.020
earns $80,000, while
the average high school

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.820
person earns $45,000.

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.120
So what you see here
is, the blue line

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.730
starts above the red line
and the gap widens over time.

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.530
And maybe, I would have
learned to clip this

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:40.910
on if I hadn't gone to college.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.800
OK, so the gap widens over time.

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:45.440
So how do we think
about this decision?

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.960
Well, the cost is
the green area.

00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:51.410
The cost is over four years,
you could have earned money

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:53.480
and you wouldn't have
had to pay tuition.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.820
The benefit is the yellow area.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.800
Over that entire time
after graduation,

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.630
you're making more money.

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:01.720
Now obviously, in terms
of size, the yellow area

00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:04.220
is much, much bigger
than the green area.

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:07.370
But the yellow area comes later.

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:08.290
That's the key thing.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.040
So if I look and say,
look, it's obvious--

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.967
before this lecture,
you might say, well,

00:46:11.967 --> 00:46:13.550
it's obvious you
should go to college.

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.320
Look, the yellow is way
bigger than the green.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.960
But that's not necessarily true,
because the green comes now,

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.430
and the yellow comes later.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.160
Indeed, if you
look at the table,

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.440
this actually shows
the net present value

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.450
of going to college
and high school.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.763
And what this shows is
at low interest rates,

00:46:28.763 --> 00:46:30.430
you're much better
off going to college.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:33.790
So if there's interest
rate, then college

00:46:33.790 --> 00:46:34.990
is a much, much better deal.

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.430
Your net present
value of earnings

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:39.960
if if you go to
college is 2.6 million,

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.510
while it's only 1.6 million
if you don't go to college.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:47.830
But once the interest
rate gets above 8%,

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:51.160
it suddenly becomes a worse
deal to go to college.

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:54.160
That is at only a 9% interest
rate, which existed not that

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.960
long ago in our history.

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:00.100
It was actually a worse
deal for the average person

00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:01.840
to go to college.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.340
Yeah.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:03.820
AUDIENCE: Isn't that not
accounting for financial aid,

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:04.320
though?

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.278
Because if you didn't
have the 35,000 to spend,

00:47:06.278 --> 00:47:08.200
you wouldn't have been
able to invest it?

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
actually, it's interesting.

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.780
It depends on the
form of financial aid.

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:10.990
Why?

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:12.370
Someone tell me why it's
dependent on the form

00:47:12.370 --> 00:47:13.540
of financial aid?

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:15.500
Financial aid comes
in different forms.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:18.760
So why does it depend on how
you get the financial aid?

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.515
Yeah.

00:47:19.515 --> 00:47:21.390
AUDIENCE: Because if
you have to pay it back.

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:23.405
JONATHAN GRUBER: If
it's a grant, then yeah,

00:47:23.405 --> 00:47:25.360
you should just take
that out of the cost.

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.450
But if it's a loan, it
depends what interest

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:28.878
rate you get the loan at.

00:47:28.878 --> 00:47:30.670
If the loan is at the
market interest rate,

00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:33.370
then it's no different.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:36.190
But that's a great point, which
is why college financial aid

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:37.570
comes in two forms.

00:47:37.570 --> 00:47:40.990
Grants for very low income
people, and low interest loans

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.373
for other people.

00:47:42.373 --> 00:47:44.290
Why do we give low
interest loans for college?

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:46.180
Because of this graph.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.030
Because we're saying,
we think people need

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:51.010
to invest in their education.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.343
We're afraid that if they
faced a regular interest rate,

00:47:53.343 --> 00:47:55.635
they won't be willing to do
it, because the green would

00:47:55.635 --> 00:47:56.890
be bigger than the yellow.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.873
So we're actually going to
subsidize their interest rate.

00:47:59.873 --> 00:48:02.290
So you might have thought to
yourself, sort of a weird way

00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:04.873
to get people to go to college
is to have a lower student loan

00:48:04.873 --> 00:48:05.780
interest rate.

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.545
But in fact, it
makes perfect sense.

00:48:07.545 --> 00:48:08.920
By having a student
loan interest

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.140
rate that's lower
than the market rate,

00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:12.790
you encourage people
to go to college,

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:15.595
because essentially you
lower this discount rate,

00:48:15.595 --> 00:48:17.470
at least on the part
that's tuition payments.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:23.160
So that's actually very
exciting way to think about

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.800
and a very important
part of public policy

00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.560
is how we set the interest
rate on student loans.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.270
For any of you-- how many of
you guys have a student loan?

00:48:31.270 --> 00:48:31.950
Do you know?

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:32.960
Any of you guys
have a student loan?

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:33.752
You might not know.

00:48:33.752 --> 00:48:36.030
Anyway, I set the interest
rate on that student loan.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:36.895
So thank you.

00:48:36.895 --> 00:48:38.520
Actually, when I was
in the government,

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.937
I was in the
government 14 months,

00:48:39.937 --> 00:48:41.190
the Clinton Administration.

00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:42.510
It was super fun.

00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:44.580
But looking back, I
only got one thing done,

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:46.872
which I got to set the interest
rate for student loans.

00:48:46.872 --> 00:48:48.400
So that was kind of fun.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:52.320
But otherwise, it was just
a lot of fun being there.

00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:58.680
So anyway, let's stop
there, and we will continue.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.680
What's today, Wednesday?

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.750
So no class on Monday.

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:04.550
That's Veterans Day, so we'll
meet in a week, next Wednesday.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.140
PROFESSOR: So today, what
we're going to be doing is--

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.840
last week, you gave
us some feedback what

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.620
you wanted to do in the class.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.290
We're going to go through that
and talk about the readings.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.320
I'm going to do a
little calling on you

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.590
and helping you take the
class through the readings.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.990
And then the six or seven
things I'm going to do--

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.150
history of money; ledgers;
fiat currency, central banks,

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.630
and credit cards;
the role of money;

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.240
some early digital money.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.048
You had the Clark reading as
to a bunch of failed attempts.

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:58.090
All the way through a
little bit of mobile money,

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.990
all the way up to
Starbucks and Alipay.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.880
And yet, the riddle remains.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.800
We're going to get
really deep into Bitcoin

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.840
in the next three classes.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.080
But this is to give
some foundational

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.203
bits of money and ledgers and
central banking and technology.

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:17.620
And then, of course,
I always like

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.300
to finish the class
talking a little bit

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.230
about why we're doing what we're
doing between now and then.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.820
Even though the
readings are required,

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.810
I know you're all busy.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.790
I know that you've all
got a bunch of classes.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.080
And like good business
students and business people,

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.040
you optimize.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.500
So I'm trying to give you a
sense of why you might read it,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.260
rather than it's required,
at the end of each class

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.550
and how it fits into
the course narrative.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.110
And then we'll do a
little bit of conclusions.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.180
So the survey results.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.320
What did you want to learn?

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.710
This is really
your class, and I'm

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.450
going to learn as much from you.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.950
But hopefully, we're going
to cover what you want.

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.460
So here's a list of those things
that were at least written

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.720
by two of you.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.420
First was technical things.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.600
18 of you said understanding
blockchain technology.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.360
Hopefully, we get
to that, but you

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.840
might find that you'll want
to do more after this class.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.890
The ecosystem and being able
to have an educated discussion,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.500
sort of the dinner party
conversation around blockchain.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.880
I think we'll be successful.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.550
But at the end of
the semester, we're

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.050
going to pull these
slides up again,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.080
and we'll see how
we did as a group.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.810
You all talked a lot
about applications.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.990
How can you actually apply it,
learning in the venture space

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.803
and thinking about where it
really works in the world.

00:02:38.803 --> 00:02:40.720
And I think we're going
to spend a lot of time

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.130
on that in the second half.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.870
But all throughout,
we're going to be

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.090
talking about the
economics and what's

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.670
the reality versus the hype.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.430
You also wanted to understand
its impact on people's lives,

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.320
the regulation.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.530
About six of you said
something about regulation.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.720
I'm glad, because we're only
doing one lecture on that.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.290
But we're going
to spread it out,

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.770
because as we talked
about in our first class--

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.740
and I'm honored
Larry's here again--

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.770
but we're going to always be
thinking about Larry's four

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.840
ways.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.610
And I see-- is it Jihei?

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.380
What are Larry Lessig's--

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.500
you shook your head yes.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.672
AUDIENCE: I know-- let's see.

00:03:29.672 --> 00:03:34.920
It is code and architecture,
market, law, and norms.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.337
PROFESSOR: You got it.

00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:38.670
Does anybody want to say how
that relates to blockchain,

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.980
why we're chatting about that?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.120
Oh, my god, I'm going to have
to cold call fast, right?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.870
You're from R3.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.250
Joe?

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.350
AUDIENCE: No, I remember
we saw it last class,

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.760
but I can't relate
it now to blockchain.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.180
PROFESSOR: Can you relate
it to anything in life?

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.050
Maybe not.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.720
Alan, help your tablemate out.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.148
AUDIENCE: I'm waiting
for my moment to shine.

00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:12.190
PROFESSOR: This isn't it.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.900
AUDIENCE: This isn't it.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.242
PROFESSOR: I'm having fun.

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:16.450
This is what I'm going to do.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.649
I'm just going to have--

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.790
don't worry about it.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.040
So why do markets, code, law--

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.330
I can't see your name,
but is it [INAUDIBLE]??

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.100
Yeah, why?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.760
Why does that
relate to all this?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.260
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat the question?

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.300
PROFESSOR: Jihei, you're
going to repeat the question,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.570
because you went through it.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.900
AUDIENCE: So how does
Larry's four forces relate

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.655
to our topic of blockchain.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:52.680
PROFESSOR: And the four
forces, again, are market,

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.020
so business; law;
code or architecture,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.320
call it technology;
and social norms.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.885
AUDIENCE: So I think
it's because it

00:05:03.885 --> 00:05:07.260
brings a new way of
doing those things,

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.940
like a new tool in order to--

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.680
so what I got from the reading
is these ledgers already

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.220
existed, but given that now
we have big data, for example,

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.760
then more things going on helps
our society roll it out better.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.010
PROFESSOR: Good way to say it.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:28.390
Look, it's unfair of me.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.640
It wasn't one of the readings.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.710
I'm just saying, in
everything in life,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.260
I find these things grind
up against each other.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.630
I spent a lot of time in
Washington in politics,

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.930
but the markets and how
the commercial enterprise

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.280
and the economy grinds up
against technology and sort

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.940
of grinds up against the law--

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.670
and then, of course, just
social normative behavior.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.480
These four forces, in almost
everything one does in life,

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.370
you will find.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.070
And so I just ask you
to always, whether it's

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.900
one reading or another
reading, bring that

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.750
into your thought
process of this class.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.618
I'm not going to assign
Larry's assignment.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:10.410
I didn't know he was
even going to be here.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.710
But I've always thought
it's a good discipline

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.500
to think, OK, what are
the commercial realities,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.180
the markets?

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.280
What's the technology, even
if it's in an earlier day

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.083
and it's the technology of
the car replacing the horse

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:26.625
and carriage?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.330
How does government
or the official sector

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.995
put it into a set of
standards that are required?

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:38.370
And then how do
we, as a society,

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.420
even if it's not required,
just have our behaviors?

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.130
Those are the four forces.

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.560
So that's why.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.750
I probably just
failed Larry's class,

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.220
but that's how I've
thought about it.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:52.080
I did, probably, right?

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:53.960
No, he's shaking his head.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.610
But regulation is just
one of those four forces.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.370
And that's why I pause there.

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.750
And so we'll have it in every
class, but only one lecture.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.030
Money and markets, that's
one of the other forces.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.830
Five of you said you
want to make money,

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:10.373
and I applaud those who
said that, because own it.

00:07:10.373 --> 00:07:11.540
You're in a business school.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.030
Why not?

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.130
But investing and trends.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.470
Now, there was a bunch of
other miscellaneous topics.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:19.845
I'm not going to
go through them.

00:07:19.845 --> 00:07:22.850
I kind of thought the last two
were interesting-- anecdotes

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.350
from my past.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.152
I'm not sure who said that.

00:07:27.152 --> 00:07:29.480
I'm not sure what you want
to know about-- my three

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.430
daughters, my running, or this
Wall Street stuff and finance.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:38.730
And I'd like to understand
hyperbitcoinization, as well,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.390
but I don't know who
asked that question.

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.920
I don't know what
it is, so I'll try

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.070
to figure out what
hyper-- does anyone want

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.840
to own up to that question?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.710
They were anonymous.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.950
All right.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.450
All right.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.340
So today's study questions.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.310
What's the role of
money historically

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:02.400
and in today's digital economy?

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.670
And this is when I'm going
to look for discussion.

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:06.170
So does anybody
want to tell me what

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:11.330
the role of money-- what
would be your answer to this?

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.235
Anton?

00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:20.100
AUDIENCE: The medium of the
transaction, and the unit of--

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:22.180
like a counting unit.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.660
And also, the
state of the value.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.450
PROFESSOR: So the three
classic rolls of money

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.820
that people talk about.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:33.132
Kelly, you want to
repeat what he just said?

00:08:33.132 --> 00:08:34.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the question,

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:37.179
but I think historically,
it was pay off

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:41.919
debts, starting and conquering
various lands and wards,

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:45.230
and then also funding
trade wars, cutting taxes.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:51.215
So a lot of societal things
that drove civilization forward.

00:08:51.215 --> 00:08:52.840
PROFESSOR: And what
we'll discuss today

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.990
and what it is, is that
money is a social construct.

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:58.840
It's something that
societies came together--

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.930
it's hard to tell whether it
was 5,000 years ago or 8,000

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.780
or 10,000 years ago.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:09.760
Really, it's a social
consensus mechanism.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.670
But we're going to chat about
the readings in a minute

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:15.490
and come back to that question.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.523
What is fiat currency?

00:09:16.523 --> 00:09:17.440
Does anybody want to--

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.430
Tom, you want to tell us
what fiat currency is?

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:22.490
It's a shame, Tom.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:24.440
See, I recognize you.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:27.730 --> 00:09:30.580
This is like a
established currency

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.140
by a central government, by
a government that proposed

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.932
a market or [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:35.932 --> 00:09:36.640
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.330
So you said it's a
central currency,

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.170
and it's by government.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.780
Anybody else want
to add some things?

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.190
Is it Kyle?

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:47.230
AUDIENCE: I would just
add that it's not backed

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.452
by any physical commodity.

00:09:48.452 --> 00:09:50.785
PROFESSOR: So it's not backed
by any physical commodity.

00:09:50.785 --> 00:09:51.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:54.460
Really just the good faith
and credit of the nation

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.050
that issues it.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.050
PROFESSOR: Daniel, did
you want to add anything?

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.842
AUDIENCE: I was just
going to say somewhere

00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:02.420
that it's not gold backed
or anything like that.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.533
PROFESSOR: But was
it always that way?

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:06.200
AUDIENCE: It wasn't
originally that way.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.908
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:10:06.908 --> 00:10:10.520
A fiat currency might be
backed by something physical.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.160
Was there other--
remind me your name.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:13.660
I'm sorry.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.710
AUDIENCE: Josh.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.920
PROFESSOR: Josh.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.100
AUDIENCE: Specifically
used to settle

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.027
debts, specifically those
to the government, so taxes.

00:10:22.027 --> 00:10:24.110
PROFESSOR: All right, so
it can be used for taxes.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.402
And remind me of your name,
because I can't see a card.

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:26.902
What?

00:10:26.902 --> 00:10:27.540
AUDIENCE: Sean.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:28.420
PROFESSOR: Sean.

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.010
AUDIENCE: So, basically,
there's no inherent value

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.270
in fiat currency.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:36.790
So basically, there's
no one recognize

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:39.293
that specific currency itself.

00:10:39.293 --> 00:10:40.210
There's no government.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:42.700
PROFESSOR: So here's a
question for the class.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:46.790
Is there inherent value
to non-fiat currencies?

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.080
Because Sean's saying that maybe
a distinguishing characteristic

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.330
of fiat is it has
no inherent value.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.063
AUDIENCE: Terry.

00:10:54.063 --> 00:10:54.850
PROFESSOR: Terry.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.320
AUDIENCE: Well,
actually, the same

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.600
applies to any commodity
that's used to--

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:03.520
currency in general.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:07.720
Because it's just the scarcity
of some specific resource

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:13.390
and social common
agreement that that's

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.820
going to be the parameter.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:22.150
PROFESSOR: So how many people
are more in line with Eric or--

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.040
there's not one
right answer to this.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.930
This is a question
that's been debated

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.890
for decades or centuries.

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.202
How many are more
in Sean's camp?

00:11:32.202 --> 00:11:33.410
AUDIENCE: I think it depends.

00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:36.660
For example, gold is
definitely a social construct.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.770
We decide that, as
a human society,

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.560
that gold is going to
be something valuable.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.650
But if it's, like, grains
that humans can [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:47.170
and that, I think,
has an inherent value.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:50.390
So I think there are
non-fiat currencies that

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.150
does have inherent
values and that

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:54.235
does not have inherent values.

00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:56.110
PROFESSOR: All right,
anybody-- what's your--

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.030
Jihi, yeah.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:11:58.570
Tom?

00:11:58.570 --> 00:11:59.160
Tomas?

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.110
AUDIENCE: Tomas.

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:02.860
I just want to say
that the [INAUDIBLE] is

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:07.180
another component which the
fact that it is a legal tender.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.630
So the government
and some [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:16.460
forced the society to use the
currency, which makes more

00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.345
comfortable for people to use.

00:12:18.345 --> 00:12:21.490
PROFESSOR: So Tomas is
saying that fiat currency is

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:22.570
legal tender.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.060
So first, we have to discuss,
what is legal tender?

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:27.550
Does anybody want to
knock that one out

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:31.700
of the ballpark who hasn't
raised their hand yet?

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.110
No?

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.310
All right.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:38.165
AUDIENCE: I think that's
maybe my earlier comment.

00:12:38.165 --> 00:12:43.180
It can be used to settle
debts, and specifically

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:44.180
those to the government.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.880
So you can use gold as a money.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:48.080
It can be a stored value.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:50.160
It can be a means of exchange.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.490
But you can't pay your
taxes in gold, right?

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:53.140
You have to--

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.350
PROFESSOR: Is that correct?

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.230
So 19th century, could you pay
your taxes in gold in the US

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:01.460
and in Britain and
other countries that

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:02.630
had gold currency?

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.710
This is just a yes
or no, but James?

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:12.105
AUDIENCE: It's yes, but after
1970s, the paper currency

00:13:12.105 --> 00:13:13.480
is attached to
the gold standard.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.960
So inherently, there
is an exchange of value

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:19.380
that is picked by the
government or the central bank.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.890
So it's almost one of the
same thing at that time,

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:24.540
until more recent years.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.650
PROFESSOR: James is saying you
could use gold as legal tender.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:30.300
Legal tender,
again, is something

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.770
that a society comes
together and creates a law--

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.840
back to the Lessig four.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.150
Society together
says-- it's not just

00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:41.800
a social normative behavior.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.110
It's a law.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:46.550
One must accept this.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:49.110
And the US and the
UK and many countries

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:52.370
it says for all debts,
public and private.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:59.400
So a debt to the government
or a debt in a store.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.650
We're going to get
to, later, as to when

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.040
is it true that somebody
has to take your cash.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.610
But I'm going to hold
off on that in a minute

00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:10.090
and talk about it.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.435
But I think, also, Jihei said--

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:17.430
it was somewhere between Sean
and Eric, both physically

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:19.980
in the class and in terms
of her articulation--

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.580
that fiat currency
might not have anything

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.190
inherently behind it.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:30.750
But gold mostly doesn't have
anything inherently behind it.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:35.970
And then some forms of
currency, like grain, had more.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.460
So maybe it's a continuum.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:42.872
Maybe it's not black
and white, 100% or 0%.

00:14:42.872 --> 00:14:44.580
And then we're going
to talk a little bit

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.010
about how Bitcoin fits into it.

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.180
And our next three
classes are going

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:51.660
to be really into the
technology of Bitcoin,

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.020
but just a little bit
of teasing out before I

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:56.340
go through some lecture slides.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.740
Who wants to talk
about how Bitcoin might

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.960
fit into this history of money?

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.260
And then I'm going to return
to that question in about

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.170
45 minutes and ask you again.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:09.090
Does anybody want to
say from the readings?

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:10.632
And you remind me your name?

00:15:10.632 --> 00:15:11.340
AUDIENCE: Isabel.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.095
PROFESSOR: Isabel.

00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:13.025
AUDIENCE: So with
Bitcoin, it's kind

00:15:13.025 --> 00:15:15.090
of the same, where
the value is given

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:17.470
by society, except
with Bitcoin, it's

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:19.200
not backed by a central bank.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.412
So people don't think that
there is an inherent value.

00:15:22.412 --> 00:15:24.120
But the readings
pointed out that there's

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.643
sort of that same history,
except it doesn't have

00:15:26.643 --> 00:15:27.330
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.340
PROFESSOR: So Isabel
is saying that Bitcoin

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.600
fits into the history of money
because, like fiat currencies

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.900
and like Jihei said about
gold, it doesn't necessarily

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:40.500
have any inherent
monetary value,

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.310
but it's a societal set of norms
that people are accepting it

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.720
as having value.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.060
But the key distinction
that Isabel said

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.380
was that it's no central.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.630
AUDIENCE: It's not backed
by any kind of central bank.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.463
PROFESSOR: It's not
backed by a central bank

00:15:53.463 --> 00:15:54.880
or a central authority.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:55.740
Alan?

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:56.850
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:59.430
So Bitcoin, in my
opinion, is unique,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.960
because I think the value of
Bitcoin changes over time, not

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.350
the fluctuation that we
see like $6,000 or $90,000,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:12.360
but in terms of the
utility of the coin itself.

00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:16.290
So today, for example, we might
be able to buy pizza or coffee

00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:19.970
or whatever with Bitcoin, so
there is an inherent value

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:21.780
in terms of medium of exchange.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.000
And it will change as society
adopts it more and more.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.250
So I think it's hard to define
if there is inherent value

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.160
or not.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.360
PROFESSOR: So Alan is
raising that Bitcoin--

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.520
if I can put some
words in your mouth,

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.130
and tell me if I'm
correct, that Bitcoin

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.930
might have some
distinguishing features

00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:43.830
from even fiat currency,
that its value is shifting

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:46.208
over time with adoption.

00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:48.000
Is that-- I mean, you
didn't use that word.

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:53.795
Please let me know
your name again.

00:16:53.795 --> 00:16:54.862
AUDIENCE: Brotish.

00:16:54.862 --> 00:16:55.570
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.730
Like British, but with an
O, you told me earlier--

00:16:57.730 --> 00:16:58.230
Brotish.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:04.420
AUDIENCE: Another way I
was thinking of [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.520
the evolution of the later
technology like accounting

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.339
and the evolution of
money, along with--

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:14.200
so initially, we
saw in the reading

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.630
how it happened in the
prehistoric age and then

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:19.359
the advent of the [INAUDIBLE]
and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.690
later, which is kind of one
of the fundamental blocks

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:23.900
of Bitcoin.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.838
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:17:24.838 --> 00:17:26.380
AUDIENCE: So that
is another way kind

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.038
of natural progression
of how money [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:31.830
PROFESSOR: Brotish?

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:32.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.042
PROFESSOR: So what
Brotish has raised

00:17:34.042 --> 00:17:36.820
is also Bitcoin fits into
the history of ledgers,

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.480
whether it's double entry
ledgers as recognized through T

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.880
accounts or other
forms of ledgers,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:47.530
that it adds to this whole
long history of ledgers.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:50.440
I agree with that.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.690
And it's a new form
of keeping ledgers.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:53.670
Alan?

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.100
AUDIENCE: So Bitcoin is
also similar to gold.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.022
There is an element of scarcity.

00:17:59.022 --> 00:17:59.980
PROFESSOR: Of scarcity.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:00.810
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:18:00.810 --> 00:18:02.748
So you cannot generate
that many Bitcoin.

00:18:02.748 --> 00:18:03.540
PROFESSOR: Correct.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:06.082
AUDIENCE: You can only generate
50 bitcoins every 10 minutes,

00:18:06.082 --> 00:18:09.460
and it keeps happening
every four years.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.120
PROFESSOR: So it seems
like scarcity and ledgers

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.410
are important components.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:14.917
Aviva?

00:18:14.917 --> 00:18:15.500
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.652
So it does have a fixed demand--

00:18:17.652 --> 00:18:20.110
sorry, a fixed supply, like
you said, in terms of scarcity.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.910
But the more we
adopt it, the more

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.740
it becomes divisible
in terms of units.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:30.400
And so we can increase its use,
because now you can divide them

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.270
up to [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:32.270
PROFESSOR: This is good.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:35.890
So divisibility is another
characteristic of money,

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:41.100
scarcity, adoption as
Alan said, ledgers.

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:42.110
Sorry, Tomas?

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.780
AUDIENCE: We mention
decentralization,

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:50.350
because this implementation
make feasible the Bitcoin

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.570
and makes feasible to
implement this kind of thing

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.680
in the decentralized
environment.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.750
So without any central
authority to design or dictate

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:04.825
the supply and all the
aspects of the concepts.

00:19:04.825 --> 00:19:06.700
PROFESSOR: We'll take
one more, and then I'll

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:08.033
start to talk about the history.

00:19:08.033 --> 00:19:09.590
Why don't we go here?

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.632
And remind me your name.

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:11.340
AUDIENCE: Alexis.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.090
PROFESSOR: Alexis.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:14.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
of like money

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.290
and other forms
of currency, even

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:21.400
if it's controlled by central
government or central bank,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.750
there's no fixed exchange rate.

00:19:24.750 --> 00:19:27.820
It trades extremely quickly
with other types of currency,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.250
so I mean, it's
still very different.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.640
PROFESSOR: So, Alexis, if
I understand Alexis' point,

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:38.290
it's that there's no fixed
exchange rate about Bitcoin

00:19:38.290 --> 00:19:40.330
we're talking about.

00:19:40.330 --> 00:19:45.450
But couldn't we really broaden
that to all forms of currency?

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:47.820
I mean, what really
is the exchange

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:54.115
rate between an ounce of
gold and a bushel of corn?

00:19:54.115 --> 00:19:54.990
AUDIENCE: Yes and no.

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.430
I mean, yes, that, for example,
some states do control exchange

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.035
rates with other counties.

00:20:01.035 --> 00:20:02.410
PROFESSOR: All
right, good point.

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:05.820
So Alexis is saying yes and
no, because some governments

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.710
try to fix.

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:08.910
Now back to markets.

00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.830
How well does that
work when governments

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:14.640
try to fix an exchange rate?

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.080
I mean, just as a sense of the
class, does that work well?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.710
So it sort of might work well
in temporal, short periods.

00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:26.965
Works less well
for decades on end.

00:20:26.965 --> 00:20:28.590
I'll take one more,
and then I'm just--

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:29.550
I want to go through a couple--

00:20:29.550 --> 00:20:30.675
AUDIENCE: Just one comment.

00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:32.363
That way you can
teach hours of work.

00:20:32.363 --> 00:20:36.900
That's how economies define
it previously, right?

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.673
But I just want to
ask, what is a ledger?

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:42.840
PROFESSOR: What is a ledger?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.530
Very good question.

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.530
I'm going to be chatting
about that in a minute.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:53.180
But does anybody
want to hit that?

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:53.970
I'm sorry.

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.375
No, over here.

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:57.000
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, it's just

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.080
a numerical record of everything
recorded, in a fashion.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:01.580
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:03.080
PROFESSOR: A numerical record.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.310
I think that's a good thing.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:11.660
A ledger is basically a way
to record economic activity

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:16.280
or social relationships or
financial relationships.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.990
I would say it's both a way
to record economic activity,

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:25.760
and it's a system of recording
financial relationships.

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.930
And while I didn't
assign these readings,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.670
some very good academic
research suggests

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:38.510
that the first methods of
writing and symbols of writing

00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:41.210
had to do with numbers and
had to do with ledgers, rather

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:46.400
than words and communication.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.920
Because it's so
fundamental to society

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.660
to record various
economic transactions

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:57.110
or to record the
financial relationships

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.060
amongst and between
members of a community,

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.300
whether it was a
small village or when

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.585
society burst out of villages
thousands of years ago.

00:22:05.585 --> 00:22:07.560
Does that help?

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:10.300
We'll be back to it.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.750
And better that
you ask that here

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.632
than in your accounting
fundamentals class.

00:22:15.632 --> 00:22:16.950
I don't know.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:20.420
So the readings-- we've sort
of talked about the readings.

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:25.220
How many of you actually watched
the little three-minute video?

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.340
What'd you think?

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.600
I mean, just as a--

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.160
I'm sorry, here.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.800
We haven't chatted yet.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.820
AUDIENCE: I think the
broad-based message was

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:35.400
that any currency, or
anything, for that matter,

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.805
has value equivalent to what
the society assigns it with.

00:22:38.805 --> 00:22:40.430
Because the video
basically just showed

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:42.480
a guy who created his
own currency and was just

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.680
selling it to the public.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.130
And his whole claim
was that it is real

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.640
if you believe it is real.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.280
PROFESSOR: So it was just a
nice little ditty, in a way.

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:51.325
Matthew, I'm sorry?

00:22:51.325 --> 00:22:52.830
AUDIENCE: I would have
given him $1 for it.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.120
PROFESSOR: You would
have given him $1?

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:54.800
Great.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.757
AUDIENCE: Seeing how
much the pizzas went for.

00:22:57.757 --> 00:22:58.590
AUDIENCE: Who knows?

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:01.710
PROFESSOR: Would anybody else
have given him $1 for it?

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:02.330
No?

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:05.100
Oh, you would have?

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.270
AUDIENCE: Actually, I'm
working with local currencies.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:14.200
And it's kind of the same, but
you can use them just locally.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.560
I mean, it keeps the
money inside the community

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.347
that decides to use that
way of transactions.

00:23:20.347 --> 00:23:22.930
PROFESSOR: We're going to refer
back to each of these readings

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:25.000
as we go through
the next 45 minutes.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.500
Yeah?

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.333
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if he was actually

00:23:27.333 --> 00:23:29.335
breaking the law by
launching his own competing

00:23:29.335 --> 00:23:30.670
currency to the US dollar?

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.580
Is that a legitimate--

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.860
obviously, it didn't compete
with the US dollar, but--

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:36.610
PROFESSOR: You raise
a very good question.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:43.860
I'm not aware of any
statute, federal or state,

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.980
that says there's an absolute
monopoly on forms of currency

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.930
as there is in other
things, like you

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:55.890
know that slot in the
door that's called the--

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.460
where you can put a letter
through the door or a mailbox?

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.400
There's actually a law that says
that the US Postal Service has

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.910
a monopoly, and
that's why UPS is not

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:10.170
allowed to put their boxes
or anything in there.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:14.430
There's a government
fiat monopoly.

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.500
But you raise a
very good question.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.970
What we've found in the
last 10 years with Bitcoin,

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.600
with really
oversimplifying, is that it

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.970
is legal to create
your own form of money,

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:34.140
as Bitcoin is
possibly this money.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.453
But you have to comply
with all the other laws.

00:24:36.453 --> 00:24:38.370
And all those other laws
that we'll talk about

00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:40.680
in other lectures,
in essence, fall

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.200
into buckets of guarding
against illicit activity,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.900
so the Bank Secrecy
Act and all the laws

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.930
related to anti-money
laundering and terrorism finance

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.280
and so forth.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.240
One still has to pay your taxes
if you're gaining or losing

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.050
on this investment.

00:24:58.050 --> 00:25:01.020
The Federal Reserve and other
authorities around the globe

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:04.110
still want to insure
for financial stability.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.955
The fellow on the streets of--

00:25:05.955 --> 00:25:07.080
I don't remember what city.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:07.770
New York?

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:11.130
Selling his dollars, when
Matthew bought it for $1

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:13.840
and I think over here--

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:14.340
Brianna?

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:15.215 --> 00:25:16.230
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:17.100
AUDIENCE: My name?

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:17.725
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:17.725 --> 00:25:18.780
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.210
PROFESSOR: Bought it.

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.610
The society's still
going to be stable.

00:25:23.610 --> 00:25:26.100
It's going to be all right.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:28.350
But if millions of
people were buying it,

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:29.610
then people might worry.

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:31.440
And then there's
the third big bucket

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.560
that we look at is investor
and consumer protection.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.140
But I think it's allowed.

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.043
So we'll refer to
these, Joaquin,

00:25:39.043 --> 00:25:40.210
and then I'm going to go on.

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:42.002
AUDIENCE: Can you
legally pay, for example,

00:25:42.002 --> 00:25:45.710
salaries in bitcoin in the US?

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.970
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.890
And why is it that
you can legally pay

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:54.380
for wages in bitcoin in the US?

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.880
I know it's outside
of the readings,

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.960
but why do you think it is
allowed in this society?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:04.190
Is it Kyle?

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.010
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
those compensation forms

00:26:06.010 --> 00:26:07.775
be allowed under any contract?

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.230
PROFESSOR: Most things--
you could pay somebody

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.970
in these placards.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.000
I doubt, really, that you're
going to value them much.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.100
But you could pay
somebody in this.

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:24.840
You could pay somebody
in gold, euros, bitcoin.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.800
And there are firms
that are paying--

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.770
usually, they're developing
blockchain applications.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:37.540
And interestingly, they have to
compute the value of the wages

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:40.810
to do withholding taxes, because
the US government will not

00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:43.820
accept taxes in bitcoin.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.420
So they figure out the
fair market value--

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.810
and there are companies
in the US that pay people

00:26:49.810 --> 00:26:52.420
in bitcoin who are
doing development work

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.220
around blockchain applications.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:58.300
But the taxes need to be
computed and analyzed and then

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.940
paid in US dollars.

00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:04.000
There was a legislative
initiative in Arizona

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.130
earlier this year where
a state legislature

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:09.370
wanted to have Arizona be
the first state in the land

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.980
to accept bitcoin for taxes.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.750
But it failed in committee.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.230
It didn't even get
a full vote of--

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.340
I can't remember if it was the
Arizona Senate or the Arizona

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.880
House of Delegates.

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.040
So just a little walk
through the history.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.832
I was going to do a
little history of money

00:27:27.832 --> 00:27:30.130
and have some fun.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.300
So in Ethiopia, people
put together salt bars.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:36.210
This is not that long ago.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.540
Salt, as Jihei said earlier,
is really valuable in society,

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.880
and they standardize
the shape and size.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:46.390
And so here's salt bars.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:48.520
We're going to get to,
a little bit later,

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.590
all the characteristics
of money.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.410
But what else do you think
a salt bar in Ethiopia,

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:56.230
as opposed to maybe
some other country--

00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:01.320
what did it have, as well, as
to why people might use that?

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.015
AUDIENCE: Oil.

00:28:02.015 --> 00:28:02.973
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:28:02.973 --> 00:28:03.806
AUDIENCE: Crude oil.

00:28:03.806 --> 00:28:05.140
PROFESSOR: Crude oil.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.737
All right, I hadn't
thought of that.

00:28:06.737 --> 00:28:08.320
I'm going to keep
thinking about that.

00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:10.640
It's not a common
characteristic of money.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.900
But why salt bars?

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:14.560
What else might it
have in Ethiopia?

00:28:16.515 --> 00:28:18.140
AUDIENCE: Are you
going to say that you

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.005
can use salt to preserver food?

00:28:20.005 --> 00:28:21.630
PROFESSOR: Well, you
can preserve food,

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:27.060
but because it was mined, there
was some scarcity, as well.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:30.260
And a lot of currencies,
a lot of moneys over time,

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:32.700
have that fundamental issue.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.750
Cowrie shells from West Africa.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.250
Does anyone know
the history of when

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.400
cowrie shells got really
debased and stopped

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.650
being used, from the readings?

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.290
I can't remember if that
was in the readings or not.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.000
They got debased when
Europeans started

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.360
to realize that they
were accepted as a value.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.970
And it's a very sad and
terrible history, too,

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.640
because it's related to
the whole slave trade.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.760
But that the Europeans
could figure out

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.480
that societies accepted
this as something of value,

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.880
but they also
debased that currency

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:12.670
and they debased the land and
captured people as slaves.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:17.650
It was quite a collection of
not particularly good things

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.120
going on.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.955
Tally sticks in England.

00:29:20.955 --> 00:29:22.330
Does anybody, from
the readings--

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.940
because there was a little
bit of the debate in the first

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.060
reading about the
history of money--

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:29.740
want to chat?

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.220
And I'll pull up the
Rai stones from Yap.

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:37.150
How this fits into that first
reading and the debate between

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:40.270
did money come from
a history of barter,

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:45.410
or did money come from a
history of ledgers and credit,

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:50.110
which is kind of a setup
of that first reading?

00:29:52.628 --> 00:29:53.170
Any thoughts?

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.740
Which ones of these four
bits of money, early money,

00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:00.015
are more about maybe barter?

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.660
AUDIENCE: There are
two theories, right?

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.170
Debt, which corresponds
to this one.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:13.510
This was a way to measure debt.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.390
PROFESSOR: Which one?

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:15.503
AUDIENCE: The sticks.

00:30:15.503 --> 00:30:16.420
PROFESSOR: The sticks.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.130
The tally sticks, yes, correct.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.590
Which is the second one on
here that has to do with debts,

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:22.645
actually, and credits?

00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:23.520
AUDIENCE: The stones.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.960
PROFESSOR: The stone,
the Rai stones.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.770
So it's remarkable.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:32.600
The Rai stones were so heavy
that on this island of Yap,

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.940
they couldn't possibly
lug it around and use it

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.030
in a traditional
medium of exchange.

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:42.350
But it was viewed as, well,
I have 1/6 of this Rai stone.

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.840
You have 1/16.

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.730
And then if I make an
exchange, we'd remember.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:51.230
And the society was small enough
to keep a form of ledgers, even

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:55.350
to the extent that when a Rai
stone was lost in a river,

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:57.380
they said, you know,
the river Rai stone,

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:00.280
we each have this piece.

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:03.850
So on the island of
Yap, I can assure you,

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:07.650
these stones could not be
used for anything else.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:10.590
Does anyone know, because it
was outside the readings, what

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:11.940
made these stones so scarce?

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.340
So Rai stones were quarried on
an island about 200 kilometers

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.940
away from Yap, so
were they exceedingly

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:27.970
hard to get, like gold,
like mining of gold.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.075
What else is mined these
days that might be a money?

00:31:31.075 --> 00:31:31.842
AUDIENCE: Lithium.

00:31:31.842 --> 00:31:32.800
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:34.174
Can I hear everybody?

00:31:34.174 --> 00:31:35.562
AUDIENCE: I'm saying lithium.

00:31:35.562 --> 00:31:36.520
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.570
AUDIENCE: For batteries.

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:38.170
For batteries.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.450
It's going to be very
difficult in the future

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:43.130
for electric
batteries and whatnot.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.010
PROFESSOR: But what's
mined right now that's

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:46.330
at the center of this class?

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.220
AUDIENCE: Bitcoin.

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.610
PROFESSOR: Bitcoin, right?

00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:51.970
The Yap stone was, in essence,
quarried a couple kilometers

00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:53.230
away.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.770
And what debased that currency
was when sailors from England

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:58.270
came.

00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.530
There's a specific sailor--

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.790
I think his name was O'Keefe--

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.550
in the late 19th century, and
he realized that these stones

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.180
were valuable.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:07.555
And he went to the other
island, and he started quarrying

00:32:07.555 --> 00:32:09.380
and came back and forth.

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.400
And within a few years,
the whole economic system

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.010
collapsed.

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:16.240
We moved to metal money.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.370
At first, it wasn't
really stamped.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.240
It was just heavy.

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.220
It was hard to quarry.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.310
Bronze in Rome.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:25.600
There was some China and Sweden.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.780
These were starting to be
stamped by the official sector.

00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:34.090
And then we had minted money
starting somewhere around 2,500

00:32:34.090 --> 00:32:35.020
years ago.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.520
And there's debates
as to whether it

00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.690
started in Greece or in China.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:47.470
But where an official emblem was
placed upon a scarce resource

00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:48.190
that was used.

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:55.210
Paper money came along, in
a sense, for what reason?

00:32:55.210 --> 00:33:01.990
Why did society first
tip in to paper money?

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:04.600
AUDIENCE: Because there's not
enough gold to back it up.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.510
I mean, like because there's--

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:06.385
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:33:06.385 --> 00:33:08.480
One reason is not enough gold.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.210
I'm sorry, I haven't--

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.340
AUDIENCE: I think
it's just easy to--

00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.780
PROFESSOR: Ease of use.

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:17.290
It's kind of heavy, especially
if there wasn't gold

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:19.000
and if it was copper or bronze.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.350
It was just heavy.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.590
Or if it was wheat, you'd have
to put it in a storage unit.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.610
So the first paper
monies from China

00:33:26.610 --> 00:33:29.140
were basically
warehouse receipts.

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.300
And I spent five years
running something

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:33.850
called a Commodity Futures
Trading Commission,

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.310
and so I guess I learned a
lot about warehouse receipts,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:40.575
commodity receipts, where you
put a commodity in a warehouse.

00:33:40.575 --> 00:33:41.950
And then you got
a piece of paper

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:44.440
that said, yes, you have
that commodity there.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.480
So the first paper
monies were basically

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.290
warehouse receipts in China.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:54.460
Because whatever it
was-- grain or gold.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.830
And then you had a piece
of paper backing it.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:58.570
These are five pound
notes from England

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.160
and the continental
notes of the US.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:04.210
But that note in China
is about 700 years old.

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:10.290
But between that first paper
money and the 18th century,

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:13.530
who do you think we're
kind of the first bankers

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:18.040
in the late 17th century,
early 18th century?

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:22.409
What craft had they been in
before they were in banking?

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:23.159
AUDIENCE: Trading.

00:34:23.159 --> 00:34:23.790
AUDIENCE: Trading.

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:24.610
AUDIENCE: Trading.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:25.427
PROFESSOR: Alpha?

00:34:25.427 --> 00:34:26.760
AUDIENCE: International trading.

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.810
PROFESSOR: International trade.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:29.435
They actually did
something more local.

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:36.560
AUDIENCE: I just
talked about this.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.220
The ones that have
lands and all the--

00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:43.199
the ones that have lands
and all the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:44.600
PROFESSOR: Lanes?

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.320
AUDIENCE: Lands.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:45.560
AUDIENCE: Land.

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.227
PROFESSOR: Land.

00:34:46.227 --> 00:34:47.000
Land.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.780
No, they had something
else that they were doing.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.606
Tom?

00:34:50.606 --> 00:34:51.540
AUDIENCE: Printmakers.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:52.915
PROFESSOR: They
were printmakers.

00:34:52.915 --> 00:34:53.659
I like that.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:55.659
We're not there yet.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:56.710
AUDIENCE: Money lenders?

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:57.668
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:34:57.668 --> 00:34:59.870
AUDIENCE: They're
underwriting insurance.

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:02.937
PROFESSOR: A little bit later.

00:35:02.937 --> 00:35:04.520
AUDIENCE: They were
doing agriculture?

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.630
PROFESSOR: It's definitely
outside of the reading.

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.650
They were goldsmiths.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:16.110
Some of the first dominant
bankers in London,

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:17.960
they were small goldsmiths.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.850
And they took the gold, they
gave you a piece of paper,

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.560
and then they went from there.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.410
And then, all of a sudden, they
figured out how to do credit.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:26.827
Later in the
semester, we're going

00:35:26.827 --> 00:35:28.950
to talk about Bitcoin credit.

00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:31.110
It's not there yet, by the way.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.330
I think in the next
18 to 36 months,

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.640
we're going to start seeing
cryptolending and cryptofinance

00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.340
in the form similar to what
the goldsmiths were doing

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.706
in the early 1700s in England.

00:35:44.706 --> 00:35:45.522
Alan?

00:35:45.522 --> 00:35:49.743
AUDIENCE: Is that scalable with
a finite number of bitcoins,

00:35:49.743 --> 00:35:50.410
in your opinion?

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:51.952
PROFESSOR: It's a
very good question.

00:35:51.952 --> 00:35:55.125
Is it scalable to lend
against a finite currency?

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:05.080
I think so, but it's
not done yet, right?

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:10.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because when
you lend money to someone,

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:12.580
I guess it could be in
the form of bitcoin.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:16.190
But you lend someone dollars,
they could redeem in bitcoin.

00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:18.810
You'd be increasing kind
of the money supply.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:20.178
So you don't need--

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.470
you're not moving money around.

00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:22.100
You're actually [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:23.810
PROFESSOR: So this is
exactly the central

00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:25.100
of commercial banking today.

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.480
It's called fractional banking.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.022
We'll be talking
about that in a bit.

00:36:28.022 --> 00:36:35.750
But yes, you could lend and
then have a multiplier effect.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.140
You also had, then,
banks come up and started

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:39.610
to issue private bank notes.

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:43.630
Private bank notes effectively
a liability of that bank

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.860
and saying it would trade.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.830
And the history of private
bank notes is usually what?

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:54.200
Good until it's really bad.

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.160
And the history of money,
a lot of private banks

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.720
went bust in this country
around the revolutionary period,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.110
again around the Civil War.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:08.120
And in essence, that's
what we have now

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.540
with 1,600 different
cryptocurrencies.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.970
We have sort of a new
period of a little bit

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:17.240
of private currencies.

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.600
And I only ask you to
remember that as we

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.170
start to look at ICOs, Initial
Coin Offerings, and so forth.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:29.305
So ledgers-- the earlier
question is, what was a ledger?

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:33.670
You asked it.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:36.080
Can you remember,
what's a ledger?

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:39.554
AUDIENCE: It's a way to
record economic transaction.

00:37:39.554 --> 00:37:40.910
PROFESSOR: There you go.

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:44.250
Principal recordings
of accounts.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.930
And 5,000 years ago--

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:51.320
you had a little reading on
this, just a medium post.

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:54.620
It wasn't meant to be a deep
economic, academic paper.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:38:01.100
But it was to try to get the
class thinking about ledgers.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:04.200
This is the personal ledger
of George Washington,

00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.360
our first president.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.620
He was 15 years old when
he kept this ledger.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.560
And he apparently kept
ledgers until his death in--

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.810
let's see.

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.020
52 years later.

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:22.220
So ledgers could be
kept just to record

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.010
the transactions of the day.

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:26.210
He's got one up there--

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:26.967
Mary Washington.

00:38:26.967 --> 00:38:28.550
It must have been a
cousin, or I can't

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:31.700
remember if it was his mother.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.822
So if they're the principal
recordings of accounts--

00:38:34.822 --> 00:38:36.530
and I've already sort
of said this-- they

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:41.780
record economic activity
and financial relationships.

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:45.710
Economic activity in a
sense of transactions.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:50.770
Financial relationships-- what's
a key financial relationship

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:53.490
a ledger might record?

00:38:53.490 --> 00:38:53.990
I'm sorry?

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.950
AUDIENCE: Debt.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.060
PROFESSOR: Kelly said it-- debt.

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.550
And it goes back to the
debate you had in the reading.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:01.887
Is money a history of barter--

00:39:01.887 --> 00:39:02.970
did it come out of barter?

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.640
Did it come out of
a sense of debts

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.370
and credit and store of value?

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:11.000
For this purpose today,
it doesn't really matter.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.870
It may have come from both.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.670
But know that it has both sides.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.360
And ledgers have
both sides, too.

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:19.680
And when we're talking about
Bitcoin, Bitcoin, you will see,

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.330
is a mechanism to
store transactions.

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:29.580
Some other blockchains, like
Ethereum, stores balances.

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.410
So even in the
blockchain world, you

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:35.100
will see some that are
balance ledgers and some

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.960
which are transaction
ledgers, not

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.370
to lose you and confuse you.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:45.820
It's an important part
of what is blockchain.

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:47.350
Some types of ledgers.

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:52.100
I just mentioned one--
transactions versus balance.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.680
George Washington's
ledger, by the way,

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.390
I think was a
transaction ledger.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:01.130
He was just keeping a list
of sales and movements.

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:04.700
But I haven't studied President
George Washington's ledger

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.480
close enough.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.637
Does anybody know
enough accounting

00:40:08.637 --> 00:40:10.720
to tell me the difference
between a general ledger

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:15.180
and a subledger or a general
ledger and a supporting ledger?

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.660
I mean, I don't want to do
the whole lecture myself.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:22.950
How many of you have
taken accounting?

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:24.090
Uh-huh.

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.150
I taught undergraduate
accounting once.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:28.660
Sorry.

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:32.560
So those of you who just put up
your hand who took accounting--

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.160
did I see, in the back of the
room, did you take accounting?

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.377
And that's Aviva.

00:40:36.377 --> 00:40:37.960
AUDIENCE: I'm an
accountant, actually.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:39.590
PROFESSOR: You're an accountant?

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.480
All right, all right.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.790
Did you pass the CPA?

00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:45.580
Oh, we have a Certified
Public Accountant

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.550
who's going to tell
us the difference

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:48.260
between a general
ledger and a subledger.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.880
AUDIENCE: So a
general ledger is one

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.700
that records all
kinds of transactions.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:55.220
Any kind of activity
that takes place, you

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:56.630
record in the general ledger.

00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:59.910
And subledgers, you can call
them as like a specialization.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.090
So let's say if there's
a salary to be paid,

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.290
you have your salary subledger.

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.040
But it'll also go in
the general ledger,

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:08.770
and the other part
of the transaction's

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:09.830
in the salary ledger.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:16.820
Or if there's capital or if
there's new stuff that you buy,

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.160
so all of that goes specifically
in the general ledger.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.368
And each of them have
their own specific ledgers.

00:41:21.368 --> 00:41:22.910
If you want to say
how much you spent

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:27.150
on Saturdays for the month, then
you go to your Saturday ledger

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.650
and see.

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:29.750
But if you want to see, overall,
how much money you've spend

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:31.375
and how much has
moved around, then you

00:41:31.375 --> 00:41:33.220
look at your general ledger.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:36.260
PROFESSOR: Aviva clearly said
it better than I could have.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.850
Thank you.

00:41:37.850 --> 00:41:41.490
Now we know we have
one CPA in the class.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:44.900
But the importance-- it's
not just a passing note.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.470
The importance of a general
ledger and subledgers

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:50.840
is there is a
hierarchy, as well.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:54.260
Subledgers have more detail,
and maybe the net number

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.080
is kept in the general ledger.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.770
That is at the heart of
our system of banking

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:05.310
and is at the heart of our
system of financial markets,

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:09.360
where the central bank is like
a general ledger for money,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.490
and every commercial bank, all
9,000 of them or so in the US,

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.530
in essence keep a
subledger for money.

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:19.800
But they do not
have control of what

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.680
I will call the master ledger
or general ledger at the Federal

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.180
Reserve.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.330
Then, a third distinction
about ledger is a single entry.

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:34.730
A little, young, 15-year-old
George Washington

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.610
was keeping a single
entry ledger--

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.610
just a list of things
that was going on.

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.613
And I didn't think I was going
to bore the class with readings

00:42:43.613 --> 00:42:45.530
about double-entry
bookkeeping, because you've

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.255
taken accounting.

00:42:46.255 --> 00:42:48.380
But does anybody want to
tell me, other than Aviva,

00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:52.200
what double-entry bookkeeping--
and she'll bail you out.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:53.640
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.920
AUDIENCE: Double-entry
bookkeeping basically means any

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.130
transaction has two
places in the lender--

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:00.530
one on the credit side
and one on the debt side.

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.370
Because every
transaction involves

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.820
one person lending,
whereas the other person

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:08.545
is getting the thing.

00:43:08.545 --> 00:43:09.670
PROFESSOR: It works for me.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.340
Anybody else want
a different view?

00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:16.050
AUDIENCE: In other
words, [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:20.970
asset and liability [INAUDIBLE]
two sites and then [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:23.310
to balance each
other [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:25.500
PROFESSOR: So there's a
balancing between assets

00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:28.020
and liabilities, and
then the resulting bit

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.740
of capitalism in it is if assets
are more than liabilities,

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.960
the rest is capital.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.360
So at the heart of
capitalism, in a sense,

00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.190
is double-entry bookkeeping.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:41.700
And in fact, while it
probably goes back a little

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.580
over 1,000 years, when
it was truly written up

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.900
by the Italians in
the 1300s, it started

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.720
to help Europe come
out of the Dark Ages.

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:55.770
I mean, the commercial
Renaissance of the Middle Ages,

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.420
some would say, was in part--

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.180
not entirely, but in part--

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.540
on the backs of
double-entry bookkeeping.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:04.255
So ledgers matter is my point.

00:44:04.255 --> 00:44:06.630
They're not going to be the
heart and soul of this class,

00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:10.320
but Bitcoin, which is a
transaction ledger, Ethereum,

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:14.980
which is a balance ledger,
our financial system, which

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.713
is all set up on ledgers is
a relevant sort of subtext.

00:44:19.713 --> 00:44:21.130
You don't have to
be afraid of it,

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:24.150
just as you don't have to
be afraid of hashing power

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:27.410
that we'll be talking about
on Thursday and cryptography.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:30.520
You have to have some sort
of basic sense of where

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.980
does Bitcoin fit in,
in terms of ledgers.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.720
I didn't feel this slide in.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.100
You'll find out it's blank.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:40.475
Does anybody want
to tell me what

00:44:40.475 --> 00:44:42.850
are some characteristics
of a good ledger?

00:44:42.850 --> 00:44:45.430
Because again, as you start
to think about your blockchain

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.020
projects later in
the semester, it's

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:49.600
like, what makes a good ledger?

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.100
I don't have any answers here.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:55.260
AUDIENCE: The bitcoin
were immutable.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:57.940
PROFESSOR: So you want it
to be immutable, maybe.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.310
Thalita can you do me
a favor and keep these?

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.000
We'll put them on the slides.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.120
We'll keep the class's list, and
we'll put them in the slides.

00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.430
Immutable, I like that.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.160
Anybody else want
to grab something

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.672
which is a good ledger?

00:45:10.672 --> 00:45:11.630
AUDIENCE: Time stamped.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:12.970
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:45:12.970 --> 00:45:14.942
Time stamped, all
right, so that you

00:45:14.942 --> 00:45:17.540
know when you made your entry.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:18.570
Kelly?

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:19.660
AUDIENCE: Ownership.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:19.960
PROFESSOR: Ownership.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.490
What do you mean by ownership?

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:25.850
AUDIENCE: Essentially, the
receiver and the person giving.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.505
So essentially, who's taking
what and who's giving what.

00:45:28.505 --> 00:45:30.130
PROFESSOR: So if
there's a transaction,

00:45:30.130 --> 00:45:33.760
the two counterparties to
the transaction, right?

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.390
And if it's a balance,
then who owns the balance?

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:39.820
I was just adding a little bit.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:41.690
Let's see if we have
a new name or face.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.020
Back here, on the back table.

00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:45.615
I haven't chatted with you yet.

00:45:45.615 --> 00:45:46.240
AUDIENCE: Ross.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:47.070
PROFESSOR: What is that?

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:47.703
AUDIENCE: Ross.

00:45:47.703 --> 00:45:48.370
PROFESSOR: Ross.

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:49.037
Thank you, Ross.

00:45:49.037 --> 00:45:49.967
Good to meet you.

00:45:49.967 --> 00:45:51.634
AUDIENCE: Pleasure
to meet you, as well.

00:45:51.634 --> 00:45:52.217
Accuracy.

00:45:52.217 --> 00:45:53.050
PROFESSOR: Accuracy.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.170
So Ross says accuracy.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.920
And can we take one
or two more, just to--

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.237
AUDIENCE: So a description
of the transaction.

00:45:59.237 --> 00:46:01.570
PROFESSOR: Andrew says a
description of the transaction.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:04.600
And last, Mr. [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:05.600
AUDIENCE: Comprehensive.

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:06.150
PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.480
AUDIENCE: Comprehensive.

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:07.810
PROFESSOR: Comprehensive.

00:46:07.810 --> 00:46:10.330
So all good attributes of a--

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:12.130
characteristics.

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:16.620
Somebody's burning desire
that we missed one or two?

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.150
Jihei?

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.870
All right.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:19.180
AUDIENCE: I just was curious.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.163
Consistency, maybe?

00:46:20.163 --> 00:46:21.330
But I don't know if that's--

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:22.288
PROFESSOR: Consistency.

00:46:22.288 --> 00:46:25.500
Well, I think that's inside of
immutability, that, in essence,

00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:30.010
that it's valid, that
you can't change it.

00:46:30.010 --> 00:46:33.220
You can't counterfeit
it and the like.

00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.610
And what you'll find
is the characteristics

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.250
of a good ledger is
also, in some part,

00:46:38.250 --> 00:46:40.290
similar to the
characteristics of good money.

00:46:40.290 --> 00:46:43.740
They're not identical,
but they overlap a lot.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:47.400
Payment systems-- I'm just
going to say one line about it.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:50.910
It's a method, basically,
to amend and record

00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:53.490
changes in a ledger for money.

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.170
I know it's not what you usually
think about a payment system.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:47:01.580
But if you go into Starbucks
and buy a cup of coffee

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:05.570
and use your cell phone,
aren't you really just

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:08.570
amending a set of ledgers?

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:14.580
Starbucks' ledger goes up, and
yup, your ledger goes down.

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:18.090
Well, your monetary
ledger goes up.

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:23.610
Your utility, your fulfillment
from that latte might go up.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.370
I'm talking about
the financial ledger.

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.500
So I just wanted to ground--
when we talk about payment

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:33.840
systems, think about it's really
just a way to amend, usually,

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:38.580
two parties ledgers'-- one
going up, one going down.

00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:43.000
Now, in an earlier time, it was
handing somebody a bit of gold

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.060
or a bit of silver,
and it was not

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.890
recorded on central ledgers.

00:47:47.890 --> 00:47:50.280
But we already live in
an age of electronics,

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.400
so this is really what a
payment system largely is.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.570
It's not entirely.

00:47:55.570 --> 00:48:00.440
There's still some other
ways to do finance.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:04.070
So what were some early
forms of payment systems

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:08.910
that did just that, that
moved and changed ledgers?

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:11.220
They're called
negotiable orders.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:12.770
I would dare say
that most of you

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:16.730
probably have not used
negotiable orders of withdrawal

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:20.300
that much in the last
week or the last month.

00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:23.990
Has anybody here
written a personal check

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:25.220
in the last week?

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:32.690
But in an earlier era, it would
have been the whole class.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:37.250
Anybody in the class not
even have a checkbook?

00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:38.880
3/4 of the class.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.821
Larry, how's that make you feel?

00:48:40.821 --> 00:48:41.404
AUDIENCE: Old.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:48.380
PROFESSOR: But a
checkbook is, in essence,

00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:51.650
with a-- what do
you put on a check?

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:53.390
This is all about Bitcoin now.

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:56.420
I'm not doing this
just as a walk down

00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:57.965
memory lane for
Larry and myself.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:03.465
What are the important pieces
of negotiable order, withdraw,

00:49:03.465 --> 00:49:04.857
or a check?

00:49:04.857 --> 00:49:05.690
AUDIENCE: Signature.

00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.080
AUDIENCE: Put your
signature on it.

00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:08.497
PROFESSOR: So
there's a signature.

00:49:08.497 --> 00:49:10.260
What else is there?

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.440
I want to get to people
I haven't talked to.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:13.180
In the back.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:14.474
I can't remember your name.

00:49:14.474 --> 00:49:15.016
AUDIENCE: Me?

00:49:15.016 --> 00:49:15.830
I'm Dana.

00:49:15.830 --> 00:49:19.432
You put who you're paying to,
how much, and what it's for.

00:49:19.432 --> 00:49:21.140
PROFESSOR: All right,
so there's a bunch.

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:27.050
So a signature, a payee, how
much, and what it was for.

00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:28.040
What else?

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.560
AUDIENCE: There's an account
number and routing number.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:33.220
PROFESSOR: Account numbers
and routing numbers.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:33.970
So think about it.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:39.720
Account numbers and
routing numbers is to say,

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:44.400
in essence, what ledger
is this coming from?

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:48.870
And the payee is the
ledger to whom it's going.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.540
And I'm sorry, Dan?

00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:52.620
AUDIENCE: Also a
date, and a day.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.360
PROFESSOR: So there's a
timestamp, a signature,

00:49:55.360 --> 00:50:01.740
a payee, the payor in the
form of the account number,

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.550
and an amount.

00:50:02.550 --> 00:50:04.860
Those five are really
critical, and you'll

00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:07.290
find them all are going to
be right in the middle of all

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.330
this Bitcoin.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:11.070
And then the reason why you're--

00:50:11.070 --> 00:50:13.410
you know, some
other information.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.811
I'm sorry, was there
something else?

00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:16.436
AUDIENCE: Kyle.

00:50:16.436 --> 00:50:17.364
PROFESSOR: Kyle.

00:50:17.364 --> 00:50:18.739
AUDIENCE: I just
have a question.

00:50:18.739 --> 00:50:21.335
Would you consider something
like PayPal or Venmo

00:50:21.335 --> 00:50:23.782
like a negotiable order?

00:50:23.782 --> 00:50:24.740
PROFESSOR: They may be.

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:26.550
They may be new forms.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:30.800
They're certainly parts
of the payment system.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.350
They might not be negotiable
orders to withdraw.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:37.460
They might not be a
direct authorization

00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.230
for a bank with one ledger to
move money to another ledger.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:44.930
They might be moving
it on their own ledger.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.040
You're asking the
right question.

00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:52.310
So some early money that we
already talked about that

00:50:52.310 --> 00:50:54.020
was ledger where
the tally sticks

00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.610
in England and the Yap stone.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:59.200
These were ledger types
and forms of money

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.510
and was kind of interesting.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:05.420
So ledgers didn't just come
with electricity and computers.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.230
So now let's get back to
fiat currency, the heart

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.230
of the earlier question.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:13.730
We already talked
about it, so let's see

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.650
how the professor did,
because you already

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.160
said some of the things that
you said were fiat currency.

00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:24.210
One, social and
economic consensus.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:27.740
I'm in the school that it's
just part of the history.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:31.280
It's not that different
than everything that came,

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.100
even though it built on that
promissory note from China

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:39.020
700 years ago and the private
bank notes and the goldsmiths

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.730
in the 1700s.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:44.810
But ultimately,
governments took control.

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:47.360
It represents central
bank liabilities,

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:48.290
and that's important.

00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:51.890
It's a liability
of a central bank.

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:53.250
It's not an asset.

00:51:53.250 --> 00:51:56.610
It's their liability side.

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.250
But it's also-- guess what?

00:51:58.250 --> 00:52:00.870
There's a second form of money.

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:04.670
And that's when
you have a deposit

00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:09.330
in a bank, that's a liability
of a commercial bank.

00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:12.780
Central bank is the top
gold standard, in a sense.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.540
Using the word gold,
but it's the top ledger.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.360
Commercial banks are like
subledgers, in a sense.

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.200
Please, Alan?

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:20.360
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:21.735
I'm not an economist
or anything,

00:52:21.735 --> 00:52:25.140
but what does it mean
for a coin or a note

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.840
to be a liability
of the central bank?

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.710
What does that actually mean?

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:33.030
PROFESSOR: So before
I answer, does anybody

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:36.600
want to try to
answer what it is?

00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:37.100
Eric?

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:41.210
AUDIENCE: Liability is basically
an obligation to, in this case,

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:44.036
pay someone an amount.

00:52:44.036 --> 00:52:46.460
PROFESSOR: So because
it's a social consensus,

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:51.110
it's a very good question that
Alan asked, is what does it

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.930
mean to be a liability
of a central bank

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:58.490
when it's just the currency
in our pocket, right?

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.950
This Federal Reserve
note, this says

00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:02.450
Federal Reserve note on it.

00:53:07.175 --> 00:53:08.495
We can pass it around.

00:53:08.495 --> 00:53:09.120
I'm not afraid.

00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.920
It's only $1.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.400
Right?

00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.630
If you want me to pass around
20's, then I want them.

00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:19.260
But it says Federal
Reserve note, right?

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.825
So it's a liability of
the commercial bank.

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:27.740
In an earlier day, it
said you could exchange it

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:28.585
for gold or silver.

00:53:28.585 --> 00:53:30.710
AUDIENCE: Right, so that's
what I don't understand.

00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:34.130
PROFESSOR: By the 1930s,
for retail deposits

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:37.430
in the middle of the
Depression, President Roosevelt

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:38.930
said, no more.

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:41.120
You cannot redeem
gold and silver.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:43.340
And then President
Nixon, in the 1970s,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.360
said in the official sector
that he was going off of the--

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.450
until that point in
time, other governments

00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:53.420
could redeem in gold.

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:57.090
But when paper money started,
it was not backed by gold.

00:53:57.090 --> 00:53:59.450
We had a period of
the gold standard.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:00.650
We were on and off of it.

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:06.560
We fell off of it during World
War I. We went back on it.

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.690
It would be a false
narrative to say

00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:11.390
that we were on the gold
standard for our first 140

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:13.190
years.

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:15.380
I just wanted to clear that up.

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.170
I mean, we sort of went on the
gold standard, we went off,

00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.180
we went back on, and so forth.

00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:23.760
But it is a liability on
the books and records.

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:27.870
So it is a matter of accounting
in double-entry bookkeeping.

00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:29.670
I will show you in
a minute the balance

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:31.410
sheet of the Federal
Reserve, and I'll

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:32.610
come back to this question.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:33.360
Is that all right?

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.610
AUDIENCE: Can you clarify
what is the bank liable for?

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:38.550
So before, it gave me
$1, and I could go to $1

00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:39.842
and get back the gold, right?

00:54:39.842 --> 00:54:40.550
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:44.010
AUDIENCE: Now, what are
they liable for now?

00:54:44.010 --> 00:54:45.780
PROFESSOR: It is, in
essence, a social--

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:48.488
it's the first point.

00:54:48.488 --> 00:54:49.530
I'm going to separate it.

00:54:49.530 --> 00:54:54.990
The central bank is liable that
they will move on its ledgers

00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:57.820
if you want to move
that to somewhere else.

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.750
So you could take that
physical $1 in and say,

00:55:00.750 --> 00:55:03.060
I want to deposit
this in a bank.

00:55:03.060 --> 00:55:06.300
And they have to record it
on the ledger of that bank.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.370
That is what they are--

00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:11.340
and the US government,
which is technically

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.530
separate from the central bank--

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:16.510
or the UK government or
the Chinese government.

00:55:16.510 --> 00:55:19.440
they're all technically
separate from their banks--

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:22.790
People's Bank of China
or the Bank of England.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.790
Their governments are
saying they will accept it

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:28.240
for payments against taxes.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.660
So there's a set of
social constructs.

00:55:33.273 --> 00:55:35.690
I'm going to just go through
this to answer your question.

00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:39.450
It relies on a
system of ledgers,

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:42.797
and it's an integration of those
ledgers between the banking

00:55:42.797 --> 00:55:44.130
system and the commercial banks.

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:49.100
In the US, we have about
9,000 commercial banks.

00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:50.870
And what the Federal
Reserve is saying--

00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:53.270
but it's true about the
People's Bank of China.

00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:57.500
It's true about the
European Central Bank.

00:55:57.500 --> 00:55:59.330
Each of these central
banks are basically

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:03.470
saying, if you bring
your paper money in,

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:07.760
we'll record it on the
ledger of a commercial bank.

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:10.030
And you can pay your
taxes to our sister

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:13.820
over here called the government.

00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:15.550
I'm sorry to let you down.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:16.850
It's not more than that.

00:56:16.850 --> 00:56:17.390
Sorry, Alan.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:18.890
AUDIENCE: I have a
potential answer.

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:19.932
I might be totally wrong.

00:56:19.932 --> 00:56:20.848
PROFESSOR: Please, no.

00:56:20.848 --> 00:56:22.940
AUDIENCE: I think it's a
legal and sustainable way

00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:31.250
to conduct a Ponzi scheme with
a proper Ponzi scheme, where

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:33.890
the value will
increase by 1% to 3%

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:39.290
if the central bank reaches
the goal of inflation.

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:41.750
PROFESSOR: All right, any
other points of view on that?

00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:44.990
I saw-- I'm not
sure of your name.

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.860
Oh, no, you don't
want to say anything?

00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:47.360
No?

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:48.827
All right.

00:56:48.827 --> 00:56:50.660
AUDIENCE: I think I'll
go back to point one.

00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:53.920
It's a construct that someone
would give you something.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.010
So your dollar with the
central bank, the central bank

00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:00.700
owes you that dollar's worth
of whatever you desire.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.800
And someone will
happily take that dollar

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.520
from the central bank and give
you the goods that you want.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.770
So it's a roundabout
way of-- it's

00:57:08.770 --> 00:57:14.358
a way of transacting something,
whatever value that dollar has.

00:57:14.358 --> 00:57:16.150
AUDIENCE: It's also
central bank liability,

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.860
because whenever the
government has sovereign debt,

00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.200
it can't just issue new notes.

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.303
It's liable.

00:57:22.303 --> 00:57:24.470
So that's why it's a
liability, because you can only

00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:26.680
issue notes against a
certain amount of reserves

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.730
that you carry.

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:30.820
So that's why you refer
to it as a liability.

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:34.660
Because you can't just issue new
notes whenever you need them.

00:57:34.660 --> 00:57:36.870
You can't just make new
money out of thin air.

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:38.970
So you're liable
for every new note.

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:41.350
PROFESSOR: I'm going to take
one more comment on this

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:42.870
and then give a
couple more things.

00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:44.120
Eric?

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.060
AUDIENCE: The
currency is actually

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.390
a small part of the total
reserves of the Federal Reserve

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:50.320
System.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:53.230
I think maybe the bank
reserves are maybe

00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:56.470
a more applicable application,
because a bank can actually

00:57:56.470 --> 00:58:00.580
require the Fed to print
money by making more loans.

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.910
So in that way,
there's this mechanism

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.050
to ensure that
liability [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:08.330
PROFESSOR: I'm very pleased
with this discussion, even

00:58:08.330 --> 00:58:13.180
Alan's contributions
about the schemes.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.620
This is the debate.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:16.540
If Jay Powell were
here-- how many of you

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:19.550
know who Jay Powell is?

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:20.755
Who's Jay Powell?

00:58:20.755 --> 00:58:24.030
AUDIENCE: It's a lab.

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:25.270
PROFESSOR: Jay Powell.

00:58:25.270 --> 00:58:25.770
No.

00:58:25.770 --> 00:58:26.790
Who's Jay Powell?

00:58:26.790 --> 00:58:27.750
AUDIENCE: Head of
the Federal Reserve.

00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:29.375
PROFESSOR: Head of
the Federal Reserve.

00:58:29.375 --> 00:58:30.540
Thank you.

00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.940
Sorry.

00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.210
But if Jay Powell
were here, he'd

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:39.930
have a laugh along with
what Alan just said,

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:44.220
but he would say,
also, the liability

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:46.860
is a social liability, as well.

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:49.380
That a central
banker, to their core,

00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:51.810
believes what they
are trying to do

00:58:51.810 --> 00:58:57.630
is ensure for the stability of
this social thing we call money

00:58:57.630 --> 00:59:00.030
and to make sure that
it doesn't get debased

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:03.330
and it has some value.

00:59:03.330 --> 00:59:06.330
So it's accepted for
taxes, we talked about.

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:08.770
Notes and coins are legal
tender for all debts,

00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:11.050
public and private.

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:16.520
I walk into a Starbucks and I
say, I'd like a cup of coffee.

00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:22.210
Here's my $5 or whatever
it costs these days.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.740
Does the person
behind the counter

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:25.250
have to brew the coffee?

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:26.620
Is just a yes or no?

00:59:26.620 --> 00:59:27.220
Can I see?

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.400
Who wants to go for it?

00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:35.340
There's a no from Christopher.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:36.630
What, Chris?

00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:37.710
There's a no from Chris.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:39.880
Who agrees with Chris?

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.550
OK.

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:43.050
They brew a cup of coffee.

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:44.700
I go to the other
side of the counter.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.660
The coffee's sitting there.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.800
Now, do they have to
accept my $5 at that point?

00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:53.650
Yes.

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:57.220
Before they brew the coffee,
nobody has to take dollars.

00:59:57.220 --> 01:00:02.460
But once a debt is established,
they've produced the good,

01:00:02.460 --> 01:00:05.280
they've provided the service,
they have to take it.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.810
Just a small, little thing.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.610
That's what legal tender is.

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:10.350
And so there's
many establishments

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:13.080
around the globe
that are basically

01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.100
now putting little signs out,
we don't take Swedish krona.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.210
We don't take this.

01:00:18.210 --> 01:00:22.530
We don't take that
in paper form.

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.410
They'll still take
it electronically.

01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:27.210
And there's a new little
bit of definitional thing

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:29.810
going on about legal tender.

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.480
There's also some
unique tax treatments,

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.390
but I'm not going to go
through the currency.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:37.060
So central banking and money
we talked about a little bit.

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:39.250
This is a kind of
chart that I borrowed

01:00:39.250 --> 01:00:42.670
from somebody else's paper.

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:45.235
But the central banks at
the top is at the center.

01:00:48.090 --> 01:00:50.800
And if Alice and Bob-- and we'll
be talking about Alice and Bob

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.270
in Bitcoin time, so you can
pull this chart down later--

01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:58.330
want to transact and they're
at the same commercial bank,

01:00:58.330 --> 01:01:00.940
Bank Number 1, then
commercial Bank Number 1

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:05.020
has to change their ledgers,
moving money from Alice to Bob.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:08.230
In essence, if you're both
two people at Bank of America,

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:12.390
you can move your balance
at Bank of America.

01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:16.580
But if you're at Bank of
America going over to Citicorp,

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:22.940
then something has to go between
two ledgers, Bank of America's

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.830
ledger and Citicorp's ledger.

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:30.730
And the only way to transact
between two banks' ledgers

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:34.260
is some balancing
act has to happen

01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:38.650
at the top ledger,
called the central bank.

01:01:38.650 --> 01:01:41.163
And later, when we talk about
payment systems-- and I'm

01:01:41.163 --> 01:01:43.330
going to use this slide
again later in the semester.

01:01:43.330 --> 01:01:45.940
That's why I'm not going to
spend as much time now on it.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:48.720
We're going to
talk about ledgers.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.980
And when you move money
between two banks,

01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:53.470
it's all within
one closed system--

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:59.510
that country's or that society's
central banking system.

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.180
But then it gets really
a little bit more iffy

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.450
and woolly when you're
moving from one currency

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:06.485
to another currency.

01:02:09.110 --> 01:02:13.670
Because how do you make two
closed ledger systems operable?

01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:15.680
Not for today, but
we'll go through

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.960
that later when we do
payment systems and the like.

01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:24.110
The central bank, the
US central bank-- this

01:02:24.110 --> 01:02:26.610
was the only good slide I could
find, which was about a year

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.480
old.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:30.540
Its liabilities and assets
are about 4 and 1/4 trillion

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.880
dollars, $4.3 trillion.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:36.990
$1.7 trillion of
that is in currency.

01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:39.060
Do I get my $1 back, by the way?

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:40.950
I mean, my liability.

01:02:40.950 --> 01:02:49.260
So $1.7 trillion of those
greenbacks are in circulation.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.650
And remarkably, even
though half of you

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:55.020
probably don't use cash
that much, you don't even

01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:59.080
have checking accounts, the
amount of cash in circulation

01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:01.000
is growing faster
than the economy

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.250
in most developed nations.

01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:07.800
Why do you think that is?

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.210
What probably one word?

01:03:10.210 --> 01:03:14.050
AUDIENCE: The amount of
2008 crisis [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:16.064
PROFESSOR: Oh, that's
more than one word.

01:03:16.064 --> 01:03:16.830
AUDIENCE: Trust.

01:03:16.830 --> 01:03:17.538
PROFESSOR: Drugs.

01:03:17.538 --> 01:03:18.540
AUDIENCE: Trust.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:19.980
PROFESSOR: Oh, trust.

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:23.130
I thought you said drugs.

01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:24.030
Trust.

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:25.710
Well, it does have
to do with trust,

01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.140
but it also has
to do with drugs.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:31.410
Paper currency is
a wonderful method

01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:35.860
of money laundering, drug
running, and a store of value.

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.490
So there's certain segments
of our economy and segments

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:40.590
of the worldwide
economy that does not

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:45.230
want to be in the
electronic banking system.

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.100
I'm going to slip
through these quickly,

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.520
but there's another piece that
we need for this whole class

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.480
and for the semester is credit
and credit intermediation.

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:56.160
But just a little thing--

01:03:56.160 --> 01:03:59.940
credit cards started
only 60 or 70 years ago,

01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:03.720
but they go back to a book
a little over 100 years ago.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:05.910
The word "credit
card" is used 18 times

01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:12.360
in this book, where a science
fiction writer in 1887 said,

01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:15.270
what would the world be
like in the year 2000?

01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:18.090
And it was the first use
of the word "credit card."

01:04:18.090 --> 01:04:21.930
And he said that society
would have a form of money,

01:04:21.930 --> 01:04:24.120
and you would have
credit against it.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.010
And it's a fascinating
thing that somebody

01:04:26.010 --> 01:04:27.750
could be that visionary.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:29.730
But there were merchant
cards starting,

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:32.820
so maybe he wasn't so visionary.

01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:37.440
Oil companies in the 1920s,
charge cards were starting,

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.870
but they were
single-merchant cards.

01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:43.830
You could have credit
from that merchant.

01:04:43.830 --> 01:04:47.160
In 1946, in a bank
in Brooklyn, a guy

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.140
named Biggins started with that.

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.970
That was the first
real charge it.

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:58.530
You could charge things in a
few dozen places in Brooklyn,

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:00.660
literally.

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:02.580
And then, all of a
sudden, it took off.

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.078
Diner's Club started
in the early 1950s.

01:05:05.078 --> 01:05:07.620
They found that they could get
a bunch of restaurants to say,

01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:11.460
wouldn't you want to extend
credit, and we'll back it?

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.340
American Express
in the mid-1950s.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.500
And then, finally,
in the mid-1960s,

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.680
Bank of America, which at that
time was a California bank,

01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:23.280
figured out they would
create a co-operative

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:27.590
with a bunch of other US
banks to extend credit.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:30.390
And the credit boom took off.

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:33.360
And what was interesting,
the laws to regulate all this

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.630
didn't come until the
1970s, at least in the US--

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:39.570
the Fair Credit Reporting
Act and all the other laws.

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:42.780
There's three big
ones in the 1970s.

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:46.050
I go to conferences sometime and
talk about Bitcoin regulation,

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:49.140
and they say, well, why can't
the government solve this now?

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:53.280
I sort of remind them that
it took 15 to 20 years from

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:57.420
the introduction of credit cards
kind of in the early to mid

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:01.110
1950s and the real
take-off in the 1960s--

01:06:01.110 --> 01:06:06.900
it was 1974, 1970, '77,
the three big credit laws.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.080
So if you're going to be
an entrepreneur in Bitcoin,

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.660
know that it could be
15 years until there's

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:17.910
some cryptolaws in the future.

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:20.940
That was the processing
machine from the 1950s.

01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.050
I made it too small, sorry.

01:06:24.050 --> 01:06:26.570
Visa made it better.

01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:29.300
And then, of course, that's
what we all see today,

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:32.550
how your cards get processed.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:35.030
So the role of money
we've talked about.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.220
So I'm going to skip over that.

01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:39.590
But now the
characteristics of money.

01:06:39.590 --> 01:06:42.020
What makes a good money?

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:43.760
We talked about some
of this earlier.

01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:48.380
It's durable, meaning that that
salt cube wasn't the greatest,

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:51.650
because if a lot of rain
came, that would wash away.

01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:54.460
Gold and silver,
metals, are durable.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.670
They're portable.

01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:57.500
The heavier it is,
the less portable

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:01.970
it is, and that's why gold was
a better money than silver.

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:02.780
You could move it--

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.800
and better than
copper and bronze.

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:07.460
It was divisible easily.

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:11.240
You could slice things up.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.280
Uniform and fungible.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.990
And anyone who's who down the
rabbit hole on this stuff,

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:18.560
if you really want
to learn about money,

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:24.480
read about Crawford
versus Royal Bank in 1749.

01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:28.170
There was a gentleman at the
early part of paper money

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:34.790
that mailed two 20-pound notes,
and he wrote his name on them.

01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:39.750
They got lost in the mail,
and he took the banks to court

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:43.280
to say, those were mine,
when they were found.

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:47.390
And there was no law in Scotland
or in England at the time

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:48.720
as to what to do about it.

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.430
But if you lose or somebody
stole a piece of art,

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.450
you get it back.

01:07:54.450 --> 01:07:57.360
And the law was settled
in 1749 that you actually

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:59.730
don't get your money back.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:02.670
Does anybody want to guess
as to why the courts--

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.940
it was a matter of
first interpretation.

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:10.550
The courts had no jurisprudence
on this before 1749.

01:08:10.550 --> 01:08:15.230
Why did the courts decide
that a piece of art

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:17.479
was different than currency?

01:08:17.479 --> 01:08:19.880
And it goes to the
fundamental of what

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:22.670
money is, fiat money is.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:25.490
Anybody want to take a
guess as to why the courts--

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:27.071
they could have
gone the other way.

01:08:27.071 --> 01:08:29.529
AUDIENCE: How could you tell
if someone really owned money?

01:08:29.529 --> 01:08:30.612
How could you [INAUDIBLE]?

01:08:30.612 --> 01:08:31.850
PROFESSOR: He signed it.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:36.240
Actually, the facts were clear
it was the currency he signed.

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:38.609
I'm just helping
you out so that--

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:42.220
that's a good point,
but he signed it.

01:08:42.220 --> 01:08:44.350
AUDIENCE: It can't be used
as a medium of exchange

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:47.492
if it doesn't belong to
the person [INAUDIBLE]..

01:08:47.492 --> 01:08:48.909
PROFESSOR: In
essence, if you were

01:08:48.909 --> 01:08:51.340
to go back and read--
there's some history on this,

01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:54.298
and read the court cases.

01:08:54.298 --> 01:08:55.090
This was the point.

01:08:55.090 --> 01:08:56.500
The court basically
said, we have

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.710
to make this a
medium of exchange,

01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:01.000
the greater social good.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.770
It has to be fungible.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:08.620
And the Royal Bank of Scotland
was, of course, kind of

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:12.109
closer to the courts than
this gentleman, Crawford.

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:15.717
But the banks were also saying,
we can't keep track of this.

01:09:15.717 --> 01:09:18.050
So it was a mixture of the
two, but it made it fungible.

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:19.330
Eric?

01:09:19.330 --> 01:09:21.478
AUDIENCE: Was it
those specific notes

01:09:21.478 --> 01:09:22.770
that he had signed [INAUDIBLE]?

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:23.437
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:09:23.437 --> 01:09:24.143
Yeah.

01:09:24.143 --> 01:09:25.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.060
PROFESSOR: And in 1749,
they all had serial numbers,

01:09:28.060 --> 01:09:30.910
and they were signed in
a way that not today.

01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:34.359
Of course, they're acceptable,
and they're stable.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:36.550
And we're going to talk a
lot about the last point.

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:38.740
They're stable because
they're hard to mine,

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:42.740
and Bitcoin has that
embedded in it, as well.

01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:45.319
The design of money is
really important, as well.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.850
You can make it a token--

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.580
a token is like
something physical--

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.649
or account based.

01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:55.440
We're of course now living in
a world of account-based money,

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.780
and it's digital, not physical.

01:09:59.445 --> 01:10:01.070
It can be issued by
the private sector,

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:04.070
just like banknotes
in the 18th century,

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:08.040
or private sector like
Bitcoin, or it can be central.

01:10:08.040 --> 01:10:10.920
It can be widely acceptable
or just wholesale.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.448
There are forms of
wholesale money.

01:10:13.448 --> 01:10:15.240
One of the biggest
forms of wholesale money

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.490
is the central bank's
reserves are only

01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:21.050
available to the
commercial banking system.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:23.090
We're going to study
this money flower later,

01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:26.630
but I put it in the
slides because this--

01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:28.880
I didn't create this flower.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:30.740
You have a reading
later in the semester

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.870
from the Bank of
International Settlement that

01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:35.060
has this money flower in it.

01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:37.640
But it's basically across
these four things--

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.250
is it token our account
based, physical or digital,

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.130
private or central,
or widely accessible?

01:10:43.130 --> 01:10:47.030
And then all monies fall into
one piece of this money flower.

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:50.420
There's a Professor Garrett
that came up with this flower,

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.480
and there's an optional reading
later in the semester from him.

01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:58.820
You had a reading from Clark.

01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:02.560
There's not enough time,
but all this stuff failed.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:04.640
Does anybody want to
give me a flavor for one

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:07.340
or two reasons why a bunch
of digital cash failed?

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.900
Did anybody read
the Clark reading,

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:10.430
the history of some DigiCash?

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:11.990
Oh, Alan read it.

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:13.930
Anybody else read it?

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:14.430
Over here.

01:11:14.430 --> 01:11:15.215
I can't remember--

01:11:15.215 --> 01:11:15.840
AUDIENCE: Zhan.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.230
PROFESSOR: Don.

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:16.965
So what did you--

01:11:16.965 --> 01:11:17.590
AUDIENCE: Zhan.

01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:18.070
PROFESSOR: What?

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.690
AUDIENCE: Zhan.

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:19.170
PROFESSOR: Zhan.

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:20.550
Zhan, what did you
take from the reading?

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.630
Why did these all fail?

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:24.852
What's the one or two
biggest reasons they failed?

01:11:24.852 --> 01:11:26.310
AUDIENCE: Most of
them still relied

01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:28.433
on kind of some form
of a central authority.

01:11:28.433 --> 01:11:30.350
PROFESSOR: All right,
they relied on central--

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.700
DigiCash certainly did
it, David Chaum's case,

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:34.270
and some of the others.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:35.250
Any other big reason?

01:11:35.250 --> 01:11:37.133
Alan, did you have--

01:11:37.133 --> 01:11:39.300
AUDIENCE: There wasn't
enough adoption by merchants,

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:39.840
I recall.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.840
PROFESSOR: Definitely not
adoption by merchants.

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:42.570
Very good.

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:43.830
Third reason why they failed?

01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:46.005
One that's at the core
of what Bitcoin solved.

01:11:49.513 --> 01:11:51.680
AUDIENCE: Incentivizing
like a decentralized network

01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:53.632
to keep that ledger,
maintain the ledger.

01:11:53.632 --> 01:11:55.590
PROFESSOR: All right,
incentivizing the ledger.

01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:57.028
Behind Eric.

01:11:57.028 --> 01:11:59.320
AUDIENCE: They couldn't solve
the double spend problem.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.195
PROFESSOR: That's it.

01:12:00.195 --> 01:12:02.190
Couldn't spend the
double spend problem.

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:04.790
Could a currency be spent
not just once, but twice?

01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:06.930
So there's four things
that were raised.

01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:09.660
Four things about
centralization, the double

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:11.010
spend.

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:13.020
They couldn't get
merchants to adopt it,

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:16.410
and there was couldn't-- some
form of consensus as to what

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:17.563
the ledger was.

01:12:17.563 --> 01:12:19.230
I'm going to flip
through these quickly,

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:21.150
but digital and mobile
money did happen.

01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:22.620
We were asked about
PayPal earlier.

01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.160
It was 1998.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:31.370
In Norway, Ericsson and Telenor
had the first mobile app.

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:35.600
And it was to get movies
on your mobile phone.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:38.450
1999, Alipay comes
along that we'll

01:12:38.450 --> 01:12:41.240
talk a lot about when
we do payments later.

01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:44.630
And of course, M-Pesa that we
talked about a little last week

01:12:44.630 --> 01:12:50.530
in Kenya, where Safaricom
noticed that a bunch of money--

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:51.460
near money.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:55.330
It was mobile minutes that was
being used as money in Kenya,

01:12:55.330 --> 01:12:58.045
and now there's 20
million users of that.

01:12:58.045 --> 01:12:59.920
And of course, there's
a bunch of regulations

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.950
now and so forth.

01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:06.000
Starbucks started in 2011.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.510
And then, of course,
it's now off to the races

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.050
in mobile money.

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:13.200
One of the key things
about mobile money

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:15.690
we will discuss
and learn together

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:17.670
is the question
each one of these

01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:21.510
is, where is the stored value?

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.030
And I have to tell
you, sometimes

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:26.270
I get quite confused when
I research a new app.

01:13:26.270 --> 01:13:28.670
Are they storing the value?

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:34.110
Or are they just a
processing provider to move--

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.910
as we said earlier,
payment systems

01:13:35.910 --> 01:13:39.370
move and change and
amend other ledgers.

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:42.900
In a number of these, like
M-Pesa, initially they

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:44.380
were storing the value.

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.310
And mobile apps Starbucks
stores the value.

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:51.390
But many of them are just
applications, computer code,

01:13:51.390 --> 01:13:54.380
to move the ledger
somewhere else.

01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:57.190
But the riddle remained.

01:13:57.190 --> 01:13:58.960
You remember that riddle--

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.300
how to move money peer to peer
without a central authority.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:07.890
And that's what I'm asking
for next class, Thursday,

01:14:07.890 --> 01:14:11.380
to actually read.

01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:16.140
I wouldn't wing it, and I
wouldn't be afraid of it.

01:14:16.140 --> 01:14:19.170
Satoshi Nakamoto wrote
a paper that everybody

01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.500
in this class-- if you're
at MIT, and a few of you

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.380
are at Harvard.

01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:25.650
I'm telling you,
you can read it.

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:28.200
You'll understand
maybe 1/2 to 2/3 of it.

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.820
It's not deeply technical.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.250
And it's only eight
or nine pages.

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.820
I've also assigned
National Institute

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:42.720
of Science Technology, about
20 pages of reading from NIST.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.913
The question is
whether that's Bitcoin.

01:14:44.913 --> 01:14:46.830
I'm going to skip through
the study questions,

01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:48.390
but the study
questions are really

01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:51.960
about cryptography and how
append-only timestamping.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.570
We are going to get into
the nitty-gritty over three

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:55.620
lectures.

01:14:55.620 --> 01:14:59.430
I couldn't commit the whole
course, the whole semester.

01:14:59.430 --> 01:15:00.840
But I think three lectures--

01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:03.020
Thursday and the two next week.

01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.400
Anytime you want
to come to see me--

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:08.430
Sabrina is somewhere
here on the floor, who's

01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:13.320
one of our TAs, who's a computer
science master's student

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:15.390
and knows more
about all of this.

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:17.280
Madores, who was
here last week--

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.860
I don't know if Madores is
here, who's part of the Digital

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.750
Currency Initiative.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:23.520
Over three lectures,
we're going to try

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:26.760
to work through what's
the cryptography,

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.170
and why does that matter?

01:15:29.170 --> 01:15:31.910
How does the time
stamping happen?

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:34.500
How's this look like money, and
how are the transactions kept?

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.000
Yes?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:36.607
You get to close it out, almost.

01:15:36.607 --> 01:15:38.357
AUDIENCE: Can you just
answer the question

01:15:38.357 --> 01:15:41.440
posed about the longest
running blockchain?

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.440
PROFESSOR: I can answer
that, but the assignment

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.054
was to answer it
by Thursday, right?

01:15:45.054 --> 01:15:46.012
AUDIENCE: Oh, Thursday.

01:15:46.012 --> 01:15:46.512
OK.

01:15:46.512 --> 01:15:48.690
PROFESSOR: So by Thursday.

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:49.800
What's your first name?

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:50.190
AUDIENCE: Caroline.

01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:51.023
PROFESSOR: Caroline.

01:15:51.023 --> 01:15:53.023
Did I say I was going
to answer it today?

01:15:53.023 --> 01:15:53.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:55.740
PROFESSOR: Oh, did I say today?

01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:58.830
No, is there a mutable
record of what I said?

01:15:58.830 --> 01:16:02.220
I'll answer it now if you want.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.915
Does anyone have the
answer in the whole class?

01:16:05.915 --> 01:16:06.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:10.720
It's a service called
Surety that Gillespie

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:16.570
begun working in
1995, was a timestamp

01:16:16.570 --> 01:16:19.440
service for digital documents.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.870
And the way they did
it was use a hash

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:28.110
function to create a seal with
a timestamp on the document.

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:32.280
And then present the
weekly batch of seals.

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:35.400
And they actually published
it in the New York

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.320
Times [INAUDIBLE].

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:40.380
PROFESSOR: So Caroline, it's
good to raise the question.

01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.730
I thought it was for
Thursday, but thank you.

01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:48.000
Stewart Haber, a
cryptographer, and a colleague

01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.330
at Bell Labs in the
early '90s, said,

01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:55.267
how do we notarize information,
digitally notarize?

01:16:55.267 --> 01:16:57.600
And we're going to be talking
about this Thursday a lot.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.590
They used a cryptographic
method called hash functions.

01:17:02.590 --> 01:17:06.640
And they were just trying
to notarize information.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:08.760
And by 1995, they took--

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.760
they were entrepreneurs.

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:12.250
They created a
company called Surety.

01:17:12.250 --> 01:17:15.640
And once a week, they published,
in the New York Times--

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.200
and they still do it.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:18.700
You can get a New York Times--

01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.800
I believe it's on
Saturday or Sunday.

01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:24.220
And they take-- it's in
the classifieds section.

01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:27.100
And they have the hash function,
which you'll read about

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.690
between now and Thursday.

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:33.530
They have the hash of all
the pre-existing information.

01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:36.730
And so they timestamp it by
using the New York Times,

01:17:36.730 --> 01:17:38.760
and they use cryptography.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.037
And it's currently
23 years in running.

01:17:41.037 --> 01:17:42.704
AUDIENCE: So that's
the longest in terms

01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:46.810
of time, not the longest with
how many ledgers or how many--

01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:48.970
PROFESSOR: Correct,
because Bitcoin

01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:52.180
is about 550,000 blocks,
and this would be

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:55.810
whatever 23 years times 52 is.

01:17:55.810 --> 01:17:57.530
Longest in time.

01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:58.120
Thank you.

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:00.630
I look forward to seeing you.

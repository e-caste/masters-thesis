WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we're shifting gears today.
We're going to talk about molecular

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
evolution, i.e. how do
we understand how species

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
evolve, how do we understand
a lot about ourselves,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how human evolution is taking
place over the last couple hundred

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
thousand years.
And traditionally,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
evolution has been the purview of
people who study the morphology of

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
organisms, and when I talk about
morphology, obviously I'm talking

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
about shape and form. And
by comparing organisms,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
starting already 250 years ago,
one began to develop hierarchies of

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
how different organisms on the
planet are related to one another.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You've seen this, undoubtedly,
in high school biology.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is the study of phylogeny,
and phylogeny has traditionally been

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
figured out by comparing the
phenotypes, the morphologies of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
adults, sometimes embryonic
development, and on that basis,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
attempting to extrapolate
back in evolutionary time,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
about the relatedness of different
organisms, one to the other.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And in so doing, one
has been able to create,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
for example, family trees, here's
something that Charles Darwin was

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
already interested in, the
various kinds of finches on the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Galapagos Islands off Peru, in
the Pacific. And here, one is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
beginning to organize different
bird species on the basis of whether

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
they're more closely or less
closely related to one another,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and to draw pedigrees, which,
one imagines, describe how they

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
evolved, one from the other.
i.e., organisms which are very

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
similar to one another must be
more closely related evolutionarily,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and conversely, those that appear
very differently from one another,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
morphologically, must be far more
distantly related to one another.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In fact, these kinds of morphologic
extrapolations can be very

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
misleading. So here, for
example, are two kinds of eyes.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The top eye is
a Drysophila eye

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
which, to state the obvious, looks
a lot different from our eyes,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
which is that the chordate
eyes shown the bottom.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Totally different. Our rods
and cones face backwards,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the Drysophila Arthropod eyes,
the light sensors face forward.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Everything is different.
And on the basis of that,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you would say that these
two organisms are independent

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
evolutionary inventions, that
they've been invented on two

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
occasions, and that they have
no relatedness, one to the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
other, at all. But I will
tell you an extraordinary

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
experiment. You can take, there's
a master gene that controls

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
eye development in the fly,
Drosophila. It's called eyeless,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if you knock it out then the
eye doesn't develop at all.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And you can take out of the mouse,
what is apparently a related gene

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
called small eye, so the
fly gene is called eyeless

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and the mouse gene is called small
eye. And you can put the small-eyed

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
gene into the Drosophila genome, in
a fly that lacks the eyeless gene.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So here we're
talking about two

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
different genes. The fly
gene is called eyeless,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the mammalian gene, at least
in mouse, is called small eye.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
If you knock out this gene in the
fly genome, and replace it with this

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
gene, you get a perfectly
normal Drosophila eye.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's extraordinary. Or
you can do the following,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
you can arrange it so that the
mouse small eye gene is expressed

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
ectopically. When
I say ectopically,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
I mean that it's expressed in the
wrong place, at the wrong time.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So you can do the following
experiment. In a fly genome,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
you can arrange it so that the mouse
small eye gene becomes expressed on

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
one of the extremities of the fly,
on one of the legs of the fly. And

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
now, on one of the extremities of
the fly, an ectopic eye will develop,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
looks just like a Drosophila eye,
but it's development is programmed

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
by the mouse small eye gene.
What I'm telling you is that these

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
two genes are totally interchangeable,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that they are effectively
indistinguishable from one another,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
functionally they have some sequence
relatedness, but in terms of the way

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
they program development, they
are effectively equivalent.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And what this means is that the
progenitor of these two genes

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
must've already existed at the
time that the flies and we diverged,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which six or seven-hundred million
years ago, and in the intervening

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
six or seven-hundred million
years, these genes have been totally

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
unchanged. i.e., once
the gene was developed,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
evolution could not tinker with it,
and begin to change it in different

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
ways, ostensibly because such
tinkering would render these genes

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
dysfunctional, and thereby
would inactivate them,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
thereby depriving the organism
of a critical sensory organ.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So here we have an example,
a dramatic example, of how

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
morphology misleads us. Here
we have an example of where we

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
would say these two eyes, the
two eyes I've shown you here,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
are so different from one
another that they must,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
by necessity, be independent
evolutionary inventions.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But in fact, genetics tells us,
and these gene-swapping experiments,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
tell us that the two eyes descend
from a common ancestral eye,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a prototypical eye, whose precise
morphology we can't discern anymore.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And so we begin to realize that
if we really want to understand

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
evolution and we really
want to understand phylogeny,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
phylogeny being how the species
are related to one another,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
we have to the DNA, and we have
to begin to look not at phenotype,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
but we have to look
instead, at genotype.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The Darwinian model is pretty
much like this, the survival of the

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
fittest. And when I say that,
we imagine that we have here, a

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
genetically heterogeneous group
of organisms within a species,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and this, this number of individuals
in the species could be 100,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:22.000
it could be 1,000,000.
This particular individual,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
by chance, acquires a mutation,
or an advantageous allele, through

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
some genetic alteration. This
genotype renders this organism

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
more fit, phenotypically,
has a selective advantage and

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
consequently, over extended periods
of time, which may be thousands or

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
even millions of years, the
descendents of the organism

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
bearing this allele now have
advantage, have greater reproductive

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
advantage, survival advantage,
compared with the other individuals

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in the same species, and
therefore, the representation of

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
this mutant allele in the gene pool
of the species becomes expanded.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
When I say gene pool, I'm
talking bout the common shared

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
set of genes within the species,
such as within the human species.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And so eventually, the
descendents of this organism,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
or the descendants of an
organism bearing this allele,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
now become overrepresented in the
population, because they're more fit.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And then there can be
another succession, i.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
., there could be other
mutations occurring subsequently.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Once again, favoring the selective
outgrowth of an individual bearing

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
this allele, or this
allele. And in addition,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
there can be the process of
what one calls, speciation.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
That is to say, that if some parts
of the species live in one place,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and other parts of the
species live in another place,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
geographically, they may no longer
interbreed, and as a consequence,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and because of the fact they're
under different selective pressures,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
they may begin to diverge from
another if, evolutionary speaking,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
because they're no longer actively
exchanging genes within one another.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And, as a consequence, one
can have new species arriving.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And what one believes,
this happens over slow,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
slowly over evolutionary time, but
it does arise, and to the extent

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
it does, one eventually ends
up with organisms here and here,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
which can no longer effectively
interbreed with one another.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
That is to say, they become
genetically so different from one

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
another, that any hybrids
formed between them are,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in fact, sterile, for one reason
or another, if they're at all

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
interested in breeding with
one another to begin with.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And what this means is that we
can begin to trace how closely or

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
distantly related species are to
one another, simply by asking how

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
closely or similarly related
are their DNA sequences?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
If, distantly related organisms
have very distantly related

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
sequences, and closely related
organisms must have sequences which

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
are very similar to one another.
And over evolutionary time, there's

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
a so-called mutational clock,
where one, where each species

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
accumulates a certain
number of point mutations,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
base substitutions in it's DNA,
per million years, and the longer

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the two species are separated from
one another, the greater will be the

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
difference in their
sequence diversity.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And on that simple basis,
one can begin to construct

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
evolutionary trees of, for
example, the entire cellular

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
life on the planet. And
here's such an evolutionary

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
tree, where what's being compared
is the ribosomal RNA sequences,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
i.e., the small ribosomal RNA.
Remember, ribosomes have two

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
subunits, small and large,
in the case of prokaryotes,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
it's 16S RNA, that is,
it's sedimentation rate.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
In the case of mammals,
it's 18S. In both cases,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
these are small ribosomal RNA
subunits. The ribosome was only

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
invented on one occasion during
the evolution of life on the planet,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
so one can begin to compare since
all cellular life forms have life

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
forms, one can ask how similar,
or dissimilar, are the various

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
sequences and coding, in
small ribosomal RNA subunits?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And on the basis of that, one has
concluded that there are actually

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
three branches of cellular
life on the planet.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
The bacteria indicated here,
this is not such a great Xerox,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
where you see a whole series
of different kinds of bacteria,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
indicated on this tree. Sorry
about the poor reproduction.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Here there's a dashed line
indicating that we're talking,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
there's a second kingdom in the
middle here, indicated by what are

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
called archae, and
the archae are also,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
from our point of view, prokaryotes,
but they're not bacteria. They are

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
a single-cell life form,
they're often found in unusual

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
situations, for instance, in
thermal vents in the bottom of

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the ocean floor, some of
them are able to stand high

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
salt, some of them are able
to stand high temperature,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
like therma fillus, therma
proteus, and so fourth.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And these, their ribosomal RNAs,
are so different from those of

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
bacteria, that they've been placed
in their own separate kingdom.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And finally, here are the
eukaryotes, all over here.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
These are all eukaryotic cells,
starting here. And we, our cells,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
seem to be slightly more closely
related to those of the Archaea,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
if you follow this ribosomal
sequences, than they are to

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
the actual bacteria. So,
there's actually two major

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
prokaryotic life forms on the
planet. The first living organism,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
well if you begin to try to
look back in geological record,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
it looks like the first living
cellular life forms existed already

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
3-3.5 billion years ago, not
so long after the planet was

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
formed, which was between 4.
and 4.5 billion years ago. And

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
here's the whole eukaryotic tree,
and if we look at the eukaryotic

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
trees, remembering here that we're
starting at 3.5 billion years ago,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And we're using this evolutionary
clock to determine relatedness,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
then we see a whole series
of single-cell eukaryotes,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
here are their names are,
these are protozoan, eukaryotic

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
protozoan. Here's Amoeba,
here are slime molds, here are

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
cilliates, we're still
at single-cell organisms.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Finally we get to
multi-cellular organisms, plants,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
fungi, and animals, and so,
all animals on the planet

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
are a relatively recent invention.
All animals, all of the metazoan,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
are just on this very small branch,
and we know that this very small

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
branch started around
600-650 million years ago,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
maybe 700 million years ago.
And that was the time, roughly

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
speaking, when we and flies
last had our common ancestor,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
otherwise, to state the obvious,
we and flies are very different.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The fact that the gene for
encoding the eye has been conserved,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
so faithfully, over enormous
evolutionary period of time

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
indicates something else,
And that is, certain genes can

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
evolve progressively over
a long period of time,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
because they don't encode vital
functions, or they may even be

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
sequences between genes that
don't encode phenotype at all.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Imagine, for example, we have a
situation were here we have a gene

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
which encodes a vital function,
like the eye, here's another gene

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that encodes another function,
oh I don't know, a leg.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And here we have intergenic
sequences. After all,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
as you have learned by now,
more than 96% of the DNA in our

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
genome, doesn't encode proteins,
and probably isn't even responsible

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
for regulating genes. So
these sequences, right in here,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
can mutate freely during the course
of evolution, without having a

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
deleterious effect on the
phenotype of the organism.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
There's no evolutionary pressure
to constrain the evolution of these

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
genes, but if this gene
over here encodes an eyes,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And if this gene has been
optimized in it's sequence,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
early in the course of evolution,
that any subsequently occurring

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
mutations will compromise it's
function, and therefore there's

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
enormous selective pressure to
eliminate any organism which has

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
begun to tinker with the sequence of
this gene, by changing it's sequence.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Here, in stark contrast, there's
no such selective pressure.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
The organism,
that is,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
can tinker at will with this.
I don't mean literally that the

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
organism is able to tinker
with it's own DNA sequences,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
but the hand of evolution can
change these sequences in here,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
at will, without having any effect
on the viability of the organism on

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
it's selective, or
Darwinian, fitness,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and therefore, such mutations
in these, in these sequences,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
are neutral mutation, they
have on effect on phenotype,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and they will not be
eliminated from the gene pool.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Again here, mutations in these
vital, critical genes will be

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
eliminated from the gene pool.
So that's another one of the

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
principles in molecular evolution
that we want to talk about.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And if you follow these
principles, we can not only do, draw

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
evolutionary trees like this,
which have a grand scope, a scale of

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
three and a half billion years,
we can talk, for example, about how

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
different kinds of bears
are related to one another,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and on the basis, once
again, of their DNA sequence.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Or, if you want, we can even
look at how different kinds of

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
domesticated animals are
related to one another.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
This is kind of a fun undertaking.
Look at this. Why is it fun? Well

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
it's, it's kind of an amusing idea,
how often were cows domesticated

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
during the history of humanity?
How often were sheep domesticated?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Pigs, water buffalos, and horses.
And what you see here is that cattle

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
were domesticated on two occasions,
probably once in Western Asia, the

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
middle east, and once in Eastern
Asia. Sheep were domesticated twice,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
all modern sheep following
these two families here.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Obviously they share a
common ancestor someway back,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
but most sheep either fall here
or here. Pigs seem to have been

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
domesticated twice, once
over here and once over here,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
water buffalos twice,
horses are very confusing,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
it looks like they were domesticated
on several occasions because they're

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
all over the map, they're
not two clusters of

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
closely-related varieties,
like here and here. What others,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
dogs, that's recently, I forget
what the number is for dogs, once.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Dogs were domesticated once,
probably the earliest domestication,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
about 100,000 years ago. They all
have one common radiating tree,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
here we have two radiating trees,
one cluster over here, one cluster

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000
over here, with sheep, pigs,
and so fourth. So we can even,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
so you can learn an enormous
amount about even the history of

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
agriculture, by looking at
these kinds of DNA pedigree.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Here's some other interesting
principles. Mitochondrial DNA

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
passes always from the mother, so
when a fertilized egg is formed,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Dad gives his chromosomes,
but he doesn't donate for any,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
doesn't donate any mitochondrial
DNA. I remember visiting a friend in

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
North Carolina in 1974,
and he was looking at the

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
mitochondrial DNA of mules and,
when you breed a horse and a donkey,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
what do you get out?
You get a mule out,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:18.000
or, what happens if you do it
the other way? What happens if the

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:24.000
father is a horse, and
the mother is a donkey?

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It's a hinny, it's actually called
a hinny. So there's two ways of

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
breeding, and the question is now,
and by the way, it's not so nice to

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
have a father being the horse
and the mother being the mule.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Why? Because Mom isn't used to
carrying an embryo that's much

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
larger than she's adapted to. The
other way is fine, because then

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
she can carry a small embryo, but
if Dad comes from a much larger

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
species, then the fetus that
the female donkey must carry,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
is larger than her womb
is really evolved to carry.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
So, you don't often see these
hinnies around because they cause

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
great difficulty at birth. In
any case, why did I get into

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
this digression?
Glad I asked that.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
The question was, where did
the mitochondrial DNA come?

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
1974, this was still a hot
question. And it turned out,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
the mitochondrial DNA in both the
mules and the hinnies came always

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000
from Mom. There was not a trace of
mitochondrial DNA from the father

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
and, as a consequence, this
begins to cause us to realize

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
where our mitochondrial DNA comes
from. So his mitochondrial DNA

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
comes from his mother,
his maternal grandmother,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
her mother, her mother before her,
and so fourth, and the same for each

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
one of you. And what
this means is that if you

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
look at a pedigree like this,
and for example, here we have a

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
mother and a father,
girls are always round,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
boys are square. And here
you'll see the mitochondrial DNA,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
it's donated to all of the children,
but the fact is that these boys,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000
when they mate, when
they have offspring,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000
they will no longer pass
along her mitochondrial DNA,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
so it will be lost. And the
only way the mitochondrial

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
DNA can be transmitted is
through one of her daughters,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
who in turn, have daughters.
Here you see the situation where

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
almost all of her mitochondrial
DNA is lost, except for this female

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
descendent who, once again,
passes it on to her sons

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and daughters.
Only the daughters,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
again, can transmit mitochondrial
DNA. And there is equity in life,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
it doesn't often happen. Jack
Kennedy said life is unfair,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
but sometimes it's reasonably fair,
but here is the y-chromosomes, the

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
y-counterpart. Keep in
mind, the y-chromosome only

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
passes from father-to-son, to
father-to-son, and exactly the

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000
same dynamics apply. And
importantly, this is critical

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
for our thinking now, neither
the y-chromosome nor the

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
mitochondrial DNA recombines
with another chromosome.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
And therefore, the complexities
of diploid mendelian genetics are

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
obviated. So when you're looking at,
for example, the mitochondrial DNA,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
you can look at the pure
results of accumulated mutations,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
You don't have to worry
about crossing-over,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
you don't have to worry about
exchange of portions of a gene

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
between two homologous chromosomes.
It doesn't happen with the

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
y-chromosome because there's
only one of them in the cell,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and it doesn't happen with the
mitochondrial DNA because there's no

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
other DNA for it to equilibrate
with. As a consequence,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
we can begin to think about what
happens with mitochondrial DNA and

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
y-chromosomal DNA, in
young and old species.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000
So let's talk about a
recently formed species,

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
and let's say we have a
young species down here,

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.000
below the illustration, and
now this species, which has

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
recently come into existence
for whatever reason,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
hangs around for the
next couple million years.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
And while it hangs around,
there will be random mutations,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
which strike the genomes of
individual members of that species.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And therefore, the longer
the life of the species

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
as a whole, the more genetically
diverse will become the individuals

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000
in the species, and
therefore, this species will

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
grow to have more and more genetic
diversity, just because of the

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
random stochastic mutations that
accumulate in different peoples

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
genomes in the course of the life of
this species, over millions of years.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Again, keep in mind that the
vast majority of these accumulated

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
mutations will be mutual mutations,
which will not affect phenotype, and

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
therefore, they will not be
eliminated by Darwinian selection.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
And many of these neutral mutations,
which have no effect on organismic

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
fitness, but are simply evolutionary
neutral, are sometimes called

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
polymorphisms. The
term polymorphism,

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000
-morph is once again morphology,
derives from the fact that species

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
tend to be polymorphic, we
don't all have blond hair,

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
we don't all have brown
eyes. We, as a species,

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
have a great variability in
phenotype, we're polymorphic,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
and yet having black hair,
and having blond hair,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
and having red hair, none of
those is considered mutant,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
none of those is
considered pathological. I.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
., among the group of normal
phenotypes, there's a whole series

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000
of different gradations, and
these are considered normal

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
gradations in phenotype,
but at the genetic level,

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
we talk about polymorphisms
in the same sense.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Genetically distinct nucleotide
sequences, which again,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
are not pathological, they don't
create a disadvantageous phenotype.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
And as a consequence, they are
once again, not selected against.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Now look what happens over
here. Here we have great genetic

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
diversity, but what will happen is,
for one reason or another, only a

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
small subset of individuals
constituting this species,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
will turn out to be the ancestors
of the successor species.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Here's the next species that arises.
And why will these just be the

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
ancestors? Well, everybody
else could get killed off

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
through some plague, they
might get killed off by

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
somebody going out and
purposefully killing them, or,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.000
it might just be that a meteor comes
down and wipes all these guys out,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
and these are the only ones in
here, from this small subset of the

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000
original species,
who end up surviving,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
and who end up becoming the
precursors, the ancestors,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
of the new species, and once
again, undergoes a period of

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
diversification. And
what we have therefore,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
is a diversification and then
a collapse of genetic diversity.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Here, this species, because
it came from a small group,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
is initially rather, rather
homogenous genetically,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000
but with the passage of
evolutionary time, once again,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
there's evolutionary diversification.
So, an older species actually ends

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
up being much more genetically
diverse than does the

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
younger species. If you
look at two chimpanzees

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
living on opposite sides of
the same hill in West Africa,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
they are genetically far more
distantly related to one another,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
than any one of us, by a factor
of 10 to 15. Two chimpanzees,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
they look exactly the same, they
have the same peculiar habits,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
but they're genetically far more
distantly-related than we are to

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
one-another, than I am to any one
of you, or than any one of you is to

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
one another. And
what does that mean?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
It means that,
roughly speaking,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
the species of chimpanzees is, at
least, 10 or 15 times older than

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000
our species are.
We're a young species,

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000
chimpanzees probably first speciated
three or four million years ago,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
if the paleontological record is,
is accurate. Paleontology is the

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
study of old, dusty bones, so
you can begin to imagine when

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:18.000
chimpanzee bones become
recognizable in the earth.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
So a paleontologist says that,
that chimps aren't that old, and it

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000
begins to suggest that our
species is only about 200,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
00 years old, at the oldest. Now
you say 200,000 years is a long

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
time, but it isn't so long because
I started out this discussion talking

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
about 3.5 billion years,
3.5 times ten to the ninth,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
and now I'm talking about
two times ten to the fourth.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Is that right? No, two
times ten to the fifth.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Four orders of magnitude difference.
So that means that our species, we

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000
went through a bottleneck
about 200-250,000 years ago,

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:04.000
and because that is so recent, we
haven't had a chance to actually

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
acquire much genetic diversity.
We're actually very closely related

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
to one another, although
to talk to people,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
you'd think we were all very
distantly related to one another.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Here's another interesting notion,
which also figures in, and that is,

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.000
what happens in the genetics
of small populations?

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
So here we started out with eight
individuals, and let's assume for a

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
moment, that this population
has a steady size, i.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
. it doesn't increase or decrease
over the course of several

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
generations. And what that
means is that each couple will,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
on average, leave behind two
children, and those two children

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
will breed, and each of them will,
couples in the successor population,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
will leave behind two children.
And what you see already,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
in such small populations, is
that for example, this male here

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
has two girls,
and right away,

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
to the extent he had an interesting
y-chromosome, that y-chromosome was

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
lost from the gene pool. This
girl, here, had an interesting

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
mitochondrial DNA, but
right away that's lost,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
because she has, she has just
two boys. And what you see,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
in very rapid order, in
small populations, there's a

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
homogenization of the genetic
compliment, just because the alleles

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
are lost within what's
called, genetic drift.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And as a consequence,
very rapidly, there becomes

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
homozygosity at many loci
in very small populations.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
A real-life situation comes
from Mutiny on the Bounty,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
where Fletcher Christian ends
up getting shipwrecked on,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
what island was it, Pitcairn Island,
which is somewhere on the South

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Pacific, South Atlantic, I
forget where. Anyhow, today if

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
you go to Pitcairn Island,
almost everybody is called,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
almost everybody has a
family name, Christian.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Why? Was it that he was more studly
and fecund than everybody else?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Probably not. What probably
happened was, in the same dynamics

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
that dictates the
homogenization of y-chromosomes,

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
dictates the homogenization
of family names. So,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
if you isolate people in a
small demographic isolate,

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
like an island in the middle of the
ocean, over a period of generations,

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
roughly equal to, I think, twice the
number of individuals in the steady,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
state population, everybody
will have the same family name,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
because the other family names will,
by chance, in a small population,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
just be lost. On my
father's side of the family,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I have hundreds of cousins with my
family name, and on my mother's side

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
of the family,
not a single one,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
just as an example of this kind of
trait. Now keep in mind that this

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
evolutionary diversification
can also affect the y-chromosome,

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
so therefore, there are different
y-chromosomes across the face of the

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
planet, which can be distinguished,
not because they're better or lesser

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
y-chromosomes, in terms
of the phenotype of

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
maleness, but because they've
accumulated polymorphisms

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
over a period of time. They
may be single-nucleotide

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
polymorphisms, but
these single-nucleotide

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
polymorphisms can be used
to determine how closely,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
or distantly related, are
individuals to one another.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Let's look at the mitochondrial
DNA of women in western Europe,

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:33.000
and if you look at the mitochondrial
DNA of women in western Europe,

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
you find that they only have,
how many different things there?

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, there's seven basic

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
types of mitochondrial DNA that
are found in western and northern

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
European women. And
what that means is,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
inescapably, people who
live in modern-day Europe,

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
descend from seven women who had
these respective mitochondrial DNA

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
sequences. When did those
seven ancestors live,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:10.000
well we don't really know, probably
between 10-15,000 years ago.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
But, the western-European
population descends from an

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
stunningly small
number of founders.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Now clearly, DNA sequencing is
terrific, but it's not good enough

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
to know the names of those women,
so I can tell you that they were not

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
named Velda and Jasmine.
[LAUGHTER] Anyhow, but here you

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
can see, here you can, now
obviously, these women in turn

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
were related to one another, you
can ask, you can do another kind

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
of question. How much are all of
our mitochondrial DNA are related to

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
one another, how distantly
related are they to one another,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
given the rate of evolution
of mitochondrial DNA sequences?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
And if you ask that question,
the answer is that we all had a

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
common ancestress who lived
about 150,000 years ago.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000
All of us trace our mitochondrial
DNA to her. Does that mean that

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
there was only one woman alive there,
she's called, Mitochondrial-Eve,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
again, we don't know her name. Does
that mean there was only one woman

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
alive, well it doesn't mean that at
all because of what I just told you,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:20.000
in small populations the
proto-human population.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I just told you that certain
polymorphisms die out because of

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
this genetic drift, because
of these stochastic events.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000
And so, the founding human
population could have had 20,

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
50,100 individuals in it, but one
woman's mitochondrial DNA happened

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
because of these accidents
to dominate, so that now,

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
all of us have the same,
are the descendents of her

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
mitochondrial DNA. Clearly,
in the intervening time

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
since 150,000 years ago,
accumulated mutations have,

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
have altered subtly the
mitochondrial DNA genome,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000
so there's polymorphisms,
And so one can make,

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000
one can drive phylogenies of
different kinds of mitochondrial DNA,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
and look at the relatedness
between different clades,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
different groups, of
women in modern-day Europe.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000
70% of Finish men, in
Finland, have a y-chromosome

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
polymorphism that is otherwise
virtually unheard of in the rest of

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Europe. 70% of Finish men,
now what does that mean?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Well, to me to means that those
70% of Finish men descended from a

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
common ancestor, a
male who lived around,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000
if you look at the sequences,
who lived around two or three

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.000
thousand years ago, and
who, for some reason,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000
became the ancestor of all the
people living in modern Finland.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
That's extraordinary. There's four
million people living in Finland

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
today, and the males all have their
inherit, inherit their y-chromosome

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
from that man, we don't
know exactly where he lived,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:01.000
But obviously
the modern Finish

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
population descends from a very
small founder-group who came into

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
what we call, modern Finland,
relatively recently, maybe two-two

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
and a half thousand years ago,
and thereafter, did not freely

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
interbreed with the rest
of the European population.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
How do we know that?
Because that y-chromosomal

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
polymorphism is not present
elsewhere, it's only present in

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Finland. So it was a genetic,
and obviously linguistic, isolate.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
So where do we
all come from,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
all of us human beings? How closely
related are we to one another?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Here's, here's a measurement of
the distances between different

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
mitochondrial DNA's from
different branches of humanity.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
And what you see is something
really quite extraordinary and

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
stunning. Here, you'll
see that the people,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
the non-African lineages here
and here, are actually relatively

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
closely related to one another.
But if you look at the people who

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000
live in Africa, down here,
there is enormous genetic

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.000
diversity. Look how far these
evolutionary branches reach back,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
look how long these are. The
distance of these branches,

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
of these roots, determines how
far, how distantly related these

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
individuals are,
one to the other.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
And on the basis of that, and
on the basis of a lot of other

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
auxiliary genetic information, we
can conclude that Africa was the

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
site where genetic diversification
was generated during

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000
human evolution. And
that what happened,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
as a consequence of
that diversification,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
is starting over the last 40,
50, 60,000 years ago, different

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
populations, different sub-populations,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
small, isolated sub-populations,
migrated out of Africa, took a very

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
small sub-set of the polymorphisms
with them, and became the

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
founder-populations of a whole
variety of whole different

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
modern-day populations. These
populations here are largely

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Mongoloid, these populations
here are largely Caucasian,

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
and here, we see that in
Africa there's enormous genetic

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
diversity.
And by the way,

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
all the genes that are present here,
the alleles that are present here,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
can also be found in Africa, but
in relatively small proportions

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
in Africa. And we know this kind
of diversity exists both for the

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000
mitochondrial DNA, and here's
for the y-chromosomal DNA,

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000
again, we look for polymorphisms.
And this is not a very good

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
overhead, again, the
reproduction was not very good,

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
but what I'm showing you is that
the evolutionary, the depth of these

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
evolutionary branches is enormous
in Africa, yet in other parts of the

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
globe, people are much more
closely-related to one another.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Some people argue on the basis of
the genetic-relatedness of western

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
and northern Europeans, that
the modern European population

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
is largely descended from about 20
couples that moved into Europe about

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
10,000 years ago, eight
to ten thousand years ago,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
at the time when agriculture was
introduced into Europe from the

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
middle east, just on the basis
of looking at these y-chromosomal

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
sequences. And so,
we human beings arose,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
even though we are reasonably
distantly related to one another on

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
this graph, keep in mind that we as
a species, are enormously close to

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
one another because of the
youth of this, of our species.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
If you look at our, the time of
this diversification was probably

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000
sometime between 80-100, 00
years ago, so how did it all

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
happen? We can even figure out the
history of humanity by beginning to

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:42.000
look at these different
kinds of polymorphisms.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000
A long time ago, individuals
went out from Africa,

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000
maybe starting 100,000 years
ago, maybe starting more recently,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
and went across the southern rim
of Eurasia, and we know already,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
we find archeological remains of
Aborigines in Australia between

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
40-60,000 years ago. And
by the way, those people are

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
very distantly related to the
rest of us, having left and not

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
intermingled with the rest
of humanity for a very long

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
period of time. There were
Aborigines in Australia,

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
already at a time when our ancestors,
to the extent we had ancestors in

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Europe, were still battling the
Neanderthals, who only died out 30,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
00 years ago. You may know by
the way, you may have read in the

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
newspaper, about a month ago,
they discovered skeletons of very

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000
small people on an island Indonesia.
In fact, those were probably not

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
even homosapiens, those
were probably a precursor

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
species, because we know over
the last two million years,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
there have been hominoids,
look like human beings but are

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
precursors, who might migrated out
of Africa, who dispersed throughout

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Asia, and who eventually
became extinct,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
So that the only modern human who
exist are the descendents of this

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
out migration that began about 100,
00 years ago. We know that about 15,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
00 years ago some of these
people ended up going over here,

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000
to crossing in four different waves
of migration, you can see it from

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
the DNA, into the
western hemisphere.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Amerindians, that is, American
Indians, Native Americans,

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000
are genetically rather homogenous.
Why? Because they all descend from

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
very small founder populations that
came into the western hemisphere

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
relatively recently. And
there's enormous genetic

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
homogeneity among different
subgroups of individuals here in

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
South America. Speaking
of South America,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
if you look in some parts of
Venezuela, what you find is that the

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
mitochondrial DNA is
largely of Indian-origin,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
but the y-chromosomal DNA is
largely of European origin.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
So, what happens there, that's
a testimonial to the tragic

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
fate of the Indians, where
the conquistadors from Spain

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
came in, killed all the men, and
took all the women, to be their

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
brides. How else can you explain
the fact that there's no Indian

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
y-chromosomes, there's
all, there is instead only

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
European y-chromosomes. And
here you can begin to see what

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
happened here in New York, as
well. 40,000 years ago people

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
started trickling into Europe,
and they hung around there for the

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
next 30,000 years,
pretty much on their own.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:30.000
The remnants of those people
who came in, we know from DNA,

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
are the Basques who live in
northern Spain, who speak,

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
by the way, a non-indo
European language.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
They're the relics of this initial
settlement by modern humans of

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Europe, starting 40, 00
years ago. And they had the

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
continent for themselves
for the next 30,000 years,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
until this new founder
population came in, about 10,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
00 years ago. Here's the names of
the girls who were in that group,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Ursula and Katrine and Zenya, Tara,
Jasmine, and Velda, and they became

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
the modern agriculturalists, and
swamped out the people who were

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:08.000
there 40,000 years ago, who
now only survive as a relic

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
population. Here's a
fun story I like to tell

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
each year, and it's about
the Cohen and y-chromosome,

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
and you'll see what an amusing
story this is, just from genetics.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Now the name Cohen, in
Hebrew means, a high priest,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
and you've heard people named Cohen,
it's not such an uncommon name among

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:34.000
the Jews. And it says, in the
Bible, in Genesis and Exodus,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
that all the high priests in the
Bible are the descendents of Aaron,

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000
the brother of Moses. And
it's also been the practice for

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
the last 3,000 years, that
the only person who can become,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
the only male who can become
a Cohen, is the son of a Cohen.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000
In other words, you cannot be
adopted into a family and acquire

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
the name Cohen. And
if that's all true,

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
and if the Bible is true, and
Aaron lived 3,000 years ago,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
whatever his name was, then it
should be the case that all male

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Cohen's should have the
same y-chromosome, right?

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Because they all descend,
their family name is Cohen,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
they could only get it from their
father, they could only get their

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
y-chromosome from their father,
so they should all have the same

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
y-chromosome. Of course, you
say that can't really be the

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
case, because we know in
this country, in this country,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.000
between five and ten percent
of people, on average,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:40.000
are sending Father's Day
cards to the wrong person.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
What does that
mean? Non-paternity.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:48.000
When you do genetic counseling
of family these days,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:53.000
one of the strictures is, that
you never tell the family if

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
the children have genetic
polymorphisms that don't match that

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
of the person whom they think is
their father. They don't look like

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
their, the person whom they regard
as father, but that's always assumed

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
to be a role of the genetic dice.
So, how is that relevant? Well,

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
let's talk about this descent from
Aaron, who lived 3,000 years ago.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
We're talking about the y-chromosome
being passed from one generation to

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.000
the next, just like the family name.
So what happened, what would happen

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
if sometime over the last 3, 00
years, Mrs. Cohen had a dalliance,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
had an affair, with a
television repairman,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
or the milkman, or the mailman,
and never told Mr. Cohen? The

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
y-chromosome, which her son
thought he was getting from Dad,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
wouldn't be coming from Dad,
it'd be coming from this other,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
the milkman or the mailman, and
it wouldn't be a Cohen-y chromosome

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
unless, by chance, the
mailman or the milkman also

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
happened to be a Cohen,
[LAUGHTER], it could happen.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
But the chances are, roughly
speaking, Cohen's are only

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
four percent of all Jews, so
the chances are against that

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
happening. OK, so they
did this experiment,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
and this is really astounding
experiment. They went,

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
the story is they went to a beach in
Tel Aviv, I don't know whether they

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
actually did that or not, and
they picked up, they picked up

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
100 male Cohen's who were Ashkenazi
, Ashkenazi means their ancestors came

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
from central Europe, over here.
And they picked up 100 Sefardi

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Cohen's, and the Sefardi
Cohen's come from Spain,

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
North Africa, Egypt, Yemen,
Iraq, Iran, Uzbekistan,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Central Asia. And the last time
that the Iraqi Cohen's and the

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Ashkenazi Cohen's were
interbreeding, were about 500 BC,

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
at the time of the Babylonian XL,
so they've been apart a long time.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
And they looked at
their y-chromosomes,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
and what they found was that 70%
of the y-chromosomes of these male

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Cohen's, 70% of the Cohen's
shared the same y-chromosome.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
Well, the same y-chromosome was
present only in 15% of non-Cohen,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Israeli Jews. Now think about that
for a second. 70% of these men had

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
the same y-chromosome, of
course they didn't know they had

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
the same y-chromosome, all
they knew was that they had the

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
same family name.
And what that means,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000
inescapably, is that over a period
of two or three thousand years,

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
it was hard to trace with exactitude
when the common male ancestor lived,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
over a period of two
or three thousand years,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
somehow the milkman and the
mailman stayed away from Mrs.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Cohen, or Mrs. Cohen
was unusually virtuous.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Because keep in mind, any
single affair with the milkman

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
or the mailman,
over 3,000 years,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
would've broke this chain of
inheritance, any single incidence of

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
non-paternity. It's a
really astounding story,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
and it's hard, there
can be no artifact to it,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000
there's no bias in it, there's
no other way to explain it.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
And you can begin to find similar
stories of families in England,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
where males are tenth cousins of one
another, they have the same family

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
name, and they also have
the same y-chromosome.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:17.000
The most amusing commentary on this
stems from a tribe that lives in

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
southern Africa, and
these people are called,

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Lemba, L-e-m-b-a. And the, the myth
of the Lemba is that they descend

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
from Jews who came down from
the north, Jewish traitors.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
So just for the hell of it, some
geneticists went down and drew

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
blood from the male Lembas, and
there's four casts of Lembas,

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
there's the ruling class, there's
the warriors, there's the farmers,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
the merchants, I don't know.
And what they found was that all

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000
members of the, almost
all members of the ruling

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000
cast among the Lembas,
had the same y-chromosome,

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
and the y-chromosome had exactly
the same polymorphisms of the Cohen

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
y-chromosome. No one in the other,
no males in the other three casts

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
had, or very few, had
otherwise this y-chromosomal

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
polymorphism. Go figure, I
don't know what's going on.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Now did those people look Jewish?
Well, they looked like everybody

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
else around them,
because if there was a Mr.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Cohen who came down there,
three or four hundred years ago,

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.000
and married in, he obviously
married one of the local population.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:30.000
And there were no other people
around from, coming in from the

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
north, to marry to, so that
99% of the males in this

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
ruling cast, who have the Cohen
y-chromosome, 99% of their genes

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000
come from the local population,
the only thing they inherited from

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000
Mr. Cohen was the y-chromosome.
Where else would they get their

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000
genes? There wasn't a massive
migration from the middle east down

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
to the Lemba tribes, probably
just one man came down

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
selling trinkets,
or who-knows-what,

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:00.000
television sets, or VCRs, sometime
over the last three or four

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
hundred years. And
somehow, for reasons that we

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:08.000
have no idea, he became the ancestor
of this cast of people in this tribe

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
in the middle of Africa. And
so you have stories that you

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.000
begin to pick up, which
are stranger than fiction,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.000
some of the weirdest stories that
you've ever heard of in your life.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Imagine having 3,000 years of
uninterrupted transmission from,

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.000
without a single
case of non-paternity.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
It didn't happen all the cases,
because I didn't say 100% of the

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Cohen men had it, on
30% of the occasions,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
there must have been some snipping
of this chain of transmission.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:52.000
And keep in mind that this chain of
transmission happened over a period

00:47:52.000 --> 00:48:04.000
of enormous political and upheaval,
over the last 3,000 years. The

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:17.000
middle east, and Europe, and
North Africa, have not been

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:29.000
tranquil places over that period of
time. Enormous population dispersal,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:42.000
and confusion,
and displacement,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:54.000
and yet we now begin to look, by
looking at the DNA, we can begin

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:07.000
to see all kinds of
really interesting things.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Next, on Friday, Eric is
going to talk with you,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
I believe, on Monday, as well. And
Wednesday, we're going to talk about

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000
a related topic,
which is, how do all,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:25.000
how do these human genetic
differences have implications for

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
the way we think about one another,
and the way that we will develop?

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000
See you then, a
week from today.

DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.130
In this problem, what
I'd like us to do

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.860
is I'd like us to sketch the
graphs, in three dimensions,

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.180
of these functions.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.370
So z here is a
function of x and y.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.210
On this second one, z is
also a function of x and y.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.060
It just happens
not to depend on y.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.510
When you graph these, I'd
suggest to consider slices,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.380
so what happens if you
consider x equals 0

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.320
or if you consider z equals 0.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.290
As you graph these, let's
see what you can do.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.850
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.690
and I'll check back
with you in a moment,

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.533
and I can show you
how I solved these.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:53.790
OK, welcome back.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.040
So why don't we start by
looking at this function:

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.410
z is the square root of
x squared plus y squared.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.050
OK, I'll try to always draw
my axes in the same way

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.890
as we do in lecture.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.340
So x is pointing towards us,
y to the right, and z up.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.604
So as I suggested,
I think a nice way

00:01:29.604 --> 00:01:31.020
to get started
with these problems

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.610
is to just try setting the
variables x and y variously

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.137
equal to 0, and then
seeing-- instead

00:01:38.137 --> 00:01:40.220
of a surface in that case,
then we'll get a curve,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.920
and we'll see what curve we get.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.740
So for instance, if
we set x equals to 0,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.660
then we just get z is the
square root of y squared,

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.610
so we just get that z is
the absolute value of y.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.880
So what that means is that
whatever this surface looks

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.870
like, we know what it
looks like if we slice it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.170
in the blackboard, in the
plane of the blackboard.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.120
We know that it just
looks like-- this

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.030
is just the graph of the
function absolute value of y, z

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.500
equals absolute value of y.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.140
So now, if you think about it,
what I just said works just

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.750
as well for x instead of for y.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.420
So if we were to graph
this in the xz-plane

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.490
where we set y equals to
0, then we would get-- OK,

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.780
I'm going to try to draw this.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.260
So let me draw that
in blue, actually.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:48.590
So the blue is in the
xz-plane and the white

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.400
is in the yz-plane.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.850
OK, now I think what's going
to be really illustrative

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:01.380
is if we think about what
happens as we fix values of z.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.040
Well, obviously, if
we set z equals to 0,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.534
then there's just one solution,
which is this point here.

00:03:08.534 --> 00:03:09.950
But what's going
to be interesting

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.050
is if we set z to be
some positive value.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.940
So, for instance,
let's take z to be 2.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.310
So, for instance,
we set z equals 2,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.030
then we get 2 equals
the square root

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.720
of x squared plus y squared.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.680
Solving this, this is the
same as saying x squared

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.890
plus y squared equals 4.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.930
So what that tells us is that
at the height z equals 2,

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.270
we're just going to have
a circle of radius 2.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.800
This is just the equation
for a circle of radius 2,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.379
and so at height 2,
we just have a circle.

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.920
And actually, as
you can see, there's

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.340
nothing special about 2.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.640
At every height, we're just
going to have a circle,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.285
and so this is
what's called a cone.

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:00.785
OK.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.780
Now for b, we can expect,
when we go over here

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.730
to b, that something
funny is going to happen

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.180
because it doesn't depend on y.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.480
So let's see if we can
see how the fact that z

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.490
doesn't depend on y, how
this enters into our picture.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:28.480
So I'll just walk over
here, and we'll consider z

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.365
equals x squared.

00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:29.865
OK.

00:04:34.648 --> 00:04:42.810
So again, we have our
x-axis, x, y, and z axes.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.290
Now, let's consider
what this looks

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.490
like when we intersect
with the xz-plane,

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.470
so when we set y equals to 0.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.090
Well, setting y
equal to 0 actually

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.770
doesn't change the equation,
and we get z equals x squared.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:56.740
So we know what that looks like.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.406
It's a parabola.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.630
And this parabola, I want you
to think that it's, you know,

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.250
coming out at us, so
it's in the xz-plane,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.480
going in and out of the board.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.230
But now if you
think about it, what

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.251
it means to say that this
function doesn't depend on y,

00:05:16.251 --> 00:05:18.500
what that means is that we
have the exact same picture

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.800
at every value of y.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:24.670
So if we go out here, then we're
going to have the same picture.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.047
And if we go over here, we're
going to have the same picture.

00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:30.630
And, in fact, what
you're going to get

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.921
is you're going to get a prism.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.440
Oh, that's really hard to read.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:47.547
Let's see if we
can-- so let me--

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.380
since that's a bit hard
to read on the axes,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.820
let's draw this again.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.210
What we'll get is
we're going to have

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:01.410
a prism, which looks
like a parabola,

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.570
looks like a sheet
that's just stretched out

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.090
in the shape of a parabola.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:13.980
And so, this we could call
a prism of a parabola.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.390
Now let's see if we can get
any more insight from these two

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.400
pictures.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.110
So look what happened
in this instance.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:33.140
So here, the function z, it
obviously didn't depend on y.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.880
And we can see that by
looking at the graph,

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.697
because, you know,
as you vary y,

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:39.030
the picture had to be unchanged.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.630
So the fact that this was
a prism in y and the fact

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.160
that the function didn't depend
on y are one and the same fact.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.700
Now if we go over
to the cone-- OK,

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.300
so here, our function z very
much depended on both x and y.

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:05.590
But you notice that it depended
on x and y only in the sense--

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:12.770
so z is actually equal
just to the radius r, which

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.990
is x squared plus y squared.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.470
So the fact that this cone--
thank you-- the square root

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.905
of x squared plus y squared.

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:27.740
So the fact that
this only depends

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.790
on the radius and not the
relative angle of x and y

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.550
is why we got what--
this is an example

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.220
of a surface of revolution.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.910
So we can always expect
that if the dependence

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.160
of z on the variables x
and y, if you can actually

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.740
just rewrite that as a
dependence on r, then

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.060
you'll get this nice
radial symmetry,

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:49.120
just like we had translational
symmetry for the prism.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.171
And I think I'll
leave it at that.

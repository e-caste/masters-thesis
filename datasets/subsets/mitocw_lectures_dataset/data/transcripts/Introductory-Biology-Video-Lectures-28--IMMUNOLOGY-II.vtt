WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, we're going to finish now by
just talking more about this amazing

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
immune system we have,
the adaptive immune system.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
As I said on Friday, this is really
an astonishing recognition system

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that just plays a key role in us
being able to survive in this world

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that's full of bacteria,
and yeast, and fungi, and viruses,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
parasites.
There are things just all the time

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
trying to do us in,
and the reason we don't succumb is

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because we have this amazing immune
system.  And there are several

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
features about it which I summarized
the other day.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
One is its diversity.
It has this incredible ability to

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
recognize entities,
including things that are

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
synthesized in a lab that had never
been seen on Earth before.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's amazing in terms of that side
of it.  Coupled with this is this

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
incredible specificity.
As I indicated the other day,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
for example, if it was seeing a
benzene ring with a methyl on it,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
it might be able to recognize this,
but it could tell the difference

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
from having the methyl over here.
It's got that level of

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
sophistication.
In spite of that,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in spite of the fact that it can
recognize everything else,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
it's able to  avoid self recognition,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which is a bit of a trick if you

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
think about it,
that you have a system that's able

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to see essentially anything,
including things that never existed

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
before.  And how does it avoid
seeing all of our molecules,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and all the many, many things that
makes us up?  So,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
it has to be able to tell self from
non-self.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And then, I also talked about this
memory aspects of the immune system,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that if you get exposed to a virus
or bacterium or something,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but the first immune response is
relatively weak.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But then if you get subsequently
exposed, you get a very powerful

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
response.  And that's the principle
of a vaccine.  If you think someone

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
is going to be exposed to chickenpox
but they haven't had it,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
if you could somehow elicit the
initial response without making them

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
sick by using a killed virus or
something like that;

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
polio is one of the examples you
hear about in the paper right at the

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
moment.  Then,
if someone does encounter that virus

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
or that bacterium,
because that's second response,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
it's very quick and it's very
powerful, and that's what vaccines

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
are all about.
So, the issue,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I guess, today is how does that
happen?  And this is one of these

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
amazing insights into biology that's
come by an application of all these

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
tools, recombinant DNA,
and sequencing, and all the fancy

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
sort of things we've been talking
about in the past few lectures.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So, the first part I need to let you
know, is there are two parts to this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
immune response, or two
kinds of responses.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:40.000
One's called the humoral response

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and one's called the cellular
response.  And this takes place in

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
the plasma of your blood.
So, in the liquid part of the blood

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
if you spin down the red cells and
the white cells,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
what you're left with is the plasma.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And, what this humoral response
response does,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it's able to target bacteria,
viruses, proteins.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And the recognition is done by a

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000
special kind of protein called
antibodies.  And I'll tell you about

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that in just a moment because
they're a very important class of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
protein in this Earth.
And the cellular immune response is

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
carried out by a special kind of
white blood cell.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:15.000
For this lecture I think I'll just

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
abbreviate those as WBC if I need it.
What this targets is not the actual

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
pathogen itself.
But it targets cells that are

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
infected with a virus or a bacterium,
etc. and that might seem to be even

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
a little bit more of a trick.
It's hard enough probably to figure

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
out how to take something that's an
entity like a virus that's floating

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
around your blood and figure out how
to find something that binds to it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
What do you do if the thing's gone
into one of your own cells and it's

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
hiding out in their replicating in
the same way that,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000
let's say, a phage does or something
like that

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
How do you see one of your own cells
that's been infected by something

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000
like that?  And there is a special
type of cells called cytotoxic T

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:27.000
cell that's very important.
It's often abbreviated as that.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So let me first say a word about
antibodies.  These are proteins that

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000
consist of four polypeptide chains.
Two of the chains are bigger.  So

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000
they're called heavy chains.
There's two of those.  And there

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
are two chains that are smaller,
so those are usually called light

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000
chains.  So, there's four
of them altogether.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And, ignoring secondary structure
and stuff for the moment,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
let me just sort of give you an idea
of how these are laid out.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:23.000
These are the two heavy chains.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And these are joined together by
disulfide bridges.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
You remember disulfide bridges?
If you had two cystines they can

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
form a covalent bond between them
under oxidizing conditions.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So, those heavy chains are locked
together.  They're actually

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
physically covalently joined.
In fact, there's the light chains

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
here.  So, this is the light.
And this part up here is highly

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
variable between different
antibodies.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And the part down here is constant
between antibodies.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And it's this huge amount of
variability that the body produces

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
many, many, many types of antibodies,
and then figures out which ones will

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
work to find the particular entity
it's trying to recognize.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And I'll come back and tell you in
a moment how that is done.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
There is a diagram of what I showed
you, but of course these are

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
proteins.  They have
three-dimensional structures,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and so if you were to look at them
with the secondary structure showing,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000
you can see the different,
especially here, a lot of beta

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
sheets should be leaping
out at you.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Now, the part where the recognition
is done is up at this end.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, it's essentially right here.
And here's a little movie.  You

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
could see how the thing looks in
three dimensional space.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
You see the part that's over on the
left at the moment; that's the light

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
chain and the blue chain is that
part of the heavy chain complex with

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the light chain.
And here is the,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
it's been tilted up this way so this
is the yellow and blue part

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
you were looking at
And the recognition pocket is right

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
at the end of that.
And at this picture,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
it's showing how a particular
protein was shown in red.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
This is an anti-body that can very,
very precisely recognize that

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
particular protein.
You can't really tell it from the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
three-dimensional shape shown on the
left because it just shows the

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
secondary structure.
But, if you could see the full

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
space filling model,
you'd be amazed.  The surfaces are

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
absolutely complementary.
It goes back to one of those

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
principles I've said over and over
and over again that so much of

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
biology works by having
complementary surfaces.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And there's a little movie you
could see how this thing is setting

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
up there at the top.
So, these antibodies are produced

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
by a special type of what
are called B cells.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:46.000
These are cells that play roles in
the humoral part of the immune

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:59.000
system.  And they're called plasma
cells.  And each plasma cell makes

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:08.000
one particular antibody.
And that's it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So you have many different types of
plasma cells, but each one only

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
expresses one particular gene that
encodes one particular antibody.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So, for years, this is something
that people struggled with just

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
conceptually.  They could sort of
calculate that there were so many

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
antibodies that if your entire
genome was nothing but antibody

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
genes, we still wouldn't have enough
DNA to account for all this ability

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to recognize things.
So, some other principle had to be

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
involved.  And there are all sorts
of speculations about what it was.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I had shown you, I'd managed to not
get Bob Horvitz's thing on here,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but this then, who is our fourth
Nobel laureate,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I've been sort of working through
these.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Susumu Tonegawa,
who is in the cancer center,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
he's in the biology department.
He's also heading, now, this

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Picower Center of learning and
memory.  So, since doing this work

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I'm telling you about on the immune
system, he's gone to do some

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
wonderful stuff more on the big
problem of how we learn,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and trying to get more molecular
insights into that process.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
But what Susumu managed to figure
out was that this variation and

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
diversity in the immune system was,
at its roots, a combinatorial sort

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:48.000
of process.  So,
if you look in the DNA of a zygote,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000
so that's the fertilized egg.  We're
just getting started with one of our

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
cells.  You've got a single cell.
We're looking in the DNA to see

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000
what would happen.
We come to the part of the DNA

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that's involved in producing
antibodies.  What he found was that

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
if you looked along the DNA,
there were sequences that looked

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
like part of the stuff that you'd
find in antibodies,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
but there were a whole series of
them.  So, he called this particular

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
segment V1, V2,
V3, up to VN.  There were a whole

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
set of these basically side by side
by side by side.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:42.000
There are about 300 of these in
humans.  And then down the DNA a

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:51.000
little bit he found another set of
sequences that are all variations of

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:01.000
each other.  And these were given D1,
D2, D3, D4, up to DN.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And there are many of these.
And then down the DNA a little

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
farther, there were three other
sections that were called joining

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:20.000
segments.  They were called J1,
J2, J3.  And a little bit farther

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
down there was a block of DNA coding
the constant part of this

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.000
polypeptide chain that goes
into an antibody.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And what Susumu Tonegawa was able to
show, and this led to the Nobel

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Prize.  So, what happens during the
development of these B cells is

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
there are rearrangements.
And a lot of DNA is thrown around.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And the basic strategy is to take,
if you think this as being column A,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
you take one from column A, one from
column B, just picking them randomly,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
one from column C over here,
and throw away everything else.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:11.000
So you might have,
for example, in one B cell,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
you might have V32, D15, J2,
and then the constant region.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And, what's in between is an intron
that will be spliced out at the time

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:45.000
that the gene's expressed.
In another B cell, you might

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:58.000
have V11, D22, J3.
So, this rearrangement is random in

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:05.000
the sense of which V segment is
chosen, which D segment is chosen,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and which J segment.  I don't mean
that it all just joins together in a

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:19.000
completely uncontrolled way.
And then the rest of the DNA is

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:34.000
deleted.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:47.000
So a consequence of this,
is each B cell expresses only one

00:16:47.000 --> 00:17:00.000
antibody.  It's true that they're
diploid, but only one chromosome

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000
is expressed.
So that's how they avoid,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:19.000
you can imagine they might make to
two.  But they only make one.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:27.000
In the process, as you can see,
that part is random.  Furthermore,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:36.000
the joining events are what I think
you could call sloppy.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And this leads to even more
variation than you would have

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:48.000
imagined simply looking at the
number of segments.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So, what this part of the process
does is it explains why the system

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
can be has the diversity it has,
because it's using this

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
combinatorial process.
If you know the number you can

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
calculate how many possible
combinations there are.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But then there's much more
variation because when it joins

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
together a little segments that are
joined are done in a sloppy way so

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
that the DNA sequence that shows up
where the joints occur doesn't look

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
like anything that was in the DNA at
all.  It was something like a

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
polymerase that wasn't very faithful
copying and making mistakes

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
as it went along.
So what the system does,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
is it doesn't get you a response.
It just explains why there is so

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
much diversity,
and why it is that I can go into the

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
lab and synthesize a compound that's
never been on this earth before,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
inject a rabbit to it, and the
rabbit will probably produce an

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
antibody that's able to recognize
that.  That's because it's made this

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
whole set of them.
And they all are going to have

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
somewhat different surfaces.
And they make so many that one of

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
those surfaces is going to fit the
molecule that I'm testing.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
You can sort of see,
that's only part of the trick.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So, how do you now get an immune
response?  Because you've got

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
millions of these things.
But what you now need is a whole

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
lot of one particular antibody
that's going to recognize the

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
pathogen that you are being exposed
to.  And the principle of that is

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
really cute.  It's a process called
clonal selection.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And the idea is that each

00:19:44.000 --> 00:20:01.000
B cell displays

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
a sample of its antibody on  its
surface.  So, we might think of it

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
this sort of way,
that after this process is through

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000
we have one B cell.
Of course, these are way out of

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
proportion.  The cells would be huge,
and these would be molecules.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
So, they're small.  But here would
be an antibody that can recognize

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
squares, say, this one would have an
antibody that could recognize

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
triangle.
This one would have an antibody that

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
could recognize a semicircle and so
on, millions and millions of

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
different shapes.
And these cells don't divide,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
though.  They've been made, and they
just sit there.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And then, when you stimulate them
with an antigen,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
and I used that word the other day,
an antigen is just anything that

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
will elicit an immune response.
It could be a piece of a foreign

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000
protein, carbohydrate,
just about anything that's a small

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
molecule you've made in the lab.
But let's say we exposed now this

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:19.000
individual to an antigen,
which in this case can fit into that

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:30.000
receptor.  And what happens,
then, this one becomes stimulated to

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:40.000
divide.
So what we have now is this B cell

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:49.000
that has this antigen stuck into its
binding pocket on the sample of its

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:59.000
antibody.  And then,
the cells divide and they give rise

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:08.000
to two populations.
They give rise to the plasma cells,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:17.000
which are very short-lived, on the
order of a few days.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And what these do, so they would
look like this,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:35.000
what they do is secrete antibodies
into the plasma.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
So what you end up with,
then, are a lot of these antibodies

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
that have exactly the specificity
that the original sample had on the

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
outside of that particular B cell.
This takes a few days.  So back

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
when we were talking about the
discovery of DNA,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
I was telling you about
Streptococcus pneumonia,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and you get infected by the
Streptococcus.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And there would be this period of
five or six days where this person

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
was very sick,
and then either they'd survive or

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
they didn't survive.
If they survived, they'd been able

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000
to mount an immune response and make
these antibodies before they got

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
killed by the bacteria.
And the reason it takes a few days

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
is when you start out there could be
just one B cell that's able with an

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
antibody, makes an antibody that is
capable of recognizing the capsule.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Maybe there are a few.
Anyway, but they were very,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
very tiny number, and there were
probably a lot of bacteria.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
So what had to happen, then,
is that the original cell or small

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
number of cells that could recognize
the Streptococcus had to be

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
amplified.  They had to make a lot
of plasma cells that have the

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
potential to make the antibody,
and then they had to secrete the

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
antibody into the plasma.
And I'll tell you in just a minute

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.000
some of the strategies that that
uses to help kill the pathogen.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And the other population, just
before I go on there,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
are what are called memory cells.
There's not as many of these made,

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
but they're very long-lived.  And so,
what they have is exactly the same

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.000
capacity to make the same antibody,
but they're not actively dividing.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:37.000
They'll just sit there,

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:45.000
float around in your bloodstream,
and then if you get a second

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:54.000
exposure to the antigen,
you get a very fast and strong

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:03.000
response because the selection for
finding the cells that had

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:12.000
antibodies that can recognize the
antigen has already been done.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
And there's already a few of them
around, and then after you do that

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
then you're able to make,
once again, the binding of the

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
antigen stimulates these guys to
start dividing.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
They make a lot of plasma cells.
And going back to the principal of

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
vaccination, your first response is
fairly modest.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
But if you get a second response,
what you're doing now is the memory

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
cells are already there.
They have the specificity for

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
recognizing the antigen in question.
And you can make a whole lot of

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
them.  So, if you had chickenpox
when you were little,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
you have memory cells that know how
to recognize the chickenpox virus.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
And then when your kid gets
chickenpox like mine did,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.000
I didn't get sick because I had
memory cells that were able

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
to recognize that.
OK, so what happens if you get an

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000
antibody?  How does this help the
organism, or in our case someone

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:22.000
like you or me,
avoid getting sick?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:29.000
So there are a couple of strategies.
One we might think of

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
is bind and block.
For example, you are a virus and you

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
get covered by antibodies.
Viruses: it's exactly the same

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.000
logic as bacteriophage,
except that instead of affecting a

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
bacterial cell a virus would be
infecting one of our cells.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And as the virus has receptors or
something, it has to recognize

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
something on my cell,
in order to attach and then to

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
inject its DNA.
So if we've got an antibody sitting

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:15.000
here, then it can't find its way to
the host cell.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:22.000
And then, there are a couple of
other ways.  They can target for

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
destruction.  And there's basically
two ways.  There's something called

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:36.000
the complement system,
that if it is able to recognize,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:44.000
say, the bacterial cell and their
antibodies are sticking to the

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000
outside, what the complement system
does is it's able to make little

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000
pores in the membrane
of the pathogen.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And I think one of the things I hope
you will remember is that one of the

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
secrets of life is that we have to
keep that membrane around there.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
We have to keep all of our insides
in, and the rest of the world

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
outside.  We have hydrogen ion
gradients across the membrane.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
So, if you want to kill a cell and
you, say, insert a protein that has

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
a little hole and it,
and that thing sits and sticks in

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000
the membrane, that cell is dead.
It can't maintain an ion gradient,

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
and things can leak out through the
hole.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000
So that's one of the ways of killing
it.  The other ways are macrophages.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:42.000
These are a type of white blood
cell, as well,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000
are very good at recognizing
bacteria that have antibodies stuck

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000
to the outside.
And in fact, that was the principle

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000
of that.  We have the Streptococcus,
and we have the capsule.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
And you may remember that little
movie I showed of a white blood cell

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
that was trying to eat it,
and it couldn't get hold of the

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
thing, whereas we saw another
example where a bacterium without a

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
capsule, there was sort of principle
I said is that the white blood cell

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
was able to recognize the bacterium
and then it pinches it off inside of

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
a membrane bubble.
And I sort of said at least in

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
principle that there is another
little bubble with poisons,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
and it brings it together so that
you have the bacterium and the

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
poison together inside of some
intracellular compartment,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.000
so that macrophages know how to kill
a bacterium if they bring it inside.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
The problem in the case of
something like Streptococcus was

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.000
being able to recognize it because
it couldn't get hold of that capsule.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
So, those antibodies that guy made
during that five day thing decorate

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
the outside of the capsule because
their specificity is to recognize

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
the capsule and bind to it.
But a macrophage,

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
even if it couldn't get hold of the
bacterium with a capsule is able to

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:20.000
ingest something that has antibodies
stuck on the outside.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
And once it gets inside,
it can kill the bacterium.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
In fact, immunologists call this
process opsinization,

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
which is derived from the Greek
words for seasoning,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
like putting salt on your food.
And the idea was that when they were

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
giving that word,
with these macrophages,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
which liked to eat bacteria,
they have a little seasoning that

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
they have these little antibodies
decorating their outsides.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So here you can see it least in the
humoral response how you generate a

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
whole lot of diversity.
Then this principle of what's called

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
clonal selection identifies a B cell
that's able to make an antibody that

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
can recognize the particular
pathogen or molecule that you're

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000
being exposed to amplify that,
make a lot of antibodies, and then

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
it can either just stick to the
pathogen like a virus and mess it up

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
that way, or it can decorate it if
it's something like a bacterium,

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
and then pull in a couple of other
systems that are capable of killing

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000
the pathogen.  I mean,
it's an absolutely amazing system.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
It sounded like science fiction when
I first heard about it.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
When I heard people talking about
it, everyone could see there was an

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
information theory problem.
How do you encode all that

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
information with just this amount of
DNA in a cell?

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
Now we understand.
And there's even another part that

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I'm leaving out here.
But once this whole thing has been

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
selected, there's another whole
round of sort of refinement where

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
the cells do kind of a very kind of
localized mutagenesis one base pair

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
at a time in the vicinity
of this binding pocket.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
And they're able to make,
if they're given more time and more

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:13.000
exposure to the antigen,
they can make a better and better

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.000
binding surface until you begin to
approach sort of the theoretical

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:25.000
maximum.  Now,
the T cell, in this case this

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:34.000
involves the cytotoxic T cells,
and they have a specific recognition

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:47.000
molecule on their surface.
It's called the T cell receptor.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:33:00.000
And in this case, it's attached.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So, this is the membrane of the T
cell.  And this is the cytoplasm

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
down on this side.
There's a little bit of the protein

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
that goes into that.
And then there's an alpha helix

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000
that goes through,
and then a segment that comes up

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
like this.  And there's another
chain that does the same thing.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
So, there are two segments that
span the membrane.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
This thing is anchored in the
membrane.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And then it's essentially the same
principle as with antibodies.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
There's a variable region, and
there's a constant region.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
And to a first approximation anyway
the logic by which the cell

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
generates a huge,
diverse set of T cell receptors is

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
the same logic that underlies the
generation of a whole lot of

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
different antibodies by taking
segments, joining them,

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000
picking them randomly out of column
A, column B, and then joining them

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
together, sloppy joining all the
other processes to increase the pool

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:19.000
of diversity.
Now, what these B cells are able to

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:33.000
do, then, these T cells are able to
do is something quite remarkable.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
We have on our cells,
this is, say, one of my cells,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
little sort of proteins that
function as sort of display cases or

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
something.  And what they do is they
show samples of all of the different

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000
proteins that are inside us at any
given moment.  Proteins are turned

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:59.000
over, and chopped up,
and things are recycled and so on.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:07.000
So there are always little peptides,
little pieces of proteins around.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:16.000
And, the display case,
if you will, has got a major

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:25.000
histocompatibility complex,
which is usually abbreviated as MHC

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
because it's such an unwieldy name.
And there are many,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
many alleles of MHC in the
population, which means that we each

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
have, for the most part,
a sort of individually designed

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000
display case for showing these
peptides.  The property of these

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
display cases,
they take some little piece of a

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
protein just a few amino acids long,
it binds into the display case, and

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
that sticks on the outside of our
cell.  And so we have

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
a lot of these.
And so on the surface of our cells

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000
are these little individualized MHC
display cases showing little samples

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
of the peptides of the proteins from
the proteins that are inside us.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000
So, if everything is fine, all of
the peptides that are in the display

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
cases are our own.
And I'll tell you in a minute why

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
that doesn't cause a problem.
But then if you get infected by a

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
virus, and it injects DNA or its RNA
inside of you and then starts to

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000
replicate, now you have some virus
proteins that don't belong to you.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
They get chopped into pieces,
and they begin to appear on these

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
major histocompatibility display
cases.  So if you think here,

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:56.000
this could be, perhaps, a little
piece of, let's call it self protein,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
it could be a little piece of my own
DNA polymerase or something

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000
like that.
And over in this one,

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:17.000
let's say we have a little piece of
a viral protein.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:25.000
So that's something that would not
be normally there.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:33.000
So what this T-cell receptor does
is it recognizes, so this

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:40.000
is non-self or foreign.
What the T-cell receptor does is it

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
recognizes these foreign peptides.
But it does it in the context of

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
the display case.
Otherwise the peptides would be

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:59.000
floating around.
So, in essence, the T-cell receptor,

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:06.000
if this is a cytotoxic T cell it's
able to see the individual display

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
case with a bit of viral
protein in it.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
And then it knows that it should
kill that cell because it's got

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
something in it that shouldn't be
there.  I mean,

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
it's a brutal but very effective
strategy.  If we applied it here,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
I go around if I found any of you
had a cold, I could just take a gun

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
and shoot you and it would cut down
on the number of sick days for the

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
rest of us because it wouldn't
spread the infection.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000
But in essence,
at a molecular level,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
that's the strategy.  Try to
identify a cell that's got something

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
inside it that shouldn't be there,
and then the cytotoxic T cells kill

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
that.  And let me just show you a
couple of quick movies of this.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.000
At this point, these will be the
last protein structures you're going

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:03.000
to see from me, I think.
Here's a representation of that T

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.000
cell just as a cartoon as you see it
in a textbook.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Here it is.  This is the binding
pocket up here.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000
And there's a little tiny peptide,
nine and amino acids from the HIV

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
virus bound in here.
Somebody did a crystal structure,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000
and was able to work that out.  And,
if you look at it in three

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000
dimensions, you'll see how
beautifully this little binding

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
pocket and the peptide
lies in there.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So that red part is the piece of
chalk, and the other part is what

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
I'm describing as my hand.
It's not a bad analogy, actually,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
even on a structural level.  And
then, here's another representation.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
This is sort of showing the hand
with a piece of peptide in it.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
And then the T cell is able to see
this whole thing in recognize it.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
And, if you look at it in a
structural form, here's

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
the little peptide.
This is the part,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
the display case you're looking at.
And here's the T cell receptor now

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
fitting down in seeing the peptide
in the context of this major

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
histocompatibility antigen.
And again, these things are all

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
beautifully complementary a three
dimensional level.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Again, at the heart of this is the
principle of complementary surfaces

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
fitting together that underlies so
much biology.  What's this?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
This is a tumor cell.
These are cytotoxic T cells that

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
have recognized this tumor cell is
doing something it shouldn't that a

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.000
normal cell wouldn't do.
And it's attacking it, and it's

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:52.000
killing them.  So,
not only does the cellular immune

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
response help us against things like
infections from virus and bacteria,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
it also will help prevent cancer.
So obviously there must be some

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000
trick here to why we don't see our
own peptides.  This is the self

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000
versus non-self  And it's a
relatively simple principle.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:24.000
So, distinguishing self versus
non-self is a problem throughout

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:32.000
this whole part of the
immune system.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:41.000
And here's the principle.
During embryogenesis, the cell

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:50.000
makes, the organism I guess,
makes the assumption.  I mean

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:00.000
obviously it's not thinking
about it.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:10.000
This is a way of understanding
what's happening.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:20.000
It makes the assumption that no
pathogens are present.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Any B or T cell recognizing
something must be recognizing itself.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:52.000
And so, it deletes those B and T
cells.  This process is given a name.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:05.000
It's called education.
And it happens in this organ called

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:16.000
thymus.  So, and then after birth,
then it switches.  And now B and T

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:28.000
cells, if they recognize something,
the body makes the assumption it

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:36.000
must be a pathogen.
And it goes after it.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:41.000
We have this huge human disease
where that goes awry: rheumatoid

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
arthritis, or multiple sclerosis are
cases where the self versus non-self

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000
recognition has broken down.
OK, so for example multiple

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000
sclerosis, a very difficult disease,
because there's a gradual

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
deterioration of the
nervous system.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
And what happens is the body of the
person with that mounts an immune

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
response against the sheath that
covers the nerves,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
and then that sheath gets destroyed,
and that the nervous system,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000
somebody with multiple sclerosis,
starts to break down.  And so, if

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000
you lose this self versus non-self
you get what's called an autoimmune

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
disease.  You may have heard that
phrase.  It's very important.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
It's a very tough thing if you have
one of these.  But that's what lies

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
at the heart of it.
And people still don't know,

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:35.000
but there is certainly some evidence
for some of these that are triggered

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
by a bacterial infection.
So, it could be that perhaps maybe

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
a bacterial protein looked close
enough to one of your own proteins,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
that somehow you got antibodies
against the bacterium,

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
and then it turned out it could also
recognize something in your body.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
There are some other immune
diseases you probably heard of,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
the baby in a bubble kind of thing.
There are a few people who were

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
born who have no immune response at
all because one of the basic pieces

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
for doing those DNA gymnastics I
talked about isn't there.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Those people have no B cells or T
cells.  They die unless they are

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
absolutely shielded from everything
else.  And that's one of those cases

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
when gene therapy,
if you could get that gene into that

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
person, they'd have an immune system
and they could live.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
There are other kinds of immune
deficiencies that are less extreme,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
but nevertheless, people will be
susceptible to infection.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
The other one which I've already
talked about, but now you can see in

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
another context is AIDS,
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
And I told you what the HIV virus
does is it injects its RNA.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
That makes a DNA copy.  It goes
into protein.  The cells that it

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
affects our special type of T cell
called T helper cells.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
What they are doesn't matter so
much, but what's important to know

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
is they're needed for both branches
of the immune system.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
They play roles in the humoral
response and cellular response.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
So, someone who gets infected with
HIV, what happens is the virus is

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
replicating in these helper T cells.
And so their immune system is

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
slowly, slowly being knocked away.
And the last thing, which I won't

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
have time to talk about,
but if you have an allergy,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
that's an overreaction of the immune
system.  So this is my last lecture.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
I've got to let you guys go.  It's
been a true pleasure to talk to you;

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
A real honor to meet many of you.
And many of you put a lot of effort

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:36.000
into those little answers.
I really, really appreciate that.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
For those who'd rather not be here,
I hope that somewhere down the line

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.000
when you're confronted with a
medical situation dealing with your

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
parents, your child,
yourself, whatever it is,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.000
that some of the stuff that you
heard will reemerge to help you with

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.000
those decisions.
And I wish you the best of luck for

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
the rest of the course,
and the rest of your careers at MIT

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
and beyond.  Thanks very much.
And as I leave,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
too, I've had the pleasure of just
having an incredible teaching staff.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
I don't think you guys know how
hard they work behind the scenes,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
but thanks to all of you for being
with me.

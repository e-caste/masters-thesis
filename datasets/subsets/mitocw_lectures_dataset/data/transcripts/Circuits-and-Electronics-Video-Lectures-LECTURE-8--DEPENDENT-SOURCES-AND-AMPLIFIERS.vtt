WEBVTT

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
All right, good morning.
So today, we are going to talk

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
about what is both a basic
device in itself,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the amplifier,
and it also serves as a real

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
key example of both nonlinear
analysis and small signal

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
analysis.
So, today, dependent sources

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and amplifiers.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, let me first spend a few
seconds just pointing out to you

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
some of the key points from our
previous lectures.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I also want to point out that
each chapter in the course notes

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
has a summary at the end of it.
And if you take a quick scan of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the summary at the end of each
chapter, it highlights the major

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
takeaway points from each
chapter.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It stresses what's important,
and if you have to remember a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
few things, what are those
things to remember?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So, to quickly review,
we talked about a few primitive

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
elements: resistors,
voltage sources,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and so on.
And by now, you should have the

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
facility to play around with
these device elements.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And then we talked about the
Node method, and this is kind of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the workhorse of 6.002.
When in doubt,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
use the Node method.
OK, and this will work both for

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
linear circuits and nonlinear
circuits.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
OK, so if you see a problem,
or if you see a situation in

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
real life that requires
analysis, then as a first step,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
you should try to think of
whether you could apply some of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
the key intuitive shortcut
methods, superposition.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
One of my favorites,
the Thevenin method,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the Norton method,
or the method that involves

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
composition, that is very
quickly analyzing circuits that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
have resistors in series and
parallel.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
OK, so if you can apply one of
these quick, intuitive,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
shortcut methods,
go do so.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
If you can't,
then usually you can resort to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the Node method irrespective of
whether the circuit is linear or

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
nonlinear.
So the last week was focused on

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
the nonlinear method or
nonlinear circuits,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and we spent the first lecture
talking about a straightforward

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
application of the Node method,
which gave us a bunch of

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
nonlinear equations that we had
to solve.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
In the last lecture,
we talked about the small

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
signal trick.
What we said is if you look at

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the whole space of nonlinear
circuits, then within that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
space, if we focus on small
variations, small perturbations

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
about an operating point,
then even the behavior of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
nonlinear circuits in that small
regime would be linear.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So small signal method.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And as an example,
I showed you how I could take a

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
highly nonlinear device like the
garage door opener LED,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and using that,
build a pretty nice transmitter

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that would transmit music.
And as long as we kept the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
signal small,
and operated the device in a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
region where its transfer curve
was relatively smooth,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and I biased,
or set the operating point

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
appropriately,
I would get a linear,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
small signal response.
OK.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So today, we're going to do a
couple things.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We're going to look at
dependent sources.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And the reading for this is
section 2.6 of your course

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
notes.
And, the dependent source will

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
be a new element in your tool
chest.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000
We will also do amplifiers,
and amplifiers are in section

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
7.1 and section 7.2 of your
course notes.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So, before I begin with
dependent sources,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I'm just a huge believer in
motivating things with real

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
world examples.
OK, so let me start by

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
motivating: why we need an
amplifier?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Why do we need to do things
like this?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Or why do we even bother?
And, spend a few minutes really

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
getting you to appreciate that
amplification is fundamental.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
OK, it's as foundational to
life as high fat potato chips

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and stuff like that.
So, let's do some basic

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
examples here.
So first, let me talk about,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
why do we need to amplify
signals.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Why amplify?
Why do we care about building

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
an amplifier?
So, an amplifier,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000
think of a little box,
and apply some sort of small

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
input.
And I get a larger output.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
In this example,
this may be a voltage with a

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
swing of 10 mV,
and in this case,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the output might be another
voltage with a swing of,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
say, 100 mV.
And commonly,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
the amplifier,
in addition to an input and an

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
output, input port and output
port, may also contain the power

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
port, OK, so that I can apply a
power supply to the amplifier

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
because commonly as an amplifier
signal, I'm looking for a power

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
gain as well,
an increase in the power

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
provided by the output.
So, that's an abstract

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000
definition of an amplifier,
and let's take a look at an

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.000
example of why we may need this.
So let's say I have a small,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
useful signal,
and let's say the signal has 1

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
mV peak to peak.
And, I'm looking to transmit

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
the signal over a wire to some
other point.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
But let's say that in this
environment, I get a bunch of

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
noise that is in a noisy
environment.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And in this environment,
let's assume that some noise

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
may get superimposed.
And if I have a 1 mV signal,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and 10 mV of noise,
then what I end up with at the

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
output is something that looks
like this.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And it's really hard to
distinguish my 1 mV signal from

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that large amount of noise.
On the other hand,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
if I do the following,
if I took the signal and passed

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the signal to an amplifier,
and I amplified the signal to

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
be a much larger version of the
same signal, let's say in this

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
particular situation 100 mV peak
to peak signal.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
OK, so I magnified the signal
by a factor of 100.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
OK, let's say it's a linear
amplifier, I linearly amplified

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
signal to be 100 mV,
then in that case,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
if I had a noise on top of
this, it's going to be less

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
discernible.
The signal will look like this.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
OK, my 10 mV noise would add on
to it.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
But, this is still pretty
decent.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I can still recognize the
input.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And so, this is one application
of amplification.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
If I need to send something
from point A to point B as an

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
analog signal,
then an amplified signal is

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
less prone to noise attacks than
a small signal.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Not surprisingly,
a large number of devices that

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
are used in everyday life have
amplifiers built into them.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So, get a little cell phone,
and virtually every single cell

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
phone contains an amplifier.
By the way, this is an all

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
digital cell phone.
It's a Kyocera,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I forget the number now.
It's completely digital.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
OK, although they say it's
completely digital,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
it turns out that a significant
fraction of the circuitry is

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
analog, in particular,
so digital is sort of a

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
marketing term to say that
there's something special about

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
this.
But remember,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
there's a bunch of analog
stuff.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, here's my little antenna
from the cell phone.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
OK, and typically the first
thing that happens to a signal

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
as it comes out of the antenna
in your cell phone is,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
look at cell phone circuits,
or cell phone systems would be

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
something that looks like this,
OK, this, and may have a label

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
LNA.
If someone were to take a guess

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
at what LNA might stand for?
What's that?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Linear amplifier.
That's pretty good.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So that's LNA.
Close enough.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
A is correct.
It's amplifier.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
What does L and N stand for?
Low noise.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
OK, so this stands for low
noise amplifier.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So, I get a really rinky dinky
small signal here,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and then the low noise
amplifier amplifies a signal.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And in real cell phones,
and for that matter,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
in your 802.11b,
or 802.11a, or 802.11g wireless

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
cards, same thing.
Antenna, low noise amplifier,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and then you may have a bunch
of processing.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And commonly,
you have a bunch of analog

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
processing.
And then, you convert the

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
analog to a digital signal.
OK, I recall last week I asked

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
somebody in class here,
how would we transmit the

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
signal from point A to point B
without it being impacted way

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
too much by noise,
and he said,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
oh, go digital.
Good point.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
OK, so if I go digital,
I can transfer the signal

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
without noise being a real
factor.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
But the analog to digital
converters need the signal

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
strengths to be a given value
before it can chop it up into

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
digital levels.
OK, so an amplifier is very

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
fundamental.
OK, and so in this case,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
what may be a signal of a few
tens of microvolts to be

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
amplified to some large enough
value that it can be further

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
processed.
So, that's application of

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
amplification in the analog
domain.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Let me talk about amplification
in the digital domain.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So, that's in the analog
domain.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
This amplification is in the
domain that I have both analog

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and digital.
OK, and now let me talk about

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
amplification in the digital
domain, OK?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I'm going to argue that
amplification is absolutely

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
foundational to the digital
domain.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
OK, the digital abstraction
would not occur if I did not

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
have basic amplification.
OK, and the next minute and 37

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
seconds I will prove that to
you, OK?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So, let's do so.
So, let's suppose I have a very

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
simple digital system,
and the system simply contains

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
a pair of inverters.
So, if I send a one here,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
it's a zero here and a one
here, which is a very simple,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
trivial, digital system.
And here's the input.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Here's the output.
And we said that for digital

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
systems of this sort to work,
they have to follow a static

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
discipline.
OK, our signals and our

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
circuits must follow a
discipline for them all to work

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
together.
And, the discipline we

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
described comprised of signals
adhering to certain voltage

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
thresholds so that all the
components in the system could

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
agree on what comprised a zero,
and what comprised a one,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
OK?
So the way we did that was we

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
said that you would have a
threshold called VIH,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
V input high,
and another threshold called

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
VIL, V input low.
OK, and we said that this

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
circuit must recognize signals
that are higher than VIH,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
3 V for example as a one,
and simultaneously,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
any signal that has a voltage
level less than VIL,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
say, two volts,
should be recognized as a zero.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
That was the input constraint.
On the output,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
it had a similar set of
constraints, where we had

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
tougher constraints on devices,
where we said that the output

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
had to satisfy a output low
constraint, output high

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
constraint.
What this said is that for this

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
circuit to be called a good
digital circuit that satisfies

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the static discipline,
signals that were ones here

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
should be recognized as such.
And if I am producing a one as

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
an output, then the signal level
should be higher than VOH.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Similarly, if the signal's a
zero, then it should be less

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
than VOL.
So as an example,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
this may be 2 V,
this may be 3 V,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and this may be 4 V,
and this may be 1 V.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
OK, so input,
I should recognize 2 V and less

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000
as a zero, but at the output I
have to produce a very,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
very low value,
1 V.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So, I have some noise margin.
So as an example,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
say if I made a plot of the
input/output,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
so I get my VIL here and VIH
here.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
This is time.
This would comprise a valid

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
digital signal:
zero, one, zero,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.000
one, and so on.
OK, now, I had a tougher set of

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
constraints at the output.
I would have VOL,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
VOH.
So, at the output,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
OK, I'm required to stretch the
ones and zeros to be further

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
apart from each other so that I
get noise margin,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and the corresponding signal
for our little circuit there

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
would look like so.
Right, if this is a valid

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
input, then this would be the
corresponding,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
valid output.
OK, and need I say more?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
OK, you can see that,
intuitively,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
look, there's amplification
happening here,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and the reason is that VOL is
chosen to be less than VIL,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and VOH is higher than VIH.
So therefore,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
the signal has to be stretched.
The signal has to be amplified.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
OK, and what's the minimum
amplification needed for the

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
system to work?
The minimum amplification is if

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I had a signal that looked like
this.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
OK, that barely skimmed the
VIL, VIH level.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
OK, so if signal were this high
peak to peak,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
VIH minus VIL,
and what's the absolute minimum

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
signal at the output?
It would look something like

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
this.
OK, barely skimming VOL and

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
VOH, OK, so the corresponding
output level would be VOH minus

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
VOL.
OK, so this is the absolute

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
minimum amplification that my
digital circuit has to provide.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
OK, and notice,
VOH is larger than VIH.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
VOL is smaller than VIL.
Therefore, this quantity needs

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to be greater than one.
OK, so I've shown you both a

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
simple, graphical,
intuitive explanation,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:45.000
and this is a slightly more
formal proof that even the

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
digital circuit really requires
to have amplification built into

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
it, if it is to satisfy valid
static disciplines.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Yes?
Yes.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The question is,
is that the same as gain?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Good question.
Yes, the term amplification has

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
many, many variants.
You could say gain.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
You could say amplification.
You could say increase in

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
signal strength,
and so on and so forth.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
And in fact,
when talking about low noise

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
amplifiers, people sometimes
talk about having the low noise,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000
high gain amplifier at the
input stage.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
OK, so let me pause there in
terms of motivation.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So, I believe I've motivated
every which way:

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
pure analog,
analog/digital,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and digital.
OK, so I've covered every

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
single base here.
And so, we need amplification.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OK, so let's look at how to
build a fundamental,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
primitive device called the
amplifier.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Before we do that,
however, let me take a quick

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
detour.
It will be convenient for me,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000
as I show you how to build an
amplifier, to introduce a new

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
device, a new element,
called the dependent source.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
OK, let me introduce a new
device for your arsenal of

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000
devices, along with resistors,
You learned about a MOSFET,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000
a switch, voltage source,
current source,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000
and now a dependent source.
So, a dependent source looks

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000
like this, OK,
has an output port,

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and has a control port.
So, a dependent source in its

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
simplest form has two ports:
an input port and an output

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
port.
Remember, a port is a

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000
convenient pairing of terminals,
and I apply signals to such

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000
terminal pairs.
But this is a abstract diagram

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
for a dependent source,
and to get a little bit more

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
specific, let me show you an
example of a dependent source.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So, let's say,
here's my input,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
and I label the terminal
variables for the input.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:45.000
VC is the voltage applied to
the input, and IC is the current

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
into this terminal here.
And, here is the symbol for the

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
dependent source.
Much like a current source or a

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
voltage source has a circle
around it, the corresponding

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
symbol for a dependent source is
like so.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
So this example,
for instance,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
is a dependent,
current source.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000
I can apply the corresponding
output variables,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000
I0, OK, and I can say that the
current, I, is some function.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
In this example,
I've designed the example that

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:30.000
the current through the current
source, I, is some function of

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:36.000
the input voltage or the control
voltage, VC.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
OK, so notice that the current
through a current source,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
the current through this
current source,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
I, is some function of another
variable.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
OK, in this example,
it's the voltage across its

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
control port.
Not surprisingly,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
this device is called a voltage
controlled current source --

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
-- or a VCCS.
So, in like manner I can also

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
devise other forms of sources.
You can think of this is a

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
device where a voltage controls
an output current.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
You can think of all other
combinations,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
current controlling current,
voltage controlling voltage,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000
current controlling voltage,
and so on.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
So, another example,
I give you another dependent

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:50.000
source, and in this situation,
my output current is controlled

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
by an input current,
VC.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:57.000
IC rather.
And I claim that I for this one

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:02.000
is some function of a current,
IC.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
OK, it's another dependent
source where the output current

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
for its output port is related
to the current,

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
IC.
And, this is a current

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.000
controlled current source.
OK, it's a current controlled

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
current source.
And, if I had lots of time on

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
my hands, and I was wanting to
kill time, I'd sit around

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
drawing for you,
other types of dependent

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
sources.
I would draw for you a current

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000
controlled voltage sourced,
and I could also draw for you a

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
voltage controlled voltage
source.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
OK, so that's an abstract
diagram for such a source.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And so, let's do a few examples
involving elements like this.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
To begin, just so you can build
up your intuition,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
let me start by doing a very
simple circuit,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
involving an independent
current source,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:09.000
OK, just so we can relate back
to what we've been doing so far.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
So, let's say I have some
resistor, and I have a standard

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
current source with current I
nought.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
This is an independent current
source.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Remember the circle?
And, some resistor,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
R, and let's say I care about
the voltage across the resistor.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.000
OK, so I have a current I
nought flowing through it.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
So, I can very quickly write
down VR as, simply,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
I0 R.
OK, it's the drop across the

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000
resistor when a current I nought
flows through it.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
OK, so this is what you've been
used to doing.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Correspondingly,
I can do an example with a

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000
dependent current source.
And, as an example,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I'll use a voltage controlled
current source.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
OK, a voltage controlled
current source is a dependent

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:20.000
current source whose output
current depends on the voltage

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000
applied at the control port of
the current source.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
So let me build a little
circuit.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
OK, so here's my current.
And let's say it's VC IC for

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
the control port,
and similarly,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
let's say my current I here is
some function of the control

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
port voltage.
And let's say,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
to be specific,
there is some K over VC,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
some function.
OK, there are a variety of

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
dependent sources that can be
built, and here's a hypothetical

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
device where the output current
is mathematically related to the

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:07.000
input in the following manner.
So, let me build a circuit of

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000
the following form.
So, let's add the resistor,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
R, and here's my circuit,
OK?

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And, as before,
let me look to figuring out

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
what VR is.
So, notice that I have to

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:27.000
supply some voltage at the input
so that the output can depend on

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
the input because right now I
don't know what the input here.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So what I'll do is let me apply
VR over here.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
OK, so let me make this
connection.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
OK, let me make the connection
from here to here.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
What I've done is I've applied
VR at the control port of the

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
dependent current source.
OK, and I often draw a circuit

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
like this.
This looks pretty messy.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:10.000
I will often draw the circuit
like so: R, VR.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
OK, short form circuit drawing
would look like this.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
This is a complete drawing that
I show you the explicit

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
connections of the control port,
but oftentimes,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
when the control port does not
have any other impact in the

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
circuit, you can eliminate,
don't explicitly show the

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
control port.
Rather, you can simply show the

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
dependence of the output current
on whatever circuit variable you

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
have in mind.
So, you can draw the diamond

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
like this, and see its current
is some function of VR.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
VR in this is case is K divided
by VR, OK?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
OK, so let's go ahead and
analyze this little circuit

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
here, and look at what this
might give us.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Our goal, as before,
is to find out the value,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000
VR.
So, in this case,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
let's apply the Node method to
this node, and sum the currents

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
into that node to be zero.
OK, so sum the currents going

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
into that node to be zero.
The current going down is

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
simply VR divided by R.
OK, and that is equal to the

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
current that is going out of the
node.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And so that is equal to F of
VR.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000
And I know that F of VR is
given by K divided by VR.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:00.000
OK, a simple application of the
Node method.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
So then, I collect VR's on the
left hand side,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
and I get VR squared is K times
R, OK, and VR is simply the

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
square root of KR.
There you go:

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
I'm done.
OK, I've gone ahead an applied

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
the Node method to this,
and when have to figure out the

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000
current here,
I simply reflect the fact that

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
it depends on VR like so,
and I just go ahead and solve

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
the circuit.
Remember, the workhorse of the

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
circuit industry,
the Node method,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
when in doubt,
apply it.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
It simply works.
And notice, this is a nonlinear

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
circuit.
OK, the dependence is

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
nonlinear, and I get the
response like so.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
So, to plug in some numbers,
supposing K was 10 to the minus

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
3 amperes per volt,
and R was one kilo ohm,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:12.000
then I can plug the numbers in
and the kilo here cancels with

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
the 10 to the minus 3,
and I get VR equals 1 V.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:24.000
OK, this simply says,
if I build a circuit like this,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
then this voltage here will be
1 V.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
So, again, as long as you
remember that the dependent

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
source is simply another little
circuit element,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
OK, and you usually draw just
the output port for dependent

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
sources, and reflect the way
that the control affects the

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000
current, that'll suffice,
and you get,

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
through the application of the
Node method, the variable you're

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
interested in.
Let's do another example,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
OK, of another fun current
source, a voltage controlled

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
current source,
and look at it this way.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
So, let's say I have a
resistor, and I have a current

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
source, a resistor,
RL, and this goes to some,

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
I apply a VS here.
Remember this short form

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
notation; that's simply applying
a supply VS between that node

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000
and the ground.
OK, and let us say the current

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
IV through the device is some
function of the current at its

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
control port.
OK, so I'm not going to show

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000
you that.
But remember that the device

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
already looks like this,
that there is a control port

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.000
here.
I'm not showing that to you.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000
And let us say that I apply
some voltage,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
VI, to the input port.
The reason we often don't show

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
the input port is for many
practical dependent sources,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
the input has no other effect
on the circuit.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
So, for example,
in this case,

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
the input has infinite
resistance looking in.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
So therefore,
if I apply a VI here,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
it doesn't draw any current
from VI.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000
I simply apply the voltage,
VI.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
It doesn't affect the circuit
in any other way except in terms

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
of how it controls the current
ID.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So let's say the current ID is
some function of VI because VI

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:55.000
is applied at the control port.
OK, and as I pointed out

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
before, I oftentimes,
just for clarity,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000
just to show this dependent
source explicitly.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000
OK, so let's work the example.
So as I said,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
I'm going to choose ID to be F
of VI, and let's pick some

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
specific parameters here.
Let's say it's K by two VI

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
minus one, both squared.
OK, and let's say this is true

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000
for VI less than equal to one
volt.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
And let us also say that ID
equals zero for VI less than one

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
volt.
OK, it's a dependent source,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000
and it can have various forms
of dependences on the input.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
And, I just picked an example
of some hypothetical,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
or as yet, hypothetical
dependent source,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.000
the current through which is
related to the input using a

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
square law relation,
VI minus one all squared as

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
long as VI is greater than one.
And if VI is less than one,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.000
then the current is simply
zero, it shuts off.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000
So, I can go ahead and apply.
So, let's say I want to find

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
out V0 versus VI.
So, I care about finding out

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
V0.
V0 is the voltage of this node

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
with respect to ground.
OK, so it's a slightly more

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
complicated circuit than you saw
up here, than you saw up there.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
So, let's go ahead and do this
example.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Start by applying the workhorse
of the circuits business,

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
the Node method,
and let's start with doing this

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
for VI.
Let's first do it for VI

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
greater than one,
notice the behavior of this is

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000
different for different ranges
of VI.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
So let's first do it for VI
greater than or equal to one and

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000
apply the Node method.
Node method says sum the

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
currents going into this node;
we know the voltage at this

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000
node.
It's VI.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
We know the voltage at this
node.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
It's VS.
OK, the only unknown is V

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
nought.
And so, let's go ahead and

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
write the node equations for
that node.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000
So, the current going up,
let me simply equate the

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
current going up to the current
that has been supplied by this

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
particular node here.
And, that should equate that

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
the two of them should sum to
zero, the current going up plus

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:36.000
the current going down should
sum to zero.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
So, I get V0 minus VS divided
by R.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000
That's the current going up.
Plus, the current going down

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000
must sum to zero,
plus ID must sum to zero.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
And ID is going to be K divided
by two VI minus one all squared.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:56.000
That must equal zero.
Straightforward application of

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:00.000
Node method, current going up
plus the current going down at

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
this node should equal zero
because the total current

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
leaving the node must be zero,
OK?

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
So I can go ahead and simplify
this, multiply it throughout by,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
I call this RL here.
So, multiply it throughout by

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
RL, and move all of this to the
other side, so I get VS divided

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000
by RL, multiply it throughout by
RL.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
I get VS at this side.
I take this term to the other

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000
side.
This becomes a minus.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
RL multiplies here,
so I get KRL.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
That's the expression I get.
V nought is VS minus KRL

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
divided by two times VI minus
one all squared.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Let me put a box around this
because I will be referring to

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000
this more times in 6.002 for a
variety of reasons than probably

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
any other equation on Earth.
OK, this is the first time you

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
saw it.
You saw it here.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
OK, mark it down.
You'll smile every other time

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
you look at it in quizzes,
and you will find out why this

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
comes up very often in 6.002.
So, I'll just give you a few

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
seconds to savor this big moment
in your 6.002 life.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
All right, OK,
so it's pretty simple actually.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000
I mean, there's really not
much.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
A lot of this stuff is just a
plain old, simple application of

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
the Node method,
and things just fall out.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
It's just so simple.
So, the V nought,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I apply the Node method,
I get V nought for this

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
nonlinear circuit.
I can also it for VI less than

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000
one.
For VI less than one,

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000
when VI is less than one,
what happens?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
ID is zero.
OK, since ID is zero,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
think of this as an open
circuit.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:06.000
OK, so there's no voltage drop
across RL.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:13.000
And, this voltage V nought is
equal to VS.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
So, I like to see things in
pictures.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
I'm not an equations kind of
person.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
I'm much more of a graphical
person.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
So, let me draw a little graph
to show how V nought,

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
to see the form of V nought,
and then let's study that

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
little system a little bit more
carefully.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
So, this is page seven,
and we plot V nought versus VI

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
for you.
And let's take a look at how

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:46.000
this really simple circuit
looks.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
This has got nothing.
It's got an RL resistor

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
connected to a supply,
and a dependent current source,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:01.000
and I apply some voltage VI at
the input.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
It's a very,
very simple circuit.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
So, let's see.
So as long as VI is less than

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:14.000
one, the output stays at VS.
OK, that makes intuitive sense,

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
right?
As long as the current here is

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
zero, this is like an open
circuit here.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
If this is an open circuit,
then effectively,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
V nought is simply the voltage
VS.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000
V nought simply appears here.
If you want to grunge through

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000
KVL and KCL, go ahead.
VS minus RL times the current

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
is V nought, and the current is
zero so it's,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
yes.
So, this is simply VS.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
When VI goes above one volt,
fun stuff begins to happen.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
OK, when V nought goes above
one volt, then this equation

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
applies because VI is greater
than one.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
This equation applies.
And, when VI is a one,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
one minus one is zero.
This term cancels out,

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
so this is VS.
OK, phew!

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
So, I start off here.
As VI increases,

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
what happens now?
As VI increases,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
this term here becomes
increasingly negative,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
OK, subtracting from VS.
OK, so I get some behavior like

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
this.
V nought begins to drop.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
And it makes intuitive sense,
right?

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
As ID begins to increase,
the voltage here will begin to

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:40.000
drop because I'm drawing more
and more current through RL.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
I'm dropping more and more
across RL.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.000
So more and more drops across
RL, so V nought begins to drop

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000
too.
So, it looks something like

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
this.
I'll show you a little demo,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:58.000
but my claim is that you have
just seen an amplifier.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Whoa.
You just saw an amplifier.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
So, I snuck an amplifier by
you, OK?

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
So, I just snuck an amplifier
past you.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I'll show you why in a second.
So, let's take a look at this

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
waveform here.
Let's not worry about what

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
happens way down here.
We'll talk about that a little

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000
later.
But, look at this curve here.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000
I claim there is amplification
in the following sense.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Focus on some change in the
input voltage,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
delta VI, OK,
and for that change in input

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:06.000
voltage, I get some change in
the output voltage.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
OK, for some change in the
input voltage,

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000
delta VI, I get some change in
the output voltage.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.000
And guess what?
In this, at least the way I

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
have drawn it,
delta V nought divided by delta

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000
VI, if I can find regions of the
curve where this is greater than

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:32.000
one, then I have amplification.
OK, so what's that saying?

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000
What that's saying is that if I
apply some voltage here,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
OK, and I change that voltage
by a small amount from,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
let's say, 2 V to 2.1.
OK, I am going to find the

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
output voltage.
Let's say I go from 2 V to 2.1

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
here.
OK, abstractly out there,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
I might have an output that
goes from three to,

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:03.000
let's say, two V perhaps.
OK, so for a 0.1 change here,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
I'm going to get a bigger drop
here, so from 3 V to 2 V,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000
giving me an amplification in
this little circuit.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
OK, so we'll see this again and
again, and you'll really

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
understand it.
So, I have a small change in

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.000
the input, and I have a
corresponding larger change in

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
the output.
So, I've shown you an

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000
amplifier.
I haven't shown you a linear

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
amplifier.
There's an extra charge for

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
that.
OK, that'll happen later.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
OK, all I've shown you so far
is an amplifier,

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
and this happens to be a crummy
amplifier.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
It's a nonlinear amplifier
because, notice,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
this is not linear.
It's a nice little curve,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
and so it's not linear.
But, I promised you an

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
amplifier, and I'm cheap,
and that's all you get for now.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
OK, we'll see linear stuff
later, but for now,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I have a little amplifier.
So, let's do some real numbers,

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
and plot some numbers down,
and also look at a demo.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
So, let's do an example.
Let's say VS is 10 V,

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.000
that the K is two milliamps per
V squared, and let's say RL is

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
five kilo-ohms,
OK?

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000
So, let me substitute these
values into that equation,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
and I get V nought is,
VS is ten.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
So, it's ten minus,
KRL divided by two.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:31.000
So, K is two milliamps.
Two milliamps times five

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
kilo-ohms is ten divided by two
gives me five,

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
and VI minus one squared.
That's what I have.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
I just plug in a bunch of
numbers, and that's what I get.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:52.000
So, what I'll do is let me just
do a little table for you,

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
and plot using real numbers,
simply plot those values for

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
you.

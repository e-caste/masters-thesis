00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.670
TROY VAN VOORHIS: All right,
well, good morning, everyone.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.100
I'm not Bob Field, but I'm Troy.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.910
Nice to see everyone.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.610
So I'm here.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.610
We're going to spend the
next couple of lectures

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.580
talking about electronic
structure theory.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.870
And at this point, I'll
give you the big reveal,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.560
which is that at this point,
you have already encountered

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.160
virtually every problem
that you can solve by hand

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.700
in electronic structure theory.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.320
So there's a handful
of other things

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.903
you could do if you
really, like, knew

00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:54.970
your hypergeometric functions
and some things like this,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.090
but basically, every
electronic structure problem

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.150
that you can solve by hand
you've already encountered.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.580
And so if chemistry
relied on us being

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.756
able to solve things by hand,
we wouldn't get very far.

00:01:06.756 --> 00:01:09.680
We'd be pretty limited
in what we could do.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.210
So we end up using the fact
that we have computers.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.592
And computers are far more good
at doing tedious repetitive

00:01:16.592 --> 00:01:17.800
things that human beings are.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.790
They don't complain at all.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.140
And so we can use computers
to do fairly neat things.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.730
So I'll show you just a
couple of quick pictures here

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.120
of things that we can do.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.560
So if you open up
any research paper

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.900
these days, even if it's
just synthesis-- you know,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.250
we made this catalyst.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.880
We did this thing, whatever.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.940
There's always some part
of it where they said,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.050
well, we did a
calculation, and this is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.300
what the structure looks like.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.920
Or this is what the
orbitals look like

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.040
or something like this.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.620
So this was actually
a calculation.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.604
We are computational
chemists, I guess.

00:01:50.604 --> 00:01:52.780
I'll use this screen over here.

00:01:54.245 --> 00:01:56.620
Is this the one that you're--
or you're filming this one.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:57.190
This one?

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.220
All right. so I'll film
this one-- go to this one.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.540
Breaking the fourth wall there.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.680
So this is the
picture of the HOMO,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.832
the reactive orbital
water-splitting catalyst

00:02:06.832 --> 00:02:07.540
that we computed.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.870
So you can see that
there's 50, 60 atoms here,

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:12.460
probably several
hundred electrons.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.920
We did not do this by hand.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.430
We didn't draw the
surfaces by hand.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.220
The computer did
all of this for us.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.670
And you can also do things
like look at chemical reactions

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.790
and run dynamics.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.740
So we can do--

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.240
there we go.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.770
So you can run
dynamics of molecules.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.850
So this is a particular
molecule in solution.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.560
And we can use the
electronic energy

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.889
in order to govern the
dynamics of the molecule.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.430
And the computer
can actually predict

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.650
for us whether this
molecule is going to react,

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.340
what it's going to
do, how it's going

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.640
to behave in one
solution, say, versus

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.430
another or at one particular
temperature versus another,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.740
those kinds of things.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.290
And all of these, again,
are based off of the idea

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.390
that we can use computers
to solve problems

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.723
in electronic structure, or
at least approximately solve

00:02:58.723 --> 00:03:01.110
problems we couldn't do by hand.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.380
And so what the goal over
the next couple lectures

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.900
is for us to learn
enough of the basics

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.030
so that you can do
some calculations

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:14.810
like this yourselves and then
see what you can do with that.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.220
So now I will switch over.

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:20.200
You'll find where the
other differences, which

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.850
is that I don't like the
feeling of chalk on my fingers,

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.470
so I use my iPad
as a chalkboard.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.750
So the rest of this
will all be on the iPad.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.820
There we go.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.570
So for those of
you who want to--

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.790
you may not have
gotten in this time.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.820
But I've literally
posted what I'm

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.256
going to be writing on here,
these blank notes, online.

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:47.380
You can download them,
print them off, if you want.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.042
If you have an
iPad or a computer,

00:03:49.042 --> 00:03:50.500
and you like to
take notes on that,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.416
you can download them
to your iPad or computer

00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:54.550
and take notes that way.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.330
But I find it's good because
there are some things that

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.810
take a long time for me
to write at the board

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.560
and that it would take
a long time for you

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.590
to write in your notes.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.640
And we can just have them
written down in advance.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.770
So the starting point
for all of these things

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.600
that you can do on a computer
for electronic structure

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.250
theory, we start with
the Born-Oppenheimer

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.910
approximations.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.451
So the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation

00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:17.740
was the idea that because
the nuclei are very heavy,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.589
you can clamp their positions
down to some particular values.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.220
So in this particular case
here, in this equation,

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.430
I have it such that big R here
are the nuclear positions.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.480
So there's going to be more
than one nucleus generally.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.650
So there's going
to be R1, R2, R3.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.357
All those crammed together,
I'm just going to denote big R

00:04:42.357 --> 00:04:43.690
And that's where the nuclei are.

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:48.480
And so in Born-Oppenheimer
approximation,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.590
we clamp the nuclei down.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.880
And then what we're left
with is the electrons.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.160
The electrons whiz around.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.676
They move in the field
dictated by those nuclei.

00:04:56.676 --> 00:04:58.050
So we have a
Schrodinger equation

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:00.180
that describes the
motion of the electrons

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.600
in the presence of the nuclei.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.320
And so here I'm using the lower
case letters, lowercase r.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.690
So they'll be, again, many
electrons, so r1, r2, r3, so on

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.320
and so forth.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.892
And it's the electrons that are
really doing all the dirty work

00:05:19.892 --> 00:05:20.600
in this equation.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.830
They're the ones that
are moving around.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.180
I've clamped the nuclei down.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.602
They're just parameters
in this equation.

00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:27.560
And so what I have is I
have an electronic wave

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.170
function that describes the
distribution of electrons.

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.204
I have an electronic
Hamiltonian that governs

00:05:33.204 --> 00:05:34.370
the motion of the electrons.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.680
Then I have an electronic
energy after I've solved

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.480
this Schrodinger equation.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.555
And the nice thing about
this is that for an arbitrary

00:05:41.555 --> 00:05:43.805
number of electrons and an
arbitrary number of nuclei,

00:05:43.805 --> 00:05:46.760
I can in one line,
in about 10 seconds,

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.961
write down the Hamiltonian.

00:05:48.961 --> 00:05:50.960
So the Hamiltonian is
pretty easy to write down.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:52.700
I've even written it right here.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.135
So I did use the cheat
of using atomic units.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.842
So the reason there's no H
bars or mass of the electrons

00:06:02.842 --> 00:06:04.300
or any of that
appearing in here is

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.740
because I chose atomic units.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.550
But then the ingredients
of my Hamiltonian

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.840
are all pretty well-defined.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.690
So I'll have some
kinetic energy.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.100
And that kinetic energy will
just be for the electrons

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.190
because the nuclei are fixed.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.330
I'll have an electron-electron
repulsion term.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.750
So of course, the
electrons repel each other.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:33.780
I'll have an electron
nuclear attraction term

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.970
because the nuclei are
fixed in positions,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.710
and the electrons feel
a potential due to that.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.070
And then I have a
nuclear repulsion term.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.160
And in this case, because
the nuclei are fixed,

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.670
that nuclear repulsion
is just a number

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:52.690
because I know where
all my nuclei are.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:54.760
They have some particular
repulsion energy.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.465
That's just some number that I
add onto my Hamiltonian there.

00:06:59.465 --> 00:07:01.090
But if I put all
those things together,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.130
I get the Hamiltonian.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.750
So I can write down
the Hamiltonian

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.270
without too much difficulty.

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.920
But of course, the
interesting thing

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:13.340
here is this Hamiltonian depends
on these nuclear positions.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.994
So I have to know what--

00:07:15.994 --> 00:07:17.410
depending on where
the nuclei are,

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.740
I'm parametrically
changing this Hamiltonian.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.160
That changes H, and it also
changes the eigenvalue,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.444
the electronic eigenvalue
E. And so there's

00:07:28.444 --> 00:07:29.860
an obvious question
of, well, what

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:31.840
is this electronic eigenvalue?

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.330
It turns out to be a
very important thing.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:40.400
We will typically call this
thing a potential energy

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.900
surface.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.860
And it turns out to
govern a whole host

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.790
of chemical phenomena.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.780
So the first thing
that it could generate

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.510
that we can look at--
we've already actually seen

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:58.680
potential energy surfaces.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.640
So on the left-hand side
here, I have the picture

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.580
from the case of H2-plus.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:13.900
So here we had the energy
of the sigma orbital.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.020
And as a function of
R, it forms some bonds.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:20.590
So as we made R shorter, the
sigma orbital formed a bond.

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:26.520
Then we had also this
sigma star orbital

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.100
as a function of R. When we
brought the atoms together,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.183
in that one there was no
bond, no swarming energy.

00:08:31.183 --> 00:08:32.490
It just went straight up.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.039
So we've got two
of these things,

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:35.429
and I should label my axes.

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:41.770
So what I'm plotting
here is the energy

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.080
as a function of
the bond distance R.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.810
So this was our first
example of a potential energy

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.630
surface, the electronic
energy as a function of R.

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:53.150
And we see that it taught
us about the bond, the bond

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:54.860
strength, so forth.

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.810
There's one other thing that
this picture reminds me of,

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.560
and that's that for
the same problem here,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.851
I actually had two different
potential energy surfaces.

00:09:02.851 --> 00:09:06.170
I have the sigma potential
energy surface and sigma star.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.870
And that's because I left
something out in my Schrodinger

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.710
equation up here.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.250
There's, of course, an index.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:16.190
I have different eigenfunctions
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.970
So I have an
electronic Hamiltonian.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:19.950
It'll have many
different eigenfunctions.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:23.050
So I have an index n for
those eigenfunctions.

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.730
And each of those eigenfunctions
will have a different energy.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.281
And each of those energies is
a different potential energy

00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:29.780
surface.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.025
So the sigma state was
the lowest solution.

00:09:33.025 --> 00:09:35.150
The sigma start state was
the next lowest solution.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.733
They had different
potential surfaces.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.000
But I will often not refer
to potential energy surfaces

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.410
plural but instead to potential
energy surface singular

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:51.570
because most chemistry occurs
on the lowest potential energy

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.220
surface.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.970
So it involves just the lowest
potential energy surface.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:59.550
And the reason for that is
because electronic energies

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.534
tend to be very big
in chemical terms.

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:03.450
So the difference between
sigma and sigma star

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.990
is several EV, typically.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.500
And chemical reactions
on that same scale

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.830
are usually tenths
or hundreds of an EV.

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.500
So the chemical reaction energy
might be somewhere way down

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.260
here, way way, way below
the amount of energy

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.542
you would need to get all
the way up to sigma star.

00:10:22.542 --> 00:10:24.500
And so the sigma star,
potential energy surface

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.399
is just irrelevant.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:27.690
It's there, but it doesn't
participate in the reactions

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.310
at all.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.350
So in most cases, knowing about
the lowest potential energy

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.640
surface gets you
most of chemistry.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.850
But then we can also,
sort of, schematically

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:43.490
talk about how these potential
energy surfaces will look

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:45.600
for a more complicated example.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:51.230
So let's say I had the
water molecule, HOH.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:55.520
So this is a more general case.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:01.310
We have at least two
coordinates here, R1 and R2.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.500
There's also going
to be an angle,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.275
but I can't really
plot three-dimensional

00:11:06.275 --> 00:11:09.620
hypersurfaces, even
with my computer.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.880
So I'll stick with two.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.327
There's a third
coordinate there,

00:11:12.327 --> 00:11:14.660
which is theta, which I'm not
going to play around with.

00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:16.800
But we'll play around
with just R1 and R2.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.580
So I can change
individually the OH bond

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.580
lengths in this molecule.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.680
So then this is going
to give me the energy

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.794
as a function of R1 and R2.

00:11:27.794 --> 00:11:28.710
So it'll be a surface.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:30.710
So it's a function
of two variables.

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:32.030
That's a surface.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:35.960
And that surface might look
like what I have plotted there,

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.830
where it would have various
peaks and valleys on it.

00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:44.720
The very, very lowest valley,
the very lowest minimum,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.090
just like we found for
H2, that lowest minimum

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.160
was the equilibrium bond--

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.664
bonding configuration.

00:11:50.664 --> 00:11:52.580
So for this two-dimensional
potential surface,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.621
that lowest minimum's
going to be the equilibrium

00:11:54.621 --> 00:11:56.090
configuration.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.246
But there's also the
possibility of other minima

00:11:59.246 --> 00:12:00.620
on this potential
energy surface.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.690
Those would be metastable
intermediates, things

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:04.231
that you could get
trapped in, things

00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:06.890
that would live for a while,
but eventually go down

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:08.765
towards the lowest minimum.

00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:10.390
Then there'd also be
reaction barriers.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.310
So these are the things that
we learned about governing

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:16.340
how fast things convert
from these metastable states

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.830
into the most stable states.

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:21.602
So that's what you would get if
you had just two coordinates.

00:12:21.602 --> 00:12:24.060
And so then you can sort of
try to generalize in your head,

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:29.570
well, what if we had 3,
4, 5, 6, 127, 368, lots

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.774
and lots of coordinates?

00:12:30.774 --> 00:12:32.690
In some many dimensional
space, it would still

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.690
have the same qualities.

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.330
There'd be minima and
barriers and so forth.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.780
And we would get those out
of the Schrodinger equation,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.740
the electronic
Schrodinger equation.

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:43.770
And so that is the
electronic structure problem.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:48.050
How do we accurately solve
for the electronic eigenvalue

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.860
and the electronic wave function
for an arbitrary molecule?

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.054
And the key word
here is accurately.

00:12:56.054 --> 00:12:57.470
I didn't just say
how can we solve

00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.410
for electronic energy and
the electronic wave function

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:04.780
because, in general here,
exact solutions are impossible.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.010
And I don't mean
impossible for 5.61.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:11.280
I mean impossible for
humans or computers.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.310
So in general, electronic
structure theorists

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:14.960
love approximations.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.750
We love to make approximations
because that's the only way

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:19.230
that you can make progress.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.160
And so what we're going to learn
about today and next Monday

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:25.280
are the, sort of, different
categories of approximations

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.180
that we make and what the
pluses and minuses of those are.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.720
So I'll pause there and see
if anybody has any questions.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.220
All right, so
we'll move on then.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.820
So we have an out--

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.110
so there is actually an
outline of how different

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.770
modern electronic structure
methods make approximations.

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.410
And these follow the
same kinds of steps

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.900
that you would use in a
molecular orbital calculation.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.930
So the first thing
that you typically

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:02.390
had to do in these
calculations was

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:06.440
to choose a set of
basis functions.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.160
So you had to choose like
1s function over here

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:12.310
or 1s function over there
or a 2s function or 2p.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.690
You had to choose some
set of atomic orbitals

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:16.747
that you're going to use
as the starting point

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:17.580
of your calculation.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.270
Then you made linear
combinations of those things

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.820
to get better functions.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.250
And so then after you'd
chosen that basis,

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.580
you had to build some matrices.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:30.530
Then you had to solve
the eigenvalues problem

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:31.370
for that matrix.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.070
Then you had to pick out which
orbitals you were actually

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.930
going to occupy.

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.820
Those were the next few steps.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.500
And then finally, you had
to compute the energy.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.327
Now, that's already kind
of a detailed outline.

00:14:44.327 --> 00:14:45.910
If it seemed like
we had to understand

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.640
the nuances of every
one of those five steps,

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.010
we'd be kind of--
well, you can do that.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:52.730
It would be an entire
course unto itself.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.730
And that's not what
we're going to be doing.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:58.570
The reason that we can avoid
going over every single nuance

00:14:58.570 --> 00:14:59.390
is twofold.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:04.390
So first, we can avoid, more
or less, steps two through four

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:06.850
because they're
done automatically.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:10.870
So once you have chosen your
basis that you want to use,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.730
the computer knows
how to build matrices.

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.490
It knows how to diagonalize
matrices and find eigenvalues.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.867
It knows how to pick out
which orbitals to occupy.

00:15:17.867 --> 00:15:19.450
It knows how to do
all of those things

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:21.160
without you telling
it to do anything.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.720
You don't really have
to change anything.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.470
So the only things you
have to worry about

00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:29.440
are choosing a
good basis and then

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.920
also telling the computer a
good way to compute the energy.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.380
The other reason that we can
actually do something useful

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.134
here is because using
a computer to solve

00:15:38.134 --> 00:15:39.550
an electronic
structure problem is

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:43.200
much like using an NMR to
get a spectrum of a compound.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.030
I doubt that
anybody in this room

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:49.200
could build their
own functioning NMR.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.170
I know generally the
principles of how an NMR works.

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:54.290
But building from
the ground up-- oh,

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:55.620
so we do have any takers?

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.524
Anybody able to
build and NMR, huh?

00:15:57.524 --> 00:15:58.432
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:58.432 --> 00:15:58.932
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:58.932 --> 00:16:00.473
TROY VAN VOORHIS:
From the ground up.

00:16:00.473 --> 00:16:01.320
I'm betting-- no.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.026
See?

00:16:03.026 --> 00:16:05.400
You have to actually, like,
make your own superconducting

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.150
magnet.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:08.580
You've got-- from the
ground up, actually

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:11.160
building your own NMR would
be very, very difficult.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.960
But that doesn't
preclude you from knowing

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.870
how to use an NMR
because you know,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.556
OK, well, this piece is-- this
dial is roughly doing this,

00:16:18.556 --> 00:16:19.680
so I change this over here.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:20.520
I shim this.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.915
That's how I make the NMR work.

00:16:21.915 --> 00:16:24.040
It's the same thing with
electronic structure code.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.631
You need to understand a little
bit of how they work in order

00:16:26.631 --> 00:16:27.630
to use them effectively.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.150
But you don't have to understand
every single line of code that

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:31.740
went into building
it, which is good

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.320
because there's several
hundred thousand lines of codes

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.640
in many of these electronic
structure packages.

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.067
So we're going to try to
understand the principles that

00:16:39.067 --> 00:16:40.650
go into this so that
we know how to be

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.820
good users of
computational tools.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.680
And we can actually,
then, organize.

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.560
So roughly speaking, we'll
be focusing on step one today

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.810
and step five next Monday.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.670
But we can organize
these approximations

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:56.100
on a sort of
two-dimensional plot, which

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.160
just sort of summarizes
the whole idea of what

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.480
we're going to be getting at.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.270
So the idea here
is that on one axis

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:04.920
we have the step
one thing, which

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.410
is the basis, the
atomic orbital basis.

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:11.609
Then we can organize those
basis, those choices of basis,

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:18.089
from, roughly speaking, on the
left hand, we have bad choices.

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:22.631
And on the right hand,
we have good choices.

00:17:22.631 --> 00:17:25.089
Now, you might say, well, why
would we even include choices

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:26.500
if we know they're bad?

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:32.010
Because the bad ones also
happen to be the fast basis.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:36.250
And the good ones
tend to be slow.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:37.680
And so it's a time trade-off.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.510
So you have a lot
of time, you might

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.154
choose a really good basis.

00:17:41.154 --> 00:17:42.570
If you have not a
lot of time, you

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:44.430
might choose not
a very good one.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.940
And then we can do the
same thing with the energy.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.370
We have different choices of
how we compute the energy.

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:57.210
And we can roughly arrange those
from bad choices to good ones.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.295
But again, these bad
choices are fast,

00:18:01.295 --> 00:18:02.420
and the good ones are slow.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.580
And so the general
thing that we want

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:13.200
is we want to get up here into
the upper right-hand corner,

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.340
where the exact answer is.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.798
Somewhere up there, with a very
good energy and a very good

00:18:16.798 --> 00:18:19.290
basis, we're going to
get the exact or nearly

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:20.790
the exact answer.

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.770
So that's where we want to get.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:27.000
But moving from the lower
left to the upper right.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.680
Every time we move
in that direction

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.170
we're making the calculation
slower and slower and slower

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:32.086
and slower and slower.

00:18:32.086 --> 00:18:34.230
Until eventually we
just lose patience.

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.902
And so then we cut
it off and say,

00:18:35.902 --> 00:18:37.860
all right, this is as
far as I'm willing to go.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:39.234
What's the best
answer I can get?

00:18:39.234 --> 00:18:43.020
What's the most best-cost
benefit analysis I can do?

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.540
And so in terms of
being good users

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:47.250
of electronic
computational chemistry,

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:49.410
it's about knowing,
OK, well, if I've only

00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:52.652
got three hours for
this calculation to run

00:18:52.652 --> 00:18:55.110
or two days or however long
I'm willing to let the computer

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.200
run on this, what's the
best combination of a basis

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.840
and an energy to get me a decent
result in that kind of time?

00:19:04.702 --> 00:19:06.410
So questions about
that before I move on?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.480
OK, so we'll focus on choosing
an atomic orbital basis.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.230
So we already have chosen an
atomic orbital basis before.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:28.040
So when we did H2-plus, which
is, sort of, a standard problem

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.580
that you can actually
solve by hand if you choose

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:36.310
the right basis, when
we did that calculation,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.870
we chose to have an
atomic orbital on A,

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:45.040
the 1s function on A, and the
atomic orbital on B, 1s on B.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.770
And those two things
together formed our basis.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.454
So we wrote our
molecular orbitals

00:19:49.454 --> 00:19:51.370
as linear combinations
of those two functions.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.650
We got sigma and sigma star out.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.500
And we were able to
work out the energies.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:02.860
Now, this type of basis
is a useful basis.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:05.045
And it has a name, and it's
called a minimal basis.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.930
And it's minimal because you
could not possibly do less.

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.690
So if you want to form a
bond between two atoms,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:17.160
you need at least one
function on each atom.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.990
If you had only one
function, period,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:21.670
you couldn't really form a bond.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.000
So it's as low as you can
go, can't go lower than this.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.630
Now, you could think
about the possibility

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:30.580
of adding additional functions.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:34.582
So I could add in, say,
the 2s function on A,

00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:38.780
the 2s function on B,
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:41.900
I could come up
with various things.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.514
Now, you might ask, why
would I want to do this?

00:20:44.514 --> 00:20:46.180
And there's a very
good reason for doing

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:47.680
this, which is one
of the principles

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.640
that we need to learn in
constructing basis functions,

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:57.220
choosing our basis, which is
that adding basis functions

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.980
always improves the calculation.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.300
So even though I think
that adding 2s A and 2s B,

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.730
why would those be important?

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.320
I can't really say.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.001
Adding basis functions
always make things better.

00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:13.750
And the reason for
that is because we were

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.460
doing a variation calculation.

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:19.060
We're trying to approximate the
lowest energy of the system.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:23.110
And just choosing the 1s A and
1s B functions doesn't give you

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:24.040
the lowest energy.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.490
It may be close,
but it's not exact.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.700
So then by adding
the 2s functions,

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.910
the result could get
better by adding a little--

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:38.790
by making C3 and C4
not quite 0 here,

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.814
maybe the answer gets
a little bit better.

00:21:40.814 --> 00:21:42.480
Maybe it doesn't, but
it can't get worse

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.290
because the calculation could
always choose C3 and C4 0.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:47.970
So adding basis
functions always makes

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:52.550
things either better, or at
least not worse than they were.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.530
And so what you'll
find is that when

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.560
we're talking about AO
basis, choosing an AO basis,

00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:59.150
we're going to be
choosing bases that

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:01.580
are much bigger than your
chemical intuition would

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.720
suggest.

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.522
So for H2, I think,
oh, 1s A, 1s B,

00:22:04.522 --> 00:22:06.230
that should more or
less describe things.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.646
And if I was doing things by
hand, that's what I would do.

00:22:08.646 --> 00:22:10.670
But if the computer's
doing the work,

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:13.070
well, no skin off my
nose if this computer

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:16.497
wastes some time doing some
2s or 3s or 4s intervals.

00:22:16.497 --> 00:22:18.080
I'll let the computer
do that, as long

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:20.910
as it gives me a better answer.

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:25.004
So the bases we have will be
much bigger because of this.

00:22:25.004 --> 00:22:26.420
But the other thing
I want to note

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:33.800
is that when I talk
about these 1s functions,

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.810
you probably all
have in your head--

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.450
you know what 1s
functions look like.

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:43.630
They look like e to
the minus a times r.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:46.840
So they just look like
exponential decay functions.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.770
Turns out that for
practical reasons,

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.200
these are inconvenient
things to use on a computer.

00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.890
And that is because integrals
involving exponentials

00:22:55.890 --> 00:22:58.590
are not analytic in three
dimensions primarily because

00:22:58.590 --> 00:23:00.919
of the cusp that
occurs at r equal 0.

00:23:00.919 --> 00:23:03.210
So if you multiply two of
these things times each other

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.376
and try to do an integral,
you have a cusp over here

00:23:05.376 --> 00:23:06.650
and a cusp over here.

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:08.490
And the integral is
just not something

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:10.510
that can be worked out.

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:15.660
And so when the going gets
tough, the tough get empirical.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:19.200
And so instead of using these
exponential functions, what we

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:21.150
use in practice are Gaussians.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.990
So Gaussians are things
instead of looking

00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:27.150
at like e to the minus ar,
they look like e to the minus

00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.050
alpha r squared.

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:33.450
So if I was to plot a
Gaussian here on the same axes

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:37.380
and choose the alpha
value appropriately,

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.532
I could get a Gaussian
that might look like that.

00:23:41.532 --> 00:23:46.320
So it would be similar to
that actual 1s function.

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.720
But particularly
near the origin,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.050
where it doesn't have a cusp,
and particularly in the tails,

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:55.570
where e to the minus alpha r
squared decays very quickly,

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.490
they don't actually
look that similar.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.355
So whole reason
to do this is not

00:24:00.355 --> 00:24:01.730
that we have some
physical reason

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:03.730
to think that Gaussians
describe atoms is better

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.830
than hydrogenic functions.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:05.560
They don't.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.050
It's just that we
can do the integrals.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:11.580
There's easy integrals here.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.990
And if we really do want
a hydrogen-like function,

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.660
we can get that
by just including

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.892
more than one Gaussian.

00:24:18.892 --> 00:24:21.350
So one Gaussian doesn't look
very much like an exponential.

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:24.440
But if I take two Gaussians
and choose their exponents

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.020
and their coefficients
appropriately,

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.090
I can make a linear
combination of two Gaussians.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:36.332
So this was the one
Gaussian result.

00:24:36.332 --> 00:24:38.040
With two Gaussians I
could make something

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.790
that might look like that.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:44.914
And with three
Gaussians I might be

00:24:44.914 --> 00:24:46.580
able do something
that would look like--

00:24:50.244 --> 00:24:54.280
and then four Gaussians and five
Gaussians and six Gaussians.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.050
But it's clear,
then, that by using

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.180
a large number of Gaussians,
I can get whatever

00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.550
I want just by brute force.

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:04.090
And so those are the two
things about building basis,

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.472
choosing basis, AO bases.

00:25:06.472 --> 00:25:07.930
And at this point,
you should start

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.810
to feel a little bit
intimidated because I've

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.980
said that for atoms you're
going to need more basis

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.290
functions than you
thought just to try to get

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.760
a variation a lower energy.

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.789
And those basis functions are
likely to be constructed out

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:25.080
of Gaussians, of which you'll
need a bunch of Gaussians

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.990
to even really approximate
one hydrogen-like orbital.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:32.050
So you're going to have lots
and lots and lots of Gaussians

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.000
on every atom.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.500
And you're going to choose the
exponents of every single one

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.480
of those Gaussians yourself.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.057
And that would be just
horrible to have to do.

00:25:41.057 --> 00:25:42.640
And the thing that
comes to our rescue

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.520
is a thing that's
known as a basis set.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.490
So a basis set is constructed
in the following way.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:52.150
A graduate student, probably
long before you were bored,

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:56.330
spent years of their life
going through and figuring out,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.100
OK, for carbon, what
is a good combination

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:01.900
of Gaussian exponents?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:09.720
OK, they're 113.6
74.2, 11.3, and 1.6.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.900
They wrote that down.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.850
They said, OK,
now, for nitrogen,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.100
what are a good set
of Gaussian exponents?

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.600
And then they went
through, and they

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.320
did this for every
element, or at least many,

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.070
many, many elements
in the periodic table.

00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:23.390
Then they wrote a paper
that said here is--

00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.210
I did it.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.340
So I'm going to say here
is the Troy basis set.

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:28.840
And the Troy basis
means when you

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.548
say you're doing the
Troy basis set means

00:26:30.548 --> 00:26:32.890
you're using those
exponents that I wrote down

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.130
for carbon or for nitrogen
or for oxygen or for fluorine

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.130
or for hydrogen. And
it's all predefined.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.044
It's all laid out.

00:26:41.044 --> 00:26:42.460
And if I was really
diligent, it's

00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:44.260
laid out for every element
in the periodic table.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.676
If I was less
diligent, maybe it's

00:26:45.676 --> 00:26:47.920
only the first two rows
or something like that.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.380
But the result is that
all you have to say

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.720
is I want the Troy
basis set because Troy

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.550
makes really good basic sets.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:56.000
And so I'm going to use that.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.760
And then the computer can
go and just say, OK, well,

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.480
there's some file that
has all those exponents.

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:01.938
And the computer looks up the
numbers and says, for carbon,

00:27:01.938 --> 00:27:05.340
you need this; for oxygen,
this; for nitrogen, this.

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:10.090
And so the key idea here is
that these are predefined

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.170
sets or AO basis functions.

00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:13.737
So somebody already
defined these.

00:27:13.737 --> 00:27:15.070
You don't have to make a choice.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.890
Other than choosing the
set, there's not other knobs

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:19.180
that you have to turn.

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.220
So you can obviously
see the benefit

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.054
of this, which is you
don't have to put down

00:27:23.054 --> 00:27:24.761
hundreds and hundreds
of numbers in order

00:27:24.761 --> 00:27:26.160
to get the calculation to run.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.090
So that's a big win,
which hopefully you're

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.260
remember for the
next 25 minutes.

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.360
Because the downside,
then, is that you just

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.560
noticed I called my basis
set the Troy basis set, which

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.680
would give you absolutely no
idea of what was in that basis

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.320
set, just that I
made the basis set.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.850
And then somebody
else might call it

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.720
the Cambridge basis set because
they did it in Cambridge.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.480
And somebody else might
number their basis sets.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.960
You know, this is
basis set number 17.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.820
And none of those
things actually

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:56.830
tell you what's actually
in the basis set

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.060
and how they designed it.

00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.710
They just give it a name.

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:03.700
But then that name is-- you have
to know the name in order to be

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.990
able to specify the basis set.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.845
And you have to know what--

00:28:06.845 --> 00:28:08.470
you have to sort of
memorize, oh, well,

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.590
this basis that does this.

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.631
This basis set does this.

00:28:10.631 --> 00:28:12.520
Or at least remember
where to look up

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.200
what those basis sets do.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.752
So for the next
20 minutes or so,

00:28:15.752 --> 00:28:17.710
we're going to talk about
some of those things.

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:20.470
And you'll be
annoyed at the fact

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.650
that these basis sets have these
funky, weird names and design

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:24.490
principles, I think.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.196
But just remember, I don't
have to put in 100 numbers.

00:28:27.196 --> 00:28:28.570
This is the price
you pay for not

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.850
having to put in 100 numbers.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:36.730
So the first thing that
we'll talk about here--

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:40.934
so I'll say that basis sets
are typically grouped by row.

00:28:40.934 --> 00:28:43.100
Of course, the basis sets
are going to be different.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:47.500
So hydrogen's going to need
a different number of basis

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.594
functions than carbon.

00:28:49.594 --> 00:28:51.760
Argon's going to need a
different number from carbon

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.380
or hydrogen just
because they have

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.570
different numbers
of valence functions

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:58.330
and different numbers
of core functions.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.420
And I'm also going to
introduce a shorthand.

00:29:04.030 --> 00:29:10.080
So first of all, I'll note
that we already have--

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.230
so actually, I'll just
introduce the shorthand.

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:18.540
So, say, for nitrogen
and for the basis set

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.080
we've talked about so far,
the minimal basis set,

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.360
the smallest basis
set I can come up

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.250
with for nitrogen
would need to have

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:30.670
the 1s function, the 2s
function, and the 2p function.

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:32.770
I need at least those
functions to just

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.800
have places to put all
of my nitrogen electrons.

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.177
Now, I'll get
writer's cramp if I

00:29:38.177 --> 00:29:39.760
have to write all
of these things out.

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.510
So I'm going to develop
a shorthand, which

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:44.680
is when I have 1s
and 2s, I'm just

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.490
going to denote that as 2s.

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.659
So I'm not indicating that
2s is the last function.

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:52.450
It's Indicating that
there are two of them.

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:54.489
So I have two s-type
functions, one

00:29:54.489 --> 00:29:57.030
that's sort of core like and
one that's sort of valence like.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:29:58.290
But there's two of them.

00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.640
And then I have one
p-like function.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.730
So I'll put 1p So
that's just telling me

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.500
how many of each of
these things I have.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:14.250
So again, this is the
number of s-type functions.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.520
This is the number
of p-type function.

00:30:20.565 --> 00:30:21.940
And so then we
can go, and we can

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:26.590
talk about the one basis
set we've dealt with so far,

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:27.930
which is the minimal basis set.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.510
So for hydrogen and
helium, it's just

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:33.824
going to be that 1s
function on each of those.

00:30:33.824 --> 00:30:35.490
And then when I go
down to the next row,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.031
it looks just like
nitrogen. They all

00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:40.950
are going to need in an s
core function and an s valence

00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:42.750
function and a p
valence function.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.200
So there'll be 2s, 1p-like.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.340
And then I go down one more
row for sodium through argon,

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:51.910
and I'll need
another s function.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.010
So it'll be total of
three s-type functions.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:57.940
And then I need two sets of
p, a core p and a valence p.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:58.580
So there's 2p.

00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:03.240
So that's the minimal basis.

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:07.082
That's the smallest basis that I
could conceive of for any atom.

00:31:07.082 --> 00:31:08.790
And then we're going
to have various ways

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.940
of trying to make these things
more elaborate, more broke.

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:14.400
And the most common
way to do this

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.760
is to note that, well, when
I bring atoms together,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.330
it's the valence functions
that actually either contract

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.990
or expand in order to describe
the electrons moving around.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.730
The core functions don't
really change very much.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:31.530
And so in order to give the
valence functions flexibility

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:36.100
to change, it makes sense to
add more valence-like functions.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.040
So if the valence
was s, it makes sense

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.596
to add another s function.

00:31:39.596 --> 00:31:41.220
Or if the valence
was p, it makes sense

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.570
to add another p function.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:51.000
And so we get a name here, this
concept, which is minimal basis

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.830
is what's known as a single zeta
basis set because it has just

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.152
one set of valence functions.

00:31:58.152 --> 00:32:00.360
It might seem like would
make better sense to call it

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.060
a single valence basis set.

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:04.920
But history made a
different choice.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.090
It said that it's zeta.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:08.520
I don't know why they chose
the name zeta, but they did.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.978
So the zeta just
means that there's

00:32:09.978 --> 00:32:11.580
one set of valence functions.

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.119
And then you can think
about making a double zeta.

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:15.660
So you'd take every
valence function,

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:18.120
just add another
valence function

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.710
that has a different
exponent so it

00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:21.690
would allow more flexibility.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:26.750
So that'll be a Double
Zeta basis set, DZ.

00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:30.480
So for hydrogen and
helium, it's all valence.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.510
So we'd just get
two s functions.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:37.130
For things in the same
row as lithium and neon,

00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:40.574
the valence functions
are in s and a p.

00:32:40.574 --> 00:32:41.990
And so when we
double those, we're

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.160
going to add another
s-type function

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.380
and another p-type function.

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:50.580
So we would go 3s
2p here because we'd

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.860
add one s function
and one p function.

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:58.779
And then for sodium through
argon, we would have 4s 3p.

00:32:58.779 --> 00:33:00.820
And then we could go on
and talk about, oh, well,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.150
what about a triple zeta?

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:10.510
So triple zeta would be
3s for hydrogen helium.

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.860
And then we add an s and
a p for the next row.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.970
So it's 4s 3p.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.370
And then we add s and p for
this, and we end up with 5s 4p.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.660
And so again, the idea
here is that for carbon, we

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.610
might have 1s that's the core.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:41.060
And then we'd have 2s and 2p as
the first valence and then 3p.

00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:47.550
And these would
respectively be--

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:54.610
so the single zeta or--

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.520
and then you include
the next cell.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.900
And it becomes-- or
sorry, single zeta

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.464
would be all of this, sorry.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.784
Oh, it's the core.

00:34:05.784 --> 00:34:07.450
And then you could
say, all right, well,

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:11.280
but then I include another set.

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.690
And this gives me a
double zeta basis set.

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.460
And then I could
include another set,

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.570
which would give me a triple
zeta kind of basis set.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.630
Then you can go
on and on and on.

00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:26.340
So you could just make a
quadruple zeta and quintuple

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.270
zeta basis set.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.969
And then this is where
the names get annoying.

00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:34.530
So the name of the most common
minimal basis set is STO-3G.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.639
And that stands for Slater-Type
Orbitals 3 Gaussians,

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.239
just in case you're
wondering why it's STO-3G.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:52.719
And then for the
double zeta basis set,

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:57.790
there are ones that
are called 3-21G,

00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:02.200
6-31G, another one that
is somewhat confusingly

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.780
just called DZ, Double
Zeta, as if there

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:07.810
was only one such basis set.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:16.600
And then for a triple zeta,
you can do 6-311G triple zeta

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.500
valence.

00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.140
And there are others.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.740
So there are other
abbreviations out there as well.

00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:26.980
But that's how you would
do these kinds of-- how you

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:30.829
change the zeta, the valence.

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:31.870
So questions about those?

00:35:36.740 --> 00:35:37.490
Yeah?

00:35:37.490 --> 00:35:40.236
AUDIENCE: So is
there [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:40.236 --> 00:35:42.610
in the example you're including
as your additional zetas,

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.520
like 3s 3p 4s.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.850
But would there be an
advantage to including

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:51.524
things that weren't atomic
orbital-like things?

00:35:51.524 --> 00:35:52.440
TROY VAN VOORHIS: Yes.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.270
So there are
occasionally times where

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.630
people include basic
functions that don't

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:59.140
look like atomic orbitals.

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.830
So the most common one is to
make bond-centered functions.

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.290
Like say, I want a bond
here, and you could

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:04.373
put basis functions there.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:08.390
There's a couple of reasons
that becomes undesirable.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:11.210
One is that, then, you can't
use a standard basis set

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.986
because basis sets have to be
sort of anchored to the atoms.

00:36:13.986 --> 00:36:15.110
That's how we catalog them.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.610
If you say, oh, I'm going to put
one in the middle of the bond,

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.860
you say, well, it would
depend on both atoms involved

00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:21.840
in the bond and how long the
bond was and things like that.

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.780
So that's a little
bit undesirable.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:27.200
The other one is that unless
you pin that bond function down

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:30.410
to a particular position, if
you let the center of that bond

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:33.440
function move, there's actually
numerical instability that

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.370
happens when two Gaussians
come on top of each other.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:39.530
And that can sometimes
cause calculations--

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.280
the computer to choke.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.590
So that in practice, we
usually stick to increasing

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:48.770
the atomic basis sets.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.230
Oh, but there is
also one other case.

00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:57.840
In physics, they are much
more fond of using solids.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.260
That's sort of one of
the things that chemists

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.600
tend to think about
molecules as the example.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.310
Physicists tend to
think about solids.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:05.990
And in solids,
they're much more fond

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.420
of using plane waves
as their basis set.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:10.240
So they start off
with the free--

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.710
instead of starting off
with atoms as the reference,

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:14.180
they start off with free
electrons as their reference.

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.440
And then say, oh,
and then we introduce

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.140
these potentials which
are perturbations

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.056
to the free electrons.

00:37:18.056 --> 00:37:19.919
So you get plane waves
as your basis set.

00:37:19.919 --> 00:37:21.710
You make linear
combinations of plane waves

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:23.481
instead of atomic functions.

00:37:26.348 --> 00:37:26.848
Yeah?

00:37:26.848 --> 00:37:28.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
atomic orbitals

00:37:28.772 --> 00:37:31.449
do we need [INAUDIBLE]?

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:33.240
TROY VAN VOORHIS: That's
exactly the next--

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:35.330
you've hit on exactly
the next thing,

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:39.550
which is that none of those
include any d functions.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.440
I mean, I can go
up to like 18 zeta,

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:43.120
and I would never
have any d functions.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.880
And on hydrogen and helium,
I can go [INAUDIBLE]..

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.800
I wouldn't even have
any p functions.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.360
And certainly there
are situations

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:53.140
where you would want these
higher angular momenta.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.570
One of them is if you're
in an electric field.

00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:00.477
So that polarizes electrons
and tends to actually require

00:38:00.477 --> 00:38:02.560
slightly higher angular
momenta functions in order

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.860
to describe that polarization.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.360
And the other one is for just
the directionality of bonding.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:09.700
That if you had, like, an
SN2 reaction or something

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.295
like this, where temporarily
something was either actually

00:38:12.295 --> 00:38:16.000
hypervalent or sort
of hypervalent,

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.370
you would need these higher
angular momentum functions

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.490
to describe the hypervalency.

00:38:21.490 --> 00:38:23.870
And so those are called
polarization functions.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.720
So here polarization
functions are

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:30.380
things that add higher
angular momentum and valence.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.220
So you need this for
things like polarizability,

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.740
which is why they're called
polarization functions.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.770
But you also need it for
things like hypervalency.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:44.280
And so the nomenclature
for polarization functions

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.670
is also a bit weird.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:50.740
But the simplest one is that
you just add the letter P,

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:54.039
so P standing for
Polarization to the basis set.

00:38:54.039 --> 00:38:55.580
And then the idea
is that you're just

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:58.844
going to add one
function with that P.

00:38:58.844 --> 00:39:00.260
You when you add
the P, that means

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.470
you're adding one function that
has one unit higher angular

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:04.030
momentum.

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.780
So if P was your highest
angular momentum,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.156
you're going to
add a d function.

00:39:07.156 --> 00:39:08.946
And if s was your
highest angular momentum,

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.334
you're going to
add a p function.

00:39:10.334 --> 00:39:11.750
So for hydrogen
and helium, that's

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:15.680
going to add a P to lithium.

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.480
To argon, it's going to add a D.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.490
If you did this also the
transition metal atoms,

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:22.010
you would note the transition
metal atoms have d functions

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.820
already.

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.640
So the polarization
would add an f function,

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:28.540
just adding one higher
angular momentum.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:36.970
So then going back to our table
up here, let me use my magic,

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:39.715
copy the double zeta
basis results here-- copy.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.950
There's my double zeta.

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:49.190
Now I'm just going to add
the polarization to this, so

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:52.300
double zeta plus polarization.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:54.200
Now I add my
polarization functions.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:55.720
And so for hydrogen
and helium, I'm

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:01.090
going to add one p function
to get a DZP basis set.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:04.500
Lithium to neon, I'm
going to add 1 d function.

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.570
For sodium to argon, I'm
going to add 1 d function.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:15.510
And then I can do the same
thing with triple zeta.

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:25.900
So if I make a TZP basis set,
then I'll add 1p, 1d, and 1d.

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:35.810
And I'll note that you could
also do a TZ 2p basis set.

00:40:35.810 --> 00:40:37.730
And then you're
adding-- the 2p just

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.190
indicates that I'm adding even
more polarization functions.

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:43.760
So I'm adding two sets of d
functions instead of just one

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:47.840
or two sets of p functions
instead of just one.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:51.790
And then these
things have names.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:41:06.030
So there's a 6-31G star, which
is a very common DZP basis set.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:10.430
Or there's also that DZ
basis that I mentioned above

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:14.510
has a DZP generalization of it.

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:18.560
Or you could have for the
triple zeta, the TZVP basis,

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:28.765
or the longest basis
set name, 6-311G (d, p).

00:41:34.602 --> 00:41:36.560
This is where the annoyance
started to come in.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.940
You're like this is annoying.

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:39.810
But it's less annoying
than the alternative.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:40.601
So we deal with it.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:50.770
So questions about that?

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:51.630
Yep?

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.191
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] 1p--

00:41:53.191 --> 00:41:53.690
I'm sorry.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.060
That 1p, they're just like,
we're going add DZ squared.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.394
Or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:58.394 --> 00:42:00.310
TROY VAN VOORHIS: It's
one set of d functions.

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:00.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:01.516
TROY VAN VOORHIS: Yes.

00:42:01.516 --> 00:42:03.290
Yeah.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:04.480
Yeah?

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.190
Yep?

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:08.749
AUDIENCE: Why can't we
have a single [INAUDIBLE]??

00:42:08.749 --> 00:42:10.040
TROY VAN VOORHIS: Oh, we could.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.980
But, yeah, we could do that.

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:13.570
So part of this has to do with--

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.870
and there are a couple of
basis sets that do that.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:17.700
This mainly represents
the hierarchy

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.670
of empirically what people
have found is most important.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.220
So if you just start with a
minimal single zeta basis set,

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.770
you say, well, what's the
next most important thing?

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.750
Usually almost always
going to double zeta

00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:34.050
is more important than the
polarization functions.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:39.517
So very few people bother making
single zeta plus polarization.

00:42:39.517 --> 00:42:41.100
They'll say, OK,
we'll do double zeta.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:42.724
And then after you
do double zeta, then

00:42:42.724 --> 00:42:44.310
maybe you want to
go to polarization.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:45.934
Or maybe you want to
go to triple zeta,

00:42:45.934 --> 00:42:47.235
depending on what you're doing.

00:42:47.235 --> 00:42:48.151
Does that makes sense?

00:42:48.151 --> 00:42:49.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.210
TROY VAN VOORHIS:
It would be 1s 1p

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:56.540
for hydrogen, 2s 1d for carbon.

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:59.410
It would just be to add that
extra polarization function

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:01.850
on top of the existing set.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.740
AUDIENCE: And would the
polarization be the--

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.602
which AO did that come from?

00:43:09.602 --> 00:43:11.060
TROY VAN VOORHIS:
What do you mean?

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:16.340
AUDIENCE: So for hydrogen, would
it be adding the 2p basis or--

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:18.260
TROY VAN VOORHIS: It
would be like adding--

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:21.070
now, so for hydrogen, it
would be like adding--

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:21.570
yeah.

00:43:21.570 --> 00:43:23.430
For hydrogen, it would
be like the 2p function.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.055
But again, when we
go back, we remember

00:43:25.055 --> 00:43:28.370
that we're not actually using
the hydrogenic functions.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:30.920
We're using Gaussians
to approximate them.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.920
And so all it really means is
that it has the same angular

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.510
distribution as a p function.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:38.940
But the radial part
is whatever the person

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.710
who made the basis set
decided to make it.

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:46.460
All right, then I have--

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.145
so then when I teach this class,
I often have clicker questions.

00:43:50.145 --> 00:43:52.020
So this would have been
the clicker question.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.270
So we'll do it by show of
hands instead of by clicker,

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.160
since we're small enough.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:59.270
So here's a test of
whether we understood--

00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:02.360
I can't show-- well, anyway.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:04.922
So I'll go back
and put things up

00:44:04.922 --> 00:44:06.380
in just a second,
if you need them.

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.170
But my question is, how many
basis functions will there

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:14.270
be for C60 in a DZP basis set?

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.780
I guess should say [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.890
So option A is there'll
be 60 basis functions.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.870
So that would be how many basis
functions per carbon atom?

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:23.720
One.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.120
All right, or 180,
that's three per carbon.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.730
360, that's six per carbon.

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:36.102
840 is-- I can't--

00:44:36.102 --> 00:44:37.560
anybody do the math
better than me?

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.120
Is that 14?

00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:39.690
No.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:40.760
No way.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.360
Yeah, it's 14.

00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.400
Yeah, 14-- 14 per carbon.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:51.519
This is-- huh?

00:44:51.519 --> 00:44:52.060
AUDIENCE: 18.

00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:52.935
TROY VAN VOORHIS: 18.

00:44:52.935 --> 00:44:55.200
And then this is
21, then, right?

00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:02.859
Yeah, so we've got,
1, 3, 6, 14, 18, 21

00:45:02.859 --> 00:45:04.400
as the number of
basis functions per.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:08.020
And I'll go back
and throw this up

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:10.090
for those who want the table up.

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:11.600
We didn't write all that down.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.140
So here's our EZP basis set.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.020
Carbon's in this group here.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.820
All right, so then
now I'll go back.

00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:28.920
Everybody feel like
they got their answer?

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.110
OK.

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:30.693
So by a show of
hands, how many people

00:45:30.693 --> 00:45:34.010
think the answer is A, 60?

00:45:34.010 --> 00:45:34.770
Nobody, all right.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.625
How about B?

00:45:38.662 --> 00:45:40.050
C?

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:41.180
We go most on C, OK.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:43.555
D?

00:45:43.555 --> 00:45:45.274
I don't know, E?

00:45:45.274 --> 00:45:46.190
F?

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.720
Everybody says C. C is
not the correct answer.

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:56.260
And every year people
miss this question.

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.824
So the key thing to get
this right-- and we're

00:45:58.824 --> 00:46:00.240
going to re-poll
in a minute here.

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.040
But the key thing
to get this right

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:02.456
was actually the
question that you

00:46:02.456 --> 00:46:07.460
asked, which is that you
said, when I add a d function,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.970
do I add DZ squared, or
do I-- and I said, no,

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:14.240
you add a set of d
functions, which is how many

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:15.690
functions in d?

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:16.350
5.

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:19.790
All right, so now
we'll go back and look.

00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:23.450
All right, but don't feel bad.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:28.530
Every year, the majority of
people choose that same answer.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:31.450
So now let's redo our math.

00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:33.110
AUDIENCE: I've never
gotten it right.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:34.170
TROY VAN VOORHIS:
Never gotten it right?

00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:34.670
OK.

00:46:40.486 --> 00:46:50.990
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.260
All right, so now
we'll go through.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:54.530
OK, how many people think A?

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.497
How many B?

00:46:55.497 --> 00:46:57.580
Nobody's going to say C
because I already told you

00:46:57.580 --> 00:46:58.205
that was wrong.

00:46:58.205 --> 00:46:59.530
How many people say D?

00:46:59.530 --> 00:47:00.946
All right, good,
you're all right.

00:47:00.946 --> 00:47:03.040
Yes, the answer is
D. In a DZP basis

00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:06.760
there are 14 basis
functions per carbon atom.

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.950
Now, you can already
start to see even

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.990
for this DZP basis,
which isn't the biggest

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:13.030
basis we've talked
about, for C60,

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.880
you've got 840 basis functions.

00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.240
That's a lot of basis functions.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.615
So that's why we're really
glad that the computer's doing

00:47:19.615 --> 00:47:24.380
the work and not us
because 840 integrals--

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:29.020
well, 840 by 840 matrices are
hard to diagonalize by hand.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:32.170
Doing all those integrals
is really, really a pain.

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.610
So then going
beyond those basis--

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:37.780
so those two things are
the key basis set ideas.

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.110
I'll just touch on a
couple of other things

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:42.800
before we finish up.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.710
So the first thing
is diffuse functions.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.920
So occasionally,
if you have anion,

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.050
so you have an extra
electron, that extra electron

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.110
is not very well
described by the valence

00:47:53.110 --> 00:47:57.580
because negative electrons tend
to spread out a great deal.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:01.030
Bob is one of the world
experts in Rydberg states,

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:03.580
which is where these electrons
spread out a really, really

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.350
significant amount.

00:48:05.350 --> 00:48:07.780
And so these Gaussian
functions that decay quickly

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:09.310
don't describe those well.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:14.650
And so you have
to add a Gaussian

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:17.914
with a small value of alpha.

00:48:17.914 --> 00:48:19.330
And it's mostly
useful for anions.

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:25.480
So you add these in order
to describe anions better.

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:31.350
And the notation here is
either you use the phrase aug

00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:34.374
or plus to the basis set.

00:48:34.374 --> 00:48:36.540
So if the basis set has the
word aug in front of it,

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:39.090
that means it has some diffuse
functions on it in order

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:42.210
to describe those
weakly bound electrons.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.570
Or the plus indicates it has
some of those functions in it.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.191
And again, those are added
with the same angular

00:48:49.191 --> 00:48:50.190
momentum as the valence.

00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:54.430
They're not usually polarization
and diffuse at the same time.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.540
And then the final thing is
you can generalize these ideas

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.730
to transition metals.

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.950
It's a little bit hazy
because a lot of this

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:06.650
is predicated on us knowing what
the valence of the element is.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:08.730
And for transition metals,
it's like, well, is s

00:49:08.730 --> 00:49:09.630
in the valence?

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:10.560
Yeah, probably.

00:49:10.560 --> 00:49:12.240
Is p in the valence?

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.349
Well, maybe.

00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.890
I don't know.

00:49:13.890 --> 00:49:15.990
D is definitely in the valence.

00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:18.420
But depending on what
you think the valence is,

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:21.210
your definition of some of these
things is a little bit fuzzier.

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.660
Sometimes you add a p function.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.220
Sometimes you don't when
you go from double zeta

00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.640
to triples for a
transition metal.

00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.160
But the overall idea
here is that we're

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.582
trying to approach this
particular limit, which

00:49:33.582 --> 00:49:35.540
is known as the complete
basis set limit, which

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:37.760
is the result that you
would hypothetically

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.790
get with an infinite
number of atomic orbitals.

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.374
So you just crank up, include
all the atomic orbital

00:49:43.374 --> 00:49:44.040
in the universe.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.970
You would get to an answer
that would be the right answer.

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.640
And we're just trying to
asymptotically approach that

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:51.830
by making our basis
sets bigger and bigger

00:49:51.830 --> 00:49:54.400
until we run out of steam.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:57.100
All right, so that's
everything about basis sets.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.510
And tomorrow-- or not
tomorrow, next Monday we

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:02.210
will talk about how
you compute the energy.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.997
All right, Happy Thanksgiving.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Good morning.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
All right.
Today we are going to take a

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
fresh look at some of the stuff
we covered in the last two

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
lectures.
And the graph I want you to

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
keep in mind as we go through
this lecture in terms of what to

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
expect.
This was time.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And last Tuesday's lecture we
covered some stuff.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I talked about a method for the
sinusoidal response which was

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
agony, I warned you it will be
agony, and then towards the end

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I showed you another method that
was quite a bit easier but still

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
pretty hard.
And I promised you that today

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
there will be a new method which
is going to be so easy ,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
actually almost trite.
Just imagine.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I am going to make a statement
right now that I think you will

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
all find hard to believe.
What I am going to say is just

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
imagine your RLC circuit,
your resistor,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
inductor and capacitor,
a parallel form or series form.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Imagine that you could write
down the characteristic equation

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
for that by observation in 30
seconds or less.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Just imagine that.
By observation,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
boom, write down the
characteristic equation for

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
virtually any RLC circuit or RC
circuit or whatever.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And we all know that once you
have the characteristic equation

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
you could very easily go from
there to the time domain

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
response intuitively or to the
sinusoidal steady-state

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
response, too.
So just keep that thought in

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
mind.
Imagine 30 seconds.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And that is what you should
expect in today's lecture.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Students often ask me,
if this stuff is actually so

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
easy why do you take us through
this tortuous path?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Are we just mean?
Do we just want you show you

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
how hard things are and then
show the easy way?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I have argued with myself every
year as to whether to just go

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
ahead and give the easy path and
that's it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
But I think the reason we cover
the basic foundations is that it

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
gives you a level of insight
that you would not have

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
otherwise gotten if I directly
jumped into the easy method.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So you need to understand the
foundations and you need to have

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
seen that at least once.
And second, once you do

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
something the hard way,
you appreciate all the more the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
easy method.
All right.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Today we cover what is called
"The Impedance Model".

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
First let me do a review just
because of the large amount of

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
content in the last two
lectures.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I did them using view graphs.
I usually don't like to do

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that, but even then it was quite
rushed.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So let me quickly summarize for
you kind of the main points.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We have been looking at,
on Tuesday, the sinusoidal --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
--looking at the sinusoidal
steady state response.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Also fondly denoted as SSS.
And the readings for this were

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Chapters 14.1 and 14.2.
what we said was if you took

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000
this example circuit and we fed
as input cosine of omega t,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
we have an R and a C,
and let's say we cared about

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
the output response and we cared
about the capacitor voltage.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
What we talked about was
focused on the sinusoidal

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
steady-state response.
And what that meant was first

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of all focus on steady-state.
In other words,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
just to capture the
steady-state behavior when t

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000
goes to infinity after a long
period of time.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And for most of the circuits
that we consider,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
because of the R or presence of
any resistance,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the homogenous response usually
would die out because the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
homogenous response is usually
of the form minus t by tau.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And as t goes to infinity this
term tends to go to zero.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We are just looking at the
steady-state.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And therefore,
because of the circuits we

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
looked at, we can ignore the
homogenous response.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
All we are left to do is to
find the particular response to

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
sinusoids of this form.
And second was focus on

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
sinusoids.
We said the reason for this was

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that, let's say we did not care
particularly

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What happened when I just
turned on my amplifier.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I just turned on my amplifier,
often times you see some

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
distorted sound coming out for a
few seconds and then hear a much

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
clearer sound.
And that initial part is due to

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
the transient response.
And let's say we don't care

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
about that.
We care about the steady state.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Second we focus on sinusoids
because based on the Fourier

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
series experience that you had
previously, we can represent

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
repeated signals as a sum of
sines.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And therefore it is important
to understand the behavior of

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
these circuits when the input is
a sinusoid.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And what was important was this
introduced a new way of looking

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
at circuits, and that was the
frequency viewpoint.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000
When we looked at transient
responses, we plotted response

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
as a function of time.
And when we look at sinusoidal

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
steady-state,
it becomes interesting to plot

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
the response as a function of
the frequency,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
a function of omega.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
What I will do is draw a little
chart for you to sort of

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
visualize the various processes
we have been going through.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
We can liken obtaining the
sinusoidal steady-state response

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to following these steps.
Here is my input.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.000
What I did as a first step was
fed my input to a usual circuit

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
model.
My elements were lumped

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000
elements, built the circuit and
wrote down the VI relationship

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
for the element.
As a second step I set up the

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
differential equation.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This was the first of four
steps, set up a differential

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
equation.
And then the path that I took

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.000
first was fraught with real
nightmarish trig.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
By the end of the day it would
still yield an answer.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It could be a nightmare.
But I would get something

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
cosine omega t plus something,
some phase.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I could grunge through the
trig.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I gave up halfway in class
here, but you could grunge

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
through it if you would like.
And you would get the answer to

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
be some sinusoid with some
amplitude and some phase.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So Vi cosine omega t would
produce the response that was

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
something cosine omega t plus
some phase.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We said this was too painful so
let's punt this.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Instead, what we said we would
do is take a detour,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:15.000
take an easier path.
And the easier path looked like

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
this.
I said let's sneak in --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
-- Vie^(j omega t) drive.
That is just imagine,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000
do the math as if you had fed
in not a Vi cosine omega t but a

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Vie^(j omega t).
And from Euler's relation you

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
know that the real part is Vi
cosine omega t.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So we said that I am going to
sneak in this thing,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:52.000
find the response and just take
the real part of that because

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
the real part of the input gives
me this.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So this is my "sneaky path".
And what I did there,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
as soon as we fed in the e^(j
omega t), because of the

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.000
property of exponentials,
the e^(j omega t) cancelled out

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in my equation.
And what was left was some

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
fairly simple complex algebra.
And at the end of the day,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
after I grunged through some
fairly simple complex algebra,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I ended up with some response
that looked like this.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Vpe^(j omega t).
What I would find is that for

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the input Vie^(j omega t),
I would get a response Vpe^(j

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
omega t).
And then what I said we would

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:53.000
do is take the real part.
Why take the real part?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Because this is a fake,
a sneaky input.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
The input I really care about
is the real part of the sneaky

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
input.
So this is my sneaky output.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And what I care about is the
real part of the sneaky output.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
That is sort of the inverse
superposition argument that I

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
made on Tuesday that if what I
care about is the real part of

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
this input, then I just take the
real part and get the output

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that I care about.
So I take the real part.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Notice that Vp here,
in the examples we did,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
we did an RC example.
The Vp here was a complex

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
number.
So I could represent that

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
complex number as,
in many ways.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This is e^(j omega t).
I could represent Vp in an

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
amplitude, as a phasor,
actually polar coordinates.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I can say that the equivalent
to Vpe to the j angle Vp.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Vp is a complex number.
If you look at the complex

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
appendix in your course notes,
I can represent a complex

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
number as an amplitude
multiplied by e raised to j

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
times some phase.
It's simple complex algebra.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then what I could do here
is take the real part of that.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And when I took the real part
of that what came about was that

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.000
this was simply Vp.
Notice that the angle Vp goes

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
in here so it becomes j times
omega t plus angle Vp.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It is Vp amplitude times e
raised to j omega t plus j angle

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Vp.
And the real part of that is

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
simply Vp cosine of that stuff.
What I end up getting here is

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Vp cosine omega t plus Vp.
The cool thing to notice was

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
that once I found out this
response here,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I could immediately write down
the output based on Vp.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
In other words,
once I had Vp,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I could stop right there in my
math.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
I got Vp very quickly here.
This step produced Vp very

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
quickly, after two algebraic
steps.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And then from here I could
directly write down the answer

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
as homogenous of Vp cosine omega
t plus angle Vp.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Boom, right there.
So this was a much shorter

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
path.
And here I just described to

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
you how this yields an
expression for Vp and angle Vp.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And for our example Vp was
1/(1+j omega RC).

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And we often times write a
shorthand notation 1+sRC,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000
where S is simply j omega.
We commonly jump back and forth

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
between the shorthand notation S
and j omega.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000
S has some other fundamental,
has another fundamental

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
significance you will learn
about in future courses,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
but for now S is simply a short
form for j omega.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
This was the path that we took.
There is a hard path and an

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
easier path.
Today I am going to claim that

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
even this was too hard.
There is an even easier path.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And today what I am going to
show you is that from here we

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
are going to take one step and
get here.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I am going to show you today
that we won't do this,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we won't do this,
not this, not this,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.000
none of this.
One step and then we are going

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to get the answer.
So let's do that.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Before we jump into the
impedance method and get into

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
doing that, I just would like to
plot for you this function here

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
just so we can understand a
little bit better exactly what

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.000
is going on.
As I mentioned to you,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
the output vO for our circuit
there was simply Vp cosine of

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:49.000
omega T plus angle Vp.
Oh, that's Vp so this one

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
should be Vi here.
I am showing you Vp so there is

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
a Vi in there.
Vp/Vi=1/(1+j omega RC).

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
This is a complex number,
and it is simply a number that

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
when multiplied with Vi gives me
the output.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
This is also called a transfer
function and represented as H(j

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
omega).
This guy is a transfer

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000
function, much like the gain of
my amplifier.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Which when multiplied by the
input to get me the output.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
This guy is a complex
multiplier which when multiplied

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
by Vi gives me Vp.
And as such we call it a

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
transfer function H(j omega).
And we can plot this function.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Notice that this a function of
omega.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Remember we are taking the
frequency domain view,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
so where has time vanished?
Remember that we are taking the

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
steady state view.
So we are saying in the steady

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
state, if I wait long enough
this is how my circuit is going

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
to behave, this is how a circuit
is going to behave.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And the transient responses
have died away and I have time

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
in my output here so my output
is a cosine.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
But that in itself is not very
interesting.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
It is a cosine of some
amplitude and has some phase.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What we will plot is we are
going to plot this property

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
here, Vp as a function of the
frequency.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Vp is frequency dependent.
As an example,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I could plot the absolute value
of Vp/Vi, the modulus of that

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
versus omega.
And notice that when omega is

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
zero again intuitive ways of
plotting this is to look at the

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
value at zero and look at the
value at large omega.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
For small omega,
omega goes to zero this is one,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000
so it starts off here.
And when omega is very large

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
then it is much bigger than one
here, so this goes down.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Far away this one looks like
1/omega RC.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And this function,
assuming I have linear scales

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000
on my X and Y axes looks like
this.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
We also commonly plot this
using log-log scales.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And when you do log-log scales
you get a straight line here,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
and then you actually get a
straight line of slope minus one

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
because the log of this gives
you a line with a constant

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
slope, it's a slope of negative
one so it becomes a straight

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
line going down.
The other interesting thing to

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
realize is that this magnitude
is simply one by one plus omega

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000
squared R squared C squared,
the square root of this.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
That's the magnitude here.
And notice when omega equals

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
1/RC, this thing,
the denominator becomes one by

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:27.000
square root of 2.
Somewhere here when omega

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
equals 1/RC
The output is one by square

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
root 2 times the input.
It's an interesting point.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
And this is called the "break
frequency".

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
You can view it as a frequency
where I am getting this

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
transition from one to a lower
value, and it is where the

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
output is one by square root two
times the value of the input.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Now you can think back on the
demo we showed you earlier.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And in the demo remember that
as I increased the frequency of

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
my input sinusoid my output kept
becoming smaller and smaller and

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
smaller.
And you notice that you can see

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
this dying out or decaying of
the amplitude as I increase my

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
omega.
Let me go back.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
What you have done is that,
we're going to apply a bunch of

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
sinusoids to the same circuit
and plot the frequency response,

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
the ratio of the output versus
input as a function of

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
frequency.
And kept applying a variety of

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
frequencies.
So you can listen to the

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
frequencies as they go by,
and we will plot the amplitude

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
up on the screen for you.
Just for fun we are going to

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
play frequencies between,
say, 10 hertz and 20 kilohertz.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
It will be fun for you to
figure out at what point you

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.000
stop hearing the frequencies.
We are going to play from 10

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
hertz to 20 kilohertz.
And figure out where your ears

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
cut out.
That will tell you what the

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
break frequency of your ear is.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
You can see the amplitude being
articulated.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000
The bottom figure is the phase.
This is the frequency axis.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
This is the amplitude,
log-log scales.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I am not sure about you but I
cannot hear anymore.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
If you bring your canine
friends to class it is quite

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
possible that they would go
berserk somewhere here.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
As I promised you,
when I plot this on a log-log

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
scale I get a straight line here
and a straight line out there as

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:30.000
well and the bottom line gives
you the phase.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Now, what you can also do is
you can also go to Websim.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Websim is now linked on your
course homepage.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You can go to Websim and you
can play with various L and C

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
and R values.
And if you plot frequency

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
response, if you click on the
frequency response button,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
boom, it will give you
frequency responses for your

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
circuit that look exactly like
that.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
You can go and play around with
that.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Thank you.
All right.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:08.000
As the next step I promised to
show you an easier path.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And let's build some insight.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Is there a simpler way to get
where we would like to get?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.000
In particular,
is there a simpler way to get

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Vp?
Let's focus on Vp.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Why Vp?
Because remember Vp was the

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
complex amplitude of e to the j
omega t.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And once I know Vp then I know
this expression here.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Also notice that this here,
the denominator is simply the

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
characteristic equation for,
I wonder how many of you

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
noticed it, is simply the
characteristic equation for the

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
RC circuit.
If I can write down Vp,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
I can write down the
characteristic equation,

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
it will be in the denominator.
I can also write down the

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
frequency response very easily
by taking the magnitude and

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
phase of Vp.
So Vp has all the information

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
humankind needs for those
circuits.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Is there a simpler way to get
Vp?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
To bring some insight,
let's go ahead and write down

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
--

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Let's stare at this for a while
longer and see if light bulbs go

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
off in our minds.
Of course, I could write this

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
as Vi/(1+sRC).
I just replaced the shorthand

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
notation for a j omega.
And I simply divide by SC

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
throughout.
So I get Vi times,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
I simply divide by SC
throughout.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Here is Vi.
I have one by SC,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000
one by SC plus R.
Light bulbs beginning to go

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
off?

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000
The form we have here is 1/SC,
some function of my capacitance

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:37.000
divided by something connected
to my capacitance plus R.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
This is Vi multiplied by
something connected to

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:48.000
capacitance divided by something
connected to capacitance plus R.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
And remember your circuit.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
What is that reminiscent of?
What does that remind you of?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Voltage divider?
Hmm.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
There is some voltage divider
thing going on here.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I just cannot quite pin it.
It is something about the

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
capacitor, capacitor plus
booster, some voltage divider

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000
thingamajig happening here.
We will try to figure that out.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:32.000
What I will do is replace those
terms with something called Zc.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Zc plus Zr.
If I can find out the Zr and Zc

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
somehow, I can write down the Vp
by inspection by the voltage

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
divider action,
by some generalization of the

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
good old Ohm's law that I know
about.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Let's proceed further and see
if we can make some kind of a

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
connection between this and
this.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
If I can make the connection
then boom, I'm done.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I will just use voltage
dividers and I am home.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
OK, so let's play around and
see.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
There is something in there.
By now you should know that we

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
are very close.
There is something going on in

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.000
there.
I just need to get that spark.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
I just need to make that spark
so I can bridge the gap between

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
something that is really easy
versus where I am.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Let's take a look at the
resistor.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
I have my resistor with the
voltage vR across it and a

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
current iR.
Remember to get to any sort of

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:11.000
steady state you are going to be
dealing with the drives of the

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
form vI e to the j omega t,
exponential drives.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
And by taking the real part,
I know I get the input,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
and the real part of the output
gives me the actual output.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Let's say my iR is simply
Ire^st and my vR is Vre^st.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
The S is, again,
a shorthand notation for j

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
omega.
If my current Ire^st of the

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
exponential form shown there and
here is Vr, I need to find out

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:53.000
what relates Vr and Ir for the
element relationship for the

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
resistor to hold.
In general, Ir and Vr are

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000
complex numbers.
For the resistor,

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:08.000
I know that Vr=RIr.
And I substitute using my

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
complex drives here.
So it is Vre^st=RIre^st.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:21.000
I am just substituting for
these drives,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Ohm's law should apply,
and I cancel off e^st.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
And so I get Vr=RIr.
Interesting.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000
For the resistor I find that,
based on the fundamental

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
principles of resistor action,
the complex amplitude of the

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000
voltage simply relates to the
complex amplitude of the input

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:56.000
by the proportionality factor R.
In other words,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
for the resistor --
Just as the time domain V and I

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000
were related by the
proportionality constant R,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:11.000
the complex amplitudes Vr and
Ir are also related in the same

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
way.
That's interesting.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Now let's look at the
capacitor.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Some current ic flowing through
it and a voltage vc.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Let's say the current is Ice^st
and the voltage is Vce^st.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Let's plug these into the
element law for the capacitor

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:59.000
and see if we can find out a way
of relating vc and ic.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
I know that ic is simply
Cdvc/dt.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:18.000
So I replace this with
Ice^st=Cd/dt(vce^st),

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:30.000
which is simply
Ice^st=CsVce^st.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So I can cancel this out again.
Interesting.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Ic=CsVc.
Very interesting.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:42.000
What is interesting here?
Notice that in the time domain

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Ic=Cdvc/dt, the element law for
the capacitor.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
So I said let's use exponential
drives, Ice^st,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Vce^st, that's an exponential
drive, and try to find out what

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
the relationship between the
complex amplitudes are.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.000
I plug them and what do I find?
I find that if my input is

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Vce^st, and Vc is the amplitude
of the input,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000
then the current is simply
given by something multiplied

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Vc.
It's very similar in form to

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
what I saw here.
The resistor,

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Vr=RIr.
For the capacitor,

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Vc=Ic/sc.
1/sc kind of plays the role of

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
R.
In other words,

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
the complex amplitudes around
the capacitor are related by Vc

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:56.000
equals some constant times Ic.
Almost like a funny Ohm's law

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:05.000
kind of relationship where Vc
and IC are complex amplitudes.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
For the inductor it is the same
way, iL, vL and L.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Let's say iL=Ile^st and
vL=Vle^st.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Substitute the values for the
inductor into its element

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000
relationship as well.
I know that vL=LdiL/dt.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Therefore, substituting the
complex amplitudes is L.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
And diL/dt will simply be
Ilse^st.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
So I cancel out the
exponentials.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000
The reason we're able to do all
of this is simply the remarkable

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000
beauty of exponentials.
Exponentials are absolutely

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
stunningly beautiful.
The reason is that when I

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
differentiate them what I get
back is the exponential times

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
some constant,
and the constant was in its

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
numerator multiplying t.
And that's the beauty of

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
exponentials.
If this was a sine then I would

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
get cosine and a sine.
With exponentials these cancel

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:34.000
out and what I am left with is
something that is LsIl.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Again, for the inductor,
the voltage across the inductor

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
relates to some constant Ls here
times Il.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:54.000
This is absolutely stunning and
almost looks like a form of

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Ohm's law here.
What I am going to do is let's

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
give this the name Zr.
Let's give this 1/sC the name

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Zc.
And let's give this the name

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
ZL.
It kind of behaves like a

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
resistor, so the resistor simply
becomes Zr.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
And 1/sC behaved like a
resistor so I called it Zc.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And this is a ZL.
These are called "impedances".

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
In other words,
for a capacitor,

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:52.000
as far as complex inputs and
outputs are concerned,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
if Vc and Ic is fed to it,
the capacitor can be replaced

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000
by an impedance Zc where I can
write the relationship between

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Vc and Ic as Vc=ZcIc.
Where Zc is simply one by sc.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Similarly, for an inductor --

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:37.000
-- I can write its impedance ZL
as sL and I get Vl=ZLIl.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:46.000
And finally for a resistor it
is pretty simple.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
What I am saying is that if I
am in the region of the

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
playground, if I constrain
myself in the region of the

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
playground where my inputs are
something Vi e to the j omega t

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
or exponentials,
in that little region of the

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:21.000
playground now,
I am focusing more and more on

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
small parts of the playground so
I am kind of boxed in right now.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
In that region of the
playground this applies.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
In that region of the
playground, I can replace

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
resistors by impedances,
capacitors with impedances of

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
value 1/sC.
And within that playground the

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:48.000
beauty of analysis there is that
in that region of the playground

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:54.000
where the inputs are of the form
Vie^st, it turns out that the

00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000
element laws are simply
generalizations of Ohm's law.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
That is absolutely stunning.
It is one of the biggest

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
hallelujah moments in learning
circuits.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
This is really big.
And I think this is almost as

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
big as the realization that you
can take a nonlinear circuit,

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
operate it at a given operating
point, and you can sit around

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.000
doing Zen things,
looking at small perturbations

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
in there, those are going to be
linearly related.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:31.000
This is one of the big
hallelujah moments in 6.002.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
And this is of the same
magnitude as the small signal

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
response being linear.
It is something that is

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000
completely non-intuitive.
It is something that you just

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
would not have known until you
had seen it happen.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
The same way here.
This is very important so I

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:49.000
will repeat it again.
I have boxed myself into this

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
small region of the playground
where all I care about are

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
sinusoidal inputs and
steady-state responses.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
So there I focus on complex
inputs, Vi e to the j omega t.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000
And I have just shown you that
I can replace inductors,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
capacitors, resistors with
their impedances.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
And the amplitudes of the
corresponding signals around

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
them are related by just a
simple Ohm's law like

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000
relationship using impedances.
I am sort of boxed into this

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
playground, right?
In my playground it is all

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000
about e to the ij omega t.
e to the ij omega t is implicit

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
everywhere.
I just don't show it.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
If I want to talk to somebody
else outside but within MIT in

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
this small region,
it's all e to the ij omega t in

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
there.
If I want to talk to somebody

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
outside, get out of MIT,
get out of this playground,

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
what else do I have to do?
I have to take the real part.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Don't forget that.
Remember that,

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
take for example Vc here,
so Vc is this,

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
so implicit in all of this is
that if I measure Vc at some

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
place it is really going to be
Vce to the j omega t.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:07.000
And if we the cosine,
the real part,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:10.000
then I have to take a real part
of this.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
And the real part of that would
Vc cosine of omega t angle Vc.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
This piece here kind of goes
unsaid.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
We will agree that we have to
do it, but we just skip that

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
step because it is obvious.
We just deal with Vcs and Vls

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
now.
So a new notation certainly

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
sneaked by you,
and that notation looks like a

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:45.000
big letter and a small letter.
Remember you have seen vL,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
this is the total behavior,
you have seen vl,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.000
that's a small signal behavior,
and now you see this,

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Vl, capital V small l.
And we also have DC,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
we have labeled operating point
values as VL,

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
capital V, capital L.
We have one thing left so

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
nobody go out there inventing
something new because we would

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
be in trouble.
This is capital V,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
small l, and this is simply
"complex amplitude" in the small

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:27.000
boxed region of my playground
where good things happen and

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
exponentials fly.
Whenever someone gives you a

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
variable, capital V,
small l, remember it's a

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
complex amplitude,
a complex number,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
and you know how to get to the
time domain from there.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
You take that number,
take the real part,

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
multiple the number by e to the
j omega t and take the real

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
part, which is tantamount to
magnitude cosine omega t plus

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
angle of that number.
Actually, you know what?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Let's send this up.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Back to an example.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
This is not good.
This is my time domain circuit.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Remember this was my time
domain circuit.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
A vI input.
A vC output.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I wanted to analyze this.
What I am telling you now is

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000
let's box ourselves in this
impedance playground.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
And in the impedance playground
the input becomes the complex

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
amplitude of the input,
my resistance gets replaced by

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000
a box Zr, my capacitor gets
replaced by a box Zc.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000
And the voltage I care about
here is Vc.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Zr = R and Zc=1/sC.
Now, there we go.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:25.000
I can write down Vc using a
voltage divider action as Vc is

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:35.000
simply Zc/(Zc+Zr),
done, times Vi of course.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.000
And that gives me 1/sC divided
by 1/sC+R and multiplying

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:48.000
throughout by sC I get 1/1+sCR
where S is j omega.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Just cannot get any simpler.
How long did I take to do this?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
30 seconds.
Where I spent a whole lecture

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
on Tuesday grinding through
first trig, giving up halfway

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
and collapsing,
and then showing you the sneaky

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:16.000
path which was still pretty
painful, but 30 seconds,

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000
boom.
This stuff is spectacularly

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
beautiful.
The really cool thing here is

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:28.000
that in this impedance domain
for linear circuits all your

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:33.000
good old tricks apply.
Your Thevenin,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
your Norton,
your superposition,

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
name it and it applies for this
linear circuit.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000
If you close your eyes and make
believe that Zr is like an R and

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
simply apply all the techniques
you have learned so far in this

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
linear playground.
Just a little hack at the end

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
where this is the complex
amplitude.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:58.000
And if you want to go to the
time domain part then you do the

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
usual thing.
Modulus Vc cosine omega t plus

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
angle Vc.
Just remember that.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
That's the jump to get back to
the time domain.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Just to show you that this not
just works for one little

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000
rinky-dink circuit here,
let me take a more complicated

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
circuit.
If I believe in my own BS,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000
I should be able to apply this
theory to my series RLC,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000
the big painful circuit that we
did differential equations for

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
about a week ago.
Let's do it.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I have an inductor,
a capacitor and a resistor.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:51.000
What I am going to do is
replace this with the impedance

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
model.
Input Vi.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Let's say this was vI.
Let's say I cared about vR.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:05.000
L, C and R.
The impedance model would

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:11.000
simply be Vi.
What's the impedance of an

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
inductor?
SL.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
And for the capacitor it is
1/sC.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.000
And for a resistor it is simply
R.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.000
And just remember,
if I can find out VR then for

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:38.000
an input cosine of the form Vi
cosine omega t the output will

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:48.000
given by |Vr| cosine of omega t
plus angle Vr.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Just remember this last step.
But Vr itself is trivially

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
determined.
It is the voltage divider

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:03.000
action again times Vi.
And the voltage divider action

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:09.000
is in the denominator I sum
these thingamajigs,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
so ZL+ZC+ZR,
ZR in the numerator.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
And Zr is simply R.
ZL is sL.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Zc is 1/sC.
And R is R.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Vi.
And I multiply through by,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:30.000
in this particular situation,
by s/L.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:38.000
I want to get it into the same
form as you've seen before.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Multiply throughout,
the numerator and denominator

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
by s/L, what do I get?
I get RS/L and out here I end

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:03.000
up getting S squared plus 1/LC,
and I get plus R/L S.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
I am done.
Look at that.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Well, a little more than 30
seconds.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Maybe a minute.
What is this?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Where have you seen this
before?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
The denominator of this
expression here?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Ah, characteristic equation for
the RLC.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Remember I promised you in the
beginning that when we come to

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
the end of the day using a
simple one-minute expression I

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:32.000
am going to write down the
characteristic equation?

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Boom, here is what I get.
Did somebody hear an echo in

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
there?
Notice that just by doing a

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
simple voltage divider
thingamajig, I got this

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
expression.
And now I can write down the

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
frequency response by replacing
s is equal to j omega.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Even more beautiful and what is
even more stunningly pretty here

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000
is that remember the intuitive
method I taught you about?

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:06.000
The characteristic equation
gives you alpha,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
omega nought,
omega d and Q.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
And based on those we can
sketch even the time domain

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
response.
Guess what?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
RLC circuits are passÈ now.
You can just write this thing

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
down and you're done,
30 seconds or less.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
No DEs, no trig,
no nothing.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
OK.

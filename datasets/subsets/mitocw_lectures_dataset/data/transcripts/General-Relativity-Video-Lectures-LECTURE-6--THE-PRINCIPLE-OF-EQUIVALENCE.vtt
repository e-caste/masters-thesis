SCOTT HUGHES: So
we're just picking up

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.525
where we stopped last time.

00:00:12.525 --> 00:00:15.840
So we are beginning
to discuss how

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.710
we are going to sort of
do a geometrical approach

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.210
to physics, using a more
general set of coordinates now.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.270
So we began talking about how
things change when I discuss

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.860
special relativity,
so for the moment

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.080
keeping ourselves just
at special relativity.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.570
We, by the way, are going to
begin lifting our assumptions

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.912
that it is simply special
relativity fairly soon.

00:00:36.912 --> 00:00:38.370
But to set that
up, I need to start

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.890
thinking about how to work
in more general coordinate

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.910
systems.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.620
So we're going to do it in the
simplest possible curvilinear

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.120
coordinates.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.850
So it's basically just going
from Cartesian coordinates

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.210
in the spatial sector to
plane polar coordinates.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.460
One of the things which I
have emphasized a few times,

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.200
and I'm going to
continue to hammer on,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.640
is that these are a little bit
different from the curvilinear

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
coordinates that you are
used to in your past life.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.020
In particular, if I write
out the displacement,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.610
the little vector of
the displacement element

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.950
in the usual way,
I am using what's

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.250
called a "coordinate basis,"
which means that the vector

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.490
dx is related to the
displacement, the differential

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.770
of the coordinates, by
just that thing contracted

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.750
with all the basis vectors.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.480
And so what that means is I have
a little displacement in time,

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.620
which looks normal.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.170
Displacement in radius,
which looks normal.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.420
Displacement in the z
direction, which looks normal,

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.248
and a displacement in an
angle, which does not.

00:01:33.248 --> 00:01:35.790
In order for this whole thing
to be dimensionally consistent,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.530
that's telling me e phi has to
have the dimensions of length.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.280
And that is a
feature, not a bug.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.750
Last time, we
introduced the matrix

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.150
that allows me to convert
between one coordinate system

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.452
and another, so just
basically the matrix--

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:51.660
it's sort of a Jacobi matrix.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.090
It's a matrix of
partials between the two

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.920
coordinate systems.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.290
And this idea that things are--

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.350
they look a little weird.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.725
So the way I did that was I
didn't actually write it out,

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:04.650
but I did the usual mapping
between x, y and r and phi,

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.038
worked out all of
my derivatives.

00:02:07.038 --> 00:02:08.580
And sure enough,
you've got something

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.470
that looks very standard,
with the possible exception

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.070
of these r's that are
appearing in here.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.710
So notice the elements
of this matrix.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.690
These do not have
consistent units--

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.030
again, feature, not bug.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.492
This guy is basically
just the inverse of that.

00:02:20.492 --> 00:02:22.450
This is the matrix that
affects the coordinates

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.533
in the opposite direction.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:26.290
And notice in this case,
you have some elements where

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.820
their units are 1 over length.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:33.470
So let's just continue
to sort of catalog

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.970
what some of the things we are
going to be working with look

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.280
like in this new
coordinate representation.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.160
And this will lead
us to introduce

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.900
one of the mathematical
objects that we

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.850
are going to use extensively
as we move forward

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.400
in studying this subject.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.310
So what I want to do
next is look at what

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.650
my basis vectors look like.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.180
So what I want to do
is characterize what

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.310
my e r and my e phi look like.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.380
And these are going to look very
familiar from your intuition,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.510
from having studied
things like E&M

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.550
in non-Cartesian coordinates.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.590
So your e r is just related to
the original Cartesian basis

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.595
vectors, like so.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.720
And if you like, you
can easily read that out

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.200
by performing the
following matrix

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
multiplication on the original
Cartesian basis vectors.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.110
Your e phi perhaps
looks a little wacky.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.380
So you can see the length
coming into play there.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.520
A good way to think about
this is if your intuition

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.710
about basis factors--

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.710
I have to be careful with
this language myself--

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.127
your intuition
about basis vectors

00:04:02.127 --> 00:04:04.010
is typically that
they are unit vectors.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.540
These are not unit vectors.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.690
They do form a nice basis,
but they are not unit vectors.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.120
In particular, the basic idea
we're going to go with here

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.060
is that e phi, it's always
going to sort of point

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.710
in the tangential direction.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.714
But no matter where
I put it in radius,

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:20.089
I want that vector
to always sort

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.060
of subtend the same
amount of angle.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.252
In order to do that, its
length needs to grow with r.

00:04:26.252 --> 00:04:27.710
So that's where
that's a little bit

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.600
different from your intuition.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.280
And there's a very
good reason for this,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.905
which we will get to, hopefully,
well before the end of today's

00:04:33.905 --> 00:04:35.730
class.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.640
So last time, when
we first began

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.130
to talk about tensors a
couple of lectures ago,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.780
the first tensor I gave you--

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.470
so confining ourselves just
to Cartesian coordinates--

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.910
was the metric,
which was originally

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.540
introduced as this
mathematical object that

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.958
came out of looking at dot
products between basis vectors.

00:05:02.958 --> 00:05:04.500
It's essentially a
tensor that allows

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.230
me to feed in two
displacements and get

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.340
the invariant interval between
those displacements that

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.090
comes out of that.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.360
I am going to continue to call
the dot product of two basis

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.350
vectors the "metric."

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.900
But I'm going to use a slightly
different symbol for this.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.400
I'm going to call
this g alpha beta.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.590
In the coordinate representation
that we are using right now,

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:45.680
so in plane polar
coordinates, this becomes--

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.650
you can work it out from what
I've written down right here.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.980
This is just the diagonal
of minus 1, 1 r squared 1.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:59.970
So this equals dot here.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.590
This is-- I'll put PPC for plane
polar coordinates under that.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.190
And then using that, you
know that you can always

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.840
work out the invariant
displacement between two

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.350
events.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:24.660
It's always going to be
the metric contracted

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:30.810
with the differential
displacement element.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.560
And this is going to
be minus dt squared

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:41.220
plus dr squared plus r squared
d phi squared plus dz squared.

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:42.785
That, I hope, makes
a lot of sense.

00:06:42.785 --> 00:06:44.160
This is exactly
what you'd expect

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.680
if I have two events
that are separated

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.300
in plane polar coordinates
by dt, dr, d phi, dz.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.660
This is what the distance
between them should be.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.730
So the fact that
my basis vectors

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.040
have this slightly annoying
form associated with them,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.790
it all sort of comes
out in the wash here.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.060
Remember at the end of the day,
if we think about quantities

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.788
that are representation
independent--

00:07:07.788 --> 00:07:09.330
and that's going to
be the key thing.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.560
When you assemble scalars
out of these things,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:16.990
the individual
tensor components,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:19.170
they can be a little
bit confusing sometimes.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.730
They are not things
that we measure.

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.250
They are not things that
really characterize what we

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.690
are going to be working with.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.482
And we really want to
get into the physics,

00:07:26.482 --> 00:07:28.800
unless we're very
careful about it.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.335
This is something
you can measure.

00:07:30.335 --> 00:07:31.710
And so sure enough,
it comes out,

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:33.270
and it's got a
good meaning to it.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:34.980
Let me just wrap
up one last thing

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.230
before I talk about sort of
where we're going with this.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.750
So just for completeness, let me
write down the basis one forms.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:50.290
Just as the basis vectors had a
bit of a funny form associated

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.710
with them, you're going to find
the basis one forms likewise

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.710
have a bit of a funny
form associated with them.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.520
And the way I'm
going to get these--

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.560
and so these are going to be
the Cartesian basis one forms--

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.795
basically, I'm not carefully
proving all these relations

00:08:05.795 --> 00:08:07.920
at this point, because you
all know how to do that.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.630
I'm just using line
up the indices rule.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:24.750
And when you do
that, you get this.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:30.190
And likewise, your basis one
form for the axial direction,

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:39.980
I'll just write down the result.
It's going to look like this.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.745
So the key place where all
of this-- so right now, these

00:08:51.745 --> 00:08:53.120
are all just sort
of definitions.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.390
Nothing I've done here
should be anything

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:58.460
that even approaches a
surprise, I hope, just

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.105
given the you guys have done--

00:09:01.105 --> 00:09:02.480
the key thing
that's probably new

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.970
is all this garbage associated
with coordinate bases,

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.820
this extra factors of r and
1 over r that are popping up.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.090
But provided you're willing to
sort of swallow your discomfort

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.860
and go through
the motions, these

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.560
are not difficult calculations.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.840
The key place where all
of this really matters

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.860
is going to be when we
calculate derivatives of things.

00:09:36.523 --> 00:09:38.440
It'll turn out there is
an important rule when

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.200
we talk about integrals as
well a little bit later,

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.200
but let's just say that.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.985
So for now, we'll
focus on derivatives.

00:09:42.985 --> 00:09:45.360
So all the derivatives that
we've been looking at so far,

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.850
we have, indeed, done a couple
of calculations where we've

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.400
computed the derivatives
of various vector valued

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.250
and tensor valued quantities.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.760
And it was helped by the
fact that all the bases, when

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.520
I work in Cartesian
coordinates, are constant.

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.130
Well, that's not the case now.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:12.150
So now, we need to
account for the fact

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:18.130
that the bases all vary
with our coordinates.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.390
So let me just
quickly make a catalog

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.540
of all the non-trivial--
there's basically four.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.180
In this one, where I'm just
doing plane polar coordinates,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.040
there are four
non-trivial derivatives

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.140
we need to worry about.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.840
One of them actually
turns out to be 0.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:42.170
So the radial derivative of
the radial unit vector is 0.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:50.310
But the phi derivative of
the phi unit vector is not.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.300
you go and take the phi
derivative of this guy,

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:56.340
and you basically get--

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.080
take the phi derivative
of this, you're

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.650
going to get this back,
modulo factor of radius.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:07.920
So I can write d e r
d phi as e phi over r.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.290
If I take the derivative
of e phi with respect to r,

00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.020
I get e phi back, divided by r.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.420
So the simplest way to
write this is like so.

00:11:31.015 --> 00:11:34.180
And finally, if I take the
phi derivative of the phi unit

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.706
vector, I get e r back, with
an extra factor of r thrown in.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:45.320
And a minus sign.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.900
So we're going to see a way of
doing this that's a little bit

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.400
more systematic
later, but I want

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.070
to just keep the simple example,
where you can just basically

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.150
by hand calculate all the
non-trivial derivatives easily.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.775
Of course, there's also a t
unit vector and a z unit vector.

00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:07.400
But they're constants,
so I'm not going

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.525
to bother writing them out.

00:12:08.525 --> 00:12:11.370
All the derivatives associated
with them are equal to 0.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:17.600
So let's imagine now that I
have assembled some vector.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.250
So I have some vector field
that lives in this spacetime.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.580
And I'm using this basis.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.830
And so I would write this
vector with components v alpha.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.628
And let's let the--

00:12:27.628 --> 00:12:29.920
so this is going to be a
curvilinear coordinate system,

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.490
so this will be plane polar
coordinates being used here,

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.060
plane polar coordinate
basis vectors.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.845
And what I would like to
do is assemble the tensor

00:12:43.845 --> 00:12:45.220
that you can think
of essentially

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:47.790
as the gradient of this vector.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:51.130
So let's begin by doing this
in a sort of abstract notation.

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.030
So the gradient of this guy--
this is sort of ugly notation,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.860
but live with it.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.420
Following what we have
been doing all along, what

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.150
you would want to
do is just take

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.100
the root of this whole thing.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.560
It's going to have a
downstairs component on it.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:12.490
So attach to it
the basis one form.

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:15.160
If you prefer, you can write
it using the d notation

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.848
like I have there,
but I just want

00:13:16.848 --> 00:13:18.640
to stick with the form
I wrote in my notes.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.290
Looking at this the way I've
sort of got this right now,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.600
I can think of, if I
don't include the basis

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:41.290
one forms here, this should be
the components of a one form.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.750
So this should be
a kind of object.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.884
So let's just expand
out that derivative.

00:13:55.610 --> 00:13:56.950
Let's write it like this.

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:03.535
So you just-- we haven't
changed calculus.

00:14:03.535 --> 00:14:05.410
So when I do this, I'm
going to basically use

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:08.170
the old-fashioned Leibniz
rule for expanding

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:09.840
the derivative
product of two things.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.020
Here's the key thing which
I want to emphasize--

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.790
in order for this
whole thing to be--

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:34.780
for this to be a tensorial
object, something that I couple

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:41.310
to this basis one form, the
sum of these two objects

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.400
must obey the rules for
transforming tensors.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.680
But the two objects
individually will not.

00:15:01.822 --> 00:15:03.280
So this is an
important point which

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.650
I'm going to emphasize in
slightly different words

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.005
in just a few moments again.

00:15:07.005 --> 00:15:09.130
This is one of the key
things I want you to get out

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.297
of this lecture, is that
when I'm taking derivatives

00:15:11.297 --> 00:15:13.278
of things like this,
you've got to be

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:15.820
a little bit careful about what
you consider to be components

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.110
of tensors and what is not.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:23.050
Now as written like that,
this is kind of annoying.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:30.100
So my first object has a nice
basis vector attached to it.

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.820
My second object involves a
derivative of the basis vector.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.710
However, something
we saw over here

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.600
is that derivatives
of basis vectors

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.910
are themselves proportional
to basis vectors.

00:15:44.858 --> 00:15:47.150
So what I'm going to do is
introduce a bit of notation.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.510
So let me switch
notation slightly here.

00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:12.220
So the beta derivative of
e alpha can be written as--

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.970
in general, it can be written
as a linear combination

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:16.900
of basis vectors.

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:37.350
So what we're going
to do is define d--

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.850
I want to make sure my Greek
letters are legible to everyone

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:40.480
in the room here.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.063
So let me write this
nice and clearly.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:55.860
d beta of e alpha, I'm going to
write that as capital gamma mu

00:16:55.860 --> 00:17:01.200
beta alpha e mu.

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:05.670
This gamma that I've just
introduced here in this context

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:08.310
is known as the
Christoffel symbol.

00:17:15.138 --> 00:17:17.680
Fact I'm calling this a symbol,
it's got three indices on it.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.129
You might look at it and go,
ooh, smells like a tensor.

00:17:20.129 --> 00:17:21.129
Be a little bit careful.

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:28.420
In much the same way that these
two terms are not individually

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.600
components of a tensor,
but their sum is,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:33.460
this guy individually
is actually

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.620
not a component of
a tensor, but when

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.340
combined with other things, it
allows us to assemble tensors.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:18:10.530
So for our plane
polar coordinates,

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:15.070
there are exactly three
non-zero Christoffel symbols.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:22.970
So gamma phi r phi is equal
to 1 over r, which is also

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:28.130
equal to gamma phi phi r.

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.820
Gamma r phi phi is minus r.

00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:38.070
And you can basically just
read that out of that table

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:40.080
that I wrote down over there.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.640
All the others
will be equal to 0.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:53.226
Now from this
example, this is what

00:18:53.226 --> 00:18:55.500
it makes it smell like
every time you introduce

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.070
a new coordinate representation.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.072
You're going to need to sit
down for an hour and a half,

00:19:02.072 --> 00:19:03.780
or something like
that, and just work out

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.405
all the bloody derivatives, and
then go, oh, crap, and read out

00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:08.197
all the different
components of this thing,

00:19:08.197 --> 00:19:09.557
and assemble them together.

00:19:09.557 --> 00:19:11.140
There actually is
an algorithm that we

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:12.848
will get to at the
end of this class that

00:19:12.848 --> 00:19:17.310
allows you to easily extract
the Christoffel symbols provided

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.420
you know the metric.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:21.060
But right now, I just want
to illustrate this thing

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:21.660
conceptually.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.610
The key thing which you
should know about it

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:27.280
is that it is essentially the--

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.120
I almost said the word "matrix,"
but it's got three indices.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:34.470
It's a table of
functions that allows

00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:38.040
me to relate derivatives
of basis vectors

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:38.970
to the basis vectors.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.690
So before I go on to talk
about some of that stuff,

00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:51.440
let's take a look at the
derivative a little bit more

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.323
carefully.

00:20:20.255 --> 00:20:21.630
So the derivative
of the vector--

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.230
so let's basically take what
I've written out up there.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:28.070
I'm going to write this as
the beta derivative of vector

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:35.510
v. And I can write that as
the beta derivative of e of v

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:36.950
alpha--

00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:39.290
so the first term
where the derivative

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:40.901
hits the vector components.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.490
And then I've got
a second term where

00:20:45.490 --> 00:20:50.300
the derivative hits the basis.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:51.760
I'm going to write this like so.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.040
This is sort of annoying.

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.200
One term is
proportional to e alpha,

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.970
one is proportional to e mu.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.560
But notice, especially in the
second term, both alpha and mu

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.740
are dummy indices, so
I'm free to relabel them.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:13.870
So what I'm going to
do is relabel alpha

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:20.340
and mu by exchanging them.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:31.660
As long as I do
that consistently,

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.490
that is totally kosher.

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:46.140
And when I do that, I can
factor out an overall factor

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.040
of the basis object.

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:54.340
This combination
that pops up here--

00:21:57.290 --> 00:21:59.480
so we give this a name.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.660
And this is a combination
which, by the time

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:05.140
you have finished this semester,
if you don't have at least

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:07.180
one nightmare in which
this name appears,

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.960
I will not have done
my job properly.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.580
This shows up a
lot at this point.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:17.133
This is called the
"covariant derivative."

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.090
And it shows up enough
that we introduce

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.780
a whole new notation
for the derivative

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.550
to take it into account.

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.290
I'm going to call
this combination

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:37.230
of the partial
derivative of v and v

00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:40.940
coupled to the
Christoffel symbol--

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:50.830
I'm going to write this using
the, if you're talking LaTeX,

00:22:50.830 --> 00:22:54.460
this would be the
nabla operator.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.530
So I made a point
earlier when we

00:22:57.530 --> 00:22:59.530
were talking about
derivatives a couple of weeks

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:05.740
ago that we were reserving
the gradient symbol

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:07.570
for a special purpose later.

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:08.980
Here it is.

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.320
So whenever I make
a derivative that

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.990
involves the gradient
symbol like this,

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.000
it is this covariant derivative.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.890
And the covariant derivative
acting on vector components,

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:23.710
it generates tensor components.

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.177
Partial derivative does not.

00:23:26.177 --> 00:23:28.510
And what I'm going to do,
just in the interest of time--

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.718
it's one of those calculations
that's straightforward

00:23:30.718 --> 00:23:31.600
but fairly tedious--

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.150
I have a set of
notes that I meant

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.550
to make live before I headed
over here, but I forgot.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.160
I have a set of notes that I'm
going to show on the website

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:43.810
by this evening which explicitly
works out what happens when you

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.360
apply the coordinate
transformation using that--

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.410
it's been erased--

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.520
when you use that L
matrix to construct

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.270
the coordinate transformation
between two representations.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.990
If you try to do it to
partial derivatives of vector

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:57.880
components, basically
what you find

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:00.910
is that there's an extra
term that spoils your ability

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.510
to call that-- it spoils the
tensor transformation law,

00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:07.360
spoils your ability to call
that a tensor component.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.790
So the partial on its
own doesn't let you.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.840
You get some extra terms that
come along and mess it all up.

00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.700
On next p set,
you guys are going

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.800
to show that if you then try to
apply the tensor transformation

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.500
law to the Christoffel
symbols, you

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.390
get something that
looks tensorial,

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.880
but with an extra term
that spoils your ability

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.210
to call it tensorial.

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.660
There's a little bit
of extra junk there.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.670
But the two terms
exactly conspire

00:24:33.670 --> 00:24:37.990
to cancel each other out so
that the sum is tensorial.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:39.610
So part one of
this will be notes

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:42.490
that I post to the website
no later than this evening.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:44.265
Part two, you guys
will do on the p set.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.270
So just saying in
math what I just

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:10.290
said in words, if I
do this, like I said,

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.530
you basically will
eventually reach the point

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:17.910
where what I am
writing out right now

00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:24.200
will become so automatic
it will haunt your dreams.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.580
Wait a minute, I
screwed that up.

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:27.622
It's so automatic I can't
even write it properly.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:38.482
Anyhow, something like that
will-- modulo my typo--

00:25:38.482 --> 00:25:39.690
that should become automatic.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.273
And the key thing
which I want to note

00:25:41.273 --> 00:25:51.840
is that if I take these
guys, and I attach

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:58.590
the appropriate basis
objects to them,

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.390
this is an honest-to-god tensor.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.820
And so this derivative is
itself an honest-to-god tensor.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.850
A typical application
of this, so one

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:09.180
that will come up a
fair bit, is how do you

00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:12.600
compute a spacetime divergence
in each coordinate system?

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:38.148
So suppose I take the divergence
of some vector field v.

00:26:38.148 --> 00:26:40.350
So you're going to
have four terms that

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.930
are just the usual, like
when you guys learned

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.840
how to do divergence in freshman
E&M in Cartesian coordinates.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.840
You get one term that's just
dv x dx, dv y dy, et cetera.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.000
So you got one term that
looks just like that,

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.917
and you're going to have
something that brings

00:26:55.917 --> 00:26:57.240
in all of Christoffel symbols.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.090
Notice the symmetry that
we have on this one.

00:27:01.090 --> 00:27:03.090
Actually, there is Einstein
summation convention

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.620
being imposed here.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.240
But when we look
at this, there's

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.210
actually only one
Christoffel symbol

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:12.520
that has repeated indices
in that first position.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:31.827
So when I put all
this together, you

00:27:31.827 --> 00:27:33.660
wind up with something
that looks like this.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.323
So go back and check your
copy of Jackson, or Purcell,

00:27:42.323 --> 00:27:44.490
or Griffith, whatever your
favorite E&M textbook is.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:46.930
And you'll see when you work
in cylindrical coordinates,

00:27:46.930 --> 00:27:49.430
you indeed find that there's a
correction to the radial term

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:50.660
that involves 1 over r.

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.030
That's popped out exactly
like you think it should.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:56.090
You have a bit of a wacky
looking thing with your phi

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.270
component, of course.

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.000
And let me just spend a
second or two making sure.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.300
It's often, especially while
we're developing intuition

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:09.380
about working in a
coordinate basis,

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.680
it's not a bad idea to
do a little sanity check.

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.740
So here's a sanity check
that I would do with this.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.960
If I take the divergence,
I take a derivative

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.660
of a vector field, the
final object that comes out

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:29.420
of that should have the
dimensions of that vector

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.640
divided by length.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.930
Remembering c equals 1,
that will clearly have

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:35.180
that vector divided by length.

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.597
That will clearly
have that vector

00:28:36.597 --> 00:28:39.200
divided by length, vector
divided by length, explicitly

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.368
vector divided by length.

00:28:40.368 --> 00:28:40.910
That's weird.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:58.930
But remember, the basis objects
themselves are a little weird.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:07.600
One of the things we
saw was that e phi

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.910
has the dimensions of length.

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.010
In order for the vector
to itself be consistent,

00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:26.910
v phi must have the dimensions
of v divided by length.

00:29:26.910 --> 00:29:28.910
So in fact, when I just
take its phi derivative,

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:30.327
I get something
that looks exactly

00:29:30.327 --> 00:29:32.493
like it should if it
is to be a divergence.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.290
Let's move on and
think about how

00:29:47.290 --> 00:29:50.620
I take a covariant
derivative of other kinds

00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:53.200
of tensorial objects.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.440
This is all you need to know
if you are worried about taking

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.252
derivatives of vectors.

00:29:58.252 --> 00:30:00.460
But we're going to work with
a lot of different kinds

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.330
of tensor objects.

00:30:07.753 --> 00:30:09.170
One of the most
important lectures

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:11.360
we're going to do
in about a month

00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.600
actually involves looking at a
bunch of covariant derivatives

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:19.308
of some four-indexed
objects, so it gets messy.

00:30:19.308 --> 00:30:20.350
Let's walk our way there.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.620
So suppose I want to take
the derivative of a scalar.

00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:29.990
Scalar have no basis
object attached to them.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.490
There's no basis object.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:40.540
When I take the
derivative, I don't

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.415
have to worry about
anything wiggling around.

00:30:42.415 --> 00:30:46.040
No Christoffel symbols come in.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.440
If I want to take the covariant
derivative of some field phi,

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.230
it is nothing more than
the partial derivative

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.370
of that field phi--

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:55.840
boom.

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.410
Happy days.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:00.000
How about a one form?

00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:13.030
The long way to do this would
be to essentially say, well,

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.860
the way I started
this was by looking

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.570
at how my basis vectors varied
as I took their derivatives.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.650
Let's do the same thing
for the basis one forms,

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:28.285
assemble my table, do a lot
of math, blah, blah, blah.

00:31:28.285 --> 00:31:30.410
Knock yourselves out if
that's what you want to do.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.280
There's a shortcut.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:39.730
Let's use the fact that
when I contract a one form

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.150
on a vector, I get a scalar.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:04.260
So let's say I am looking at the
beta covariant derivative of p

00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:06.990
alpha on a alpha.

00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.890
That's a scalar.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:18.155
So this is just the
partial derivative.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:30.160
And a partial derivative of
the product of something I

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.500
can expand out really easily.

00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:46.900
So using the fact that this
just becomes the partial,

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:54.900
I can write this
as a alpha d beta p

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.350
alpha plus p downstairs alpha.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:06.860
So now what?

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:13.260
Well, let's rewrite this using
the covariant derivative.

00:33:18.862 --> 00:33:21.070
Pardon me a second while I
get caught up in my notes.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:24.230
Here we are.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:31.210
I can write this as the
covariant derivative

00:33:31.210 --> 00:33:34.210
minus the correction that comes
from that Christoffel symbol.

00:33:45.595 --> 00:33:46.980
Pardon me just a second.

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.480
There's a couple lines here I
want to write out very neatly.

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:57.120
So when I put this in--

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.170
oops typo.

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.880
That last typo is important,
because I'm now going

00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.491
to do the relabeling trick.

00:34:34.491 --> 00:34:36.199
So what I'm going to
do is take advantage

00:34:36.199 --> 00:34:40.280
of the fact that in this
last term, alpha and mu

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.050
are both dummy indices.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:47.030
So on this last term that
I have written down here,

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.560
I'm going to swap
out alpha and mu.

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:29.570
When I do that, notice that the
first term and the last term

00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.060
will both be proportional
to the component a alpha.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.130
Now, let's require that
the covariant derivative

00:35:57.130 --> 00:36:00.220
when it acts on two things
that are multiplied together,

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:04.430
it's a derivative, so it should
do what derivatives ordinarily

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.930
do.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:09.680
So what we're going
to do is require

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:15.230
that when I take this
covariant derivative,

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:30.040
I should be able to
write the result like so.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:35.750
It's a healthy thing that
any derivative should do.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.680
So comparing, I look
at that, and go,

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.830
oh, I've got the covariant
derivative of my one form

00:36:40.830 --> 00:36:41.330
there.

00:36:41.330 --> 00:36:42.140
Just compare forms.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.850
Very, very similar, but
notice the minus sign.

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:14.530
There's a minus sign that's
been introduced there,

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:19.470
and that minus sign guarantees,
if you actually expand out

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.290
that combination of
covariant derivatives

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.660
I have on the previous line,
there's a nice cancellation

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.050
so that the scalar that
I get when I contract p

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.740
on a, in fact, doesn't have
anything special going on when

00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.033
I do the covariant derivative.

00:37:41.483 --> 00:37:43.150
So I'm going to
generalize this further,

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.130
but let me just make
a quick comment here.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:48.820
I began this little
calculation by saying,

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:53.260
given how we started
our calculation

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.240
of the covariant
derivative of a vector,

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.920
we could have begun
by just taking

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:59.620
lots of derivatives of the
basis one forms, and assembling

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.840
all these various tables,
and things like that.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:10.960
If you had done this,
it's simple to find,

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:22.050
based on an analysis
like this, that if you

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:34.640
take a partial
derivative of a one form,

00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:37.740
that you get sort of a linear
combination of one forms back.

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:39.167
Looks just like
what you got when

00:38:39.167 --> 00:38:41.250
you took a partial derivative
of the basis vector,

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:42.560
but with a minus sign.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:48.670
And what that minus sign does
is it enforces, if you go back

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.730
to a lecture from ages ago, when
I first introduced basis one

00:38:51.730 --> 00:39:04.480
forms, it enforces the idea that
when I combine basis one forms

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:08.110
with basis vectors, I get an
identity object out of this,

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:09.910
which is itself a constant.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.190
If you are the
kind of person who

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.320
likes that sort of
mathematical rigor,

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:16.090
some textbooks will
start with this,

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.790
and then derive other
things from that--

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:21.310
sort of six of one, half
a dozen of the other.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:24.460
So we could go on at this point.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.310
And I could say,
how do I do this

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:30.070
with a tensor that has two
indices in the upstairs

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:30.890
position?

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.350
How do I do this
with a tensor that

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:34.373
has two indices in the
downstairs position?

00:39:34.373 --> 00:39:35.790
How do I do it for
a tensor that's

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.960
got 17 indices in
the upstairs position

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.490
and 38 in the
downstairs position?

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:43.480
The answer is easily
deduced from doing

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.970
these kinds of
rules, so I'm just

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.900
going to write down a
couple of examples and state

00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:47.900
what it turns out to be.

00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:01.390
So basically, imagine I want to
take the covariant derivative--

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:03.470
let's do the stress
energy tensor--

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.747
covariant derivative of T mu nu.

00:40:06.747 --> 00:40:09.080
So remember, the way that the
Christoffel got into there

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.420
is that when I looked at
the derivative of a vector,

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.000
I was looking at derivatives
of basis objects.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.750
Well, now I'm going
to look at derivatives

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.870
of two different basis objects.

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:22.140
So I'm going to wind up with
two Christoffel symbols.

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:42.543
You can kind of think of it
as coming along and correcting

00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:43.460
each of these indices.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.520
I can do this with the indices
in the downstairs position.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:40:58.250
Guess what?

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:07.510
Comes along and corrects
all them with minus signs.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.930
Just for completeness,
let me just

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:35.250
write down the general rule.

00:41:35.250 --> 00:41:40.330
If I am looking at the
covariant derivative of a tensor

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:48.330
with a gajillion
upstairs indices

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:51.990
and a gajillion
downstairs indices,

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:59.690
you get one term that's just a
partial derivative of that guy,

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:10.800
and you get a
Christoffel coupling

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.270
for every one of these.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:32.020
Plus sign for all the
upstairs, minus sign

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.820
for all the downstairs.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.500
That was a little tedious.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.450
You basically just, when I
give you a tensor like that,

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:47.950
you just kind of
have to go through.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.723
And it becomes sort
of almost monkey work.

00:42:49.723 --> 00:42:51.640
You just have to rotely
go through and correct

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.500
every one of the indices using
an algorithm that kind of looks

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.000
like this.

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:02.300
Oh, jeez, there's absolutely a
minus sign on the second one.

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.085
Thank you.

00:43:05.085 --> 00:43:06.040
I appreciate that.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:19.687
So the way that we have
done things so far,

00:43:19.687 --> 00:43:22.020
and I kind of emphasized, it
sort of smells like the way

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:26.190
to do this is you pick your
new coordinate representation,

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:33.420
you throw together all of
your various basis objects,

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.467
and then you just
start going whee,

00:43:35.467 --> 00:43:37.050
let's start taking
derivatives and see

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.380
how all these things vary
with respect to each other,

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:42.780
assemble my table of
the gammas, and then do

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.550
my covariant derivative.

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:48.220
If that were, in fact,
the way we did it,

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:50.260
I would not have chosen
my research career

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.480
to focus on this field.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:52.990
That would suck.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:58.030
Certainly prior to Odin
providing us with Mathematica,

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.750
it would have been
absolutely undoable.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:05.290
Even with it, though, it
would be incredibly tedious.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:28.890
So there is a better
way to do this,

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:33.170
and it comes via the metric.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:39.800
Before I derive what the
algorithm actually is,

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:43.250
I want to introduce an extremely
important property of tensor

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:46.430
relationships that we are
going to come back to and use

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:47.750
quite a bit in this course.

00:44:57.923 --> 00:45:00.340
So this is something that we
have actually kind of alluded

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:03.280
to repeatedly, but I want to
make it a little more formal

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.742
and just clearly state it.

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.370
So this relationship
that I'm going to use

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:27.350
is some kind of a tensor
equation, a tensorial equation

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:37.620
that holds in one
representation must

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.182
hold in all representations.

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:48.350
Come back to the
intuition when I first

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.780
began describing physics in
terms of geometric objects

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:51.460
in spacetime.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.560
One of the key points I
tried to really emphasize

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:57.410
the difference of is that
I can have different--

00:45:57.410 --> 00:46:00.457
let's say my arm is a
particular vector in spacetime.

00:46:00.457 --> 00:46:02.540
Someone running through
the room at three-quarters

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.030
the speed of light will use
different representations

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:06.013
to describe my arm.

00:46:06.013 --> 00:46:07.430
They will see
length contractions.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.722
They will see things sort of
spanning different things.

00:46:09.722 --> 00:46:11.450
But the geometric
object, the thing

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:16.400
which goes between two events
in spacetime, that does not

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.920
change, even though the
representation of those events

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:20.138
might.

00:46:20.138 --> 00:46:22.430
This remains true not just
for Lorentz transformations,

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:25.070
but for all classes
of transformations

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:28.850
that we might care to
use in our analysis.

00:46:28.850 --> 00:46:32.560
Changing the representation
cannot change the equation.

00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:43.350
Written that way, it
sounds like, well, duh,

00:46:43.350 --> 00:46:47.741
but as we'll see, it's got
important consequences.

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:06.440
So as a warm-up exercise of
how we might want to use this,

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.710
let's think about the
double gradient of a scalar.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:47.710
So let's define-- let's just say
that this is the object that I

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:50.320
want to compute.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.044
Let's first do this in a
Cartesian representation.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.710
In a Cartesian
representation, I just

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.875
take two partial derivatives.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.790
I've got a couple basis
one forms for this.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:20.102
So I've got something like this.

00:48:20.102 --> 00:48:21.560
The thing which I
want to emphasize

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.220
is that as written, in
Cartesian coordinates, d

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:27.350
alpha d beta of phi--

00:48:27.350 --> 00:48:32.564
those are the components of a
tensor in this representation.

00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:42.880
And the key thing is
that they are obviously

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:48.690
symmetric on exchange of
the indices alpha and beta.

00:48:53.795 --> 00:48:55.420
If I'm just taking
partial derivatives,

00:48:55.420 --> 00:48:57.400
doesn't matter what
order I take them in.

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.794
That's got to be symmetric.

00:49:02.970 --> 00:49:05.780
Let's now look at
the double gradient

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.374
of a scalar in a more
general representation.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:37.430
So in a general
representation, I'm

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:40.220
going to require
these two derivatives

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.870
to be covariant derivatives.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:47.690
Now, we know one of them can
be very trivially replaced with

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:50.090
a partial, but the
other one cannot.

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.590
Hold that thought
for just a second.

00:49:55.610 --> 00:50:01.220
If this thing is symmetric in
the Cartesian representation,

00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.822
I claim it must also be true
in a general representation.

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:27.890
In other words, exchanging the
order of covariant derivatives

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.853
when they act on a scalar should
give me the same thing back.

00:50:31.853 --> 00:50:33.020
Let's see what this implies.

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:11.725
So if I require the following
to be true, that's saying--

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:19.130
oops.

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:31.030
So let's expand this
out one more level.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:48.700
So now, I'm correcting that
downstairs index and over here.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.740
So the terms involving
nothing but partials,

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.940
they obviously cancel.

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.247
I have a common
factor of d mu of phi.

00:52:13.247 --> 00:52:15.330
So let's move one of these
over to the other side.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.360
What we've learned is
that this requirement,

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:33.097
that this combination of
derivatives be symmetric,

00:52:33.097 --> 00:52:35.430
tells me something about the
symmetry of the Christoffel

00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:36.140
symbols itself.

00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.880
If you go back to
that little table

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.250
that I wrote down for
plane polar coordinates,

00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:50.750
that was one where
I just calculated

00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:53.720
only three non-trivial
components,

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:55.202
but there was a
symmetry in there.

00:52:55.202 --> 00:52:56.660
And if you go and
you check it, you

00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:00.673
will see it's consistent with
what I just found right here.

00:53:00.673 --> 00:53:01.840
Pardon me for just a second.

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:06.600
I want to organize
a few of my notes.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.320
These have gotten
all out of order.

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.460
Here it is.

00:53:49.897 --> 00:53:51.605
So let me just use
this as an opportunity

00:53:51.605 --> 00:53:52.897
to introduce a bit of notation.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:00.770
Whenever I give you a tensor
that's got two indices,

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:10.870
if I write parentheses
around those indices,

00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:14.110
this is going to
mean that I do what

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:15.931
is called "symmetrization."

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.090
We're going to use
this from time to time.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:29.310
If I write square braces,
this is what we call

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:31.057
"anti-symmetrization."

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:41.220
And so what we just learned
is that gamma mu alpha beta

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:45.450
is equal to gamma mu alpha
beta with symmetrization

00:54:45.450 --> 00:54:48.630
on those last two indices.

00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:53.430
We have likewise learned
that if I contract

00:54:53.430 --> 00:55:03.780
this against some object, if
these were anti-symmetric,

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.027
I must get a 0 out of it.

00:55:07.027 --> 00:55:09.360
So that's a brief aside, but
these are important things,

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.610
and I want to make sure you
have a chance to see them.

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:19.710
So trying to make a decision
here about where we're going to

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:22.410
want to carry things forward.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:25.140
We're approaching the
end of one set of notes.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.810
There's still one more
thing I want to do.

00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.760
So I set this whole
thing up by saying

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.760
that I wanted to give you
guys an algorithm for how

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.640
to generate the
Christoffel symbols.

00:55:51.230 --> 00:56:02.200
The way I'm going to
do this is by examining

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:11.300
the gradient of the metric.

00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:16.140
So suppose I want to
compute the following tensor

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.390
quantity-- let's say
is g the metric tensor,

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:20.890
written here in the
fairly abstract notation.

00:56:20.890 --> 00:56:26.530
And this is my full-on tensor
gradient of this thing.

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:36.380
So if you want to write
this out in its full glory,

00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.150
I might write this as
something like this.

00:56:44.030 --> 00:56:47.320
But if you stop and think
about this for just a second,

00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:53.370
let's go back to this principle.

00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:55.830
An equation that is tensorial
in one representation

00:56:55.830 --> 00:56:57.990
must be tensorial in all.

00:56:57.990 --> 00:57:03.600
Suppose I choose the Cartesian
representation of this thing.

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:26.870
Well, then here's what
it looks like there.

00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:29.970
But this is a constant.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:36.030
So if I do this in Cartesian
coordinates, it has to be 0.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:39.840
The only way that I can
make this sort of comport

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:43.170
with this principle
that an equation that

00:57:43.170 --> 00:57:45.480
is tensorial in
one representation

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:48.370
holds in all representations--

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:57.150
this leads me to say,
I need to require

00:57:57.150 --> 00:58:02.970
that the covariant derivative
of the metric be equal to 0.

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:07.460
We're going to use this.

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:09.710
And I think this will be the
last detailed calculation

00:58:09.710 --> 00:58:11.250
I do in today's lecture.

00:58:11.250 --> 00:58:12.830
We're going to use
this to find a way

00:58:12.830 --> 00:58:16.027
to get the Christoffel symbol
from partial derivatives

00:58:16.027 --> 00:58:16.610
of the metric.

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.050
There's a lot of
terms here and there's

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:49.260
a lot of little indices.

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:51.552
So I'm going to do my best
to make my handwriting neat.

00:58:54.137 --> 00:58:55.720
I'm going to write
down a relationship

00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.100
that I call "Roman numeral I."

00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:03.750
The covariant derivative in the
gamma direction, G alpha beta--

00:59:15.298 --> 00:59:17.590
you know what, let me put
this down a little bit lower,

00:59:17.590 --> 00:59:19.507
so I can get these two
terms on the same line.

00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:34.020
So I get this thing that
involves two Christoffel

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:38.790
symbols correcting
those two indices.

00:59:43.418 --> 00:59:44.460
This is going to equal 0.

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:52.680
I don't really seem to
have gotten very far.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:57.120
This is true, but I now
have two bloody Christoffel

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.760
symbols that I've somehow
managed to work into this.

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.410
What I'm trying to
do is find a way

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:04.470
to get one, and equate it to
things involving derivatives

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.520
of the metric.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:09.670
So this is sort of a
ruh-roh kind of moment.

01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:11.770
But there's nothing
special about this order

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:14.030
of the indices.

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:18.790
So with the audacity
that only comes

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.790
from knowing the answer in
advance, what I'm going to do

01:00:21.790 --> 01:00:23.500
is permute the indices.

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:57.800
Then go, oh, let's permute
the indices once more.

01:01:25.665 --> 01:01:27.790
So I'll give you guys a
moment to catch up with me.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:29.520
Don't forget, these notes
will be scanned and added

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:30.187
to the web page.

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:33.240
So if you don't want to
follow along writing down

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.760
every little detail,
I understand,

01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:38.568
although personally, I
find that these things gel

01:01:38.568 --> 01:01:40.110
a little bit better
when you actually

01:01:40.110 --> 01:01:41.110
write them out yourself.

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:52.260
So those are three ways that I
can assert that the metric has

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:54.125
no covariant derivative.

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.500
They all are
basically expressing

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.790
that same physical fact.

01:01:56.790 --> 01:01:59.730
I'm just permuting the indices.

01:01:59.730 --> 01:02:03.080
Now there's no better
way to describe this

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.240
than you sort of just stare
at this for a few moments,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.694
and then go, gee, I wonder
what would happen if--

01:02:10.694 --> 01:02:12.760
so stare at this
for a little while.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.850
And then construct-- you
know I have three things that

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:17.320
are equal to 0.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.020
So I can add them together,
I can subtract one

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:20.830
from the other.

01:02:20.830 --> 01:02:24.760
I can add two and
subtract one, whatever.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.800
They should all give me 0.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:33.160
And the particular
combination I want to look at

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:36.530
is what I get when I
take relationship one

01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:40.840
and I subtract from
it two and three.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:48.470
So I'm going to
get one term that

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:54.210
are just these three
combinations of derivatives,

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:54.710
gamma.

01:03:03.020 --> 01:03:05.040
And I get something
that looks like--

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:25.490
let me write this out and
then pause and make a comment.

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:54.690
So I sort of made some lame
jokes a few moments ago

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:56.250
that essentially, the only
reason I was able to get

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.930
this was by knowing the answer
in the back of the book,

01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:58.890
essentially.

01:03:58.890 --> 01:04:01.560
And to be perfectly blunt,
for me personally, that's

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.220
probably true.

01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:04.157
When I first wrote
this down, I probably

01:04:04.157 --> 01:04:05.490
did need to follow an algorithm.

01:04:05.490 --> 01:04:07.823
But if I was doing this ab
initio, if I was sitting down

01:04:07.823 --> 01:04:09.840
to first do this, what's
really going on here

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:12.600
is the reason I wrote out all
these different combinations

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:16.620
of things is that I was trying
to gather terms together

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:20.010
in such a way that I could take
advantage of that symmetry.

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:24.330
A few moments ago, we showed
that the Christoffel symbols

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:28.210
are symmetric on the
lower two indices.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:30.630
And so by putting out all
these different combinations

01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:33.660
of things, I was then able
to combine them in such a way

01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:35.510
that certain
terms-- look at this

01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:38.610
and go, ah, symmetry on
alpha and gamma means

01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:41.490
this whole term dies.

01:04:41.490 --> 01:04:45.620
Symmetry on beta and gamma
means this whole term dies.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:49.020
Symmetry on alpha and beta
means these two guys combine,

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:50.100
and I get a factor of 2.

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:06.400
So let's clean up our algebra.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.060
Move a bunch of our terms
to the other side equation,

01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:22.255
since it's a blah,
blah, blah equals 0.

01:05:22.255 --> 01:05:27.010
And what we get when we
do this is g mu downstairs

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:32.140
gamma is equal to 1/2.

01:05:50.450 --> 01:05:52.770
What we're going to do now
is we will define everything

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:53.770
on the right-hand side--

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:58.380
I've kind of emphasized earlier
that the Christoffels are not

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:01.202
themselves tensors, but we're
going to imagine that we can

01:06:01.202 --> 01:06:02.910
nonetheless-- we're
not going to imagine,

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:04.010
we're just going to define--

01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:06.240
we're going to say that we're
allowed to raise and lower

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.782
their indices using the metric,
in the same way you guys been

01:06:08.782 --> 01:06:11.640
doing with vectors and one forms
and other kinds of tensors.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.580
So let's call everything
on the right-hand side

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:21.890
here gamma with all the indices
in the downstairs position,

01:06:21.890 --> 01:06:24.240
gamma sub gamma alpha beta.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.500
And then this is
simply what I get

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:37.370
when I click all of these
things together like so.

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:44.390
If you go and you
look up the formulas

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.040
for this in various
textbooks that

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:49.070
give these different
kinds of formulas,

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:53.520
you will typically see it
written as 1/2 g upstairs

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:57.590
indices, and then all this
stuff in parentheses after that.

01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:59.780
When you look things up,
this is the typical formula

01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:01.133
that is given in these books.

01:07:01.133 --> 01:07:02.300
This is where it comes from.

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:15.850
So I need to check one thing
because it appears my notes are

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.530
a little bit out of order here.

01:07:18.530 --> 01:07:22.210
But nonetheless,
this is a good point,

01:07:22.210 --> 01:07:29.490
since we've just finished
a pretty long calculation,

01:07:29.490 --> 01:07:30.900
this is a good
point to introduce

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.175
an important physical point.

01:07:32.175 --> 01:07:33.550
We're going to
come back to this.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.835
We're going to start
this on Thursday.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.460
But I want to begin making
some physical points that

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:43.800
are going to take us
from special relativity

01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.200
to general relativity.

01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:50.100
So despite the fact
that I've introduced

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:54.810
this new mathematical
framework, everything

01:07:54.810 --> 01:08:04.050
that I have done so
far is in the context

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:06.810
of special relativity.

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:08.880
I'm going to make a
more precise definition

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.490
of special relativity right now.

01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:18.890
So special relativity--
we are going

01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:32.990
to think of this moving forward
as the theory which allows us

01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:50.270
to cover the entire
spacetime manifold

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:52.520
using inertial reference frames.

01:09:00.865 --> 01:09:02.990
So we use inertial reference
frames or essentially,

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:05.660
Lorenz reference frames, and
saying that Lorentz coordinates

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:07.220
are good everywhere.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:09.890
We know we can go between
different Lorentz reference

01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:13.550
frames using Lorentz
transformations.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:15.800
But the key thing is that
if special relativity were

01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.100
correct, the entire universe
would be accurately described

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:23.720
by any inertial reference
frame you care to write down.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:28.160
And I will probably only be able
to do about half of this right

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.330
now.

01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:32.109
We'll pick it up next time,
if I cannot finish this.

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:33.800
The key thing which
I want to emphasize

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.000
is, gravity breaks this.

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:51.660
As soon as you put gravity
into your theory of relativity,

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:53.220
you cannot have--

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:58.820
so we will call this a
global inertial frame,

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.950
an inertial frame that
is good everywhere,

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.080
so "global" in the
mathematical sense,

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.330
not "global" in the geographic
sense-- not just earth,

01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:11.200
the whole universe, essentially.

01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.580
As soon as we put in
gravity, we no longer

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:16.580
have global reference frames
and global inertial reference

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:18.230
frames.

01:10:18.230 --> 01:10:19.977
That word "inertial"
is important.

01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:34.650
But we are going to be allowed
to have local inertial frames.

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:36.570
I have not precisely
defined the difference

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:40.035
what "local" means in this case,
and I won't for a few lectures.

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:52.998
But to give you a preview
as to what that means,

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:54.540
it's essentially
going to say that we

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:56.100
can define an
inertial coordinate

01:10:56.100 --> 01:11:01.200
system that is good over a
particular region of spacetime.

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:03.120
And we're going to have
to discuss and come up

01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.738
with ways of understanding what
the boundaries of that region

01:11:05.738 --> 01:11:07.155
are, and how to
make this precise.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.020
So the statement
that gravity breaks

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:16.990
the existence of global
Lorentz frames, like I said,

01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:18.000
it's a two-part thing.

01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:30.730
I'm going to use a very
handwavy argument which

01:11:30.730 --> 01:11:32.620
can be made quite
rigorous later,

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.380
but I want to keep it to this
handwaving level, because first

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.030
of all, it actually
was first done

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:41.205
by a very high-level
mathematical physicist named

01:11:41.205 --> 01:11:43.705
Alfred Schild, who worked in
the early theory of relativity.

01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:45.413
It's sort of like he
was so mathematical,

01:11:45.413 --> 01:11:48.550
if it was good enough for him,
that's good enough for me.

01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:51.190
And I think even though it's
a little handwavy, and kind

01:11:51.190 --> 01:11:53.890
of goofy in at
least one place, it

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.220
gives a good physical sense
as to why it is gravity

01:11:57.220 --> 01:11:58.990
begins to mess things up.

01:11:58.990 --> 01:12:04.988
So part one is the
fact that there exists

01:12:04.988 --> 01:12:06.030
a gravitational redshift.

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:25.760
So here's where I'm going
to be particularly silly,

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:28.753
but I will back up my silliness
by the fact that everything

01:12:28.753 --> 01:12:30.170
silly that I say
here has actually

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:33.100
been experimentally
verified, or at least

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:34.800
the key physical output of this.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.840
So imagine you are
on top of a tower

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:49.110
and you drop a rock of rest mass
m off the top of this tower.

01:12:59.484 --> 01:13:00.400
So here you are.

01:13:04.112 --> 01:13:04.820
Here's your rock.

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:08.720
The rock falls.

01:13:15.770 --> 01:13:22.810
There's a wonderful device down
here which I label with a p.

01:13:22.810 --> 01:13:24.301
It's called a photonulater.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:34.820
And what the
photonulater does, it

01:13:34.820 --> 01:13:44.370
converts the rock
into a single photon,

01:13:44.370 --> 01:13:46.680
and it does so
conserving energy.

01:13:53.790 --> 01:13:56.710
So when this rock
falls, the instant

01:13:56.710 --> 01:14:05.880
before it goes into
your photonulater,

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.590
just use Newtonian physics
plus the notion of rest energy.

01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:15.510
So it's got an energy of m--
mC squared, if you prefer,

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:17.100
its rest energy--

01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:19.948
plus what it acquired
after falling--

01:14:19.948 --> 01:14:21.990
pardon me, I forgot to
give you a distance here--

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.450
after falling a distance h.

01:14:30.330 --> 01:14:32.432
So that means that the
photon that I shoot up

01:14:32.432 --> 01:14:33.140
from this thing--

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:39.300
let me put a few
things on this board.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:15:00.350
So the instant that
I create this photon,

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:02.730
this thing goes
out, and it's going

01:15:02.730 --> 01:15:05.882
to have a frequency omega
bottom, which is simply

01:15:05.882 --> 01:15:06.840
related to that energy.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.880
This photon immediately is
shot back up to the top,

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.760
where clever you,
you happen to have

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.507
in your hands a rerockulater.

01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:29.430
The rerockulater, as the
name obviously implies,

01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:31.080
converts the photon
back into a rock.

01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.930
Now, suppose it does so--
both the photonulater

01:15:54.930 --> 01:15:57.660
and the rerockulater are
fine MIT engineering.

01:15:57.660 --> 01:16:00.930
There are no losses
anywhere in this thing.

01:16:00.930 --> 01:16:02.160
So there's no friction.

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.510
There's no extra heat generated.

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:07.830
It does it conserving
energy, 100%.

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:09.620
What is the energy at the top?

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:21.717
Well, you might naively
say, ah, it's just

01:16:21.717 --> 01:16:22.800
going to go up to the top.

01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.300
It's going to have
that same energy.

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.780
It might just have it in the
form of a photon and omega b.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.850
There will be some
frequency at the top.

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:37.103
And your initial
guess might be it's

01:16:37.103 --> 01:16:39.270
going to be the same as the
frequency at the bottom.

01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:41.478
But if you do that, you're
going to suddenly discover

01:16:41.478 --> 01:16:43.850
that your rock has more energy
than it started out with,

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.890
and you can redirect it
back down, send it back up.

01:16:45.890 --> 01:16:47.480
Next thing you know, you've
got yourself a perpetual motion

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.770
machine.

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:50.750
So all you need to do
is get your photonulater

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:52.375
and your rerockulater
going, and you've

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.630
got yourself a perpetual
motion machine here.

01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:56.463
I will grant that's
probably not the weakest

01:16:56.463 --> 01:16:58.550
part of this argument.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:59.500
Suppose you had this.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.542
I mean, you look at this.

01:17:00.542 --> 01:17:05.210
If technology allowed you
to make these goofy devices,

01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:08.000
you would instantly look
at this and say, look,

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.542
if I am not to have--

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.000
let's just say I
live in a universe

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.417
where I'm fine
with photonulaters.

01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:14.780
I'm fine with
rerockulaters, but damn it,

01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:16.100
energy has to be conserved.

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.100
I am not fine with
perpetual motion machines.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:26.200
If that's the case, we always
fight perpetual motion.

01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:35.485
We must have that
the energy at the top

01:17:35.485 --> 01:17:37.360
is equal to the energy
this guy started with.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:38.980
When it sort of gets back into--

01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:41.140
imagine that your
rerockulater is shaped

01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:42.460
like a baseball catcher's mitt.

01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.100
You want that thing to just
land gently in your mitt,

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:48.170
and just be a perfectly
gentle, little landing there.

01:17:48.170 --> 01:18:07.290
And when you put all this
together, going through this,

01:18:07.290 --> 01:18:10.223
taking advantage of the fact
that if you work in units where

01:18:10.223 --> 01:18:11.640
you've put your
c's back in, there

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:21.860
will be a factor of g h over c
squared appearing in here, what

01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:25.340
you find is that the
frequency at the top

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:30.000
is less than the
frequency at the bottom.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.340
In other words, the light has
gotten a little bit redder.

01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.630
now I fully confess, I did
this via the silliest argument

01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:37.650
possible.

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:39.720
But I want to
emphasize that this

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:45.060
is one of the most precisely
verified predictions of gravity

01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.250
and relativity theory.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:51.030
This was first done, actually,
up the street at Harvard,

01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:54.740
by what's called the
Pound-Rebka experiment.

01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:57.240
And the basic principles of
what is going on with this right

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:57.958
now--

01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:00.000
I just took this out to
make sure my alarm is not

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.667
about to go off, but
I want to emphasize

01:19:01.667 --> 01:19:03.208
it's actually built
into the workings

01:19:03.208 --> 01:19:04.630
of the global
positioning system.

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:07.170
Because this fact that
light signals may travel out

01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:09.960
of a gravitational
potential, they

01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.390
get redshifted, needs to be
taken into account in order

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:15.210
to do the precise
metrology that GPS allows.

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:21.630
Now, this is part one,
this idea that light

01:19:21.630 --> 01:19:24.720
gets redder as it climbs out
of a gravitational field.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.230
Part two, which I
will do on Thursday,

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:31.500
is to show that if there
is a global inertial frame,

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.830
there is no way for light to
get redder as it climbs out

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:38.080
of a gravitational potential.

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:42.280
You cannot have both gravity
and a global inertial reference

01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:42.898
frame.

01:19:42.898 --> 01:19:44.690
That's where I will
pick it up on Thursday.

01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:45.700
So we'll do that.

01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:49.000
And we will then begin
talking about how

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.510
we can try to put the principles
of relativity and gravity

01:19:52.510 --> 01:19:53.695
together.

01:19:53.695 --> 01:19:56.320
And in some sense, this is when
our study of general relativity

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:58.060
will begin in earnest.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:01.110
All right, so let us stop there.

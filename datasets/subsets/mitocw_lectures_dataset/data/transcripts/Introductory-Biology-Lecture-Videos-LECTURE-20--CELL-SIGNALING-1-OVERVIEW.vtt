BARBARA IMPERIALI: Now,
I want to talk today

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.620
about one small thing before
we move on to signaling,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.480
because it really
kind of completes

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.900
the work that we talked about
with respect to trafficking.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.520
So I popped this
question up last time,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.430
and it seemed like there weren't
quite enough sort of people

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.900
leaping to give me an answer.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.990
But let's just take a look
at the big picture of things,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.670
as it's always good to do.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.940
Because this will also
get me to one other topic,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.910
which is protein misfolding.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.940
So at the end of
the day, what really

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.100
defines where a protein
is, what it does,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.870
is defined by its sequence.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.990
But you always want to remember
that a protein sequence is

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.090
defined by its messenger.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.690
The messenger is defined
by the pre-messenger.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.510
Yes, there may be splicing
events that really

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.990
cause changes in localization.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.410
But the pre-messenger
includes the content.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.480
And then what defines
that is the DNA.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.550
There's certain
aspects of regulation

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.100
at the epigenetic level that
we don't talk about barely

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.220
in this course.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.940
But I want you to make
sure that you realize

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.720
at the end of the day,
what the protein is,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.140
how it folds, is
defined originally

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.560
by the sequence of the DNA,
although a long way along here.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.190
The post-translational
modifications that we started

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.060
talking about last time
are defined by the protein

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.140
sequence, which all the
way is defined by the DNA--

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.610
so, so much of protein function.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.660
And there's one more
aspect of proteins

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.330
that's defined by
the DNA sequence,

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.690
and that's whether a protein
folds well, or perhaps,

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.550
in some cases, misfolds.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.370
And that's the thing I want to
talk about very briefly today.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.310
Because I think that this
captures the picture.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:23.640
So let's just go over here
and write misfolded proteins,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.370
which, just like
everything else,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.270
largely end up being
dictated by the DNA.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.450
Because whether a
protein folds faithfully

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.240
into a good
structure or misfolds

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.610
can be a function of
the protein sequence.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.940
So there could be mutations
in the protein that ultimately

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.960
end up that the protein
misfolds and forms

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.220
either a misfolded tertiary
structure, or even worse,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.820
adopts an aggregated form
that causes a lot of damage

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.160
within cells and
outsides of cells.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.760
So I want to talk just briefly
about the processes that we

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.740
have-- it's just one slide--

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.570
to deal with misfolded proteins.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.760
So when a protein is
translated, it almost

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.570
starts folding straight away,
especially large proteins.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.480
A fair amount of a protein
may have already emerged

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.750
from the ribosome and
started folding, even

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.120
when the whole
protein isn't made.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.110
The sequence ultimately ends you
up with a well-folded protein.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.740
But if the protein does
not fold fast enough,

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.930
or there is a mistake
in this, which

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.170
might be caused intrinsically
by the primary sequence,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.880
if there's a mistake in that--

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.770
so slow folding or
incorrect folding--

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.810
then you will end up with a
protein that's partially folded

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.850
within the context of a cell.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.150
We especially encounter
misfolded proteins

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.610
when we are
overexpressing proteins

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.730
in cells, because you're just
making one of a type of protein

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.160
really quickly, and it
doesn't have a chance

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.680
to adopt its faithful structure.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.430
So there are proteins
within the cell that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.700
helped sort of protect
the folding process early

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.010
on, to allow the protein to have
enough time in singular, not

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.730
with a lot of copies of itself
around that are misfolded,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.740
to adopt a folded structure.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.770
And these proteins
are called chaperones.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.940
I don't know if you guys
are familiar with the term

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.020
chaperone.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.790
It was a term that
was heavily used

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.280
in the sort of 18th
and 19th century.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.620
A chaperone used to be
an aunt or someone who

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.080
you would send out with your
beautiful young daughter

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.040
to chaperone her, to protect
her so she didn't get bothered

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.140
by those mean men out there.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.920
So chaperones were-- that
was the original definition

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.000
of the chaperone.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.610
And it's kind of interesting
that the chaperones are now

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:22.690
proteins that help folding or
protect against misfolding.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.420
How do they do this?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.930
Generally, a protein
will fold poorly

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.780
if it's very, very-- if
it's quite hydrophobic.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.500
And hydrophobic patches
are exposed in aggregate.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.610
So let's say, you
have a protein,

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.810
and there's a lot of copies,
but they're not folded.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.700
If you have things that are
hydrophobic that would normally

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.630
end up tucked
inside the protein,

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.760
if the protein hasn't
folded in its good time,

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.610
these will just start
to form aggregates, sort

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.600
of associating with each other.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.240
It's just a physical phenomenon.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.780
If you put something that's
got a lot of hydrophobic faces

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.930
on the outside, this
will start forming

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.400
an aggregated bundle, and not
a nicely folded protein at all.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.330
What the chaperones
may do is in part

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:29.650
hold the partially
folded protein.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.920
So let's just think of this
big jelly bean as a chaperone

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.850
until things start to
adopt a favorable state.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:38.710
But sometimes it's
just too much.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:42.410
The chaperone cannot
handle the flux of protein.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.940
So the protein ends up being
recognized as misfolded.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.660
And then it gets tagged
as a misfolded protein,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.060
and it gets taken to a place
in the cell for disposal.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:07:01.050
So if you are unable to fold,
there is a tagging process.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.580
And I mentioned it last time.

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.770
It's a process known
as ubiquitination.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.080
This is also a
post-translational

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.780
modification, but
it's one that occurs

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.070
on poorly folded proteins.

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:22.370
And I'm going to describe
to you that system,

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:26.000
because the ubiquitination
is the flag, the signal,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.170
or the tag, to take this
protein to the great shredder,

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.230
basically.

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:34.160
And so what does the--
what's a paper shredder--

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.440
I like the analogy
with a paper shredder.

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.015
So here's a fellow who's got
too much on in his inbox.

00:07:41.015 --> 00:07:42.890
So he just sends it
straight to the shredder.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.580
It's a little bit about too much
misfolded protein being made.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.450
So instead of sort of waiting
to deal with the paperwork,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.280
you just send it
straight to the shredder.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.940
And the proteasome is
the cellular shredder

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.570
that actually breaks proteins
up into small chunks,

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.590
and then digests them out.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:17.350
So think of the
proteasome as a shredder,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:27.170
which chops up proteins
into small pieces,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:35.240
mostly into short
peptides that are 8 to 14

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.919
amino acids in length--

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.480
fairly small.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.630
Short peptides won't cause
a problem in aggregation,

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.669
and will then be
further digested.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:46.580
Now, if you've got this shredder
sitting around in the cell,

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.940
it's like having a paper
shredder on all the time.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.400
You've got a-- there's a risk
things may end up in there

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.960
without meaning to be.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.690
So for things to be
tagged for shredding,

00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:01.110
they go through what's known
as the ubiquitin system.

00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:04.200
So the first thing
to get into that is--

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.670
and it's only then
that proteins are

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.930
tagged for shredding up or
chopping up by the proteasome.

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.190
So as you can sort
of tell by its name,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.610
it's got protease
function, but it's

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:26.730
a large, macromolecular
protease,

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.280
with lots and lots
of subunits that

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.580
are important to cut that
polypeptide into smaller

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.890
pieces.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.020
But because many
of your proteins

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:40.530
may be partially
folded or misfolded,

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.900
they first have to be unfolded.

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:48.500
So the ubiquitin is the
signal to send proteins

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:52.020
to the proteasome, where
the second action is

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.800
protease activity, and the
first action is unfolding.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.840
So what I show you
on this picture

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.010
is the barrel structure
of a proteasome.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.410
Let me explain the
components of it.

00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:10.530
The red component
of the proteasome

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.760
is a multimeric ring
that uses ATP and starts

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.290
tugging apart the protein
that you need to destroy.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.110
But it will only do
that if the protein

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:26.390
becomes labeled for destruction
by the ubiquitin system.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:30.060
And I am showing you here a
massively simplified version.

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:32.700
Let's say this is a
misfolded protein.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.400
It gets tagged with
another protein.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.310
It's a really little
protein known as ubiquitin.

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.410
I've shown you the
three-dimensional structure

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.250
here.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:44.220
And using ATP, you
end up managing

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.310
to put a ubiquitin chain
on the protein that's

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:49.020
going to be destroyed.

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.870
That is a post-translational
modification that

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.210
is a tagging for destruction.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.670
If the protein is
not tagged, then it's

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.170
not going to be chewed up.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.040
That makes sense.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.500
You don't want to be
chopping up proteins

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.350
in a cell with wild abandon.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:07.410
Once the ubiquitin
chain is on here,

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:11.160
the protein will bind
to the unfoldase part

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.800
of the proteasome,
and with ATP, it

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:18.120
will just stop tugging the rest
of the residual structure apart

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:24.355
to thread the protein down into
the blue part of the barrel.

00:11:24.355 --> 00:11:25.980
It's a little hard
to see it like this,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:29.010
but it's literally,
the proteasome,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.560
are four concentric rings.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.460
Let me see.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.590
I hope my artwork is
going to be good enough.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:39.860
Well, that's an unfoldase.

00:11:43.312 --> 00:11:44.760
And so is that.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.770
And then in the center,
there is a protease.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.760
And each of these
components is multimeric,

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:56.790
having six or seven subunits.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.850
So it's a huge structure.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:03.060
It has a sedimentation
coefficient

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.540
of 20S, that entire structure.

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:09.600
I don't know if you remember
when I talked about ribosomes,

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.350
they were so big we didn't tend
to talk about them by size.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.760
We talked about them by
sedimentation coefficient.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:19.930
And the large and small
subunits of the ribosome,

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:32.310
the eukaryotic one, just to
remind you, were 40S and 60S.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:36.690
So just remember that
S stands for Svedberg.

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.150
It's a sedimentation
coefficient unit.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.340
It describes how fast
approaching precipitates.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.250
So once the protein has
been labeled with ubiquitin,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.260
it binds to the unfoldase.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.880
And then the single strand feeds
into the center core, which

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.360
is two sections of protease.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.280
So it's feeding in here.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.850
It sees the protease activity.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.190
And then it's just
short pieces of protein

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:10.940
are spit out of the proteasome.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.640
Once these are really
little pieces of peptide,

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:21.490
they're readily digested by
proteases within the cell.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:23.880
And you can recycle
the amino acids,

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.600
or you can do other things with
these small pieces of peptide.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.440
They actually end up sometimes
being sent for presentation

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.590
on the surface of the
cell by the immune system.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:37.340
And you may hear a little
bit more about that later.

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.175
So the proteasome--
oh, I apologize--

00:13:40.175 --> 00:13:41.300
this should have been 26S--

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.350
has a molecular weight
that's very large--

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:49.240
2,000 kilodaltons.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.950
That's why we refer to it by
its sedimentation coefficient.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.500
So this machinery
is very important

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:01.300
to get rid of misfolded
or aggregated proteins

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.470
to destroy them.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:05.860
Now, does-- are people aware of
the sorts of diseases that can

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.540
result from misfolded proteins?

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:10.360
Has anyone been
reading the news much

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.520
about certain types of diseases,
particularly in neurobiology?

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.140
Anyone aware of those?

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:17.902
Yeah.

00:14:17.902 --> 00:14:19.510
AUDIENCE: Was it
mad cow disease?

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:19.810
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Which one?

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:20.770
AUDIENCE: Mad cow.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:21.070
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yes.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:21.670
Mad cow.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:25.540
So there are a variety of
neurological disorders,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:27.070
and mad cow is one of them.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.710
Creutz U-T-Z feldt-Jakob.

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.830
But Alzheimer's
disease is another one.

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:46.150
Pick's disease is another.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.750
There are a wide variety
of neurological disorders

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:54.080
that result from misfolded
proteins, both inside the cell

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.880
and in the extracellular matrix,
forming these tangles that

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.900
are toxic to the neurons,
causing them to no longer

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.090
function, and then
resulting in many

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.550
of these neurological disorders.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:09.640
The ones I've described to you,
I've mentioned to you here.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.420
I know many of you are familiar
with Alzheimer's disease.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:19.000
Mad cow disease is a variant of
a particular protein misfolding

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.810
disease that was
first noted in cattle.

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:25.870
And they basically just
fell down, dropped down.

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.670
And it was in some
cases ascribed to--

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:34.930
the contagion with the disease
is ascribed not to a virus

00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.960
or to a microorganism,
but literally,

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:41.080
to misfolded proteins
causing the formation

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.330
of more misfolded proteins.

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:49.820
So these are all collectively
designated as prion diseases.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:52.030
I think you'll have
read that term.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.130
And it's a particular
kind of disease

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:59.020
that the infectious agent
isn't a living system--

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.000
not a virus, not a
microbe, a fungus,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.170
a protozoan, but
rather a protein,

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:08.860
where it's misfolded
structure nucleates

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.470
the formation of more
misfolded structure

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.340
that leads to the disease.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.190
So I grew up in England
during the years

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.550
where there was a lot of
mad cow disease in England.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.210
And even though I'm a vegetarian
in the US for 30 years,

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:25.420
I can't give blood in the US,
because I lived in England

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.930
during the time when there
was a lot of mad cow disease.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.690
And this can be dormant
for a long, long time

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:33.710
before it suddenly takes over.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:38.230
So there's restrictions on
blood donation in certain cases.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.630
And it's because
it's not something

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:42.370
you can treat with
an antibiotic,

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:44.140
you can treat with an antiviral.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:48.400
It's literally traces
of badly folded protein

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.390
that can nucleate the formation
of more badly folded protein,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.480
that can lead to the diseases.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.400
These were-- there's
particular instances of some

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.480
of these diseases in
tribes where there's

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.060
pretty serious
cannibalism, and eating

00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.270
your sort of senior
relative's brains

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:14.950
was considered to be something--
an important act of respect.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:17.260
And there was this
transfer of some

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:20.980
of these prion-type diseases
through cannibalism as well.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:25.099
So eating contaminated
meat, be it a cow,

00:17:25.099 --> 00:17:28.487
be it your
grandparents, whatever,

00:17:28.487 --> 00:17:30.070
it's something that
actually is-- it's

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:33.220
a serious transmissible disease.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.490
And it's really--
in the situations

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:40.390
where it can be sort of related
back to contaminated meat are

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:41.360
one thing.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.700
But there are variations in
the case of Alzheimer's, where

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:50.620
the sequence of proteins may
dictate that they don't fold

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.010
well, or they're not
post-translationally modified

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:57.760
properly, so they end up
as misfolded proteins.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.450
So these are often
genetically linked disorders,

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.520
some of the things
like Alzheimer's.

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.250
And once again, remember
that goes all the way back

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.400
to the DNA, which
might, in some cases,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.300
trigger the misfolded disease.

00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:14.950
So it's a fascinating area,
and there's a tremendous amount

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.150
to be studied.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.220
Because of the aging population,
these diseases are piling up,

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:25.360
and we need to mitigate
the causes of the disease,

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.930
and find ways, for
example, to slow down.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:33.070
If there are these fibrils of
protein that are misfolded,

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:36.520
can we maybe inhibit
that formation

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.100
with some kind of small
molecule inhibitor

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.300
to mitigate the
symptoms of the disease?

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:44.350
So it's a very,
very active area,

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:48.460
because almost every-- many,
many neurological disorders

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.755
seem to be coming down
to misfolded proteins.

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:56.050
So let's move on
now to signaling.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.170
All right.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.780
So we're going to
spend two lectures

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.320
on-- the remainder of this
lecture plus the next lecture.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.540
And what I want to
do in this lecture

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.020
is introduce you to some of the
paradigms, the nuts and bolts,

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.470
the mechanics of
protein signaling.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:33.380
And then in the
next lecture, I'm

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:35.310
going to show you
examples of how

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:39.030
all the characteristics
that we define signaling by

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.700
get represented in signaling
pathways within cells.

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:44.940
So I'm going to give you
all the moving parts,

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.180
and then we'll move forward to
see how the moving parts might

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.070
function in a physiological
action, such as a response

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:57.180
to something particularly
scary, or as a trigger to do--

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.110
for the cells to do
something different.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:01.500
So let me take
you, first of all,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.510
to a cartoon-like
image of a cell.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:07.530
And we're going to just
take from the very simplest

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:08.400
beginning.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.790
But then this topic will get
quite complex, as you see.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:14.640
But that's why I think
it's important to reduce

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:19.620
the process of protein signaling
down to simple aspects of it

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:22.410
that we can really
recognize, even in much

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.760
more complicated pathways.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:26.950
So in protein
cellular signaling,

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.000
this is a complex
system of communication

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.310
that governs all basic
activities of the cell.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.670
There are no cells that
don't do signaling.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.550
Bacteria and
eukaryotic cells may do

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:40.980
signaling slightly differently.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:46.890
But they still do have an
integrated correlated system

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:49.380
that's responsible
for triggering

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.910
functions of the cell through
a series of discrete steps.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.520
So protein signaling
can be dissected

00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:00.570
into three basic steps,
where you, first of all,

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.410
receive a signal.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.930
And we're going to talk
about what that signal is.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:11.780
What's the nature
of that signal,

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:13.680
is it small molecule,
large molecule?

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.240
Where is the signal?

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.220
Where does it act?

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:20.115
Then the next step is
to transduce the signal.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.750
And finally, you have an
outcome, which is a response.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:34.750
So we're going to talk about
each of these components

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:38.320
in order to understand flux
through cellular signaling

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.930
pathways, and how
they work to give you

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.160
a rapid response to
a necessary signal.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:44.660
All right.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:49.060
So in this cartoon, let's just,
for example, think about what

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.460
if we want to trigger
cell division?

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:55.210
We might have a signal, which
is the yellow molecule--

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.280
a small molecule,
large molecule.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.930
We'll get to that later.

00:21:58.930 --> 00:22:02.800
There's a cell here, where
on the surface of the cell

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:04.980
is a receptor.

00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:08.140
And that would be the entity
that receives the signal.

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:11.150
So in the first
step in the process,

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:14.050
there's a buildup of a
concentration of a signal.

00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:16.480
And it occupies the
receptors on the surface

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.510
of the cell, and in some
cases, inside the cell.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.150
We'll talk about a
bifurcation there.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:25.210
But really, a lot of
cellular signaling

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:28.450
is dominated by cells
coming-- by signals

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:30.880
coming from outside the cell.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.950
What happens upon this binding
event is the transduction.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.070
If you bind to something
on the outside of the cell,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:42.670
as a consequence, you might
have a change on that structure.

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.860
If it crosses the
membrane, you might

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:48.310
have a change on that same
molecule structure that's

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.180
on the inside of the cell.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.600
So that's why it's
called transduction.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.850
You're transducing
a soluble signal

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.840
from outside, binding that
signal to the cell surface

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.710
receptor.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:03.160
And the cell surface receptor
is responding in some way.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.010
And there are two
principle ways in which

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.470
we respond to
extracellular signals,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.960
and we'll cover them both.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.000
The next event that
might happen is

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.120
through the change that
happens to the intracellular

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.100
component of the receptor.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.460
There might be a
change, a binding event,

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:24.320
another step occur
within the cell.

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.630
And as a function of
that, you get a response.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.130
All right?

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:31.300
So it's really-- thinking
it in these three components

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.760
is a good way to
kind of dissect out

00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.925
the beginnings of
the complication.

00:23:35.925 --> 00:23:37.300
And then what
we'll be able to do

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.800
is really start to see what
kinds of molecules come in?

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.390
How are they received?

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.430
How is the signal transduced?

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:49.990
And what's the ultimate outcome
with respect to a response?

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.840
Everyone OK with that?

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.390
All right.

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:55.460
Now this is what you
have to look forward to.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:57.610
So we give you something
with three moving parts,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.800
and suddenly we show
you something with sort

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.100
of, you know, 100 moving parts.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.860
And cell biologists
very, very frequently

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.370
look at these maps
of cells, where

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.120
what they're
looking at with each

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.990
of these sort of little
acronyms or names, all of these

00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:17.620
are proteins, where they
have been mapped out

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.860
through cell biology and
cellular biochemistry

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.150
to be existing in certain
components of the cell.

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:26.980
And what has also been
mapped out very frequently

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:28.990
is, who talks to who?

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:33.440
So the fact that JAK S
might interact with STAT 35

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.270
and so on.

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:37.840
So much of this was worked
out through cell biology

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.940
and biochemistry,
and also by genetics.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.610
So Professor Martin
has talked to you

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.210
about identifying a player in
a complex system by genetics.

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:50.050
Let's say you have a cell
that fails to divide.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:54.010
You might perhaps screen
or divides unevenly,

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:56.390
or has some defect
in cell division.

00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.770
You might be able to pick
out a particular player.

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.150
Now, the key thing I want to
point out to you with this cell

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:08.410
is what's on the
outside of the cell

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:10.780
and runs across the
membrane, and might

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.940
have the chance,
the opportunity,

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.020
to have both an extracellular
receptor and an intracellular

00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:18.100
function.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:22.270
And those key proteins are
things like receptor tyrosine

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.840
kinases.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.230
And we're going to talk about
all of these in a moment.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:30.340
G protein-coupled receptors,
and various other cell surface

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.270
receptors--

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.560
so all of these--

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:42.800
anything that spans a
membrane has the opportunity

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.965
to be an important component
of a signaling pathway.

00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:50.960
Because what you're
routinely trying to do

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.250
is have your signal recognized
on the outside of the cell

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.770
by something that
spans the membrane.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.340
The signal will bind to that.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.100
And then you will have an
intracellular response.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.340
So that's breaking it down.

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.030
That's why proteins
that are made

00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:10.310
through the secretory
pathway that we talked

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.440
about in the last
lecture, that go

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.780
through that
endomembrane system,

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.810
and end up being parked
in the plasma membrane

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.550
are so important.

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:23.720
Other proteins that actually get
secreted through that pathway

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.630
are also important.

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:27.300
What do you think they
may be important for?

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:29.988
Let's say you've made a
protein within the cell.

00:26:29.988 --> 00:26:31.280
It goes through all the system.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.370
It doesn't stay parked
in the cell membrane.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:36.400
It actually gets
released from the cell.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.210
What might that be doing?

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.085
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:40.085 --> 00:26:41.085
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yeah.

00:26:41.085 --> 00:26:41.600
Exactly.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.180
So that endomembrane
system that I

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.350
described to you, that pathway
is great for making receivers.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:50.480
And it's great for
making signals.

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.450
And that's really what can sort
of fuel the functions of cells.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:56.120
OK.

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.240
So in systems biology, you
may have heard this term

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.530
quite frequently.

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:04.790
Systems biology is
research that helps

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.940
us understand the underlying
structure of signaling

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:09.170
networks.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:11.420
So a lot of people who
have common interests

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.920
in engineering, computational
analysis and cell biology,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.920
might bring in
data to allow them

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.440
to make models of
cellular systems,

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.890
to understand flux through
signaling pathways.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:27.470
So they may make
fundamental measurements

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:31.430
about the concentrations of
some components within the cell.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.580
And then try to say, OK,
I know based on everything

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.350
I've measured that this is
a dominant pathway for gene

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.560
regulation.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.330
And I could control this
pathway by different--

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:48.140
by sort of different
types of interactions.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:51.630
In this cellular system, I also
show you another component,

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.350
which is the nucleus.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:56.660
And when we discuss and
describe specific cell

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.270
signaling networks,
in some cases

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.030
the signaling
network may involve

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:06.650
receiving a signal, undergoing
a variety of changes

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:09.350
in the cytoplasm, but
then a change that

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:14.060
eventually results in a
protein going to the nucleus.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:17.770
And oftentimes, those proteins
that run into the nucleus

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:23.270
are transcription factors that
then trigger DNA replication

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.830
or transcription.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.180
And then promote activities.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.790
So this is how you
think about it.

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:32.150
When you think of cellular
signaling, it's really about,

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:34.040
what does the signal need to do?

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.090
And what's the pathway
that I follow to get there?

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:40.830
So all of those are
membrane proteins.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:44.310
So now let's look at
the canonical aspects

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.240
of signal transduction.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.320
So the first-- and I'm going to
rely on these little cartoons.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.430
But I want, both in this
lecture and the next,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:57.200
to really show you where these
recur in so many systems.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:02.150
So to that purpose, I want to
talk about the characteristics.

00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.560
So the first critical
characteristic

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.440
is a signal and
it's specificity.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.150
So a signal will
be something that

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:29.740
comes from outside of the cell.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.800
It could be a hormone that's
produced in the hypothalamus

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.570
and sent to another organ.

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:37.710
But the most important
thing about the signal

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.190
is that that signal, which
binds to a receptor in a cell

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:47.190
membrane, is specific for
a particular receptor,

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:50.080
and the different signal won't
blind to the same receptor.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.950
You have to have faithful
signal specificity

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:55.760
to trigger the right function.

00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.530
So if it's a hormone, it's got
to be the hormone that you want

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:02.710
to trigger the receptor, not a
related but different-looking

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:03.640
structure.

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.410
If it's a small
protein, you want

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:09.597
it to be the exact one that
binds with high specificity

00:30:09.597 --> 00:30:10.180
to a receptor.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:21.480
So what that means is if
something is binding--

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.850
if a small molecule is
binding to a protein

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:27.150
on the surface of a cell
with high specificity

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.350
and high affinity, it means that
even at a low concentration,

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.140
it will make that
binding contact.

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:37.890
But all the other small
molecules that are around

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:41.220
won't crosstalk into that
triggering that interaction.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:46.290
So we have high specificity,
and we gain that specificity

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:48.180
through macromolecular
interactions,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.450
just like the ones we talked
about in biochemistry.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.970
So if we have a small
molecule or a protein bind

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:58.680
to the receptor, it's making
all those hydrogen bonding,

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:01.920
electrostatic, noncovalent
types of interactions

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:07.740
with high specificity, so that a
low concentration of the signal

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:14.430
molecule is efficient for
binding to the receptor

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.410
to trigger the function.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:22.220
The next characteristic
is amplification.

00:31:28.052 --> 00:31:31.000
Now let's put some lines
between these guys.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:37.520
Now, with all the
signaling pathways

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.560
that you're going
to see, we're going

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.730
to be looking where in a
pathway you get amplification.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.400
Very commonly, you
might have a response

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:50.740
that's just the result of
a single molecule binding

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:52.390
a single receptor.

00:31:52.390 --> 00:31:55.300
But at the end of the day, you
might want a large response.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.640
You might want to
make a lot of ATP.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:01.420
Or you might want to
replicate all of the genome.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.390
So you need some kind of
amplification where in a sense

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:06.910
you're turning up the
volume on your signal.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:08.920
And you need to do that rapidly.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:11.800
So frequently in
signaling pathways,

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:15.040
you go through a
cascade of reactions

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.890
where the signal might
affect an enzyme.

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.290
But once you make
that enzyme active,

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:23.590
it might work on many, many
copies of another enzyme.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.660
And then each of those may
work on even more copies.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.930
So that's what I mean
by amplification,

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.670
where at some stage
you've generated

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:36.380
a molecule that can result
in the cascade of a reaction.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:41.990
So we often refer to
these as cascades.

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.450
So if you're
Spanish-speaking, cascada.

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.270
You want to think about a
waterfall coming from just

00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:49.160
a single molecule of water.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.400
You're getting a large
increase in your signal

00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.740
as a result of amplification.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.730
The next feature or
characteristic of signaling

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.280
is feedback.

00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:10.760
At the end of the day,
if you're signaling,

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.230
I got to make some ATP.

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.210
I got to run out of the woods.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:15.410
I'm getting chased.

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.360
At a certain stage,
you need to stop

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.550
all of the process occurring.

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:23.390
So feedback is just a
negative feedback loop

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.800
that might slow down
some of those steps that

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.420
are involved in amplification.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.290
So for a pathway, you only
want the pathway turned on

00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:35.390
for a prescribed amount of time.

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:37.820
And then you want
to be able to say,

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.550
I'm done with that
whole pathway.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.840
I don't need to keep churning
through all those enzymes.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.970
It's time to stop that.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:47.270
And that usually occurs
through negative feedback.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.850
And remember, we talked
about negative feedback

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.910
when we were talking about
enzyme catalyzed pathways.

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:55.850
So feedback is very
often some kind

00:33:55.850 --> 00:34:02.180
of negative feedback,
which suppresses

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:04.760
a series of
transformations, perhaps

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.940
through a product of those
transformations acting

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:10.370
as an inhibitor
on an early step.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.250
And then finally,
the other component

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:14.850
of a signaling network--

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.850
if you think of
signaling networks

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.520
as electronic structures,
you have integration.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.495
So that's the last
characteristic feature.

00:34:31.804 --> 00:34:38.830
And let me go back
to that big circuit

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:43.159
diagram quickly to show you
an example of integration.

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:45.489
So if you look at this
signaling pathway,

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:48.340
all these signaling
steps are not single.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.260
You just have a signal
come in, and you end up,

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:52.989
for example, in the nucleus.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:56.500
But rather, other components
may have crosstalk

00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.140
within one pathway,
and start out

00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:01.510
either amplifying
or turning down

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:03.520
a particular signaling pathway.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.780
So these are networks.

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:06.610
They're not pathways.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:09.910
They're networks that
interact and communicate,

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:12.730
all to amplify signals
or turn down signals.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:16.870
So integration is an
important part of signaling,

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.500
because you're often dealing
with the integrated function

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.060
of a number of pathways to
get a particular response.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:28.450
And that actually ends up being
one of the situations where

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.000
sometimes a
particular enzyme may

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.510
look like a perfect target
for a therapeutic agent.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.830
But if you don't take into
account the integration steps,

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:40.540
you may be trying
to deal with a--

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:43.150
you may think you're dealing
with a single pathway,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.520
but you're, rather,
dealing with crosstalk

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.740
with a lot of other pathways.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.900
And what often
happens in a cell is

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.910
there's compensation
from other pathways.

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:54.570
Is everybody following?

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.380
Any questions here about this?

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.320
So what I want
you to think about

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.400
is that it's just amazing
what is orchestrated

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.350
to have even the simplest
functions in the cell,

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:10.510
how many interacting
components there may be.

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:15.880
Specificity, amplification,
feedback, and integration--

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:19.300
all right, so let's talk
briefly about types of signals

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:22.300
and how we name them, where
they come from, in order

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:24.970
to make sure we're all on
the same page with respect

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.550
to the language that's used.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:38.760
So now, signals may take
different molecular forms.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:47.140
They may be small molecules,
for example, an amino acid

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.990
or a phospholipid--

00:36:49.990 --> 00:36:51.370
just something little.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:53.880
Alternatively, they
may be proteins.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:01.060
They may be carbohydrates.

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.520
They might take
different forms in terms

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.440
of their molecular structure.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:09.653
But we tend to describe signals
by where they come from.

00:37:09.653 --> 00:37:11.320
So what I've shown
you here is a picture

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:13.510
from the book that
just describes how

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.200
we refer to certain signals.

00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.345
So there are four
different terms--

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:36.920
autocrine, juxtacrine-- and I'm
going to just give you a little

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.570
hint to how to
remember these terms--

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.220
paracrine, endocrine.

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:48.380
OK.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:52.940
So these don't tell you
anything about the molecule.

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.760
They tell you about
where it's come from.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.640
So an autocrine
signal is a signal

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.440
that may come from a cell,
but it's signaling to itself.

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.910
So it may produce a
component that's released.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.510
And so it's producing this
through a secretory pathway.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.850
It's a release, and it stays
in the vicinity of the cell.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:17.180
So the self is self-signaling.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:22.040
So whenever you
see something auto,

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.960
you just want to
say, oh, that means

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.900
it's coming from the same
cell where the signal occurs.

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:31.790
Let's move to the next
one, which is paracrine.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:33.380
I'm going to talk about jux--

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.020
and that's usually
from a nearby cell,

00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:38.240
not a cell that's in contact--

00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.630
definitely a different cell.

00:38:39.630 --> 00:38:45.460
So paracrine is-- we
would always call nearby.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:48.740
And endocrine is completely
from somewhere else, so

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.160
perhaps coming through
the circulatory system.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.330
One cell may release
an endocrine signal.

00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:59.930
It may weave its way
through the vascular system,

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.860
and then target a cell.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.985
So endocrine is always
from a distance.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.520
And juxtacrine is the only
one that's a little odd.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.400
It's really from
cells that actually

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.690
are in contact with each other.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.840
So it's not self-signaling
within a cell.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:23.730
It's not a cell that's
nearby but pretty close.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:26.590
It's actually physically
making a contact.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:29.280
And so that's the last
terminology there.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:32.700
So hopefully, I can get this
calcium wave to show you.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:40.310
This is just a video of
juxtacrine to signaling.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:42.640
I just want you to sort
of keep an eye on things.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:44.230
It's usually a cell.

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:46.960
What you're observing
here is a dye

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.810
that lights up in the
presence of calcium flux.

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:51.610
It's called Fura-2.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.780
And so when you stare at
these for long enough, what

00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.800
you can notice is that
when one signal will often

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.920
come from an adjacent
cell right near it--

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.540
so there are long prostheses.

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:07.000
You're not looking
at the entire cell,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.280
but they're definitely--
for example, this little duo

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.890
down here, they keep
signaling to each other.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.680
And that's just a juxtacrine
signaling, because the cells

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.540
are in the contact.

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.730
So that just shows you
the difference there.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:22.570
If it was autocrine, you just
have a single cell responding.

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:25.180
If it's paracrine, they would
be at more of a distance

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.980
to each other.

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:33.730
I hope that imagery-- this is
from a website in the Smith Lab

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.700
at Stanford.

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.450
OK.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.750
And then the last thing I
want to give you an example,

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.600
there are many, many
hormones in the body that

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:49.180
undergo endocrine signaling,
and so one example I thought

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.670
I would tell you about,
you all know that insulin

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:54.160
is made in the pancreas.

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.300
It's an important hormone for
regulating glucose levels.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.650
And it's actually-- functions
at the muscle level.

00:41:02.650 --> 00:41:06.340
So insulin is an example
of an endocrine signal,

00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.830
because it travels a
distance from where

00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:13.165
it's made in the body to where
it functions in the body.

00:41:13.165 --> 00:41:14.620
All right.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:19.520
Now-- so we've talked
about the types of signals.

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.090
Let's now move to the
types of receptors.

00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:40.160
Now, we cover both
the intracellular

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.200
and the cell surface receptors.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:52.130
But we really will focus a lot
on the cell surface receptors.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:55.700
I just want to give you a
clue that not all signaling is

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.610
cell surface.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:59.030
So what I've shown
you here is a cartoon

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.850
where you see signaling,
where a signal

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.830
comes from outside the cell.

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.830
It goes into the cell
and triggers a change.

00:42:06.830 --> 00:42:09.120
And then the
majority of the time

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:10.910
we'll talk about
these receptors that

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.250
are in the plasma membrane.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.000
And they have an outside
place where the signal binds,

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.490
and they trigger
a response inside.

00:42:19.490 --> 00:42:22.190
And it's only very
specific signals

00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:26.990
that are able to
signal intracellularly,

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:31.490
that is, to cross the membrane
to get inside the cytoplasm

00:42:31.490 --> 00:42:32.570
to do the triggering.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.675
What kinds of molecules can
cross the membrane easily?

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:40.160
We talked about
that before, when

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:43.435
we talked about getting
across that barrier.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.620
Yeah?

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:48.460
Nonpolar.

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.060
OK.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:51.950
So you can look at a-- you
can stare at a molecule,

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:55.070
and if it's very
polar or pretty large,

00:42:55.070 --> 00:42:57.550
it's not going to be able
to sneak through a membrane.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:00.580
So something like
a steroid molecule,

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.370
a large, greasy
molecule, can definitely

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.870
make that transition.

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:07.810
And so those are the only types
of signals that we can really

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:12.590
do inside the cell, because
they can get across the cell.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:16.090
Many, many other signals
have to go through this--

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:19.010
bind to the outside of a
cell, and transduce a signal

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:20.710
to the inside of the cell.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:28.060
So one very typical signal that
can bind to an intracellular

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.280
receptor is a steroid.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.810
So remember when I talked to you
about these lipidic molecules,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:37.480
things like testosterone
and cortisol.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.390
These are very
hydrophobic molecules.

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:44.110
So they literally can cross
from the outside of the cell

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:45.980
without a transporter.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.390
So for example, the
hormone cortisol.

00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:51.060
And when that
functions, it just--

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.720
an amount of it
becomes available,

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.450
for example, in the bloodstream.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.970
It crosses the
cell, and it binds

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:01.100
to an intracellular receptor.

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:04.090
Once it binds to that
intracellular receptor,

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:08.140
this disengages a different
kind of chaperone protein

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.030
that's keeping it stable.

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:14.920
Once it's found, it can then
go into the nucleus and trigger

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.220
transcription.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.930
So this is the one example
of an intracellular receptor

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:21.197
that we'll talk about.

00:44:21.197 --> 00:44:22.780
I just wanted to
show you a little bit

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:24.860
about the steroid receptors.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:28.660
These are molecules
that are very--

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.650
these are macromolecules,
proteins that are very--

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.230
quite a complex structure.

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:37.480
But they can literally-- and
I'll show you the picture

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.330
at the beginning of
the talk next time--

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.930
they can literally
engulf these proteins.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.090
So once the steroid
is bound to that,

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.190
it completely changes shape.

00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:50.500
And that's what enables
the change for it

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:54.770
to be triggered and
sent to the nucleus.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:58.810
Now, the key types of receptors
that we'll focus on, though,

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.060
are the cell surface receptors.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.430
And there are
three basic classes

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:06.910
of molecules that occur in
the plasma membrane that

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:09.130
are critical for
cellular signaling.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.490
They are the G
protein-coupled receptors,

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.010
the receptor tyrosine
kinases, and then

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:19.720
you will talk in the lecture
22 about ion channels,

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.720
and how they perform
a receptor function.

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.010
So the membrane
proteins, first of all,

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.390
I want to underscore
their importance.

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:33.310
50%-- they comprise
50% of drug targets,

00:45:33.310 --> 00:45:36.850
the receptor tyrosine kinases
and the G protein-coupled

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:38.080
receptors.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:44.350
The G protein-coupled receptors
have this 7 transmembrane helix

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:48.170
structure, which
spans a membrane.

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:53.700
This would be the
outside of the cell,

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.430
and the inside of the
cells-- so there's

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.320
signals going across there.

00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:02.280
The receptor tyrosine kinases
are another important type

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.330
of receptor.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.180
They are dimeric proteins
that in the presence

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:10.320
of a ligand dimerize, and then
cause intracellular signaling.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:13.800
Once again, they cross
the plasma membrane

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:15.900
from the outside to the cytosol.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.410
And then lastly, there are
the ion channels, which also

00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.360
may cross the plasma membrane.

00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:24.370
And when you think about
these classes of proteins,

00:46:24.370 --> 00:46:27.060
there's a tremendous amount
to be learned with respect

00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.440
to their functions.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.600
And they are so
important to understand

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.630
their physical
functions in the body,

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:37.920
because they really represent
the place, the nexus, where

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.030
signaling happens in the cell.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:44.520
So I want to briefly show
you a picture of a GPCR.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:48.180
It's a 7 transmembrane
helix structure.

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:50.250
You can see it here.

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:54.180
There are about 30% of
modern drugs actually target

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.710
the GPCRs.

00:46:55.710 --> 00:46:59.490
And here, I'm just going to show
you the structure of a GPCR.

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:02.490
Those are the 7
transmembrane helices.

00:47:02.490 --> 00:47:06.300
If you stretch them out, that's
about the width of a membrane.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:08.400
That's typical of
a signal that would

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.620
bind to that kind of receptor.

00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:13.330
This is a chemokine.

00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:15.360
It's a small protein receptor.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.520
So you can see that
structure and how

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:22.470
it would go from one side of
the membrane to the other.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:27.210
In it's bound
state, the chemokine

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:31.860
binds to the 7
transmembrane helix receptor

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.600
through kind of a
clamping action.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.610
The magenta is the chemokine.

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:40.710
The blue and the green space
filled parts are actually

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:44.190
what holds the chemokine.

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:46.620
And if you look at it where
the membrane would be,

00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:48.780
you can see how
you can transduce

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:52.320
a signal from one side of
the membrane to the other,

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:54.960
by the binding of
the magenta molecule

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.640
to the outside of the cell, to
those loops outside the cell.

00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.220
That would have a
significant perturbation

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:06.690
to the biology and chemistry of
what's going on on the inside.

00:48:06.690 --> 00:48:09.540
So next class, we'll
talk about pathways

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.710
that are initiated by these
G protein-coupled receptors,

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:16.810
and what that terminology means.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.360
OK.

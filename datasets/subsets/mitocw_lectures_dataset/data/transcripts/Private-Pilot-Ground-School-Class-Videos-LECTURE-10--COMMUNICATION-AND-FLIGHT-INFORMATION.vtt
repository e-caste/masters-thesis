00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:17.850
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
All right, folks,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.410
before Tina is
going to talk, I'm

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.200
going to share with you
something that I've never said

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.520
to anyone before in 55 years.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.420
I figured it out on
my own by thinking.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.880
So when you put in the
flaps, the airplane's nose

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:38.840
has to go down.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.470
So you put in the
flaps, nose goes down.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.970
Think about the tail plane.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.670
Remember, a tail
plane is actually

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.310
flying in the
downward direction.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.000
So the angle of attack
of the tail is negative.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.560
And if you put the airplane
a little bit more nose down,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.930
that increases the
angle of attack

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.230
on the horizontal stabilizer.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.450
And it can become a
stalling angle of attack

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.960
if that horizontal stabilizer
has been rendered inefficient

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.560
by frost.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.740
Does that make sense?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580
So remember, the angle
of attack of the wing

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.370
is positive between the
relative wind and the wing.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.310
But the tail plane is
flying down, generating lift

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.070
in a downward direction.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.390
Wings pull up, tail pushes down
in a conventional airplane.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.690
And when you go a little
bit more nose down,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.240
then you have a higher
angle of attack on the tail.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.310
If that becomes a
stalling angle of attack,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.820
it's not generating the
necessary down force anymore.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.843
So the airplane stalls.

00:01:45.843 --> 00:01:46.760
Does that makes sense?

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.740
Francis says, yes.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.143
He's awake.

00:01:52.143 --> 00:01:53.560
All right, well,
anyway, thank you

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.350
guys for being here
for that unusual moment

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.370
in my personal journey.

00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:04.880
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA:
All right, now, we're

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.940
going to jump into radar,
and communications,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.620
flight information.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.770
And we're going to do a
little thing that you probably

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.700
haven't done for a long time,
especially not here at MIT.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.140
We're going to sing
the alphabet together.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.720
So it's going to
be a great session.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.490
So we'll start with radar and
Air Traffic Control, or ATC

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.260
services.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.830
So what's a transponder?

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.330
Why do we have transponders?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.220
What does it have
to do with anything?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.090
So a transponder is something
that helps enhance your radar

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.540
return, so that the air
traffic controller can better

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.360
understand where
your airplane is.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.200
So who knows just
generally what a radar is?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.460
Let's step back.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.160
Do people know what radar is?

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.670
Who's seen the movie or read
the book Hunt for Red October?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.190
Goodness, only half the
class, that's really a shame.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.160
In that situation, we're
talking about sonar.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.980
But sonar, since it's
audible, is much easier

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.570
sometimes to think about.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.900
Well, in that movie, we
have some of the characters

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.370
that are in a submarine.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.830
And they're trying to
find another submarine.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.710
So they send out
a sound, a sonar

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.540
that goes out and is supposed
to bounce off of whatever

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.840
is out there and come back.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.757
So if there's a submarine,
it will bounce off.

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:34.560
So you hear, you know, ping.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.550
And then if it comes back, they
can hear the sound coming back.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.090
Well, radar works the same
way, but it's above the water.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.150
And we use radar
to detect aircraft.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.480
So the air traffic
control center

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.980
has a radar that basically sends
out signals that bounce off

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.960
of airplanes and come back.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.680
We also can use radar
for other things,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.920
like terrain avoidance,
so very complex airplanes.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.130
Not usually your little Cessnas,
but some more complex airplanes

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.700
might have a terrain
avoidance radar system.

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.240
So as they're flying along,
they send out a signal.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.230
It bounces off a
mountain and comes back,

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.330
and it tells you there's
a mountain over there.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.180
Well, we want to make sure
that that return, so the signal

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.360
bouncing off, is very clear and
provides as much information as

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.130
possible, so that
the air traffic

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.540
controller knows where you
are and what aircraft you are.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.887
So inside-- yes.

00:04:28.887 --> 00:04:30.720
AUDIENCE: I think it's
important that we all

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.205
realize [INAUDIBLE]
invented right

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.820
where we're sitting right now.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:35.626
Do you know that?

00:04:35.626 --> 00:04:37.834
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Yeah,
that's a really good point,

00:04:37.834 --> 00:04:40.980
so just remembering where we
are here at MIT and that radar

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.022
was, in fact,
invented here at MIT.

00:04:43.022 --> 00:04:43.980
It's a very good point.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
this building.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.860
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.025
AUDIENCE: This building
used to be army barracks.

00:04:49.025 --> 00:04:52.470
And because radar
was invented there,

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.140
MIT had to keep the army
barracks as a historic site.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.020
And there were,
like, wood floors.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.320
And I had classes in there.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.848
It used to be the MIT
model [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:00.848 --> 00:05:03.390
And they finally got permission
to demolish the Army barracks

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.040
to build this building.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.620
So it really was right here.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:07.140
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Oh, wow.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.580
That's great, so
a little history

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.628
about what was here before this
data center was built here.

00:05:11.628 --> 00:05:12.795
That's really great, thanks.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.165
So with that great history
about where we are and radar,

00:05:19.165 --> 00:05:22.690
a transponder is actually
a piece of equipment

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.490
that you have in your aircraft.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.660
And this is generally
what it looks like.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.660
So it has some numbers
across the bottom where

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.410
you can type in a particular
transponder code or a squawk

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.300
code, as it's called.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.190
And there are different types.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.790
When we were talking about
the charts and airspace,

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.000
we discussed how
near the class bravo

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.550
we had a big ring
around the side that

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.750
said mode C transponder.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.320
So it required a specific
type of transponder,

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.150
so that the air
traffic controllers

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.980
know exactly what the
altitude is of your aircraft.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.350
There are a bunch of
different squawk codes.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.260
One that is probably the most
important for you to remember

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.300
is a 1200.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.160
So that is the VFR or
visual flight squawk code.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.270
So if you don't have a
particular flight plan going

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.890
on, you'll need this squawk code
dialed in almost all the time.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.890
And this is usually a question
on the FAA exam you know,

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.780
if you're a VFR
flight, and then they

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.760
add a bunch of other
things to the question.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.840
But if you're VFR flight and
you don't have a specific flight

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.900
plan, or flight
tracking happening, then

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.940
you should be on that
1200 squawk code.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.895
There are also a
couple other ones.

00:06:37.895 --> 00:06:39.270
Hopefully, you
won't have to deal

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.150
with this in a small,
you know, two-seater

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.600
or four-seater airplane.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.790
But in case you
get hijacked, you

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:52.560
need to enter a particular
squawk code, 7500.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.740
Seriously, please don't enter
this unless you mean it.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.780
You might find
yourself entering this.

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.290
You might hear someone not
actually say the word hijack.

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:02.880
Maybe they don't
want your person

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.800
hijacking you to know
that that's happening.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.540
And they might just say, confirm
transponder squawk code 7500.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.590
And if you confirm, that
means you've been hijacked.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:17.040
You might see a special
plane come fly up next

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.750
to you or something bad happen.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.570
So please only use
this if necessary.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.480
Lost comms is really
important, 7600.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.678
So if you indicate that,
it might be the case

00:07:27.678 --> 00:07:29.220
that your transponder
is working even

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:33.180
if your radios, for
example, are not working.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.330
So by indicating this, that
would be how you tell the air

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.180
traffic controller, for
example, the tower controller

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.480
at your airport, that, hey,
I don't have radio comms.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.660
And that's when they would
use that light gun signal,

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.690
as we discussed the
different colors, to indicate

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:50.927
different instructions to you.

00:07:50.927 --> 00:07:53.010
And then in general, if
there's just an emergency,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.740
if you've lost your engine, if
you're declaring an emergency,

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.210
7700 is a great one to
just indicate to everyone

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:01.810
that you're in trouble.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.700
So don't accidentally dial
in these squawk codes.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.730
Please be very mindful
of these in particular.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.100
And in general, there's
also an FAA question

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.990
that comes up that
says, you know,

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.523
what's a squawk code you don't
want to dial in accidentally?

00:08:15.523 --> 00:08:17.190
And those are those
three at the bottom.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.700
So let's just take a step
back and talk about this.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.550
In general, when I
first became a pilot

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.550
before I learned
all this material,

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:33.130
I was under the impression
that you pretty much always had

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.809
to have a flight plan.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:36.370
That before you
flew anywhere, you

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.450
had to decide where
you were going.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:39.700
You had to file a flight plan.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:41.440
You had to communicate
to different people

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.398
and tell them that this
is where you were going

00:08:43.398 --> 00:08:44.620
to go and get it approved.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.560
And then when you took off, you
had to fly exactly that flight

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.430
plan.

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.170
Well, turns out that's
not always the case.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:53.410
And in fact, that's
only usually the case

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:56.920
on specific types of flights
or an instrument flight,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.940
for example.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:01.750
But most of the time in general
aviation on a good weather day

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:03.490
you don't have to
file a flight plan.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:06.460
And most of the time most
people don't file a flight plan.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:10.780
You can even decide what you're
doing after you've taken off.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.420
It's a good idea to know
in advance generally where

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.430
you're flying, because
you need to know certain

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.130
of those required things
we talked about-- airports

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.260
in the vicinity,
fuel, runway length.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.050
But if you always fly kind
of in your home airport area,

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.740
so if you fly here at
Lawrence, or you fly out

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:29.410
of Bedford, Beverly, one
of the local airports

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.920
and you're familiar with all the
airports in the area, when you

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.140
take off on a given day
you don't necessarily

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.290
have to tell anyone in
advance where you're going.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.910
You might go with an instructor.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.760
And that instructor, kind of
as you're flying, will decide,

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.130
you know, we should do a
couple landings at Worcester.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.860
We should practice an
instrument approach at Lawrence

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.920
or whatever they're
deciding in the air.

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.170
And so you don't have to
file these flight plans.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.830
So when you're in the air
there are certain times

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:58.788
that you don't actually
have to talk to anyone.

00:09:58.788 --> 00:10:00.913
And we discussed the
different classes of airspace.

00:10:00.913 --> 00:10:03.040
So as long as you're not
in a class of airspace

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.440
where you have to be
specifically communicating,

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.140
you can actually just take off
without a lot of communication

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.240
equipment and just look
outside the airplane

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.330
to avoid aircraft and
go where you're going.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.230
But if you do want to
have some guidance--

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:18.730
so let's say you're
flying somewhere

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.120
you're not in a class bravo
or a class Charlie airspace.

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.880
But you know, say you're
just taking a flight.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.850
You want to go south to
Provincetown, let's say.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.730
And while you're
flying, you just

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.150
want to have an additional
pair of eyes in the sky

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.020
to help you know if there's
a really bad quick changing

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.960
weather front coming in that
maybe developed that you didn't

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:43.680
notice before you took
off, which usually--

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.930
we'll talk about weather data.

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:46.420
Hopefully, you'll
know in advance.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.600
Or you just want to be aware
and alerted to other traffic

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.850
in the area, traffic
meaning other airplanes

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:52.990
flying in the area.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.590
So you can actually choose
as a voluntary thing

00:10:56.590 --> 00:11:01.000
to call in and ask the air
traffic controllers to give you

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.472
those traffic advisories.

00:11:02.472 --> 00:11:04.180
And there are different
types of services

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.980
available in different areas.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.870
There are even parts
of the country where

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.310
it's not available at all.

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.530
So even if you wanted
to have someone

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.780
to talk to you when you're
flying up there to tell you

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.390
what's going on, there
is no radar service

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.130
in all parts of the country.

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.405
So how do you
request the service?

00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:22.780
So you can do it
a couple of ways

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.460
depending on where you are.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.430
Sometimes when you're
still on the ground

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:29.140
before you've taken
off, you're taxiing

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.580
or you're in the
run up area, you

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:35.320
can ask for certain
types of flight services.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.180
But a lot of times,
it's after you've

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.820
taken off from the
airport, after you

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.190
have left the tower controller.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.500
And you've switched
to a local radar.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.120
And you want to ask for some
types of radar following.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.210
So in general, whenever
you do a radio call,

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.400
you start with who
you're talking to.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.005
So in this case,
Boston Approach.

00:11:56.005 --> 00:11:58.870
So Boston Approach is
who you're talking to.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.010
And then who you are--

00:12:00.010 --> 00:12:04.530
so in this example
Cirrus 707 whiskey tango.

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.670
So that's the name of the
airplane that you're in

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.260
and the tail number.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.390
And then you have to
say where you are,

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:11.870
so they can try to find you.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:14.260
So you can say 5
south of Hanscom.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.370
So that means you're 5 miles
south of Hanscom or Bedford

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.540
field.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.490
And then what you want,
why you're calling--

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:24.708
so requesting VFR
advisories, Provincetown.

00:12:24.708 --> 00:12:26.500
So that's saying kind
of where you're going

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.530
and what you're
asking for help with.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:33.820
So once you do that and, first
of all, before you call in,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.580
you want to listen to the radio
for just a moment to make sure

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.530
you don't talk over somebody.

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.120
But once you make
that call, you're

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.220
waiting for the approach
controller to call you back.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.070
And so if they call
you back, they'll

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.690
say who they're
talking to first.

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:48.940
So that's you, so
seven Whiskey Tango.

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.500
And then they'll tell you
what to do, squawk 4231.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.550
So that means to type into your
transponder the numbers 4231.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:01.150
And ident, so ident
is short for identify.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.820
And there's an ident
button on your transponder.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:07.690
When you hit ident, it
basically blinks on their screen

00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:10.240
to make them find
you easier with all

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.050
the airplanes on their screen.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:13.590
OK.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:18.750
And it's also possible that
you call the controller,

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:20.220
and you don't hear any response.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:22.357
Maybe they're busy
doing some other thing.

00:13:22.357 --> 00:13:23.940
So you give them a
little bit of time.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.890
You can just make your
call again and hope

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.960
that they respond to you.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.190
And once the
controller tells you,

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.340
you know, radar
contact, so that's

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.980
where they say that they
found you on their screen.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.350
So you know, radar
contact 7 miles south

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.290
of the Bedford airport,
that means they caught you.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.740
And in this example,
as you can see,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:46.560
you traveled 2 miles before they
actually got the radar contact.

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.080
Sometimes that happens.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.810
When you're getting
traffic advisories,

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.455
they do it in
reference to a clock.

00:13:54.455 --> 00:13:55.830
So if you remember,
you guys have

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.230
to go back and remember
your analog clocks.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:02.072
And you know, just so
I do it to you guys,

00:14:02.072 --> 00:14:03.030
so you're looking here.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.050
So you know, 1 o'clock,
2 o'clock, 3 o'clock,

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:08.650
so basically it's like a clock.

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.720
And they're trying to do
it in reference to you.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.205
So when you flying the plane
look at your 3 o'clock,

00:14:14.205 --> 00:14:16.920
that means look out
your right window.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.580
It just noted that wind
can affect that sometimes.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:23.940
So even if they said 3 o'clock,
it might be at 2 o'clock.

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.630
So just keep that in mind.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.590
So we'll just do a little
practice question here.

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:31.920
So here just to
make it easy, we're

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.820
saying the pilot is flying
on a heading of 360.

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.230
So why is that easy?

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.750
Well, 360 is north.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.300
And so north sometimes makes
it easy to think about.

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.600
So if you're flying on
a heading of 360 degrees

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:52.800
and the controller says traffic,
10 o'clock 2 miles southbound,

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:54.645
where are you looking
for this traffic?

00:14:58.180 --> 00:14:59.340
So A, B, or C?

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.396
Shout it out.

00:15:00.396 --> 00:15:01.130
AUDIENCE: A.

00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:03.180
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA:
All right, good.

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:06.570
So you're flying north.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.050
And so when you're talking
about traffic at 10 o'clock,

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:12.510
so 10 o'clock will be a
little bit to your left.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.030
So that's the 10:00.

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:17.980
And then 2 miles
is kind of how far

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.900
away that is in the direction
that traffic is going.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:21.400
Yes.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.860
AUDIENCE: Is that clock
heading relative to you?

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:27.250
So if you would be traveling
at heading of zero,

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:33.290
would 10 o'clock be southwest?

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.360
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Yes.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.580
So the question was, is
the clock relative to you?

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.380
So it is relative to you.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.300
So we just made
it easy by saying,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.230
you're flying 360 or north.

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:45.610
But yes, if you
were flying south,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:49.840
180, if they say
10 o'clock, it's

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.540
still going to be out your left
window a little bit forward.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:59.040
But in that direction, it's
going to be now southeast.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.400
Good question.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.900
OK.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.000
So we've already talked
about this a little bit

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.580
yesterday, the ATIS, or
Automatic Terminal Information

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:07.080
Service.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.538
So we talked about that when
we were looking at the charts.

00:16:09.538 --> 00:16:11.770
And we talked about
the ATIS frequency.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:13.830
So it's a frequency
you can dial in.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.500
And basically, it's information
that's being broadcast.

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.080
So when you dial into
that particular frequency,

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.030
you get a certain
amount of information.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:22.830
Now, the first
couple times, I admit

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.750
when you hear this
ATIS information,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.760
it seems very overwhelming.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.745
And you might have to listen
to it 3 times, 4 times even

00:16:29.745 --> 00:16:31.770
to understand what
they're saying.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:35.540
But I trust you, it gets
a lot easier over time.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:37.710
So they give you a whole
bunch of information.

00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:39.458
So they give you
the airport name.

00:16:39.458 --> 00:16:41.000
That's really
important to listen to.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.892
Maybe you dialed
the frequency wrong

00:16:42.892 --> 00:16:45.350
and you're getting the ATIS
information from the completely

00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:46.670
wrong airport.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:49.520
So look at the airport
location, and then the letter.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:53.360
So they'll say, you know,
Bedford information whiskey.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.770
So that letter is referring
to the most recent update.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.280
So let's say you listen to it,
it says information whiskey.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.210
Then you go off, you do some
practice turns or whatever.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.530
And you're coming back to
Bedford, and you dial it in.

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:08.210
If it's still
information whiskey,

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:09.829
then you don't have to listen
to the whole recording.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.310
You already have
that information.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.470
But if it's now advanced
to the next letter,

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.970
then you know it's
new information.

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:17.579
So you need to listen to it.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.910
So a whole bunch of weather
information is provided here.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.089
So it'll give you the time.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.700
We'll explain what we mean
by Zulu time, the wind,

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.410
visibility, ceiling, those
types of information.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.750
It'll also tell you
local information,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.200
so if a certain
taxiway is closed.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.410
Or right now, you're likely to
get a lot of those warnings,

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:38.370
because there's snow everywhere.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.730
So they might have piled
up snow on certain parts

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:41.570
of the airport.

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:45.110
So they'll indicate that those
different taxiways or runways

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:47.680
might be closed.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.340
So in case you want
to listen and practice

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.760
to listening to different
ATISs, this is an example.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.010
You can click on and
listen to what it is.

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.020
There's also a phone number
that I've highlighted here.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.260
So you can just use
your regular phone.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:06.420
Call that number, and you can
listen to the ATIS information.

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.350
And it updates
approximately once an hour.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.450
It can update more often,
especially if weather

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.930
is changing frequently.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.930
They're also flight
service stations.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.252
And there's a lot of
way to get weather data.

00:18:21.252 --> 00:18:23.210
So when you're on the
ground before your flight

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:24.890
and you're preparing,
you can actually

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.740
get a weather briefing.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.730
You can get a full
weather briefing.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.370
It's very important
to do this, especially

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:33.680
before your FAA check ride.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.990
But also, any kind of
cross-country flights, it's

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.670
a good idea to call in.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.040
And you can provide
your tail number.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.690
You can indicate where
your starting airport is,

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:47.480
where your destination airport
is, when you plan to take off,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.910
how long you plan
to be in flight.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.670
And then that way they know
what weather data to give you.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.190
And they'll actually just
tell you all the information

00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:57.350
that you need to know
in a very long spiel.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.610
So you want to be ready to
write all that information down.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:03.260
But what's really
great about that

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:06.170
is they also keep a
record that you called in

00:19:06.170 --> 00:19:08.090
and that you got
this weather data.

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:09.980
And so it's one way
to kind of demonstrate

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.013
that you've adequately
prepared for the flight

00:19:13.013 --> 00:19:15.305
and gotten the appropriate
weather briefing in advance.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:21.010
All right, so radio
procedures, so this

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.820
is where we're going to do
our fun alphabet test here.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.300
So we actually did
this last year,

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.730
but some people said they
kind of forgot the alphabet.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.140
So it wasn't that they forgot
that B stood for Bravo, they

00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.490
just forgot what letter
of the alphabet came next.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:37.010
So to remove that as
an excuse for you,

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.340
I have the full alphabet here.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.250
And together, we're
going to see how much you

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:46.510
know about the full
aviation phonetic alphabet.

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:49.270
So what they mean is instead
of saying A, you say alpha.

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:51.220
Instead of saying
B, you say bravo.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.270
So let's go through together.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.090
So let's start from the top--

00:19:55.090 --> 00:20:04.750
alpha, bravo, Charlie, delta,
echo, foxtrot, golf, hotel,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:16.060
India, Juliet, kilo, Lima, Mike,
November, Oscar, Papa, Quebec,

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:24.277
Romeo, Sierra, Tango,
Uniform, Victor, Whiskey--

00:20:24.277 --> 00:20:25.110
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.985
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:25.985 --> 00:20:28.690
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA:
Yankee, Zulu.

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.730
All right, good job.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.880
So I know that some of you
aren't familiar with that,

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.780
and that's totally fine.

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:38.200
So if you were just
listening along, that's OK.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.090
It's good to just get
used to hearing it.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:42.040
But it's a good
thing to practice.

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.090
And you might notice
that in your daily life,

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.890
especially if you're
someone like me that

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:51.430
has a very long last
name, Srivastava.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.350
I have to spell
it out to people.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:57.700
I love to use my aviation
phonetic alphabet to do that.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:59.500
And you might find
a fellow pilot

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:00.860
on the other end of the line.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.440
So that's always fun to do.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.960
But it's good to just
start practicing this

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.370
and get used to it.

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.620
Not only is it a fun trick you
can whip out when you need to,

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.450
but it's extremely helpful just
to have that kind of memorized

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:16.753
and be familiar with that.

00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:18.420
In terms of the
numbers, you pretty much

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:19.600
just say the numbers.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.590
Sometimes people say
niner instead of nine,

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:24.030
some people don't.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:27.600
Also, instead of saying
three, they say tree.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.370
A lot of people consider
that pretentious,

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:30.660
and they don't like
it when you do that.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.420
But officially, you're supposed
to say tree instead of three.

00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.540
It's supposedly easier
to hear on the radios.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.640
There's also different ways
that you describe a number.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.940
So if you're talking about
1,200 feet, like your altitude,

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.710
you say 1,200.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:52.440
But if you're over 10,000,
then you say one zero thousand.

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.450
And then if you're
talking about a frequency

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:59.250
where you have a decimal
point, so you would say 124.4.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.780
So it's really
important to do that,

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.770
because if you
start saying 124.4,

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.140
then you take up too
much time on the radio.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.840
And people aren't used to
hearing the numbers that way.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.707
It can confuse people.

00:22:11.707 --> 00:22:13.290
So just a question
to make sure you've

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:22.914
gotten that, so A, B, or C?

00:22:22.914 --> 00:22:23.870
AUDIENCE: C.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:27.860
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Right, so
one zero thousand five hundred.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.620
There's inevitably a question
on the FAA exam about this.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.970
It's not that hard to do, but
please try to remember it.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:39.860
All right, so Zulu time is
the same as the UTC time.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.550
So does anyone know what
time zone we're currently in?

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:44.603
AUDIENCE: Eastern.

00:22:44.603 --> 00:22:45.770
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Eastern.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.967
But is it Eastern Standard
Time or Eastern Daylight Time?

00:22:48.967 --> 00:22:50.300
AUDIENCE: Eastern Standard Time.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:52.280
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Eastern
Standard Time, that's right.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.990
And do you know how
many hours that is

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.440
different from the Zulu time?

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:56.940
AUDIENCE: 5.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.148
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: 5, right.

00:22:58.148 --> 00:23:00.330
So you subtract 5
from the Zulu time

00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:03.050
to get our Eastern
Standard Time.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:05.838
And does it stay
like that year round?

00:23:05.838 --> 00:23:06.380
AUDIENCE: No.

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:07.338
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: No.

00:23:07.338 --> 00:23:11.240
So when it turns into Daylight
Time in the March time frame,

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.420
then you do minus 6 or minus 4?

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:15.320
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:16.640
TINA P. SRIVASTAVA: Minus 4.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:20.120
So it's good to just know that,
because a lot of the weather

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.000
data and information is
provided in Zulu time.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.330
And you might need to convert
it to your local time zone.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:32.010
So when you're
speaking on the radio,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.500
it's very important to
know that that radio is

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.133
for essential purposes.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:38.550
You know, it needs
to be available

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.008
if somebody is
having an emergency,

00:23:40.008 --> 00:23:41.700
if somebody is lost
or disoriented,

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.230
if somebody is having a problem.

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.630
So you don't just speak
and talk on the radio

00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:48.420
unless you have something
in particular to say.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.660
That logic goes out the door
if you're at a very tiny,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:55.680
not very often used airport.

00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:57.510
The other thing
to keep in mind is

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:00.510
that a lot of the
communication radios

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.060
operate at a VHF, or
Very High Frequency,

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.310
which means that
it's line of sight.

00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:08.880
So if there's a mountain
range in between you

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.440
and what's
transmitting, then you

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.485
won't be able to
hear that connection.

00:24:12.485 --> 00:24:13.860
So there are a
number of airports

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.750
in the Northeast that
are kind of nestled

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.270
in between some mountains.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.430
You've got to be very
careful of mountains.

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:22.135
Philip talked a lot
about fog associated

00:24:22.135 --> 00:24:24.510
with mountains and different
wind effects near mountains.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:27.180
So mountains are not
something to be trifled with.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.510
But in addition, you may
not have proper radio

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.622
communications.

00:24:31.622 --> 00:24:34.080
So if you're trying to land at
an airport in the mountains,

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.360
you may not be able to
get the ATIS unless you

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.970
fly high enough that
you have a line of sight

00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:42.350
to that airport above the
mountains, for example.

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.100
And then whenever
you're using the radio--

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.690
we already briefly covered
this with one example.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.930
But there are a couple
things you need to say.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:52.500
So you need to say you, so
who am I talking to, first.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.280
And then who I am,
where I am, what I want,

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:57.990
and then sometimes
you have to say with,

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.760
with meaning what information
you have with you.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.710
And that's referring
to the ATIS.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.540
So if you are trying to take
off from Hanscom Airport

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.480
and you have received the
ATIS information whiskey,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.465
then you say with whiskey.

00:25:14.465 --> 00:25:15.840
Because if you
don't say whiskey,

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.700
then they might not
know if you have

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.730
the right barometric pressure
setting, for example.

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:23.975
Or you might not know that
an airport runway is closed.

00:25:23.975 --> 00:25:26.350
So they want to make sure you
have the right information.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:27.370
So this is an example.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:30.030
So first, whenever
you get on the radio,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.650
don't just start talking.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.360
First, listen to
make sure you're not

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.190
talking over anybody.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.960
And then state all that
type of information.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.710
So in this particular
example, it's

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:45.390
a Cessna coming back to
Hanscom to land there.

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.760
So you would say, you're
talking to Hanscom Tower.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.030
So you would say, Hanscom
Tower, Skyhawk November

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:55.950
five three five six niner,
5 miles west of the field.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.500
Field is referring
to the airport.

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.660
Inbound for landing,
so that's what I

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.990
want, with information whiskey.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.320
And one thing to keep in mind
with all radio communications,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:09.450
you are the pilot in command.

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:13.980
It's important that you first
aviate, which is fly the plane.

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:16.980
Then navigate, make sure
you know where you're going.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:19.060
And last, communicate.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:21.060
That's really important,
because sometimes there

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.520
can be a very
aggressive air traffic

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:26.160
controller on the phone
trying to get you to respond

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.262
or, even if you've declared an
emergency, trying to help you.

00:26:29.262 --> 00:26:31.470
And if you need to tell them
to stand by, if you even

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.020
need to unplug your
communications so that you

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.630
can focus on landing the
plane, you should do that.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.490
Because aviate is
most important,

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.750
then navigate, and
finally communicate.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.780
And if the air traffic
controller gives you

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.320
any instruction regardless
of how assertively they

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.278
tell you to do something,
you can just say, unable.

00:26:49.278 --> 00:26:50.820
That means you're
not going to do it.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.540
They have to figure
out a way around it.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:55.340
They have to either move
other planes out of the way.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.090
And you're telling
them what you're doing.

00:26:57.090 --> 00:27:00.060
So in the unfortunate
case of the--

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.430
ultimately positive
case of Captain Sully

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:06.127
landing in the Hudson,
if you watch the movie

00:27:06.127 --> 00:27:07.710
or if you hear the
recordings of that,

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:09.793
you hear that the air
traffic controller is trying

00:27:09.793 --> 00:27:11.760
to be really helpful
and is trying to say,

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.550
hey, you can land at Teterboro.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.290
You know, I've cleared all
these airports for you.

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:21.260
And Captain Sully
just says, unable.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.930
So there's a Common Traffic
Advisory Frequency, or CTAF.

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.140
So this is where there
are a lot of airports

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.368
increasingly, unfortunately
due to budget cuts,

00:27:29.368 --> 00:27:31.160
there are more and more
airports that don't

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.070
have operating control towers.

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.130
So in these spaces,
you have a frequency

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:39.710
that airplanes can
just talk to each other

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.530
on to make sure they're
coordinating with other people

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.490
there.

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:47.760
So I'm going to give you a
couple examples and procedures.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.140
So you want to do
your first call

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.270
10 miles away from
the airport and then

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:52.650
just report certain things.

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:55.650
So when you're entering the
downwind, the base, the final,

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:58.230
these are the legs of the
traffic pattern to land.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.890
When you're leaving, also when
you're taxiing on the field,

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:04.590
those are things that you would
want to call out on the radio.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.630
And nobody will respond to you.

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.690
Sometimes you just say
that, so that anyone

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:11.490
who's around who might
be in the vicinity

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:15.310
can hear that there's another
airplane and what you're doing.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:17.430
And so just kind
of tying it back

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.710
to when we're looking
at the charts, so here's

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.710
a snapshot from a
sectional chart.

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:25.410
So you see in the middle there
there's a tiny little airport.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:27.510
It says, Jamestown.

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.850
So if you want to figure
out what the CTAF is,

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:34.050
so just zooming in there,
so you can see where

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.660
it says in magenta Jamestown.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.980
It talks about the airport.

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.400
It first gives the ASOS,
which is the automated weather

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.780
information.

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.860
It gives you more
information there

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:50.010
that it's the bottom right
numbers 123.0 is that CTAF.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.590
So that's the frequency
at which you would just

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:58.330
announce that you're coming in,
that you're landing, et cetera.

00:28:58.330 --> 00:29:01.740
So there are a lot of
different radar facilities.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.540
You may not necessarily
interact with all

00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.720
of these as a private
pilot, but there are things

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.280
called clearance delivery.

00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:13.110
They're really frequently
at busy airports.

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:16.627
And they talk about a lot
of specific operations.

00:29:16.627 --> 00:29:18.210
You probably won't
deal with this much

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.420
as a private pilot just
getting your first license.

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.510
Ground control you'll
definitely talk to if you're

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:26.250
at Hanscom, even at Lawrence.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.950
There's usually both
a tower and ground.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:34.260
And so when you're ready
to enter the runway,

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:36.600
so you finished
your engine run up,

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.910
you're lined up waiting to
enter the runway, that's

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:40.860
when you talk to tower.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.795
You tell them that
you want to take off,

00:29:42.795 --> 00:29:44.670
and then they give you
clearance to take off.

00:29:44.670 --> 00:29:46.795
And when you're flying and
approaching the airport,

00:29:46.795 --> 00:29:48.030
you're talking to tower.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.900
But once you've landed and
you exit the active runway,

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.370
then you switch over to ground.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:56.550
And ground will tell you how
to taxi around the runway

00:29:56.550 --> 00:30:00.990
and get to wherever you're
parking your airplane.

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.720
So if you lose your
communications,

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.020
the first thing you
should do is actually

00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.600
make sure you did lose
your communications.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.510
It turns out vast majority
of the time you actually

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.747
just bumped your plug
out of the socket,

00:30:14.747 --> 00:30:16.080
and you just need to plug it in.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.360
Or you turned your volume down.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.532
Or you're not talking
on the right frequency.

00:30:20.532 --> 00:30:21.990
So make sure all
of that's working,

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:27.130
because it's very infrequent
that your comms actually die.

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:28.830
But if they do, we've
talked about how

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.760
you can enter that
transponder code

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:37.670
and indicate that you don't
have your comms available.

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:41.000
And we talked about that that
transponder code is 7600.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.730
So that's the last
communications.

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:45.620
And depending on the
class of airspace,

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.220
they might give you a light gun
signals to tell you what to do.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:52.430
Or you could actually just
go to an untowered airport

00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:55.280
where you don't require
communications with anyone,

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:58.010
and you can and just
kind of look around,

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:00.410
see and avoid other
aircraft, and land.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:05.150
You can also transmit in case
it's the fact that your ability

00:31:05.150 --> 00:31:07.700
to hear has died, but
your ability to transmit

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.570
is still alive.

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:10.070
So you can still
transmit, you know,

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.440
I'm approaching such
and such airport.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:13.820
I'm entering the final.

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:16.130
But don't continuously transmit.

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:19.070
Because keep in mind it might
be that your transmission is

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:20.990
working just great,
you just can't hear.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:24.940
So don't clog up
the entire radio.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:30.460
This is just a review of those
light gun signals as well.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.627
OK, so emergency
procedures, there

00:31:32.627 --> 00:31:34.460
are a lot of different
emergency procedures,

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.760
but here we're focusing
on from our radios

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.620
and comms perspective.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:43.070
Again, you need to first
aviate, then navigate, then

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.130
communicate.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.880
So the first things
you do really

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.590
depends on what the
emergency is, right?

00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:50.420
If it's an engine
failure, then your focus

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.170
is on pitching to an
appropriate airspeed,

00:31:54.170 --> 00:31:56.780
so that you can get
the greatest time

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:58.580
and distance to where
you need to land,

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.070
finding a place to land and
trying to restart your engine.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:06.470
That aside, with regard to the
radios and the communications,

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:10.460
there is an emergency
frequency, 121.5.

00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:13.250
There's a squawk code, 7700.

00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:14.790
We already talked about that.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:17.780
And you can radio just
mayday, mayday, mayday.

00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.980
That alerts folks of the fact
that you have an emergency.

00:32:22.980 --> 00:32:25.980
We also discussed when we
were talking about required

00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.530
equipment on your
aircraft, there's

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.790
a such thing called an ELT, or
Emergency Locator Transmitter.

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:35.820
And this thing basically
turns on by itself

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:39.840
and will basically
broadcast where you are.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.350
And it needs to be
tested fairly often.

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:46.170
You can actually tune
into the frequency

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:50.880
that it's emitting at to
test if it is transmitting.

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.550
OK, flight information, this
is our last big section.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:59.260
So this is talking about
information around an airport.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.420
So I'm going to grab
the ForeFlight again.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.170
So again, just like with
the case of the sectional,

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.330
there's always a
physical version

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.930
or an electronic version.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.650
So the picture you
see on the slide

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:13.640
is something that you
could actually look at.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.300
So there's an airport
flight directory.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.090
So that will give you
the types of information

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.500
you're looking at.

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:25.990
Or on a ForeFlight, and
I'll pass this around,

00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:28.630
you can search a
particular airport

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.080
and get the same information.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.010
So I'll just pass this around.

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:38.760
So there's a lot of
good information.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.920
We already discussed some
of it when we were first

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.790
talking about charts and runway
markings and runway length

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.150
and those types of things.

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.150
But from a communications
perspective,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:50.340
it also has a lot of great
information with regard

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.890
to what the ATIS is, what
the tower frequency is,

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.320
what the ground, all of
that type of information.

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.810
And we've also
discussed previously

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:02.890
the FAR/AIM very large
book of regulations.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.370
There are a number of other
types of notices called Notices

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:08.800
to Airmen, or NOTAMs.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:12.662
And NOTAMs basically
can be warnings

00:34:12.662 --> 00:34:13.870
of different types of things.

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:18.040
We've discussed a TFRs or
temporary flight restrictions.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.260
But you might also get
a NOTAM that there's

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.370
parachute jumping in the area.

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.870
So watch out for that happening.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:30.350
Sometimes there's also
an advisory circular.

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:34.489
These are not
required or binding,

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.010
but information that
is put out to help

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.960
you understand or
clarify if there's

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.889
confusion with regulations.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:45.400
OK, I have the answer
up here for you,

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:48.260
but just a couple
practice questions.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.280
So this one is about
basic radar service.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.980
And so this is about what
we were just describing.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.800
If you call up and ask
for flight following,

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.450
what are they providing you?

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.550
Well, they're providing
you safety alerts, traffic

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:02.080
advisories.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.240
Sometimes they'll do vectoring.

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.190
So what do I mean
by vectoring is

00:35:06.190 --> 00:35:10.447
let's say there's traffic,
traffic 12 o'clock 3 miles.

00:35:10.447 --> 00:35:13.030
That means there's traffic right
in front of you 3 miles away.

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:14.140
And then they come back.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.920
And you know, you're
saying, looking for traffic.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.540
You can't find the traffic.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:22.570
They say traffic
12 o'clock 2 miles

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.780
in the same altitude as you.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.350
So if you're at
3,000, they say 3,000.

00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:28.270
And then you still can't see it.

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:31.420
And you're just like, you
know, negative traffic.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.190
So then they'll just tell you.

00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:38.320
You know, they'll just
give you another heading.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.350
So they'll give you a
number, so heading 360.

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:44.950
Or they'll say, turn
10 degrees left.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:47.320
And so that is what they
mean by limited vectoring.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.630
So they'll tell you what
to do for a little bit

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.860
to avoid something dangerous.

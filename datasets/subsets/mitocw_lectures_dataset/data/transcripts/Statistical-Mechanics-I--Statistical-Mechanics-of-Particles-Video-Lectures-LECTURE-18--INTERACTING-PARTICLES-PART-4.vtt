00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:36.920
PROFESSOR: So today's topic
is liquid gas condensation

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.690
and throughout this
course I have already

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.710
mentioned two
different perspectives

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.220
on the same
phenomenon, transition

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.790
between liquid and gas.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.290
One perspective was when we
looked at the phase diagram

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.360
even in the first
lecture I mentioned

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.680
that if you look at
something like water

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.800
as a function of
pressure and temperature

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.710
it can exist in three
different phases.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.800
There is the gas
phase, which you

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.010
have at high temperatures
and low pressures.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.360
At low temperatures
and high pressures

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.240
you have the liquid phase.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.960
And of course at
very low temperatures

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.110
you also have the possibility
of the solid phase.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.920
And our concern
at some point was

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.840
to think about the location of
the coexistence of the three

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.230
phases of that was set as
the basis of the temperature,

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.020
273.16.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.800
Actually what you're
going to focus now

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.320
is not this part of
the phase diagram

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.480
but the portion that consists
of the transition between liquid

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.449
and gas phases.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:14.150
And this coexistence
line actually

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.190
terminates at what is called
the critical point that we will

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.080
talk about more today at the
particular value of Tc and Pc.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.230
An equivalent perspective
that we have looked at that

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.420
and I just want to make sure
that you have both of these

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.940
in mind and know the
relationship between them

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.840
is to look at isotherms.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.560
Basically we also
looked at cases

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.200
where we looked at isotherms
of pressure versus volume.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.540
And this statement was that
if we look at the system

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:04.160
at high enough temperatures and
low enough pressures so let's

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.220
say pick this temperature and
scan along a line such as this,

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.370
it would be equivalent
over here to have

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.300
some kind of an isotherm that is
kind of potentially a distorted

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.090
version of an ideal
gas hyperbola.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.640
Now if we were to look
at another isotherm

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.080
that corresponds to
this scan over here then

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.190
what would happen is
that it will cross

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.360
this line of the
coexistence, part of it

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.300
would fall in the
liquid phase, part of it

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.400
would fall in the gas phase.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.720
And we draw the
corresponding isotherm,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.750
it would look
something like this.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.110
There would be a
portion that would

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.650
correspond to being
in the liquid.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.190
There would be a
portion that would

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:00.875
correspond to being in the gas.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.460
And this line, this point
where you hit this line

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.450
would correspond
to the coexistence.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:20.610
Essentially you could change
the volume of a container

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:27.450
and at high volumes, you
would start with entirety gas.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.070
At the same pressure
and temperature

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.440
you could squeeze it
and some of the gas

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.590
would get converted
to liquid and you

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.580
would have a coexistence
of gas and liquid

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.880
until you squeezed it
sufficiently, still maintaining

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.310
the same pressure
and temperature

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:47.970
until your container
was fully liquid.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.650
So that's a different
type of isotherm.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.110
And what we discussed
was that basically there

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:03.410
is a coexistence
boundary that separates

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.470
the first and the second
types of isotherms.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:14.380
And presumably in between
there is some trajectory

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.570
that would correspond to
basically being exactly

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:22.138
at the boundary and it would
look something like this.

00:05:22.138 --> 00:05:27.440
This would be the trajectory
that you would have at Tc.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.930
The location Pc is
the same, of course,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.660
so basically I
can carry this out

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.970
so there is the same Pc
that would occur here.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.480
And there would be
some particular Vc

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.240
but that depends on the amount
of material that I have.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.240
OK?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:55.260
So we are going to try to
understand what is happening

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.750
here and in particular
we note that suddenly we

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.900
have to deal with cases
where there are singularities

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.110
in our thermodynamic parameters.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.310
There's some
thermodynamic parameter

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.000
that I'm scanning as I
go across the system.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.300
It will not be
varying continuously.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.440
It has these kinds of
discontinuities in it.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.830
And how did discontinuities
appear and how can

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.660
we account for these
phase transitions

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.610
given the formalisms
that we have developed

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.080
for studying
thermodynamic functions.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.460
And in particular
let's, for example,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:45.000
start with the canonical
prescription where I state,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.210
let's say that I have volume
and temperature of a fixed

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.980
number of particles and
I want to figure out

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.410
thermodynamic properties
in this perspective.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.020
What I need to calculate
is a partition function

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.460
and we've seen that the
partition function is obtained

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.140
by integrating over all degrees
of freedom which are basically

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.720
the coordinates and momentum
of particles that make up

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.030
this gas so I have
to do d cubed p i,

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:26.530
d cubed q i, divide by h cubed,
divide by n factorial because

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.710
of the way that we've been
looking at things, of energy

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.030
so I have e to the minus
beta h that has a part that

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:43.670
is from the kinetic energy which
I can integrate immediately.

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:47.920
And then it has a part that
is from the potential energy

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.490
of the interactions among
all of these particles.

00:07:55.581 --> 00:07:57.980
OK?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:03.610
So somehow if I could
do these integrations--

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:06.280
we already did them for
an ideal gas and nothing

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.050
special happened
but presumably if I

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:12.950
can do that for the case of
an interacting gas, buried

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:18.660
within it would be the
properties of this phase

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.950
transition and the
singularities, et cetera.

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.900
Question is how
does that happen?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:27.710
So last time we tried
to do shortcuts.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.520
We started with calculating a
first derivative calculation

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.500
in this potential and
then try to guess things

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:38.580
and maybe that was
not so satisfactory.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.309
So today we'll take
another approach

00:08:41.309 --> 00:08:44.290
to calculating this
partition function where

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.980
the approximations and
assumptions are more

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:54.290
clearly stated and we
can see what happens.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:57.480
So I want to calculate
this partition function.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.440
OK?

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.540
So part of that
partition function

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.030
that depends on the momentum I
can very easily take care of.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.890
That gives me these
factors of 1 over lambda.

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:18.660
Again as usual my lambda
is h over 2 pi m k T

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.740
and then I have to do
the integrations over all

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:29.410
of the coordinates, all of
these coordinate integrations

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.160
and the potential that I'm
going to be thinking about,

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.780
so again in my U
will be something

00:09:35.780 --> 00:09:41.640
like sum over pairs
V of q i minus q j,

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:46.450
where the typical form of this V
as a function of the separation

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:50.830
that I'm going to
look at has presumably

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:55.360
a part that is hard-core
and a part that is attract.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.200
Something like this.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.560
OK?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.900
So given that potential what
are the kinds of configurations

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.835
I expect to happen in my system?

00:10:06.835 --> 00:10:08.840
Well, let's see.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.640
Let's try to make a diagram.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:17.150
I have a huge number of
particles that don't come very

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.020
close to each other, there's
a hard-core repulsion,

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:24.200
so maybe I can think of them
as having some kind of a size--

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.870
marbles, et cetera, and they are
distributed so that they cannot

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:29.950
come close to each other.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:37.030
More than that are
zero and then I

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:40.480
have to sum over all
configurations that

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:44.280
are compatible where they
are not crossing each other

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.550
and calculate e to
the minus beta u.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.860
So let's try to do some kind
of an approximation to this u.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.030
I claim that I can write this
U as follows- I can write it

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:04.840
as one-half, basically
this i less than j,

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.370
I can write as one-half
all i not equal to j,

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:11.310
so that's where the
one-half comes from.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:14.090
I will write it as one-half
but not in this form,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:20.170
as an integral d cubed
r d cubed r prime n of r

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:28.520
n of r prime v of r minus
r prime where n of r

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:39.125
is sum over all particles asking
whether they are at location r.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:47.450
So I can pick some
particle opposition here--

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.030
let's call it r-- ask whether or
not there is a particle there,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:58.270
construct the density by
summing over everywhere.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.450
You can convince
yourself that if I

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:03.960
were to substitute
this back over here,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.490
the integrals over r
and r prime can be done

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:11.880
and they sit r and r prime
respectively to sum q i and q j

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.596
and I will get back the
sum that I had before.

00:12:15.596 --> 00:12:16.095
OK?

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.810
So what is that thing doing?

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:25.620
Essentially it says
pick some point, r,

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.530
and then look at some
other point, r prime,

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.310
ask whether there are
particles in that point

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:37.960
and then sum over all pairs
of points r and r prime.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.790
So I changed my perspective.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:44.400
Rather than calculating the
energy by looking at particles,

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.920
I essentially look
at parts of space,

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.940
ask how many
particles there are.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.600
Well, it kind of makes
sense if I coarse-grained

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.690
this a little bit that
the density should

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:01.460
be more or less the same
in every single box.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:10.050
So I make the assumption
of uniform density--

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.210
I shouldn't say
assumption, let's

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:21.680
call it an approximation of
uniform density in which I

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.630
replace this n of r
by it's average value

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:29.752
which is the number of
particles per [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:31.730
OK?

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:38.230
Then my U-- I will
take the n's outside.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.830
I will have one-half n
squared integral d cubed

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.870
r d cubed r prime v
of r minus r prime.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.650
Again it really is a function
of the relative distance

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:57.950
so I can integrate
over the center of mass

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.150
if you like to get
one factor of volumes

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:04.380
so I have one n
squared V and then

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.770
I have an integral
over the relative

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.760
coordinate d cubed r-- let's
write it as 4 pi r squared d

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:16.150
r, the potential as a
function of separation.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:20.340
Now the only configurations
that are possible

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:27.370
are ones that don't really
come closer than wherever

00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:30.790
the particles are on
top of each other,

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:37.430
so really there is some kind
of a minimum value over here.

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.440
The maximum value you could
say is the size of the box

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.650
but the typical range of
potentials that we are thinking

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.000
is much, much less than
the size of the box.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.940
So for all intents
and purposes I

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:54.790
can set the value of the other
part of the thing to infinity.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:02.700
So what I'm doing is essentially
I'm integrating this portion

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:09.395
and I can call the result
of doing that to be minus u.

00:15:09.395 --> 00:15:10.710
Why minus?

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.620
Because it's clearly
the attractive portion

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.480
in this picture I'm integrating.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:20.420
And you can convince yourself
that if I use the potential

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:23.280
that I had before-- yes,
the last time around it

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.715
was minus u 0 r 0 over
r to the sixth power,

00:15:27.715 --> 00:15:35.400
but this u is actually the
omega that I was using times u 0

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.990
but I will keep it as
u to sort of indicate

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.560
that it could be a
more general potential.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.210
But the specific potential that
we were working with last time

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:47.660
to calculate the second
visual coefficient

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.910
would correspond to that.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:53.550
So essentially I claim
that the configurations

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.720
that I'm interested
will give a contribution

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.120
to the energy which is
minus whatever this u 0--

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.770
u is n squared V divided by 2.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.350
Now clearly not
all configuration

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:12.610
has the same energy.

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.650
I mean that's the
whole thing, I have

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:17.880
to really integrate
overall configurations.

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.050
I've sort of looked at
an average contribution.

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:23.930
There will be configurations
where the particles are

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:26.570
more bunched or separate,
differently arranged,

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:29.480
et cetera, and
energy would vary.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.780
But I expect that
most of the time--

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.470
I see something like
a gas in this room,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.550
there is a uniform
density typically.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.870
The fluctuations in
density I can ignore

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:41.560
and I will have a
contribution such as this.

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:48.750
So this factor I will replace
by what I have over here.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:52.070
What I have over here will
give me e to the minus

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:58.090
beta u density squared actually
I can write as N squared

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:05.179
over V squared, one of V's
cancel here, I have 2 V. OK?

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.520
So that's the typical value of
this quantity but now I have

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.930
to do the integrations
over all of the q's.

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:17.430
Yes?

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:19.550
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
approximation you made--

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:20.175
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:20.175 --> 00:17:23.020
AUDIENCE: --the implications are
that if you have a more complex

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.535
potential--

00:17:23.535 --> 00:17:24.160
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.618
AUDIENCE: --you'll get into
trouble with for a given sample

00:17:26.618 --> 00:17:30.130
size, it will be less accurate.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:31.702
would you agree with that?

00:17:31.702 --> 00:17:34.035
PROFESSOR: What do you mean
by a more complex potential?

00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:35.250
Until you tell me, I can't--

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:38.370
AUDIENCE: I mean I, guess,
and usually-- I mean,

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:40.362
I guess if you had like
multi-body or maybe

00:17:40.362 --> 00:17:41.830
the cell group.

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:42.550
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.850
So certainly what I have assumed
here is a two-body potential.

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:49.220
If I had a three-body
potential then I

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.930
would have a term that
would be density cubed, yes.

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.530
AUDIENCE: But then you would--
my point is that-- and maybe

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:58.870
it's not a place to question--
for a given sample size,

00:17:58.870 --> 00:18:01.420
I would imagine there's some
relation between how small

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.440
it can be and the complexity
of the potential when you make

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.547
this uniform density assumption.

00:18:07.547 --> 00:18:08.130
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:12.630
We are always evaluating things
in the thermodynamic limit,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.410
so ultimately I'm always
interested in m and v going

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:21.310
to infinity, while the
ratio of n over v is fixed.

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:22.310
OK?

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:27.060
So things-- there are certainly
problems associated with let's

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:31.220
say extending the range of
this integration to infinity.

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.390
We essentially are
not worrying about

00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:36.840
the walls of the
container, et cetera.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.970
All of those effects
are proportional to area

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:43.540
and in the thermodynamic limit,
the ratio of area to volume

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:44.530
goes to zero.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.150
I can ignore that.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.070
If I bring things to
become smaller and smaller,

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.180
then I need to worry
about a lot of things,

00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:54.730
like do particles absorb
on surfaces, et cetera.

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.490
I don't want to do that.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.780
But if you are worrying
about complexity

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:03.430
of the potential such as I
assume things to be radially

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:05.610
symmetric, you
say, well actually

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:08.310
if I think about
oxygen molecules,

00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:09.500
they are not vertical.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.380
They have a dipole-dipole
interactions potentially,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.190
et cetera.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:17.610
All of those you can take care
of by doing this integral more

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.670
carefully.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.900
Ultimately the value of your
parameter u will be different.

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:25.930
AUDIENCE: But I guess what I'm
getting at is you deviate from

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.210
the-- if you're doing it-- if
we're back when computers are

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.126
not as fast and you can
essentially approach

00:19:31.126 --> 00:19:33.659
the thermodynamic limit and
you're doing a simulation

00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:35.200
and you want to use
these as a tool--

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.282
PROFESSOR: Mm-hmm?

00:19:36.282 --> 00:19:38.490
AUDIENCE: --then you get
into those questions, right?

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:39.115
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:19:39.115 --> 00:19:42.420
AUDIENCE: But this
framework should still work?

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:43.100
PROFESSOR: No.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.170
This framework is
an approximation

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:49.500
intended to answer the
following question--

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:53.630
how is it possible that
singularities can emerge?

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.180
And we will see
shortly that the origin

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:58.430
of the emergence
of singularities

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.130
is precisely this.

00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:05.610
And if I don't have that, then
I don't have singularities.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:08.320
So truly when you do
a computer simulation

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:13.280
with 10 million particles, you
will not see the singularity.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.530
It emerges only in the
thermodynamic limit

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:21.340
and my point here is to sort
of start from that limit.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.690
Once we understand
that limit, then maybe

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.650
we can better
answer your question

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:27.400
about limitations of
computer simulations.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.080
OK?

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:39.260
So I've said that there's
basically configurations

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:42.350
that typically give
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:43.840
But how many configurations?

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:47.590
I can certainly move
these particles around.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:52.650
And therefore I have to see what
the value of these integrations

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:54.500
are.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:55.860
OK?

00:20:55.860 --> 00:21:00.980
So I will do so, as follows--
I will say that the first

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:03.940
particle, if there
was nobody else--

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.040
so I have to do this
integration over q 1, q 2, q 3,

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.900
and I have some constraints in
the space that the q's cannot

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.440
come closer to each
other than this distance.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.730
So what I'm going to
try to calculate now

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.680
is how this factor of v to the
n that you would have normally

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.510
put here for ideal
gases gets modified.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:30.410
Well I say that the first
particle that I put in the box

00:21:30.410 --> 00:21:33.100
can explore the entire space.

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.030
If I had two particles,
the second particle

00:21:37.030 --> 00:21:39.640
could explore everything
except the region that

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.670
is excluded by the
first particle.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.080
The second particle
that I put in

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:49.860
can explore the space
minus the region that

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.220
is excluded by the
first two particles.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:59.890
And the last, the end
particle, the space

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.970
except the region
that is excluded

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.340
by the first n minus 1.

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.980
This is an approximation, right?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.650
So if I have three
particles, the space

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.430
that is excluded for
the third particle

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.840
can be more than this
if the two particles

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.430
are kind of close to each other.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:22.030
If you have two
billiard balls that

00:22:22.030 --> 00:22:25.490
are kind of close to each
other the region between them

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:28.700
is also excluded for
the first particle.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:33.680
We are throwing that out and
one can show that that is really

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.610
throwing out things
that are higher

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:40.010
order in the ratio of omega
over V So if you're right,

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:44.930
this is really an
expansion in omega over V

00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:47.660
and I have calculated
things correctly

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:50.040
to order of omega over V.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.910
And if I am consistent
with that and I multiply

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:58.840
all of these things together,
the first term is V to the N

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:05.600
and then I have 1 minus omega
plus 2 omega plus all the way

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.940
to N minus 1 omega which then
basically sums out to 1 plus 2

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:18.590
plus 3 all the way to N minus
1, which is N minus 1 over 2

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:20.215
in the large N limit.

00:23:20.215 --> 00:23:23.786
It's the same thing
as N squared over 2

00:23:23.786 --> 00:23:29.750
and this whole thing is
raised to the power-- OK

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:35.290
this whole thing I can
approximate by V minus N

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:36.865
omega over 2 squared.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.300
There are various
ways of seeing this.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:46.320
I mean one way of seeing this
is to pair things one from one

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:50.430
end and one from the
other end and then

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.040
multiply them together.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:54.590
When you multiply
them you will have

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.450
a term that would go be
V squared, a term that

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:00.780
would be proportionate
to V omega

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:04.520
and would be the sum of
the coefficients of omega

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.530
from the two.

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:10.220
And you can see that
if I pick, say, alpha

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:12.640
term from this
side N minus alpha

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.730
minus one term from
the other side,

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:20.560
add them up, the alphas
cancel out, N and N minus 1

00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.150
are roughly the same, so
basically the square of two

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:31.190
of them is the same as
the square of V minus N

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.850
omega over 2.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:38.764
And then I can repeat that
for all pairs and I get this.

00:24:38.764 --> 00:24:39.263
Sorry.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.650
So the statement is that
the effect of the excluded

00:24:47.650 --> 00:24:57.000
volumes since it is joint
effect of mutually excluding

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.810
each other is that V to the
N that I have for ideal gas,

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:04.950
each one of them can go
over the entire place,

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:10.450
gets replaced by V minus
something to the power of N

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.240
and that something
is N omega over 2.

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.120
Plus higher orders
in powers of omega.

00:25:23.228 --> 00:25:23.728
OK?

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:33.630
So I will call this a
mean field estimate.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.300
Really, it's an average
density estimate

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.840
but this kind of
approximation is typically

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.890
done for magnetic systems
and in that context

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:54.840
the name of mean
field has stuck.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.850
And the ultimate result is that
my estimation for the partition

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:09.210
function is 1 over
N factorial lambda

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:14.660
to the power of 3 N V
minus N omega over 2

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:20.370
raised to the power of N
because of the excluded volume

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.960
and because of the Boltzmann
weight of the attraction

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.070
between particles
I have a term which

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:30.620
is e to the minus beta
U N squared over 2V.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.420
OK?

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.740
So the approximations
are clear on what

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:50.765
set of assumptions I get this
estimate for the partition

00:26:50.765 --> 00:26:53.450
function.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:55.730
Once I have the
partition function,

00:26:55.730 --> 00:27:00.060
I can calculate the
pressure because log z is

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.890
going to be related
to free energy,

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:05.500
the derivative of the free
energy respect to volume

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.450
will give me the pressure,
and you can ultimately

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:14.410
check that the formula
is that beta P is the log

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:20.720
Z by d V. That's
the correct formula.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.490
And because we are doing this
in the canonical formalism

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.490
that I emphasized
over here, let's

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:31.080
call this P that we get through
this process beta P canonical.

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:34.970
OK?

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:40.060
So when I take log z,
there's a bunch of terms

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.990
and I don't really
care about because they

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.810
don't have V dependence
from N factorial lambda

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:48.830
to the power of 3N,
but I have N times log

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:52.260
of V minus N omega over 2.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:54.830
So that has V dependence.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.120
Take the derivative of log
of V minus N omega over 2,

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.580
what do I get?

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.760
I get V minus N omega over 2.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.000
The other theorem
when I take the log

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.020
I have a minus beta
U N squared over 2 V

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.160
so then I take a
derivative of this 1

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.480
over V. I will
get minus 1 over V

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.500
squared so I have
a term here which

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:33.090
is beta U over 2 N
squared over V squared.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:39.380
OK?

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.930
Let's multiply by
k T so that we have

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:47.220
the formula for P canonical.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:56.940
P canonical is then N k
T V minus N omega over 2

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:02.750
and then I have-- I think I made
a sign over here-- yes the sign

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.880
error that I made
is as follows-- note

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.350
that the potential is attractive
so I have a minus U here.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:15.820
So when I exponentiate
that, it becomes a plus here

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:20.260
and will be a plus
here and therefore I

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:27.250
will have a minus here
and I will have a minus U

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:32.740
over 2 times the
density squared.

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.720
OK?

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.600
So what did we arrive at?

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.042
We arrived at the van
der Waals equation.

00:29:44.494 --> 00:29:44.994
OK?

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:53.330
So we discussed
already last time

00:29:53.330 --> 00:30:00.030
around that if I now look
at the isotherms pressure

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.970
volume at different
temperatures,

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.980
at high temperatures
I have no problem.

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.500
I will get things that look
reasonable except if I have

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:17.220
to terminate at something that
is related to this excluded

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:22.500
volume, whereas if I go to
low temperatures, what happens

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.910
is that the kind of
isotherms that I get

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:31.630
have a structure which
is kind of like this

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:38.350
and incorporates a region
which violates everything

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.630
that we know about
thermodynamics,

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.880
is not stable, et cetera.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.420
OK?

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.310
So what happened here?

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:53.920
I did a calculation.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.000
You can see every step of
the calculation over there.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.370
Why does it give me nonsense?

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:09.500
Everything that you need
to know is on the board.

00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:18.720
Suggestions?

00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.866
Yep?

00:31:22.866 --> 00:31:24.657
AUDIENCE: The assumption
of uniform density

00:31:24.657 --> 00:31:26.360
in a phase transition?

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.580
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:31.030
That's the picture
that I put over here.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.510
If I draw the box that
corresponds to what

00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:37.750
is happening over there,
what's going on in the box?

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.100
So there is a box.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:44.860
I have particles in it
and in the region where

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.640
this nonsense is
happening, what is actually

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:48.930
happening in reality?

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.390
What is actually
happening in reality

00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:54.380
is that I get some
of the particles

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:58.220
to condense into
liquid drops somewhere

00:31:58.220 --> 00:31:59.880
and then there's
basically the rest

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.950
of them floating
around as a gas.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.360
Right?

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:12.560
So clearly I cannot, for this
configuration that I have over

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:18.730
here, calculate energy
and contribution this way.

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:26.460
So coexistence implies
non-uniform density.

00:32:33.885 --> 00:32:34.385
OK?

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:41.120
So what do we do?

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:44.100
I want to carry out
this calculation.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.490
I want to stay as
much as possible

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:50.070
and within this framework
and I can do it,

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:52.679
but I need to do
one other thing.

00:32:52.679 --> 00:32:53.345
Any suggestions?

00:32:58.860 --> 00:32:59.930
Yes?

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:03.670
AUDIENCE: Try to describe
both densities simultaneously?

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.695
PROFESSOR: Try to
describe both densities--

00:33:06.695 --> 00:33:08.320
AUDIENCE: You know
the amount of liquid

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:10.310
and the amount of
vapor on average--

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.610
PROFESSOR: I guess I could.

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.341
I have an easier
way of doing things.

00:33:17.341 --> 00:33:17.840
OK.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:20.540
So the easier way that
I have on doing things

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:23.860
is we have emphasized
that in thermodynamics, we

00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:26.570
can look at different
perspectives.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.780
Problem with this
perspective of the canonical

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.880
is that I know that I will
encounter this singularity.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.540
I know that.

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:38.450
There's phase diagrams
like this exist.

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:43.070
Whereas if I use this
prescription I have one.

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:45.370
So what's the difference
is this prescription

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:49.240
is better mind in terms of
pressure and temperature.

00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:52.500
So what I want to
do is to replace

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:55.380
the canonical
perspective with what

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:00.080
I will call the isobaric-- it's
the Gibbs canonical ensemble.

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.220
In this context it's
called isobaric ensemble

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:08.469
where rather than describing
things at fixed volume,

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:11.560
I describe things
at fixed pressure.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:14.010
So I tell you what
pressure, temperature,

00:34:14.010 --> 00:34:16.710
and the number of
particles are and then

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:21.440
I calculate the corresponding
Gibbs partition function.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.449
Why does that help?

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:30.690
Why that helps is because of
what you see on the left side

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.900
diagram is if I
wanted to maintain

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.120
this system at the
fixed pressure rather

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.810
than a fixed volume,
I would replace

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.900
one of the walls of this
container with a piston

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:45.520
and then I would apply a
particular value of pressure.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.620
Then you can see that a
situation such as this

00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.179
does not occur.

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:58.300
The piston will move
so that ultimately I

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:00.650
have a uniform density.

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:05.820
If I'm choosing my
pressure to be up here,

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.100
then it would be all liquid.

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.700
If I choose my pressure to be
down here, it will be all gas.

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.220
So I have this piston on top.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:16.250
It does not tolerate
coexistence.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:19.260
It will either keep
everybody in the gas phase

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.590
or it will compress,
change the volume

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:25.970
so that everybody becomes
liquid so what I have done

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.520
is I have gotten
rid of the volume.

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:32.670
And I do expect that
in this ensemble as I

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.270
change pressure and
go through this line,

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:40.340
there is a discontinuity that
I should observe in volume.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.790
OK?

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:43.660
So again just think
of the physics.

00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.860
Put the piston, what's
going to happen?

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:49.050
It's going to be either
one or the other.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.780
And whether it is one or the
other, I'm at uniform density

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:56.150
and so I should be able to
use that approximation that I

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.034
have over there.

00:35:58.034 --> 00:36:00.330
OK?

00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:04.100
So mathematics,
what does that mean?

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:07.240
This Gibbs version
of the partition

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.330
function in this
isobaric ensemble,

00:36:10.330 --> 00:36:14.060
you don't fix the volume
you just integrate over

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:19.200
all possible volumes weighted
by this e to the minus beta P V

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:22.130
that does the Laplace
transform from one ensemble

00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:26.550
to the other of the
partition function

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:35.730
which is at some fixed
volume, V T N. OK?

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:47.106
And for this we use the
uniform density approximation.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:58.980
So my Gibbs partition
function, function

00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:06.530
of P T and N is the integral 0
to infinity d V e to the minus

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:14.720
beta P V and I guess I have
what would go over here

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:24.850
would be log Z of V T N. OK?

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:28.160
Again this is answer
to previous question,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.310
I am in the thermodynamic limit.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:37.030
I expect that this which gives
essentially the probabilities

00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:39.500
or the weights of
different volumes

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.390
is going to be dominated
by a single volume that

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.120
makes the largest contribution
to the thermodynamics

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:49.110
or to this integration.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.710
But this integration
should be subtle point

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:56.780
like so what I would do is I
will call whatever is appearing

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:02.560
here to be some function of V
because I'm integrating over V

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:05.790
and I'm going to
look for its extreme.

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:12.450
So basically I expect that this
because of this subtle point

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:19.580
will be e to the psi of V
that maximizes this weight.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:24.220
OK?

00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:34.270
So what I have to do is I
have to take the psi by d V

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.990
and set that to 0.

00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:45.830
Well part of it is simply minus
beta P. The other part of it

00:38:45.830 --> 00:39:00.340
is log Z by d V but the log
Z by d V I have up there.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.290
It's the same Z that
I'm calculating.

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.980
It is beta P canonical.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.710
So this is none
other than minus beta

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:14.980
the P that I in this
ensemble have set out,

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:18.529
minus this P canonical that
I calculated before which

00:39:18.529 --> 00:39:19.820
is some function of the volume.

00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.600
Again, generally, it's fine.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.550
We expect the
different ensembles

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.080
to correspond to each
other and essentially that

00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.670
says that most of the time
you will see that you're

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:44.060
going to get the pressure
calculated in this fashion

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.510
and calculated canonically
to be the same thing.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:54.970
Except that sometimes we seem
to have ambiguity because what

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.760
I should do is given that I
have some particular value

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:06.750
of pressure that I emphasize
exists in my isobaric ensemble,

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:09.020
I calculate what
the corresponding V

00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.500
is by solving this equation.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.710
What is this
equation graphically?

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:17.420
It says pick your
P and figure out

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:23.560
what volume in these
canonical curves, intersected.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:28.250
So the case that I drew
has clearly one answer.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:32.720
I can go up here
I have one answer.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:36.990
But what do I do when I have
a situation such as this?

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:38.600
I have three answers.

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:50.500
So in this ensemble I
say what the pressure is

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.670
and I ask, well,
what's the volume?

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:56.590
It says you should solve this
equation to find the volume.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.670
I solve the equation
graphically and I

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.880
have now three
possible solutions.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.988
What does that mean?

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:12.910
All this equation says is that
these solutions are extrema.

00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:15.940
I set the derivative to 0.

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:22.060
The task here is to find if
I have multiple solutions,

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:27.310
the one that gives me the
largest value over here.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:29.910
So what could be happening?

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:34.140
What is happening is
that when I'm integrating

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:37.610
as a function of
V, this integrand

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:41.910
which is e to psi of V. Right?

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:45.510
An integrand in the
curve let's call

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:49.070
these curves over
here number one.

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:52.240
In the case number one
there's a clear solution

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:59.640
is if I'm scanning in volume,
there is a particular location

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:05.530
that maximizes this side of V
and the corresponding volume

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:07.710
is unambiguous.

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:09.900
If I go and look
at the curve let's

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:16.035
say up here let's call it
that case number three.

00:42:16.035 --> 00:42:21.210
For case number three it
also hits the blue curve

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:25.420
unambiguously at one point
which is at much lower volume

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.720
and so presumably
I have a situation

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:30.200
such as this for my number two.

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:37.860
Now given these
two cases it is not

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:44.040
surprising that the middle
one, let's say number two here,

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.070
corresponds to a situation
where you have two maximums.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:52.790
So generically,
presumably, case number two

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.840
corresponds to
something such as this.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:58.640
OK?

00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:02.920
There are three solutions to
setting the derivative to 0.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.570
There are three extrema.

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:08.130
Two extrema
correspond to maxima.

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:11.350
One extrema corresponds
to the minimum

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:14.810
and falls between the
two and clearly that

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:19.610
corresponds to this portion
that we say is unstable.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:23.610
It's clearly unstable because
it's the least likely place

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.250
that you're going
to find something.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.930
Right?

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:29.410
Not the least likely but if you
go a little bit to either side,

00:43:29.410 --> 00:43:32.790
the probabilities
really increase.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:33.290
Yes?

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.180
AUDIENCE: I think your
indices don't correspond

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:38.500
on the plot you've just
drawn and on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:44.682
Like 1, 2, 3 in parentheses,
in two different cases

00:43:44.682 --> 00:43:47.620
they don't correspond to it.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.567
PROFESSOR: Let's
pick number one.

00:43:50.567 --> 00:43:52.523
AUDIENCE: Number
one is when we have

00:43:52.523 --> 00:43:54.724
a singular maximum
is the biggest.

00:43:54.724 --> 00:43:56.390
PROFESSOR: With the
biggest volume, yes?

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.940
AUDIENCE: No.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:58.340
Number two should be--

00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.260
PROFESSOR: Oh, yes.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.020
That's right.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:08.860
So this is number three
and this is number two.

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:14.560
And for number two I indicated
that there are maxima that I

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:18.720
labelled one, two, and three
without the parenthesis that

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.610
would presumably
correspond to these.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.320
OK?

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:33.590
So then you see there
is now no ambiguity.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.710
I have to pick
among the three that

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:44.110
occur over there, the three
solutions that correspond

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.390
that occur from the
van der Waals equation.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:52.130
The one that would give the
highest value for this function

00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.780
psi.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:59.580
Actually what is psi if you
think about this ensemble?

00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:07.325
This ensemble is going to
be dominated by minus beta P

00:45:07.325 --> 00:45:14.310
V at the location of the
V that is thermodynamic.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:19.530
This Z is e to the minus beta
E, so there's a minus beta E

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:24.750
and there's omega which
gives me a beta T S.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.460
So it is this combination
of thermodynamic quantities

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:33.520
which if you go and look at your
extensivity characterization

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:37.900
is related to the
chemical potential.

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:42.590
So the value of the
psi at the maximum

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:46.360
is directly related to
the chemical potential

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:51.180
and finding which one of
these has the largest value

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.580
corresponds to which solution
has the lowest chemical

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.770
potential.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.320
Remember we were drawing this
curve last time around where

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.230
we integrated van der
Waals equation to calculate

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.050
the chemical
potential and then we

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.570
have multiple solutions
for chemical potential.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.843
We picked the lowest one.

00:46:09.843 --> 00:46:13.491
Well, here's the justification.

00:46:13.491 --> 00:46:13.990
OK?

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:17.230
All right.

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.370
So now what's happening?

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:26.170
So the question
that I ask is how

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:32.130
can doing integrals such as
this give you some singularity

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.210
as you're scanning in say
pressure or temperature

00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:37.660
along the lines such as this?

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:43.200
And now we have the
mechanism because presumably

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:47.530
as I go from here to here
the maximum that corresponds

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:53.580
to the liquid volume will get
replaced with the maximum that

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:57.010
corresponds to the gas
volume or vice versa.

00:46:57.010 --> 00:47:04.770
So essentially if you have
a curve such as two then

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:11.960
the value of your Z which is
also e to the minus beta U N

00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:20.840
as we said is determined by the
contribution from here or here.

00:47:20.840 --> 00:47:22.480
Well, let's write both of them.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.810
I have e to the
psi corresponding

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:30.920
to the V of the gas plus
e to the psi corresponding

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.580
to V the liquid.

00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:37.040
Now both of these
quantities are quantities

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.550
that in the large N limit
will be exponentially large.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:46.390
So one or the
other will dominate

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:49.550
and the mechanism of
the phase transition

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:53.190
is that as I change
parameters, as I change my P,

00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:56.510
I go from a situation
that is like this

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.100
to a situation
that is like this.

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:03.270
The two maxima change heights.

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.770
OK?

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.926
It is because you are
in the large N limit

00:48:10.926 --> 00:48:15.640
that this can be expressed
either as being this

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.260
or as being the other
and not as a mixture

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:21.410
because the mixture you
can write it that way

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:23.930
but it's a negligible
contribution

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:25.880
from one or the other.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:30.040
This is the answer I was giving
in connection with computer

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.540
simulations.

00:48:31.540 --> 00:48:35.330
Computer simulations, let's
say you have 1,000 particles.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:40.170
You have e to the 1,000 times
something, e to the 1,000

00:48:40.170 --> 00:48:42.600
times another thing,
and if you, for example,

00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:47.760
look at the curves for
something like the density

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:52.990
you will find that you will
start with the gas density.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.700
You ultimately have to
go to the liquid density

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.960
in the true
thermodynamic limit there

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.310
will be a discontinuity here.

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.580
If you do a computer
simulation with finite end,

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.810
you will get a continuous
curve joining one to the other.

00:49:08.810 --> 00:49:12.500
As you make your size of
your system simulated bigger,

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.920
this becomes
sharper and sharper,

00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:18.960
but truly the
singularity will emerge

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.290
only in the N goes
to infinity limit.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:26.820
So phase transitions, et
cetera, mathematically really

00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.130
exist only for infinite
number of particles.

00:49:30.130 --> 00:49:33.310
Well, of course, for
10 to the 23 particles

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:35.340
the resolution you
would need over

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.010
here to see that it's
actually going continuously

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.760
from one to the other
is immeasurably small.

00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:46.565
OK?

00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:51.820
Any questions about that?

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.250
I guess there was
one other thing

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.270
that maybe we should note.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:50:01.350
So if I ask what is the
pressure that corresponds

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.050
to the location of
this phase transition,

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.500
so what is the value of
the pressure that separates

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.620
the liquid and gas, the
location of the singularity?

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:19.450
I would have to find Pc from
the following observation,

00:50:19.450 --> 00:50:23.810
that that's the pressure
at which the two

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:27.800
psi's, psi of the
gas is the same thing

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:31.220
as the psi of the liquid.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:33.160
Right?

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.010
All right.

00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:39.312
Or alternatively, the difference
between them is equal to 0.

00:50:39.312 --> 00:50:40.780
OK?

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.720
And the difference
between-- I can

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:46.220
write this kind of
trivially as the integral

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:48.800
of the derivative
of the function.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:57.860
So d V d psi by d V integrated
between the V of the liquid

00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:59.060
and then the V of the gas.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:06.440
That integral should be 0.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:11.450
d psi by d V we established,
is this quantity.

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:25.420
It is beta integral from
V liquid to V gas d V P

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:31.600
canonical of V minus this
P transition that I want,

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.620
has to be zero.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.970
OK?

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:38.470
So what do I have to do?

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:44.420
Since that we identify the
location of your Pc such

00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:49.630
that if you integrate the
canonical minus this Pc

00:51:49.630 --> 00:51:54.320
all the way from the V of
the gas to V of the liquid,

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:59.110
this integral will give you 0.

00:51:59.110 --> 00:52:02.300
So this is the
Maxwell construction

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:04.719
that you were using last time.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:12.430
Again, it is
equivalent to the fact

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:17.520
that we stated that really this
object is the same or related

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:21.430
to the chemical potential, so
I'm requiring that the chemical

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:27.080
potential should be the same
as I go through the transition.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:34.840
Yes?

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:38.720
AUDIENCE: Could you repeat
why minus finite size

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.680
does not in phase transition?

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:41.405
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:52:41.405 --> 00:52:41.904
Yes.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:55.690
So let's imagine that I
have two possibilities that

00:52:55.690 --> 00:53:01.360
appear as exponentials but
the number that is appearing

00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:05.800
in the exponential which is the
analog of N makes one of them

00:53:05.800 --> 00:53:10.560
to be positive so I have
e to the N u and the other

00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.660
to be negative.

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:17.358
So my object would be
something like this.

00:53:17.358 --> 00:53:19.270
OK?

00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:25.270
Then what is this?

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:31.050
This is related to a factor of
2 to hyperbolic cosine of N u.

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:31.550
OK?

00:53:34.530 --> 00:53:38.700
So this is like some kind
of a partition function

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.000
and what we are
interested is something

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.465
like the log of this quantity.

00:53:45.050 --> 00:53:47.550
And maybe if I take a
derivative with respect

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:50.480
to u of this I
will get something

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.500
like the tangent of N u.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:54.000
OK?

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.450
So some kind-- something
like a tangent and u

00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:58.420
would be something
like the expectation

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:00.330
value of this quantity.

00:54:00.330 --> 00:54:04.210
It's either plus u
or minus u and it

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:09.980
occurs-- so the average of
it would be e to the N u

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:16.370
minus e to the minus N u e to
the N u plus e to the minus N u

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:20.210
and so u would be some
kind of an expectation

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:22.500
value of the quantity
such as this.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:26.940
Now what is this function look
like the function tangent.

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:32.710
So for positive values it goes
to plus 1, for negative values

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:37.500
it goes to minus 1 and it's a
perfectly continuous function.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:40.350
It goes to 0.

00:54:40.350 --> 00:54:41.630
All right?

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:44.020
That's the tangent function.

00:54:44.020 --> 00:54:48.490
Now suppose I calculate
this for N of 10,

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.450
this is the curve that I drew.

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:54.640
Suppose I draw this
same curve for N of 100.

00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:56.860
For N of 100 I
claim that the curve

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:03.330
will look something like
this because the slope

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:05.900
that you have at the
origin for the tangent

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:10.110
grows like N so basically
becomes steeper and steeper

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:14.200
but ultimately has to
saturate one or the other.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:20.030
So what-- for any, for even N of
1,000 then it's a finite slope.

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:24.510
The slope here is related to
1,000 U 1,000, but it's finite.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:26.650
It is only in the
limit where N goes

00:55:26.650 --> 00:55:30.250
to infinity you would say
that the function is either

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:32.950
minus 1 or plus 1
depending on whether U

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:35.350
is positive or negative.

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:38.840
So the same thing
happens as I scan over

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.720
here and ask what
is the density?

00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.940
The density looks precisely
like this tangent function.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:49.680
For finite values of
the number of particles

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:52.090
the density would do
something like this.

00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:55.684
It is only for infinite
number of particles

00:55:55.684 --> 00:55:57.100
that the density
is discontinuous.

00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:02.900
Yes?

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:06.288
AUDIENCE: Sir, on the plot
which you drew initially

00:56:06.288 --> 00:56:10.160
on that board, what are the
axis over which this scans?

00:56:13.255 --> 00:56:14.130
PROFESSOR: Over here?

00:56:14.130 --> 00:56:15.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.841
Just what values
are physical values?

00:56:19.147 --> 00:56:19.730
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:56:19.730 --> 00:56:20.590
Pressure, right?

00:56:20.590 --> 00:56:26.670
So what I said was that if
I scan across pressure what

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:30.130
I will see is a
discontinuity, right?

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:30.840
So if--

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.590
AUDIENCE: You said
that this is the result

00:56:32.590 --> 00:56:34.740
of a numerical experiment with
finite number of particles.

00:56:34.740 --> 00:56:35.890
So what is the parameter
of the experiment,

00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:36.848
and what is the result.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:44.160
PROFESSOR: We have the
density so you could have,

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:46.680
for example, exactly
the situation that I--

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.150
PROFESSOR: Pressure.

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:53.540
This box that I'm
showing you over here,

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:55.060
you simulate on the computer.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:57:00.050
You have a box of finite volume,
you put a piston on top of it,

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:02.879
you simulate 1,000
particles inside.

00:57:02.879 --> 00:57:03.420
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:03.920
Thank you.

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:07.180
PROFESSOR: Then you scan
as a function of pressure,

00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.330
you plug the density.

00:57:09.330 --> 00:57:11.860
Now, of course, if you
want to simulate this,

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:14.420
you have to increase both
the number of particles

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:19.230
and the volume of the box so
that the average density is

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.488
fixed and then you would
see something like this.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:26.260
OK?

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:27.093
Any other questions?

00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:35.625
OK, let's stick
with this picture.

00:57:45.470 --> 00:57:51.190
I kind of focused on the
occurrence of the singularity,

00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:56.460
but now let's see the exact
location of the singularity.

00:57:56.460 --> 00:58:03.246
So I sort of started this
lecture by labeling Pc, Tc, Vc.

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:05.480
Well, what are their values?

00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:06.410
OK.

00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:12.140
So something that you
know from stability

00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:17.000
is that the isotherms
are constrained such

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:21.590
that delta P delta V
has to be negative.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:23.470
OK?

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:32.680
Or writing delta V as a
function of V or delta V,

00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:38.740
this is d P by d V along an
isotherm delta V plus d 2

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:42.500
P by d V squared along
the isotherm delta

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:49.710
V squared-- this is one-half
plus one-sixth d cubed P d

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:53.630
V cubed along the
isotherm and so forth.

00:58:53.630 --> 00:59:00.498
This whole thing
has to be negative.

00:59:00.498 --> 00:59:00.998
OK?

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:13.960
Now generically I pick a point
and a small value of delta V

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:17.280
and the statement is
that along the isotherm

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.220
this derivative
has to be negative.

00:59:21.220 --> 00:59:28.420
So generically what
I have is that d P

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:33.430
by d V for a physical
isotherm has to be negative

00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:37.390
and indeed the reason we
don't like that portion

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:41.890
is because it violates
the stability condition.

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:44.080
Well, clearly that
will be broken

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:48.760
at one point the isotherm that
corresponds to T equals to Tc

00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.340
is not a generic isotherm.

00:59:51.340 --> 00:59:58.120
That's an isotherm that at some
point it comes in tangentially.

00:59:58.120 --> 01:00:06.020
So there is over here a
point where d P by d V is 0

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.940
and we already discussed this.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:16.250
If d P by d V is 0 then
the second derivative

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:20.500
in such an expansion
must also be 0.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.000
Why?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:25.396
Because if it is
nonzero, irrespective

01:00:25.396 --> 01:00:29.275
of whether it is positive or
negative, since it multiplies

01:00:29.275 --> 01:00:34.510
that V cubed, I will be
able to pick a delta V such

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:37.610
that the sine will be
violated by the delta V

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:40.290
of positive or
delta V of negative.

01:00:40.290 --> 01:00:45.990
And clearly what it says is
that over here the simplest

01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:50.060
curve that you can have
should not have a second order

01:00:50.060 --> 01:00:51.560
therm which would
be like a parabola

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.260
but should be like a cubic.

01:00:54.260 --> 01:01:02.520
And that the sine of the
cubic should be appropriate

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.150
the negative so that delta V to
the fourth is always positive,

01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:08.520
then you have the right thing.

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.530
OK?

01:01:10.530 --> 01:01:18.010
So given that information I
have sufficient parameters,

01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:22.770
information to calculate what
the location of Pc, Tc, Vc

01:01:22.770 --> 01:01:27.990
are for the van der Waals or
other approximate equation

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:29.620
of state such as
the one that you

01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:32.310
will encounter in the problems.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.430
So let's stick with
the van der Waals

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:46.290
so the van der Waals equation
is that my P is-- actually

01:01:46.290 --> 01:01:55.400
let's divide by N so it
would be volume per particle

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.920
so I have introduced V to be
the volume per particle which

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.670
is the inverse of the
density, if you like,

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.900
so that is intensive.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:09.100
V minus-- there's
some excluded volume,

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.420
let's call it
through the volume b

01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:13.570
and then I have
minus something that

01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:17.250
goes like the inverse
of this excluded volume,

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:19.760
let's write it as a.

01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:22.440
Just I write those two
parameters as a and b

01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.060
because I will be
taking many derivatives

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:29.021
and I don't want to write
anything more complicated.

01:02:29.021 --> 01:02:29.520
OK.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.880
So that's the equation.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.620
We said that the location
of this critical point

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.260
is obtained by the
requirement that d P by d V

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:42.160
should be 0 so what is that?

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:50.430
It is minus k V T divided by
V minus b squared plus 2 a

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:54.920
over V cubed so I
took one derivative.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:58.510
And the second derivative
is now constrained also,

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:03.090
so that's going to
give me plus 2 k T V

01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:10.130
minus b cubed minus
6 a V to the fourth.

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:12.040
OK?

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:17.580
Now if I'm at a critical
point-- so I put c over here,

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:22.950
this will be 0, and
this will also be 0.

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:29.010
So the conditions for
the critical point

01:03:29.010 --> 01:03:39.350
are that first of all k B Tc
divided by Vc minus b cubed

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:44.300
should be 2 a over
Vc cubed and 2

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:51.680
k B Tc Vc minus b to the
fourth power should be 6 a

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.958
divided by Vc to
the fourth power.

01:03:55.958 --> 01:03:58.940
Hmm?

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:05.460
So this is two equations for two
unknowns, which are Tc and Vc.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:08.990
We can actually reduce
it to one variable

01:04:08.990 --> 01:04:12.580
by dividing these two
equations with each other.

01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:14.520
The division of
the left-hand sides

01:04:14.520 --> 01:04:20.580
will give me Vc minus b
in the numerator divided

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:24.370
by 2 in the denominator.

01:04:24.370 --> 01:04:31.850
The ratio of these two
is simply Vc over 3.

01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:34.610
That's a one variable equation.

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:35.575
Yes?

01:04:35.575 --> 01:04:38.808
AUDIENCE: Where you have
written the equations in terms

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:42.266
Vc minus b and Vc, it should
come in different powers.

01:04:42.266 --> 01:04:45.593
So our first equation should
be Vc minus b squared.

01:04:45.593 --> 01:04:46.218
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:04:46.218 --> 01:04:47.134
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:55.680
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:04:55.680 --> 01:05:01.330
Magically the ratio
does not get affected

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:05.450
and therefore neither
does the answer

01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:11.560
which is Vc which is 3 b
so that's one parameter.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:15.840
I can substitute that
Vc into this equation

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.710
and get what k B Tc is.

01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:26.730
And hopefully you
can see that this

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:30.860
will become 2 b
squared, which is 4b

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:37.250
squared so this gives me a
factor of 8 a, ratio of these

01:05:37.250 --> 01:05:43.720
will give me one factor
of b, so that's k B Tc.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:49.220
And then if I substitute
those in the first equation,

01:05:49.220 --> 01:05:54.800
I will get the value
of Pc and I happen

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.800
to know that the answer--
oops, this is going to be 27,

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:03.410
I forgot because 3
cubed will give me 27.

01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:07.950
And Pc here will
give me 27 also.

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:12.242
I believe b squared a and
there will be a factor of 1.

01:06:16.602 --> 01:06:17.102
OK.

01:06:21.948 --> 01:06:22.448
OK?

01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:28.370
Really the only
thing that actually I

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:30.610
wanted to get out
of this, you can

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:34.120
do this for any equation
of state, et cetera.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:37.680
Point is that we
now have something

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:40.060
to compare to experiment.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:48.180
We have a dimension less
ratio Pc Vc divided by k B Tc.

01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:53.820
So I multiply these two
numbers, I will get one-ninth.

01:06:53.820 --> 01:06:57.550
And then I have
here a factor of 8

01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:02.250
so the whole thing becomes
a factor of 3 over 8

01:07:02.250 --> 01:07:06.420
which is 0.375.

01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:08.570
OK?

01:07:08.570 --> 01:07:14.390
So the point is that we
constructed this van der Waals

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:20.130
equation through some
reasonable description of a gas.

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:23.120
You would imagine that
practically any type of gas

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.170
that you have will have some
kind of excluded volume so that

01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:30.510
was one of the parameters
that we used in calculating

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:34.070
our estimation for the
partition function,

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:37.040
ultimately getting this omega.

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:40.470
And there's some kind of
attraction at large distance

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:44.170
that's been integrated
over the entire range,

01:07:44.170 --> 01:07:46.580
here was this factor
of U. You would

01:07:46.580 --> 01:07:50.340
expect that to be quite generic.

01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:54.160
And once we sort of put
this into this machinery

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:57.110
that generic thing makes
a particular prediction.

01:07:57.110 --> 01:08:02.620
It says that pick any gas,
find it's critical point--

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.860
critical point occurs
with for some value

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:09.210
of Pc density or
inverse density, Vc,

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.910
and some characteristic
[INAUDIBLE] pressure k B Tc.

01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:17.600
This is a dimensionless ratio
you can calculate for any gas

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.950
and based on this
semi-reasonable assumption

01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:24.000
that we made, no matter what
you do you should come up

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.979
the number that is around this.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:28.220
OK?

01:08:28.220 --> 01:08:29.519
So what you find in experiment?

01:08:33.450 --> 01:08:46.585
You find that the values of this
combination from 0.28 to 0.33,

01:08:46.585 --> 01:08:49.399
so that's kind of a range
that you find for this.

01:08:49.399 --> 01:08:52.180
So first of all, you
don't find that it

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.770
is the same for all gases.

01:08:54.770 --> 01:08:57.140
There is some variation.

01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.830
And that it's not
this value of 3 8.

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:05.130
So there's certainly
now questions

01:09:05.130 --> 01:09:08.310
to be asked about the
approximation, how

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:12.160
you could make it better.

01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:14.529
You could say, OK,
actually most of the gases,

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:17.170
you don't have
spherical potentials.

01:09:17.170 --> 01:09:21.010
You have things that
are diatomic that shape

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:22.399
may be important.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.470
And so the estimation
that we have

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:30.750
for the energy for the omega
et cetera is too approximate.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.649
There is something
to that because you

01:09:32.649 --> 01:09:38.560
find that you get more or less
the same value in this range

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:42.500
for gases that are similar, like
helium, krypton, neon, argon,

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.020
et cetera, they're kind
of like each other.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:48.080
Oxygen, nitrogen, these
diatomic molecules

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:51.260
are kind of like each other.

01:09:51.260 --> 01:09:51.859
OK?

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:56.740
So there is some
hope to maybe get

01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:58.659
the more universal description.

01:09:58.659 --> 01:09:59.950
So what is it that we're after?

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:03.960
I mean the thing that is so
nice about the ideal gas law

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:07.620
is that it doesn't matter what
material you are looking at.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:09.870
You make it
sufficiently dilute, you

01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:12.660
know exactly what the
equation of state is.

01:10:12.660 --> 01:10:16.270
It will be good if
we could extend that.

01:10:16.270 --> 01:10:19.820
If we could say something
about interacting gases

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:23.150
that also maybe depends
on just a few parameters.

01:10:23.150 --> 01:10:25.960
So you don't have to go
and do a huge calculation

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.980
for the case of
each gas, but you

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:34.060
have something that has the
sense of universality to it.

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.680
So clearly the van
der Waals equation

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.480
is a step in that direction,
but it is not quite good enough.

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:45.440
So people said,
well, maybe what we

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.420
should do is increase
the number of parameters,

01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:52.520
because currently we are
constructing everything

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:54.540
based on two
parameters, the excluded

01:10:54.540 --> 01:10:57.520
volume and some
integrated attraction.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.720
So those are the two parameters
and with two parameters

01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.680
you really can only
fit two things.

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:08.940
What we see that the ratio of
Pc Vc over k T is not fixed,

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:11.950
it's as a range, so
maybe what we should do

01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:14.650
is to go to three parameters.

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:20.470
So this whole is
captured by the search

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:22.701
for law of corresponding states.

01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:32.710
So the hope is that let's
do a three parameter system.

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:35.170
Which parameters
should I choose?

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:38.020
Well, clearly the
different systems

01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:43.130
are characterized by Pc Tc
and Nc T at critical point,

01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:48.470
so maybe what I should do is I
should measure all pressures,

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:52.420
made them dimensionless
by dividing by Pc

01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:55.570
and hope that there is some
universal function that

01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:59.970
relates that to the ratio of
all temperatures divided by Tc,

01:11:59.970 --> 01:12:04.200
all densities or inverse
densities divided

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.680
by the corresponding Vc.

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:12.870
So is there such a curve so
that that was a whole and you go

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:16.500
and play around with this curve
and it is with this suggestion

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.010
and you can convince yourself
very easily that it cannot be

01:12:20.010 --> 01:12:21.080
the case.

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:22.910
And one easy way
to think about it

01:12:22.910 --> 01:12:25.730
is that if this
was the case, then

01:12:25.730 --> 01:12:28.220
all of our virial
expansions and all

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:31.660
of the perturbative expansions
that we had should also

01:12:31.660 --> 01:12:35.200
somehow collapse together
with a few parameters.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:37.990
Whereas all of these
complicated diagrams that we

01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:42.030
had with the cycles and
shapes and different things

01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:44.870
of the diagrams are really,
you can calculate them.

01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:47.040
They're completely
independent integrals.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.550
They will give you
results that should not

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:52.710
be collapsible
into a single form.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:58.100
So this was a nice suggestion
what in reality does not work.

01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:05.236
So why am I telling you this?

01:13:05.236 --> 01:13:07.980
The reason I'm
telling you this is

01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:14.280
that surprisingly in the
vicinity of this point

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.470
it does work.

01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:18.800
In the vicinity
of this point you

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:21.940
can get the huge number
of different system gases,

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:26.220
krypton, argon, carbon
dioxide, mixtures,

01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:28.610
a whole lot of things.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:33.290
And if you appropriately rescale
your pressure, temperature,

01:13:33.290 --> 01:13:36.400
et cetera, for all
of these gases,

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.770
they come together and fall
on exactly the same type

01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:42.080
of curve of over here.

01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:42.920
OK?

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.870
So there is universality,
just not over the entire phase

01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:52.040
diagram but in the vicinity
of this critical point.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.010
And so what is special about
that, and why does that work?

01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:59.520
OK?

01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:05.680
So I give you first an
argument that says, well,

01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.760
it really should work.

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:07.910
It shouldn't be a surprise.

01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:17.080
And then show that the simple
argument is in fact wrong.

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:24.290
But let's go through because we
already put the elements of it

01:14:24.290 --> 01:14:26.200
over there.

01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:35.670
So let me try to figure out
what the shape of these pressure

01:14:35.670 --> 01:14:40.140
versus volume curves are
going to be for isotherms that

01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:44.200
correspond to different
temperatures close to Tc.

01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.670
So what I want to
do is to calculate P

01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:49.680
as a function of
volume, actually there's

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:52.780
reduced volume by the
number of particles,

01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:58.520
and P and I'll do the following.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:02.170
I will write this
as an expansion

01:15:02.170 --> 01:15:10.507
but in the following
form-- P of Vc T plus d

01:15:10.507 --> 01:15:23.230
P by d V at Vc T times V
minus, Vc plus one-half V 2

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:32.284
P by d V squared at Vc T minus
Vc squared plus one-sixth d

01:15:32.284 --> 01:15:41.510
cubed P d V cubed at Vc and T
V minus Vc cubed and so forth.

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:45.140
So it's a function
of two arguments.

01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:49.370
Really it has an expansion
in both deviations

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:55.450
from this critical point
along the V direction

01:15:55.450 --> 01:16:00.440
so going away from Vc as
well as going T direction,

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:05.940
going to away from Tc but I
organize it in this fashion

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.860
and realize that actually
these derivatives and all

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.720
of the coefficients will be
a function of T minus Tc.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:17.590
So for example P
of Vc and T starts

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:21.780
with being whatever value I
have at that critical point

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.560
and then if I go to higher
temperatures the pressure will

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.660
go up.

01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:30.230
So there's some coefficient
proportional to T minus Tc

01:16:30.230 --> 01:16:35.170
plus higher order in T minus
Tc and so forth and actually I

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:37.156
expect this alpha
to be positive.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:50.390
The next coefficient d P by
d V Vc T T what do I expect?

01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:57.680
Well, right at this point
d P by d V there's slope.

01:16:57.680 --> 01:17:00.760
This has to be 0 for
the critical isotherm.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:08.375
So it starts with 0 and
then if I go and look

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:12.930
at a curve that corresponds
to high temperatures because

01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:17.830
of the stability, the
slope better be positive.

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:22.060
So I have a T minus
Tc plus our order

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:31.000
that I know that a is
positive because of a-- a

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.710
is negative because
of stability.

01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:35.452
So let's write it
in this fashion.

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:41.890
OK?

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.295
What about the
second derivative?

01:17:48.790 --> 01:17:50.830
Well, we said that if
I look at the point

01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:53.710
where the first derivative is
0, the second derivative better

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:57.810
be 0, so it starts also with 0.

01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:00.760
And then there's some
coefficient to order

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:03.680
of T minus Tc and
then higher order

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.560
and actually I don't know
anything about the sign of P.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.600
It can be both
positive or negative,

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.620
we don't know what it is.

01:18:11.620 --> 01:18:21.160
Now the third derivative
there is no reason

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.250
that it should start at 0.

01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:26.880
It will be some negative
number again in order

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:31.020
to ensure stability and there
will be higher order terms

01:18:31.020 --> 01:18:34.430
in T minus Tc what we have
is structure such as this.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:55.340
So putting everything
together the statement

01:18:55.340 --> 01:19:00.940
is that if I look in the
vicinity of the critical point,

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:05.430
ask what should
pressure look like?

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:07.960
You say, OK, it has to
start with a constant

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:10.270
that we called Pc.

01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:18.790
It has this linear increase
that I put over there.

01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:22.560
The first derivative
is some negative number

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.900
that is proportional to T minus
Tc multiplying by V minus Vc.

01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:38.140
The third coefficient
is negative-- oh

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:41.400
and there's also a second--
there's the second order

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:51.920
coefficient and then there
will be high order terms.

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:58.770
So there should be generically
an expansion such as this.

01:19:58.770 --> 01:20:03.720
Say, well, OK, fine,
what have we learned?

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:07.130
I say, well, OK, let me tell
you about something that we're

01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:08.620
going to experimentally measure.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:12.020
Let's look at the
compressibility, kappa.

01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:19.730
Kappa is minus 1 over V d V
by d P evaluated at whatever

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:22.600
temperature you are looking at.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:28.970
So if I look at this-- actually
I have stated what d P by d V

01:20:28.970 --> 01:20:29.665
is.

01:20:29.665 --> 01:20:33.330
d V by d P will be
the inverse of that,

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.170
so this is going to
give me in the vicinity

01:20:36.170 --> 01:20:39.830
of this critical
point Vc a T minus Tc.

01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:47.910
So the statement is
this is now something

01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:52.080
that I can go and ask
my experimentalist

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.360
friends to measure,
go and calculate

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:59.400
the compressibility
of this gas, plot it

01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:03.080
as a function of temperature,
and the prediction is

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:09.640
that the compressibility
will diverge at T goes to Tc.

01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:10.730
OK?

01:21:10.730 --> 01:21:17.020
So the prediction is that
it is 1 over a T minus Tc.

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:17.550
OK.

01:21:17.550 --> 01:21:19.900
So they go and do
the experiment,

01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.470
they do the experiment
for a huge number

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:25.930
of different systems,
not just one system,

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:29.180
and they come back
and say it is correct.

01:21:29.180 --> 01:21:35.180
The compressibility does
diverge but what we find

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:39.240
is that irrespective of
what gas we are looking at,

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.220
and this is a very
universal, it goes

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:45.279
with an exponent like this.

01:21:45.279 --> 01:21:47.600
OK?

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:53.670
So question is maybe you made
a mistake or you did something

01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.080
or whatever, really
the big puzzle

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:03.260
is why do such different gases
all over the spectrum and even

01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:06.910
some things that are not gases
but other types of things

01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:08.890
all have the same diverges?

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:12.823
Where did this number
1.24 come from?

01:22:12.823 --> 01:22:14.737
OK?

01:22:14.737 --> 01:22:18.962
AUDIENCE: So there isn't a
range like there was 0.375.

01:22:18.962 --> 01:22:20.720
It all depends on 1.24.

01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:24.390
PROFESSOR: All hit 1.24.

01:22:24.390 --> 01:22:26.040
Irrespective of
[? order. ?] It's

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:27.270
a different quantity, though.

01:22:27.270 --> 01:22:30.510
I mean, it's not the
number, it's an exponent.

01:22:30.510 --> 01:22:34.090
It's this, a functional form.

01:22:34.090 --> 01:22:37.400
Why did this functional
form come about?

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:39.760
Another thing that
you predict is

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.770
the shape of the curve at Tc.

01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:47.660
So what we have said is
that at T close to Tc,

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:52.690
the shape of this isotherm is
essentially that P minus Pc is

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:57.150
cubic, it's proportional
to V minus Vc cubed.

01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:00.220
And the way that we said
that is OK at that point

01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:03.250
there's neither a slope
nor a second derivative,

01:23:03.250 --> 01:23:05.740
so it should be cubic.

01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:09.346
They say, OK, what do
you find in experiment?

01:23:09.346 --> 01:23:11.860
You go and do the
experiment and again

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.980
for a whole huge range of
materials all of the data

01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:23.650
collapses and you find the curve
that is something like this,

01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:26.550
is an exponent that
is very close to 5

01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:28.090
but is not exactly 5.

01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:40.540
And again, why not 3 and why
is it always the same number 5?

01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:43.380
How do you understand that?

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.760
Well, I'll tell you why not 3.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:47.620
Why not 3?

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.690
All of the things
that I did here

01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:52.040
was based on the
assumption that I

01:23:52.040 --> 01:23:55.060
could make an
analytical expansion.

01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.820
The whole idea of
writing a Taylor series

01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.950
is based on making
an analytical series.

01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.160
Who told you that you can
do an analytic series?

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:07.200
Experiment tells you
that it is actually

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.130
something non-analytic.

01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:12.680
Why this form of
non-analyticity?

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.070
Why it's universality?

01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:16.770
We won't explain in this course.

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:20.070
If you want to find
out come to a 334.

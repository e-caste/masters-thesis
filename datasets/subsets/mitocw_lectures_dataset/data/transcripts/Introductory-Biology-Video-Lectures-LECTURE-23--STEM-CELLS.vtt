00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.930
HAZEL SIVE: I want to
discuss with you today

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.580
a very topical and
interesting question, which

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.110
is the notion of stem cells.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.420
In fact, I'm going to discuss
two things, the first of which

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.240
is another concept
that you need,

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.520
following on from the
concepts we had right

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.310
at the beginning of lecture.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.740
I feel like this microphone--

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.720
The first is a concept that you
need in addition to the ones

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.220
we started lecture
with, and then

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.550
we'll talk about stem cells.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:15.570
So today, we'll
talk about potency,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.360
and then we'll talk
about stem cells.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.070
Potency, along with
fate, determination,

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.160
and differentiation,
is one of those terms

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.070
that you need to know and you
need to understand in order

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.390
to understand stem cells.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.480
Potency refers to the
number of possible fates

00:01:45.480 --> 00:02:04.370
that a cell can acquire,
number of possible fates

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.840
open to a cell.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.710
And this is a very important
concept of development

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.870
because, in general,
potency decreases with age,

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.680
and decreases as different
parts of the organism

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.740
become specialized.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.245
So in general, potency
decreases with age.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.380
But I will put in
here, and we'll

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:51.100
explore this more in a moment,
except for some stem cells.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.370
And we haven't defined a
stem cell yet, but we will.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.890
What kinds of
potencies are there?

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.080
There's the big one,
totipotent, where

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.110
a cell can become all fates.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.500
And there's really
only one cell that

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.190
can do this in the normal
animal, and is the zygote.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.800
And in most animals,
even as the zygote

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.880
becomes just two
cells or a few cells,

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.600
that full potency is lost.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.590
And cells instead,
in the embryo,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.940
are multi or pluripotent, which
means that they can acquire

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.535
many fates, but not all fates.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.430
Embryonic cells, especially
in the early embryo,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.790
and many stem cells
can also become,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.030
are also multipotent
or pluripotent.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.510
And then as time progresses--
is that a hand up?

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:02.686
Yes, sir.

00:04:02.686 --> 00:04:08.518
AUDIENCE: How do you reconcile
the fact that human cells,

00:04:08.518 --> 00:04:09.976
we can separate them.

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:12.041
Even at the eight cell stage.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:13.540
HAZEL SIVE: That's
a great question.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.204
The question is
how do I reconcile

00:04:15.204 --> 00:04:16.620
what I'm telling
you with the fact

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.970
that you can get
identical sextuplets,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.610
or octuplets actually?

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.870
It's a good question.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.560
That's true.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.310
In different animals, the
very early embryonic cells

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.980
are sometimes totipotent
up to a while.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.760
OK?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.220
And so for example,
in armadillo,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.030
here's a piece of, you know,
fact for your back pockets.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.230
In the armadillo, the
eight-cell embryo almost always

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.590
splits into eight single
cells, each of which

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.401
becomes a baby armadillo.

00:04:48.401 --> 00:04:48.900
OK?

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.050
So those cells are totipotent.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.600
In mice, even at
the two cell stage,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.880
the two mouse cells are
probably not equivalently potent

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.740
and they're not totipotent.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.600
So very, very seldom--

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.541
almost never-- get
identical mouse twins.

00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.040
OK?

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.530
So it's one of
these generalities.

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.650
And if you ask me, you get the
specifics are a bit different.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.400
As cell fate
restriction continues,

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.600
cells can become
bipotent, or unipotent,

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:32.940
whereby one or just two
fates are open to them.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.490
And so if we look,
taking this concept,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.420
let's now start the
lecture about stem cells.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.400
You're going to
need this concept.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.440
Stem cells, I'll point
out, whatever they are,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.880
got almost 3,000 hits
yesterday on Google News.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.950
This is way below
baseball, which got 45,000.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.530
I checked.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.350
But still, you know,
as science topics go,

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.630
stem cells are really up there.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.280
And they're on the covers of
magazines, over and over again.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.260
And we'll talk more
about why that is.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.210
Here's a diagram-- it's
not on your handouts--

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:10.043
that I drew for you.

00:06:10.043 --> 00:06:11.500
Let's not dwell on it.

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.310
But let's now move
on to Topic Number

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:20.130
2, which will fold in
this concept of potency

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:23.220
and the concepts of
fate, determination,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.805
and differentiation, and
talk about stem cells.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.050
And let's do, as is
our custom, let's

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.900
define what a stem cell is.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.300
I think that a stem
cell can be defined

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.510
as a cell of
variable potency that

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.710
has the capacity to self-renew.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:07:06.560
Cells of variable potency
that can self-renew.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.956
They can make more
of themselves.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.250
Despite the hype, despite
covers of Time Magazine

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.540
and almost every front
page of every newspaper

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.150
across the world, stem cells are
normally found in our bodies.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:32.360
And normally, as
we'll explore, they're

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:44.855
used for organ maintenance
and repair, organ maintenance

00:07:44.855 --> 00:07:45.355
and repair.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.880
But the thing, you know,
that has everyone fired up

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.580
is that you can somehow
harness these cells

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.830
for therapeutic purposes.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:03.790
And that you can repair what the
body cannot, by being clever,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:09.130
and using the power of these
cells as they normally have it,

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.420
or as you can give it to them.

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.150
And so there's this question
of therapy and therapeutic stem

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:22.720
cells, where the idea, again, is
that you would repair a damaged

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:36.409
organ by introducing
somehow, injecting

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:45.150
or otherwise introducing, extra
or somehow special stem cells--

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:51.190
which I am going to
abbreviate heretofore as SC--

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:57.270
by introducing extra stem
cells into a damaged body.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.480
Does this work?

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.010
It does work.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.740
It works for the
hematopoietic system,

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.570
as in bone marrow transplants.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.310
And it also works for
skin cell transplants.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.430
Well, let's just put skin cells.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.930
OK.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:42.470
Skin stem cells can be
grown from your own skin.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.330
And in the case of
burn victims, this

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.130
has really saved
countless lives.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:49.700
The original technology
began to be developed here

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.150
at MIT by Professor Howard
Green, who is now at Harvard.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.420
But the idea is
to take your skin

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.480
and grow it on
something like gauze

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.330
or some kind of
some solid support,

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:10.640
and then to cover a burn patient
with layers of support on which

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.650
there are some stem cells.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.890
And these stem cells will
help fill in the holes

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.690
in the skin left by the burn.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.740
Normally when a wound heals,
as I'm sure you've noticed,

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:23.990
it heals from the sides.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.550
The only way a wound can
heal is from the side.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:30.020
And if it's a big wound, it
can take a very, very long time

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:30.530
to heal.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.300
And you can get
infections and so on

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.580
while the healing
process is going on.

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:39.050
So seeding the inside of a
wound with stem cells that

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.840
can start the skin
regeneration process

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.850
and seal up the body
against infection,

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:45.540
that's been incredibly useful.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.805
And we'll talk more about bone
marrow transplants in a moment.

00:10:49.805 --> 00:10:50.305
OK.

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:59.090
We previously talked about this
process by which cells decide,

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.100
are undecided
initially, they decide

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.450
what they're going to become.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.300
And then they differentiate
into their final function.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:08.510
Stem cells fit into
this litany somewhere

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:13.170
between the commitment stage
and the differentiation stage.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.650
And in this diagram,
these multiple arrows

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.340
are there for a reason.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.890
There are multiple steps between
commitment and differentiation.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:26.870
And somewhere along the way, a
group of cells with capacities

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:31.940
we'll talk about,
leaves this lineage

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.990
and sits around and waits,
partially determined,

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.836
so that it can go on and make
more differentiated cells when

00:11:39.836 --> 00:11:40.460
they're needed.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:52.150
And I've added on there the
potency timeline, decreasing

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.770
with age, of the
developing animal.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:04.000
But let's diagram the notion
of stem cells on the board.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.195
Stem cells generally
divide slowly.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:14.270
Here's one.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:20.090
It's a variable potency.

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.820
It may be multipotent.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.870
It may be bipotential.

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:34.660
And it is somewhat
committed, which is

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.340
a slightly difficult concept.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.080
Because last time
we talked about

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.186
committed versus uncommitted.

00:12:40.186 --> 00:12:41.560
But now I'm telling
you something

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.450
can be somewhat committed.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.700
And that gets to
this multiple arrows

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.810
there were as cells progress
in their fate decisions,

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.330
they change their
molecular signature

00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.240
and they really do
become closer and closer

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.310
to a cell that's
made a decision.

00:12:57.310 --> 00:13:00.250
But it's kind of like, you
know, if you're weighing up

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:03.610
going to med school or
going to graduate school

00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:05.860
in bioengineering,
you know, you have

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.960
decided that it will
be one or the other,

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.580
but you haven't decided which.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.972
You're somewhat committed.

00:13:10.972 --> 00:13:12.430
And then when you
make the decision

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:15.510
to go to graduate school, you
have now become committed.

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.010
OK?

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:20.210
So the cell is doing the
same kind of notion there.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:23.110
There's your stem
cell, variable potency.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:26.230
Under the correct
stimulus, that stem cell

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:31.330
will divide to give rise
to two different cells.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.265
One is another stem cell.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:38.870
And the other is something
we'll call a progenitor.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:47.760
The progenitor is more
committed than the stem cell.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:58.100
The progenitor cell
is going to go on

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.625
and divide, usually a lot.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.295
Progenitors divide rapidly.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.620
And their progeny
will eventually

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:22.390
go on and differentiate into
one or more different kinds

00:14:22.390 --> 00:14:34.910
of cells, maybe a stripey
cell, and a spotted cell type,

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.230
and a cell type with squiggles.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.505
And so here are the
differentiated cell types.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.380
And the number of different
differentiated cells

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.050
that comes out of
this process is

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.480
a reflection of the
potency of the stem cell.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.370
OK?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.830
So here you've got
these progenitors.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:05.080
The idea is that
these progenitors

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.460
will have similar potency.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.380
But as I'll show you, there's
a whole variation on this.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:16.640
But here the number of
differentiated cell types,

00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:22.730
the number of cell
types reflects

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:29.070
potency of the stem cell.

00:15:29.070 --> 00:15:29.570
OK?

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.420
This kind of diagram is
called a lineage diagram.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.100
It tells you what--

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.650
not only what the final
fate of the cell is,

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.810
it tells you something
about the progress

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.880
towards that final fate.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:51.960
So a lineage we can
define as the set

00:15:51.960 --> 00:16:03.460
of cell types arising from
a stem cell or a progenitor.

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:26.180
Let's talk about the discovery
of stem cells, because this

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.930
is something that really
was pivotal in helping

00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:33.290
understand whether or not there
was some way that the body

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:35.180
normally repaired itself.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:37.520
It was clear that during
early development,

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.580
there was lots of cell
division and lots of changes.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.520
Cell types were formed
and organs were formed.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.040
But it really wasn't
clear in the adult

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:50.030
how much repair there was,
how much turnover of tissues

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.480
there were, and really what
the whole dynamic process

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.250
of maintaining the adult was.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.630
And the discovery of
stem cells came about

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:10.329
because people looked to
see how long cells lived.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:14.550
And what they found
was found using

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:21.360
a turnover assay that measures
the half life of cells.

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:32.070
And they found that
in almost all organs,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.790
in fact, probably in all organs,
cells did not live forever.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.560
They turned over.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:38.280
They died.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:39.870
And they were
replaced by new cells.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.760
And this turnover assay
implied that there

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.490
was some kind of replacement.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.250
And the cells doing
the replacement

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.510
were called stem cells.

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:09.965
You find this by a pulse/chase
assay, which we'll go over

00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:13.150
on your handout in a moment.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.670
And what was found was really
variable for different organs.

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:26.990
Firstly, all organs,
about, show cell turn over.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:37.095
Red blood cells have a half
life of about 120 days.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.080
There are a lot of red
blood cells in your body.

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:51.600
And in fact, that implies
that there are about 10

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.560
to the seventh new red
blood cells made a day.

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.280
In your intestine,
the half life of cells

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:05.660
is three to five days,
in the small intestine.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:20.195
And the hair on your head has a
half life of about four years.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.220
So it's variable for
different kinds of cells.

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.590
If you look at
your first handout,

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:34.050
it diagrams a
pulse/chase assay where

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:41.470
a cell population is labeled
with a nucleotide analog.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:45.880
It's a normal nucleotide, but
it's got a bromine added to it.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.340
And it acts like deoxythymidine,
gets incorporated into DNA,

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:56.170
and you give just a short pulse
of this nucleotide analog.

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.810
So only some of the
cells get labeled.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:01.480
And you only give
it for a short time.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.210
So you get a labeled
cell population.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.370
And then you stop the
labeling by adding

00:20:06.370 --> 00:20:10.840
lots of unlabeled thymidine,
and that's called a chase.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.680
And you follow the cells
over this long chase period.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.860
And then you can watch and see
what happens to those cells

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.680
that you initially labeled
over a very short time.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.720
And so in this example, I've got
four cells initially labeled.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.520
Over time, they're
only two cells left.

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.380
And if you measure the time
from going from four cells

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:35.830
to two cells, you can get to
the half life of that cell

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.180
population.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:37.680
OK?

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:42.720
You can also-- if you don't
have a handout for this,

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.230
just look on the screen--

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:46.800
you can also follow the
labeled cell population

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.810
and see what those cells become.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:51.000
And you can see that they
go on to differentiate

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.900
as particular cell types.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.720
So this is a kind
of way of labeling

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.640
the lineage of these cells.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.900
And that is useful, too.

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:05.820
This was the theory behind
stem cell definition.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:07.830
But what is a stem
cell look like,

00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:09.390
and how do you isolate one?

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.190
It turns out that
that's really difficult.

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:26.930
So isolation and
assay in the adult

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.070
stem cells are very, very rare.

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.970
And that is one of
the issues with using

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.460
stem cells for therapy.

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:42.970
There are very few of them
and they're hard to isolate.

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:49.570
Hematopoietic stem
cells comprise

00:21:49.570 --> 00:21:55.820
about 0.01% of the
bone marrow, which

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:59.150
is where the stem
cells reside, and where

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:03.050
the precursors of your whole
blood and immune system reside.

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.610
The way that this
was dealt with was

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:12.430
through a really
clever technique

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.160
that has the acronym of FACS.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.610
I'll give you a
slide in a moment.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:20.230
It stands for Fluorescence
Activated Cell Sorting.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:21.850
We'll go to a slide
in a moment so we

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:23.960
don't have to spell it out.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:29.950
And the idea behind FACS is
that you label stem cells.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.110
And you might be guessing
what to label them with.

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:42.050
But you label them usually via
their cell surface proteins

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:47.290
with some kind of tag,
often an antibody tag.

00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:55.010
And then you can use that tag
to make them different colors.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.950
And you can then sort
them, cell by cell,

00:22:57.950 --> 00:23:01.690
through the Special Fluorescence
Activated Cell Sorter.

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:09.560
Sort individual
cells, and then you

00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:14.870
can assay individual cells
or small groups of them

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.210
for stem cell properties.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.970
Let's look at a slide of how
the FACS, the Fluorescence

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.500
Activated Cell Sorter works.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:26.460
No, let's not.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.200
I've really gotten
ahead of myself here.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:34.040
And I'm going to go back
because I want to show you this.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.900
Hold on to that
thought and let's

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.880
go back to this notion
of a pulse/chase assay.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.130
I forgot that I had this here.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.830
This is really important.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:47.870
This is a pulse/chase
assay of intestinal cells.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:54.770
And so your small intestine
lies inside your belly.

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.080
And if you look
at its anatomy, it

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.450
contains many
tubes whose surface

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.980
is thrown into folds
to increase the surface

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.170
area for food absorption.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.810
And if you look at these folds,
they are very closely packed.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.720
So you get a huge
surface area increase.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.430
And the cells of
these folds that

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.340
are doing the food
absorption turn over

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.600
every three to five days.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.710
Those are the ones
I was talking about.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:25.100
So if you blow up one
of these folds, which

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.140
is called a villus,
there's the part

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.330
that's sticking up
into the cavity,

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.850
into the lumen of
the small intestine.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:33.830
And then there's this
part that kind of dips

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.380
down into the lining
of the intestine, which

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.120
is called a crypt.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.270
The stem cells lie somewhere
at the base of the crypt.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.750
It's not exactly clear where.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.660
But the idea is that somewhere
at the bottom of this crypt

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:51.410
there are these stem cells
that under specific conditions

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:53.450
will start to proliferate.

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.690
And they will move
up into the villus

00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:59.570
and replace the villus
cells that are dying.

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:03.540
You can monitor this by doing
a pulse/chase experiment.

00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:05.210
So here's the crypt.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:07.340
And they've given,
in this experiment,

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.160
a pulse of thymidine
has been given.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.110
And you're looking
kind of at time 0,

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:15.890
right after the pulse of
thymidine has been given.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.380
Here the cells, the black
cells are in the crypt.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:19.460
They're labeled.

00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.280
And then if you
look over time, you

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.540
can see that these black cells
move away from the crypt.

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.790
They're moving up
into the villus.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.580
And here they are actually
right on top of the villus,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.110
replacing the cells
that were turning over.

00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:35.960
So that's a really
beautiful demonstration

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.130
of a pulse/chase assay.

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:38.630
OK.

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:41.210
Now we can go to our
Fluorescence Activated Cell

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.710
Sorter.

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.321
The idea is that you
take a mix of cells--

00:25:47.321 --> 00:25:48.820
you don't have this
on your handout,

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.860
just look on the screen--
the cells are labeled

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.900
with fluorescent antibodies.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:55.570
And you put them into
a reservoir and droplet

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:56.920
generator.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.460
And the cells drop out of
this reservoir, one at a time.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.320
And as they drop out,
they go past a laser.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.410
And you can tune the laser to
whatever wavelengths you want.

00:26:08.410 --> 00:26:10.150
It excites the cells.

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:13.060
And if the cells emit in
the particular wavelength

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:16.720
you're interested in, the
detector will detect that.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.880
And then it actually
gives a charge to the cell

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.340
that it is the
correct fluorescence.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.800
And as the cells
are dropping down,

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.350
the cells of the correct
color are deflected

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.060
by an electric charge.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.430
And different color
cells can be collected

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:32.500
into different flasks.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:33.100
OK?

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.280
This really works.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.040
It's a fantastic machine.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.620
You can collect cells
about, you know,

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:40.720
you can collect millions
of cells an hour.

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.920
It's pretty quick.

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.140
But you do it one
cell at a time.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.750
And in that way, you
can isolate cells, which

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.010
have got stem cell properties.

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.510
OK.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:54.247
So you've used
your FACS machine.

00:26:54.247 --> 00:26:56.080
You've got cells that
look as though they've

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:58.610
got stem cell properties.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:10.760
And now, let's look at the
assays that may be used.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.730
And there are three assays
that you should know.

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:18.640
One is a repopulation assay
to test stem cellness.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:29.980
And this is a transplant assay
where you're transplanting test

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:39.960
cells, test stem
cells, into the adult.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:46.320
And you have removed from the
adult, endogenous cells that

00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:48.675
might be competing
with those stem cells.

00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:58.290
That would include
the stem cells.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:27:59.880
We'll go through a
slide in a moment.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:01.380
I'm going to list them here.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:09.160
Another one is an
in-vitro induction assay,

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:13.860
where you are going
to take isolated cells

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.620
and you're going to treat
them with various inducers,

00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.680
various signaling
molecules, and you're

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.760
going to test and see what
fates those cells can acquire.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:31.070
And a third assay is called
an embryo incorporation assay,

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:35.100
where you are going to take
cells that may be stem cells,

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:40.200
and you're going to test
them in a chimeric embryo.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:46.560
Let's go through
your next slides

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.760
to discuss each of these points.

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:54.690
Bone marrow transplants resulted
in a Nobel Prize in 1990

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:56.760
for E. Donnall Thomas
and Joseph Murray.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.790
It's a technique that
saved millions of lives,

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.250
and here how it
works in a mouse.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.160
You take the mouse and
you irradiate the mouse

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.490
to destroy the bone marrow
and the stem cells associated

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.480
with the bone marrow.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:14.350
If it's a person, to destroy
the diseased burned bone marrow.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:18.600
And then you replace that bone
marrow with normal bone marrow

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.660
to either try to make the
person better, or in this case,

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:24.210
to test something
about stem cells.

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.480
The irradiated mouse
or person would die,

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.660
but the normal bone marrow
will cause the mouse to live.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.440
And if you've put stem
cells into that mouse,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:38.000
you can start getting them out
of that mouse whose life you

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.890
have saved, and isolate
more stem cells.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.010
Those kinds of assays
led to the definition

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.470
of the hematopoietic stem cell.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.250
Here it is.

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:52.400
It's a pluripotent stem
cell that gives rise

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.390
to all of these different kinds
of cells, the immune cells,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.740
and all of the blood cells.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.560
It's a very, very
powerful stem cell.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.340
And the ability to actually make
this diagram and say that there

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:08.510
was a single cell that gave rise
to all these different lineages

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:12.350
was because of a titration
assay where you could take these

00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:16.370
putative hematopoietic stem
cells that were difficult

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:20.120
to isolate-- and still haven't
been isolated in their purity--

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.500
but you can titrate them down.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:25.790
And you can introduce what you
think is one stem cell, 10 stem

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:30.350
cells, 100 stem cells, and so
on, into an irradiated mouse,

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:32.270
and ask how many
stem cells does it

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:36.686
take to repopulate the entire
blood system and immune system.

00:30:36.686 --> 00:30:38.060
And it turns out,
you have to mix

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:41.450
these cells with carrier cells,
otherwise it doesn't work.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.750
But it turns out that
one cell can repopulate

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:48.380
the entire hematopoietic system,
which is really extraordinary,

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.730
and led to the diagram that I
showed you in the slide before.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:54.750
OK.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:55.920
Here's another assay.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.500
This is an in-vitro
induction assay.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.810
And the idea here is
that you start off

00:31:00.810 --> 00:31:04.230
with something, which you
think might be stem cells,

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.330
by various criteria.

00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.970
And then to test what
these cells can do,

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.990
you put them into plastic
tissue culture dishes,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.000
and you add some
nutrients and so on

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.190
to allow the cells to divide.

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.350
And then you add some inducers.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.300
And you remember a
couple of lectures back,

00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:25.170
inducers are just ligands for
various signaling systems.

00:31:25.170 --> 00:31:27.840
You might add fibroblast
growth factor to this one,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.390
and retinoic acid to
that one, and then you

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.700
ask what happens to the cells.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.160
They will go on, in
general, to differentiate

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.780
into different cell types.

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:39.630
And depending on what
they differentiate into,

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:43.570
you can say something about the
potency of these putative stem

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:44.070
cells.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.260
You can't test if they're
really stem cells,

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:50.338
but you can say something
about their potency.

00:31:50.338 --> 00:31:55.560
You can do a similar experiment,
but in a whole mouse.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.380
The mouse is made
from, the embryo

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.670
is made from a part of the
very early embryo called

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.350
the inner cell mass.

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:08.040
And you can inject labeled,
putative stem cells

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.700
into an early mouse embryo,
into this inner cell mass

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:18.840
part of the embryo, put it into
a mother, a recipient mother,

00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.420
and then ask what comes
out, what kind of embryo

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.800
comes out of that process.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.310
And if you see that
the baby that comes out

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:32.070
of this chimeric embryo has got
a green liver and green ears

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.430
and green whiskers, you'll
know that these cells that you

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.650
put into the chimeric
embryo, that you made

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:40.170
the chimeric embryo
with, had the capacity

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:43.570
to give liver,
ears, and whiskers.

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:44.070
OK?

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.770
So this is a powerful
assay to, again,

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:49.740
look at the potency of
cells, not, in this case,

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:51.600
the stem cellness of cells.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:01.050
One of the things
about stem cells

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.150
is that you only
want them to work

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:04.860
when you want them to work.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.920
If you cut yourself,
in the normal process

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.230
of keeping your
liver the right size,

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:13.590
in the normal process of keeping
your heart muscle correct,

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:16.740
you want your stem cells
to be working and keeping

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.820
everything homeostatic.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.130
You don't want them to be
dividing out of control,

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.140
because then you'll get cancer.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.960
And so something has to
control what stem cells do

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.300
and when they do it.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:35.340
And this is a
question of regulation

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:42.090
and the notion of
a stem cell niche.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:51.570
Stem cells are kept
quiescent, usually in G0

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:55.170
that we talked about in
the cell cycle lecture.

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.530
And they're kept quiescent by
signals from the surrounding

00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.070
cells.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:07.150
So their cell-cell
interaction, and by signals

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:10.719
from the surrounding cells.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:15.130
And those are given a special
name by stem cell biologists.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:19.449
They're not that special, but
they're given a special name.

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.640
They're called niche
cells, or the niche.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.139
OK?

00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:25.555
They're just surrounding cells
that are secreting signals.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.530
On some kind of activation--

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:37.170
you cut yourself, your organ
normally needs repair--

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.560
things change.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:46.409
So on activation, by some
kind of environmental input--

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:50.850
local or less local--

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:55.755
niche cells induce the
stem cells to divide.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.580
And they do this--

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.100
and they induce the
stem cells to divide

00:35:08.100 --> 00:35:14.160
into a stem cell plus a
progenitor, which then goes on

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.370
to do all the things that I
diagrammed that progenitors do,

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.630
on the first board.

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:22.150
And the niche cells
do this because they

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:23.700
have changed their signaling.

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:37.810
This is yet another use,
or a very related use,

00:35:37.810 --> 00:35:41.830
of the notion of cell-cell
signaling in controlling life.

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.500
Here's a diagram.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.447
Here are niche cells.

00:35:44.447 --> 00:35:45.280
You don't have this.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:46.810
Just look on the screen.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:51.430
Surrounding cells,
maintaining stem cells quiet.

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:56.080
When there's an environmental
input, the niche cells change.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:59.530
They activate the stem cells
to divide and form more stem

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.650
cells and progenitor cells.

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:07.440
One really fantastic
example of the niche,

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:10.080
and the interaction between
stem cells and the niche,

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.730
is in the hair.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.770
This is from my colleague
Elaine Fuchs at Rockefeller,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.720
who over many years has figured
out that in the hair follicle--

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:22.290
this is the hair sticking
out of the skin--

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.450
in the hair, there's
a small group

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.500
of cells on one side of the hair
shaft called the bulge cells,

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:32.820
and these bulge cells
are the stem cells.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.130
Her investigators
isolated these bulge cells

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:38.110
and did the following
experiment to show

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:40.720
that they were hair stem cells.

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.810
There's a kind of a mouse
called a nude mouse that

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.690
has a very bad immune system.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:48.190
So it's useful for immune
system experiments.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:50.470
But it also has no hair.

00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:53.330
And you can do a
transplant into this mouse

00:36:53.330 --> 00:36:55.570
of these bulge cells.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:58.060
And you get little tufts
of hair growing where

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.890
the rest of the mouse is nude.

00:36:59.890 --> 00:37:01.840
And you've done a
careful experiment

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.080
where you've labeled the cells
you have transplanted in so

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:07.240
that you can show
that they actually

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.940
came from the transplanted
tissue and not

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.100
from the mouse, the
nude mouse tissue.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.470
And you can do that because
you labeled them with GFP

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:15.400
and they're green.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.050
So this the green hair.

00:37:17.050 --> 00:37:21.520
And it shows you that these
bulge cells are stem cells.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.070
During the life of a hair--

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:27.160
your hair has a life,
we discussed four years

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:28.450
on your head--

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:34.230
during the life of a hair, the
bulge cells and the niche cells

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:36.010
are in different places.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.250
And depending on whether they're
touching or far apart from one

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.600
another, there's induction
of hair growth or not.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.170
So at a particular stage
of the hair cycle--

00:37:46.170 --> 00:37:48.460
this is called the hair
cycle, look on the bottom

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:49.810
of the screen here--

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.300
the bulge cells and
a group of cells

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.030
called the dermal
papilla that lies right

00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:58.900
at the bottom of the hair
shaft are touching one another.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.570
And at that point, a
particular signaling pathway

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.390
called the Wnt
pathway is activated.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.170
And these dermal papilla
cells tell the bulge cells

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:12.430
to start dividing and start
making a new hair shaft.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:15.400
After that's happened,
the bulge cells

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.310
move away from the
dermal papilla cells.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.190
Here they are during
growth, the growth period.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.710
You see the bulge and
the dermal papilla cells

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.360
are no longer touching.

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:28.660
At this point, the stem
cells become quiescent.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:31.870
And there are enough progenitor
cells in the hair shaft

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:34.120
to give you formation
of the hair.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.780
And then the stem cells remain
quiescent until the next hair

00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:41.200
cycle starts and they get in
contact with the dermal papilla

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.630
again and start making new hair.

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:45.880
This is a really
beautiful story that's

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:48.760
shown us quite clearly
how the niche cells can

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.720
control these stem cells.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.860
All right.

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:56.370
So let's spend the last minutes
talking about therapeutics.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.960
Here's the dream.

00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.930
You know, the dream is
that you have a stem cell

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:19.820
population for every
organ in the body,

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.290
including things
like limbs, such

00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:26.350
that if your limb gets
severed or your heart

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.550
becomes really diseased or
your spinal cord is injured

00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.760
and you can't walk anymore,
that you can just inject

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:37.510
into a patient the correct
stem cells and everything

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:38.920
gets repaired.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.940
That's the dream.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.750
And that's really the
holy grail of what

00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:47.500
thousands and thousands of
investigators are going after.

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.950
And it's given precedence by
bone marrow transplants, which

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:53.050
really are very successful.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:55.870
Turns out that
it's kind of tough.

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:59.850
It's tough because these adult
stem cells are really rare.

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:02.680
The hematopoietic stem cells
are special because they're

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.580
kind of liquid.

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:04.560
They're single cells.

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.280
They're not attached
to anything.

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.260
And they are relatively
easy to identify.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.840
But other stem cells
are very difficult.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:20.110
So the idea is that you inject
stem cells to repair a damaged

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:20.610
organ.

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.750
You need stem cells of
the correct potency,

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:38.560
otherwise you're not going
to repair the specific organ.

00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:47.950
But adult stem
cells are very rare.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:55.240
And so the quest has been to
find some kind of substitute

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:56.485
for adult stem cells.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:07.620
And those substitutes
come in two flavors.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:17.650
One are embryonic stem
cells, abbreviated, ESCs.

00:41:17.650 --> 00:41:20.380
Embryonic stem
cells are cells that

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:25.900
grow from the inner cell mass
of an early mammalian embryo.

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:28.450
And you can grow
from them groups

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:31.030
of cells that will keep
growing in the laboratory

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:34.610
for a long time and
have variable potency.

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:39.340
So the embryonic stem
cells are derived

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:44.700
from the inner cell mass of
an early mammalian embryo--

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.750
human in the case of human.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:08.030
And you grow out
so-called ESC lines,

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:14.825
which means that these cells
grow continuously in culture.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:31.620
And each embryonic stem cell
line has a unique potency

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:35.520
and can be used to do
different things, in terms

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.530
of theoretical repair.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:39.210
If you look on
your next handout,

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:43.320
the idea is that you take
this inner cell mass,

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.960
you plate the cells
as single cells,

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:50.690
they grow and grow and grow.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.920
And if you treat them
with various inducers,

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:58.210
you can get them to become
heart or neuron progenitors,

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:01.850
inject those into animals
and make them better.

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:05.860
There are some issues
with embryonic stem cells.

00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:08.890
And the problems are twofold.

00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:22.470
One is ethical in that you
have to harvest human embryos.

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.740
You have to obtain and
harvest human embryos

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.660
to get these human
stem cell lines.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.960
And currently, you're
really not allowed

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:46.390
to do much human embryo work
to obtain human stem cells.

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.240
But the second,
even if you were,

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.860
is that these cells
are non-autologous.

00:43:53.860 --> 00:44:01.960
They do not match the person
into which you're putting them.

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:05.290
They do not match the immune
system of the recipient.

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:07.180
And so they'll be rejected.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.100
And it's the same as
an organ transplant.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.230
You have lots of
problems of rejection.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:17.860
So the latest thing that is
very exciting and wonderful

00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:25.510
and potentially might be very
useful, is the use of things

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:38.630
called IPS cells, in which
you convert adult cells

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.390
into stem cells.

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:45.440
And you do so, as I'll tell you,
by adding some transcription

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:47.030
factors to them.

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.650
The advantage of these is
that they are self cells.

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.600
You could do them from yourself.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:57.770
The disadvantage is that
they're really not proven.

00:44:57.770 --> 00:45:02.810
And there is still, I will
just say, lots of problems.

00:45:06.730 --> 00:45:09.080
But there are a lot
of people, including

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.780
some of the top
investigators in the world,

00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.540
working on these IPS cells.

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.340
So look at your last handout.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:22.660
We will remove our interesting
calendar reminders there.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.620
Adult differentiated
cells, which are unipotent,

00:45:26.620 --> 00:45:31.390
can be treated with three or
four transcription factors.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.780
And finding these transcription
factors is the key.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.690
And once you express these
transcription factors

00:45:37.690 --> 00:45:42.730
in these adult cells, like
magic, they become stem cells.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.920
It really was like magic.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:48.830
You can test the potency
of these stem cells

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.810
in the same way we discussed.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.850
And Professor Yamanaka in
Japan and Professor Jaenisch

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.560
here have shown that these are
really very powerful cells.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.650
And those are the
promise of the future.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.920
And we'll stop there
and meet on Friday.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.410
PROFESSOR: So, welcome
to systems biology.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580
There are many different numbers
that you might have signed up

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.870
for this class through.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.130
My name is Jeff Gore.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.070
I'm an assistant professor
in the physics department.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.707
And I think that
this is really--

00:00:38.707 --> 00:00:39.790
it's a fun class to teach.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.269
I hope that those of
you that stick around

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.560
for the rest of the semester
find that it's a fun class

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.186
to take as well.

00:00:46.186 --> 00:00:48.310
I just want to give a little
bit of an introduction

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.770
of the teaching
staff, and then we'll

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.490
go over some
administrative details

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.120
before-- most of
today, what we'll do

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.110
is we'll basically
just spend an hour.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.160
I'll give you a flash
summary of the course,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.420
and then you'll have a
sense of the kinds of ideas

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.000
we'll be exploring.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.010
So, what is this
thing, systems biology?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.230
So it's, I would
say, ill-defined.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.030
But in general, we have this
idea that, in many cases,

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.595
the really exciting functions
that we see in biology

00:01:17.595 --> 00:01:19.890
are arising from
the interactions,

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.100
at a lower level, of
relatively simple components.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.160
So, the kinds of behavior
that we'd like to understand

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.931
are nicely encapsulated in this
video of a neutrophil chasing

00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:31.430
a bacterium.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.630
And if I can-- if my computer
is actually doing something,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.320
then-- there's something.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.980
So, this is a classic
video that many of you

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.110
guys might have
seen over the years.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.580
So, this was taken in the 1950s.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.080
It's, as I said, a
neutrophil, which

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.760
is part of your
innate immune system.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.530
So, sort of the first
line of defense.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.110
When you get a bacterial
infection, for example,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.920
this white blood cell is
going to chase the bacterium

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.280
and eat it up before it
can divide and harm you.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.310
So, I'm going to
play that over again,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.790
because it's pretty cool.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.270
So, the features that you
want to try to pay attention

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.330
to-- so, this is
a single cell that

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.285
somehow is able to track
this bacterial invader.

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:28.610
It's using chemical
cues in order

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.500
to figure out where it is
that bacterial cell is going.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.470
It's able to disregard
these red blood cells that

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.990
are in its way, push them
aside, change direction,

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.560
before it eventually
captures this bacterial cell.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.930
So, all of these are striking,
amazing information-processing

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.350
capabilities, where
that information has

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.720
to be coupled not only to
some sort of decision-making

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.450
within that cell,
but also, it has

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.330
to be transduced into
these mechanical forces

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.320
and motions that allow that cell
to capture the bacterial cell.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.210
So, let's try it again.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.120
So, here it is.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080
You can see the
bacterial cell is here.

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.710
So, it's ignoring
this other cell,

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.150
keeping focus on this one,
pushing aside the red blood

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.910
cells, so it can
follow it along.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.650
Every now and then-- now
the cell changed direction.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.310
But eventually, you
can see it catches up

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.590
to the bacterial
cell and eats it.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.820
Now you're not going to get
sick from that infection.

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.782
So, that's an example of the
kinds of remarkable behavior

00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:34.390
that can be implemented
even just by a single cell.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.830
So, we know that, as humans,
we have brains with 10

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.444
to the 12 neurons or so.

00:03:40.444 --> 00:03:42.110
So, maybe you'd say,
it's not surprising

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:43.520
that we can do fancy things.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.600
What's remarkable is
that even at the level

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.870
of an individual cell,
it's possible to implement

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.930
rather sophisticated information
processing capabilities.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.640
So, this is the kind
of thing that we'd

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.560
like to be able to say something
about by the end of the class.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.289
Many of you, I think, probably
read the course description,

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:04.330
and this gives you a sense
of the kinds of topics

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.030
that we're going to be
covering over the course

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.696
of the semester.

00:04:06.696 --> 00:04:08.170
I'm not going to read it to you.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.810
But one thing I
want to stress is

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.350
I brought up this general
idea of systems biology.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.399
How is it that function
arises from interactions

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:18.860
of smaller, simpler parts?

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.000
I think it's very important,
right at the beginning,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.480
to be clear that
there are really,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.510
I'd say, two
distinct communities

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.030
that self-identify as
studying systems biology.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.390
And they're-- to simplify it a
bit, what I would say is that,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.070
basically, there's the physics,
or physics-inspired community,

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.390
where-- and I'm in the
physics department,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.700
so that's where I fall, and
where this class is going

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.450
to be.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.230
So, it's really trying
to use some simple models

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.770
from nonlinear dynamics
or stochastic processes

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.990
combined with
quantitative experiments,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.180
often on single
cells, in order to try

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.070
to illuminate how this cellular
decision-making process works.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.720
And on over the
next hour, you'll

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.634
see-- get a flavor of
what I mean by this.

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:05.550
Now, there's another
branch of systems biology

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.129
that is also very exciting,
and that many of you

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:10.920
may want to learn more
about in the future.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.862
And maybe some of
even were thinking

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.820
that this was what the
class is going to be in.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.174
But let me explain what is.

00:05:16.174 --> 00:05:18.090
This other branch, I'd
say, is more influenced

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.387
by computer scientists
and engineers,

00:05:20.387 --> 00:05:21.970
where what they're
really trying to do

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.900
is use complex models,
machine learning techniques,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.660
and so forth, in order to
extract signal from large data

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.460
sets.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.660
And this is also,
again, systems biology

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.250
because it is
trying to understand

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.440
how the global
properties of the cell

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.060
result from all
these interactions,

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.085
but it's a rather different
aesthetic take on the subject.

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:44.720
And, indeed, much
of the activity,

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.827
that one would be doing here is
different from the more physics

00:05:48.827 --> 00:05:49.910
branch of systems biology.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:55.990
So, if what you were looking
for was more of this large data

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.790
set, high throughput,
branch of systems biology,

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:04.407
then you may not be
at the right place.

00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:05.990
And there's an
interesting fact, which

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.831
is that if you
decide that you want

00:06:07.831 --> 00:06:09.830
this other branch of
systems biology, then, very

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:12.660
conveniently, you actually
have space in your schedule,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.820
because Manolis
Kellis is teaching

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.770
a class in computational
biology-- really,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.790
this other branch of systems
biology-- at the same time.

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.260
So, if you think you're
at the wrong place,

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.800
you're welcome to
just sneak out now.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.600
Go to over 32-141, and I'm
sure that he will welcome you,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.290
and no hard feelings.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.840
Similarly, in the
spring, there's

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.774
another computational biology
class that some of you

00:06:40.774 --> 00:06:41.690
may be thinking about.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.607
And this is taught by
Chris Burge and company,

00:06:44.607 --> 00:06:46.690
and also, I'd say, maybe
more of this other branch

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.280
of systems biology.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.620
And, finally, once again, in
the spring there's a class,

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.940
quantitative biology
for graduate students,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.220
that I'd say probably
assumes somewhat less

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.570
mathematical background.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.572
So, if after looking at the
syllabus, or maybe even getting

00:07:00.572 --> 00:07:02.280
started looking at
the first problem set,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.176
if you think that maybe this
class is expecting too much,

00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:07.550
then you may want to consider
taking quantitative biology

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.591
in the spring, and maybe
taking systems biology--

00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:12.480
this class-- next fall.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.210
So, on that note, I
want to say something

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.780
about the prerequisites.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.570
The major challenge
with this class--

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:20.810
certainly, teaching
it, from my standpoint,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.226
and I think for
many of you taking

00:07:22.226 --> 00:07:25.110
it-- is that there's a wide
range of different backgrounds.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:28.000
So, we can maybe get
a sense of that now.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.490
Just a show of hands, how many
of you are undergraduates?

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.110
So, we've got a
solid third or so.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.517
How many are-- mixing together
undergraduate and graduate--

00:07:40.517 --> 00:07:42.850
but how many of you are in
the physics department at one

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.350
level or another?

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.630
So, we have maybe,
again, a third.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.300
Biology department?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.850
So, we have a quarter, a fifth.

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:55.310
Engineers?

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.330
So, a substantial
fraction of engineers.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:00.570
And chemists?

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:01.570
We've got a few of them.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.590
Mathematicians?

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.830
All right, we've got one.

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:11.267
So, if you did not raise
your hand, where you based,

00:08:11.267 --> 00:08:12.850
physically,
intellectually, something?

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.580
Did we get everybody?

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:18.270
OK.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:20.311
So, you can see that
there's a really broad range

00:08:20.311 --> 00:08:21.390
of different backgrounds.

00:08:21.390 --> 00:08:23.820
And what that means in
a concrete way for us

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.690
is that I will very
much try to avoid

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:30.380
using unnecessary jargon
or unnecessary mathematics.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.110
I think that mathematics
is a wonderful thing,

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.710
but in some cases
it, I think, obscures

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.210
as much as it illuminates.

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.510
So, for me, I very
much try to focus

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.470
on conceptual understanding.

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:46.060
And on top of that, I try to
build-- you like math, too.

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.920
But I think that
it's very important

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.580
to be able to, for example,
plot your solution.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.140
So, after you derive some fancy
equation describing something,

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.870
you should know
whether that thing

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.120
goes up or down as a function
of something or another.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.070
And I think it's
very easy to lose

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.050
sight of these
basic aspects when

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:08.550
we get too deep into the
mathematical equations.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.460
But, that being said, we do,
I'd say, expect something--

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.450
not necessarily
full-- you don't have

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:16.700
to have taken the full class,
701 or 702, but at least

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.730
a solid high school
class of biology.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.530
If it's been more than 10 years
since you took a biology class,

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.550
you might want to take
one before coming here.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:29.530
You could, in principle,
catch up, like all things.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.600
We also assume some comfort
with differential equations

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:33.960
and probability.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.930
So, we've actually added
those as prerequisites,

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.530
particularly from the
standpoint of an undergraduate

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.660
to give you a sense of
the sort of material

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.800
that we expect you to
be comfortable with.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:48.510
So, we will not be defining
probably distributions so much.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.930
We will assume that you can
calculate means and standard

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:56.080
deviations of discrete,
continuous distributions,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.889
and so forth.

00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:59.930
And the other thing that
is going to be important

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.160
is that a major
goal of the class

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.610
is to increase
your comfort level

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.282
with using computational
techniques to analyze

00:10:07.282 --> 00:10:08.240
some of these problems.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.323
So, every week, we're going
to have a problem set.

00:10:10.323 --> 00:10:13.100
And on every problem set, there
will be at least one problem

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.260
where you have to use some
computational package in order

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.400
to calculate something.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.900
So, are you going
to do a simulation

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.394
to understand the stochastic
dynamics of this or that?

00:10:21.394 --> 00:10:23.560
Or maybe you're going to
integrate some differential

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.670
equations.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.769
And in this case, you can use
whatever package you like.

00:10:28.769 --> 00:10:30.560
So if you are a MATLAB
person, that's fine.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:31.950
Mathematica is fine.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.009
The officially
supported language

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:36.550
is going to be
Python, because that's

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.220
what Sarab-- if he's going to
be spending hours helping you

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.080
with your code, he
wants it to be something

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.140
that he's comfortable with.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.640
So, that's going
to be what we might

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:48.280
call the official language, in
the sense that he will perhaps

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.200
provide some sample code and
so forth to get you started.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.490
But you're welcome to use
anything that you want.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.910
And that being said, we
will have a Python tutorial

00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:59.170
almost certainly on Monday.

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.600
We're waiting to
get-- to find out what

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.808
the classroom is going to be.

00:11:01.808 --> 00:11:07.577
But we will send out a notice
to the class about that,

00:11:07.577 --> 00:11:10.160
as well as instructions on how
to get Python on your computer.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.890
Are there any questions
about where we are so far?

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:17.150
What we've said?

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:18.806
Expectations, prerequisites?

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:26.300
All right.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:27.510
So, grading.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:30.090
One of the things that we have
to do is we have to grade.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:34.340
I'd say that our goal is very
much to help you learn material

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.760
that we're excited about.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.900
So, I am not in any way trying
to grade in any mean way.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.696
And what that means
is that-- we also just

00:11:43.696 --> 00:11:45.320
don't want you guys
to feel like you're

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.528
competing against each other.

00:11:46.528 --> 00:11:48.440
So, what that
means is that-- so,

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.190
these are the grade cutoffs.

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:53.250
So, they will not-- numbers
will not go up from here.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.290
If I screw up and I make
some really hard exam,

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:58.430
then I reserve the right
to lower these numbers.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.720
But basically, this
is what's worked

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.000
for the last several years.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.410
So, you should feel comfortable
collaborating with your friends

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:10.420
to study, to try to
figure out the material,

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.003
because your grade
is just going to be

00:12:12.003 --> 00:12:15.340
determined by where things end
up on this chart, basically.

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.650
And the course grade is going
to be split, as you can see.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:22.320
There's a fair component
on problem sets,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.121
and that's because
the problem sets are--

00:12:24.121 --> 00:12:25.370
they're going to be hard work.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:27.080
We're going to have
problem sets every week,

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.090
and you can expect to spend
a significant amount of time

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.900
on them.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.694
And the thing that
you learn in doing

00:12:32.694 --> 00:12:34.360
these computational
problems is somewhat

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.150
different from what
you learn and what

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:37.800
you demonstrate on an exam.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.649
So, that's why it's not
all just an exam grade.

00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:44.190
I'm going to say something more
about these pre-class reading

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:44.690
questions.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.350
There are going to be
two midterms and an exam.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:51.782
The dates are on your syllabus,
so please mark these evenings

00:12:51.782 --> 00:12:52.490
on your calendar.

00:12:56.525 --> 00:12:57.400
So, the problem sets.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.399
You can read about this.

00:12:58.399 --> 00:13:02.320
But basically, every
Friday at 7 o'clock,

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.980
they're going to be due.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.610
A box out between the
third floor of building six

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.310
and the fourth floor
of building 16,

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:13.980
I suppose-- these are the
physics homework boxes.

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:16.250
So, the idea is we'd like
you to have a weekend

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.490
to catch up and start
reading for the next week.

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.570
So, that's why they're dude
just before dinner on Friday.

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:24.190
That being said, we understand
that sometimes there

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.880
are a lot of problem sets, or
sometimes you're overwhelmed

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.280
with something else.

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:27.966
So, that's fine.

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:29.340
You can turn it
in for 80% credit

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.131
till Monday morning at
10:00 AM, when we're

00:13:31.131 --> 00:13:32.840
going to post the solutions.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.950
So, we won't be accepting
problem sets after that,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.740
unless you get agreement
from Sarab in advance.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:44.790
So, the pre-class
reading questions.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.115
I'd say this is a key
part of the class.

00:13:47.115 --> 00:13:48.990
It's only 5% of
the grade, and it's

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.110
graded really only
on participation--

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:52.350
that you've done it.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.790
But this is an essential
element of what we like

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:57.245
to call a flipped classroom.

00:13:57.245 --> 00:13:58.870
So, today's class is
going to be rather

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.090
different from the rest of the
semester in that today is more

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.540
like a lecture, I would say.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.030
Whereas the rest
of the semester,

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:10.820
there will not be any PowerPoint
slides and it'll be very much,

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.880
I hope, very interactive.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.312
In order to
facilitate that, there

00:14:14.312 --> 00:14:15.770
are a number of
different elements.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:19.340
One is that we do require
reading before class.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.020
And the way that we encourage
you to do the reading

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:26.510
is that we ask you to answer
questions the night before.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.160
So, what you're going
to do is you'll,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.730
by 10:00 PM, the night before,
just three questions-- just

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.230
a couple of sentences
each question.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.530
It's not that you're supposed
to have to do a lot of work.

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:37.970
It's just that if
you did the reading,

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:39.440
you should be able to
give your take on it,

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.000
and you think about
it a little bit.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.250
And then Andrew will go
over the submitted answers,

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.590
and we'll send out his favorite
answers among the group.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.300
So, your answer
will occasionally

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:55.680
be represented there, if you
say something that's reasonable.

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.539
Now, it's really important
to have done this reading

00:14:58.539 --> 00:15:00.330
and thought about the
material some before,

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:02.440
because the idea is that,
in class, we'd really

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:05.571
like to engage in what you
might call some higher level

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:06.070
learning.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.160
So, it's not just this idea
that-- the traditional lecture

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.960
arose when books
were very expensive.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.080
So, if you're at a university
in the 13th century,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.210
you don't have a textbook.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:21.180
So, what you need is for me to
stand up front and read to you.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.570
And that's fine, except that
it's better for you to read it.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:27.590
And you can read it outside of
class, think about it a bit.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.381
And then that means
when you come to class,

00:15:29.381 --> 00:15:31.505
we can actually discuss it.

00:15:31.505 --> 00:15:33.520
In particular, I'll
give you my take

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.680
on the material, the
research that I'm

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.090
excited about in the area
that's been published recently.

00:15:40.090 --> 00:15:44.030
And we will also try to get
you involved via these concept

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.530
questions.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:48.930
So, in future sessions we'll
have these flash cards,

00:15:48.930 --> 00:15:51.480
or these colored
cards, so we can

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.930
ask these conceptual questions.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.640
A, B, C, D-- if you drop an
apple, does it go up, down,

00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.550
left, right?

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:01.380
And then, you guys get to vote.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:05.535
And then, after the vote, we
will often have you pair up.

00:16:05.535 --> 00:16:06.910
And the goal there
is that you're

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.980
trying to convince your
neighbor that you're right.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:12.500
And after that, you might
expand it to fours or so.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.530
But the idea there is that
it's very important for you

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.740
to try to confront the
material, make your best guess,

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.240
and then discuss
it with a neighbor.

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.015
And I think that
this is actually

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.936
one of the fun
aspects of the course.

00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:27.990
At least, I think so.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.490
And I'll say also that
this basic technique

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.550
is the result of-- there's
a whole field of education

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:36.370
research.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.290
And there are very,
very consistent

00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:41.100
and strong signals
in this, suggesting

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:44.240
that this sort of flipped
classroom, active learning

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:48.060
style, actually is
good for learning.

00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:50.312
So I'm not just doing this
because-- it is more fun,

00:16:50.312 --> 00:16:52.020
but that's not actually
why I'm doing it.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.330
I'm doing it because
the people who

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:56.427
have spent their lives
studying this topic

00:16:56.427 --> 00:16:58.260
have included this is
the best way to teach.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.060
Any questions about
the pre-class questions

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.190
or my notion of active learning?

00:17:12.444 --> 00:17:12.950
All right.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.510
You can mark your
calendars in advance.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.609
We do have a final.

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.184
It has not been scheduled yet.

00:17:22.184 --> 00:17:24.990
It'll be sometime the
week of December 15-19.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:28.780
So, for those of
you who are looking

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:34.472
online for plane tickets
back home, after December 19.

00:17:34.472 --> 00:17:36.430
Or, if you'd like, you
can wait a couple weeks,

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:37.971
and then the final
will be scheduled.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.250
We have two required
textbooks for the class.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.100
The first is An Introduction
to Systems Biology by Uri Alon.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.740
I think it's a wonderfully
clear, exciting introduction

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.420
to the topic.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.140
The flip side of being
wonderfully clear

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:57.270
is that it's a
little-- you could

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.180
complain that it's too simple.

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:02.490
And what that means is that we
will be supplementing the book

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.860
in a variety of ways,
both with separate notes,

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.980
and also by extensive
reading of papers

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.190
from the primary literature.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.590
The second half or
third of the class,

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:17.460
we'll be reading some chapters
from Evolutionary Dynamics,

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.990
a book by Martin Nowak.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:22.330
Again, a very nice, I think,
clear, exciting introduction

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:23.750
to that field.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.360
So, I think that
these are both books

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.490
that, if you're at all
interested in this area,

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.104
you should own anyways.

00:18:31.104 --> 00:18:32.520
There are two other
books that you

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.160
might want to recommend buying.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.340
So, first there's
Essential Cell Biology,

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:40.890
which is kind of like the
easy version of the cell, also

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.660
by Alberts.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.890
So, be careful of just
buying a book by Alberts.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.084
So, I'd say The Cell
is everything you ever

00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:49.750
wanted to know about
the cell-- and more

00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:50.880
than you want to
know about the cell--

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.880
whereas Essential
Cell Biology is really

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.610
just a wonderful book.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:59.540
We read this in my lab as
kind of a summer book reading

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:02.707
project, where each
week, we read a chapter,

00:19:02.707 --> 00:19:03.790
and we got get over lunch.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.597
And we just went
around the table,

00:19:05.597 --> 00:19:08.055
and we went through all the
questions in the book-- really.

00:19:08.055 --> 00:19:11.350
And we just alternated, and we
discussed, and it was-- really,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.150
it's wonderful.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.510
It focuses on the ideas.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:17.310
You have to memorize
a few things.

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:19.831
But every now and then, you
need to memorize something

00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:21.580
in order to keep track
of what's going on.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.970
But I would say that if you're
really interested in biology

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:29.159
in any serious way, then I would
recommend you buy this book.

00:19:29.159 --> 00:19:31.450
And then, finally, there's
this book Nonlinear Dynamics

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:33.770
and Chaos by Steven
Strogatz, which

00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:37.326
is a beautiful introduction
to denominator dynamics.

00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:41.310
If you have not seen the book,
I encourage you to check it out.

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:45.620
And in particular, some of the
topics on stability analysis,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.820
and oscillations, bifurcations,
and so forth-- this

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:50.570
is a really great way
to learn about them.

00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:57.550
I want to just give a
brief plug for-- there's

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.294
another class that some of
you, especially the first year

00:20:00.294 --> 00:20:01.710
students interested
in biophysics,

00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:02.790
might be interested in.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:08.260
This is 8.590J slash 20.416J
slash seven something.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.420
So it's a class targeted for
first year graduate students

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:13.520
interested in biophysics.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.950
Basically, each week,
we read a paper.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:17.500
We have a different
guest lecturer

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.500
come from across campus, either
physics, chemistry, biology,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.020
biological engineering, civil
or environmental engineering.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.300
So, a great way to meet
different faculty who

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.520
are working in the interface
of physics and biology

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.560
in one manifestation or another.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:32.333
The class-- it's going to be
this Friday from 3:00 to 5:00

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:32.466
PM.

00:20:32.466 --> 00:20:33.965
But then, in later
weeks, it's going

00:20:33.965 --> 00:20:36.925
to be 4:00 to 6:00 PM because
we-- because it conflicted

00:20:36.925 --> 00:20:37.550
with something.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.640
So, I'm going to tell
you-- I'm going to give you

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.380
the overview of the rest
of the semester in terms

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.460
of the science.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.440
But I just want to
first remind all of you

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:56.764
that, starting on Tuesday, it's
going to be the real class.

00:20:56.764 --> 00:20:58.430
What that means in
particular is that we

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:01.260
expect you to have
done some reading,

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:05.000
and we expect you
to have submitted

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.072
your pre-class reading questions
by Monday night at 10:00 PM.

00:21:10.072 --> 00:21:12.030
We used to have it at
midnight, but then Andrew

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:15.030
has to stay up really late
to go over all your responses

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:17.600
and send out them--
so, 10 o'clock.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:25.750
And then we'll get going
on simple interactions

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:29.100
between doing enzyme and
substrate, simple gene

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:30.510
expression ideas, and so forth.

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.070
So, I'd say that the
course has three parts.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:39.370
There's like-- the
first half is part one,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:45.000
and then part two is
the half to 3/4 mark,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.010
and then the last part is
maybe four or five lectures.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.700
And the structure
of this is really--

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.100
it is going from the
microscopic scale,

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.840
and then-- in terms of
just the basic ideas of,

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:01.130
what happens if molecule A
binds with molecule B. What

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.320
are the features that
we should be aware of?

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.810
So, pretty basic there.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.230
All the way up to
questions in ecology.

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.580
The last lecture is going to
be questions about the origin

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.430
of diversity in ecosystems.

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.920
So, we'll basically march
from the molecular scale

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.040
up to the population scale
throughout the semester.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.470
For those of you who are
interested in thinking

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:27.746
about these questions of
how to organize a class,

00:22:27.746 --> 00:22:29.370
there's quite an
interesting discussion

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.400
at the beginning of Bill
Bialek's Biological Physics

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.770
book, where he very
explicitly says

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:38.100
that he tried to resist
the temptation to do what

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:40.330
it is that we do in our class.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.710
He resisted the temptation
to start from the small scale

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:46.150
and then build up to
these larger scales.

00:22:46.150 --> 00:22:47.930
And the reason he
says he wants to avoid

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:50.890
that is because he does not want
to give students the impression

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:54.880
we actually understand how
you go from the lower scales

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.600
up to the higher scales.

00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.980
And I think that's a totally
reasonable viewpoint.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.610
But that being said, the whole
point of this endeavour is

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.710
to try to say
something about it.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:12.420
We may not really understand
it all, but we have to try.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:17.830
And it's certainly true that is
how function arises, that there

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.600
are lower level interactions
that lead to higher scale

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.220
functions, dynamics, behaviors.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:25.720
We may not be able to predict
exactly what's going on there,

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.170
but that is the way
that nature does it.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.510
So, I don't want a second
guess nature, certainly.

00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:34.960
So, that's going
to be our approach.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.600
But if at the end of the class,
you prefer a different order,

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:39.554
you can always just
turn yourself around,

00:23:39.554 --> 00:23:41.220
and then it all jumble
up in your brain.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.160
And then, it can be
whatever order you like.

00:23:45.556 --> 00:23:47.180
On Tuesday, we're
really going to start

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:48.560
with the most basic ideas.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:50.820
What happens if you
have, for example,

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:53.202
one gene that is going
to turn on another gene?

00:23:53.202 --> 00:23:54.910
So, you might have a
transcription factor

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.975
X that's going to
activate so gene Y, that

00:23:57.975 --> 00:24:01.790
says it's going to cause
gene Y to be expressed.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:04.690
Now, it's as simple
as you can get.

00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:06.380
But what are the
general features

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.200
that you can say about
this sort of process?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.940
Well, you can say,
there's one thing.

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.560
It's that X could either
be an activator of Y,

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.462
or maybe it's a
repressor of Y. So,

00:24:16.462 --> 00:24:18.420
these are the two symbols
that we'll often use.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.680
An arrow will
either be an-- well,

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.870
this symbol will
always be a repressor.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.310
A plain arrow may be
ambiguous, so beware.

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:28.990
Now, the question is,
what happens here?

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.380
For example, you might have
this transcription factor--

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:34.730
let's say 10R-- that's
repressing expression

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:39.315
of this gene that is encoding
GFP, green fluorescent protein.

00:24:39.315 --> 00:24:41.690
You're going to see this many,
many times over the course

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.860
of the semester.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:44.800
In some ways, one of
the things that we're

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.310
going to see in the class
is that new ideas often

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:52.570
arise from new techniques
or new capabilities.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.560
Now, it was really, I think,
the Y-- the spread of GFP

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.210
and related proteins that
allowed us to visualize gene

00:25:00.210 --> 00:25:02.050
expression in individual cells.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:06.190
And it led to this real
flowering of new ideas,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.620
of how, for example,
stochasticity may be relevant,

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.702
cell to cell heterogeneity.

00:25:10.702 --> 00:25:12.660
These are all, I think,
very interesting ideas.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:16.280
But in order for them to
be concrete, you need data.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:18.270
And this was a
powerful way for us

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:21.020
to get data that was
relevant for these sorts

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:23.570
of big questions.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:27.280
So, the idea here is that
if this protein is made,

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.276
it's expressed.

00:25:28.276 --> 00:25:29.900
Then that cell will
become fluorescent.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:31.570
In particular,
it'll become green

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.456
if you shine the
proper light on it.

00:25:34.456 --> 00:25:35.580
And then, we can do things.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.310
We can ask questions
about, for example,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:38.835
the dynamics of this process.

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:47.010
So, here we have a
case where, now, this

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.280
is a repressor that is--
if you have this repressor,

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.100
then it stops expression of
that fluorescent protein.

00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:58.240
Now, you can ask, what happens
if you start in a situation

00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:03.600
where the cell is repressing
expression of that gene.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.650
So, in this case, the
protein concentration is 0,

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:08.000
so the cell is not fluorescent.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.240
But then, you add
something so that now you

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.007
cause that repressor to fall off
and stop repressing that gene.

00:26:16.007 --> 00:26:17.590
Now, the question
is, how long does it

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.570
take for the protein
concentration

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.010
to grow to some equilibrium?

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:24.440
It starts out at 0.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:27.240
Eventually, it's going to
reach some steady state.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.270
So, what is it that
sets this time scale?

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:35.410
What's the characteristic time
that it takes for the cell

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.774
to respond to this signal?

00:26:36.774 --> 00:26:38.440
What we're going to
find is that there's

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.070
a very general sense in which
that characteristic time

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.890
scale is really the
cell generation time.

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:48.220
So, cells divide at some rate.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:52.190
It depends on the kind of cell,
the environment, and so forth.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.470
Does anybody have a sense
for a bacterial cell

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.620
in nice, rich media, good
temperature-- how long it

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.272
takes for it to divide?

00:26:59.272 --> 00:27:00.890
Yeah, 20 minutes.

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.140
So, E. coli, for example,
can divide every 20 minutes,

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:04.764
if you put it in the
right environment.

00:27:04.764 --> 00:27:06.440
Which is really
an amazing thing,

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:08.660
if you think about the
number of different proteins

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:11.280
that have to be made, and
the complicated mechanics

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.400
of growing, and
separating, and so forth.

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.490
But every 20 minutes
such a cell can divide.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.360
That's saying that a
bacterial cell, when

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.290
it sees a new signal,
it's going to take,

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.210
of order, that amount of time
in order for it to do anything.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:29.050
And that's just because of this
natural process of dilution.

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:33.449
So, as the cell grows, there's
a dilution of the contents.

00:27:33.449 --> 00:27:34.240
So, it makes sense.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.740
If you start out with a
protein and you stop making it,

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.886
then maybe you'll get
an exponential decay

00:27:38.886 --> 00:27:41.510
of that concentration with this
time scale, the cell generation

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:42.050
time.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:42.990
What's interesting is
that, in some ways,

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.530
that resolve is more general.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:46.860
That, even if you're trying
to turn something on,

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.290
there's the same limit,
this cell generation time,

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.830
that is placing some limit to
how fast the cell can respond

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:58.080
to new information, if it
uses this mode of information

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.824
transmission where you
express a new gene.

00:28:02.824 --> 00:28:04.240
So, if you want
to go faster, than

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.490
you have to do something else.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:09.630
So, in some cases,
you can actually

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:15.000
have a situation where a protein
is actually regulating itself.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.050
So, this is an example
of what you might

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:20.370
call negative autoregulation.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.890
So, in this case, that
protein actually comes back,

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.564
and it represses
its own expression.

00:28:28.564 --> 00:28:30.980
It's found that this is actually
rather common in biology.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:32.750
And so, of course,
if you see something

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.000
that is common in biology,
then it's reasonable that-- so,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.190
maybe there's an
evolutionary explanation.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:40.580
Not always, but it
gives you a hint

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.649
that maybe it's worth looking.

00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:44.440
Now, in this case, what
we're going to find

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.400
is that such negative
autoregulation does

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.982
some very interesting things.

00:28:47.982 --> 00:28:50.190
So, for example, one thing
that it's been shown to do

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.890
is to increase the rate
of response of that gene.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.320
So, in some ways, you can speed
up a response to some signal

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.200
by having that negative
autoregulation.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.790
In a similar way, this
negative autoregulation

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.500
increases what you
might call robustness,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.990
the ability of the
function-- in this case,

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:13.970
maybe, the concentration--
of the protein

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:20.300
to be robust to variations in
things like the temperature,

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:21.240
or this or that.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.630
So, environmental
perturbations, or maybe

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.300
just stochastic fluctuations.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:35.740
Now, in this field, I'd say
one of the key advances that

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:39.310
led to the birth of both this
branch of systems biology,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.790
but also the field of what you
might call synthetic biology--

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.340
really using engineering
principles to try and design

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.595
new gene circuits-- was a
pair of important papers

00:29:49.595 --> 00:29:51.720
that we're going to be
talking about in this class.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.120
So, the first of these was a
paper from Jim Collins's group.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.535
He was at BU, although you
may not have heard yet,

00:29:59.535 --> 00:30:02.530
but he's actually just agreed
to move over here at MIT.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:06.550
So, this is very exciting for
us, and hopefully for you.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.610
So, Jim Collins--
in 2000 he showed

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.920
that he could engineer
a switch, something

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.380
called a toggle switch.

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.990
So, if you have two genes
that are mutually repressing

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:19.410
each other, then
this is a system

00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:23.690
that the most basic
memory module.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:25.885
Because if you have
one gene that's high,

00:30:25.885 --> 00:30:28.530
it can repress the other one,
and that's a stable state.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:29.932
But if this other
gene goes high,

00:30:29.932 --> 00:30:31.640
then it's going to
repress this one here,

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.660
and that's another stable state.

00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.520
And that state,
since it's stable,

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:39.010
can maintain memory of
the past environment.

00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:41.560
And he was able to
demonstrate to his group

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:45.560
that he could construct such
a switch using components

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.590
that, in the past, were never
interacting with each other.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:52.295
So, this is taking advantage
of this fabulous modularity

00:30:52.295 --> 00:30:54.250
of the components
of biology in order

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:57.300
to do something that,
is in, principle useful.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.030
And by doing this, it's possible
that you could go and engineer

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:02.530
new things.

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.880
But it's also a test bed
for you to take this dictum

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.710
from Feynman that if
you can't build it,

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.950
then you don't understand it.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:12.550
And this is a nice way
to go into the cell

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:15.414
and say, if it's really
true, if all these models

00:31:15.414 --> 00:31:17.580
that we talk about in systems
biology, for example--

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.930
if they're really true,
then we should actually

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.970
be able to go into the cell,
put these components together,

00:31:20.970 --> 00:31:22.761
and demonstrate that
there is, for example,

00:31:22.761 --> 00:31:24.670
this switch-like behavior.

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:27.380
And this was a very
important paper

00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.058
that demonstrated that
it's possible to do this.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.870
The other paper that I think--

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:35.703
AUDIENCE: Did they
actually make the switch?

00:31:35.703 --> 00:31:38.060
PROFESSOR: Yes They
actually constructed it.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.860
They put it on a round, circular
piece like this plasmid,

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.070
put it into E. coli, and showed
that they could do this here.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.700
And indeed, this particular
issue of nature, I think,

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.660
was hugely influential
for our field,

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:53.040
because that toggle switch
paper and this other paper--

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:55.600
"The Repressilator," by Michael
Elowitz and colleagues--

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.620
they were kind of back to
back in that issue of nature.

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.020
And I'd say, in some ways, they
were the beginning of systems

00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:03.070
and synthetic biology.

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:05.170
Of course, you can
argue about this.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.730
But certainly, I
think they influenced

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:10.430
many, many people in getting
excited about the field.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:13.160
So, the repressilator--
this is the idea

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:16.700
that you can generate
a gene circuit

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.312
like this that will oscillate.

00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:22.640
And in this case, instead of
having just two genes that

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.380
are repressing each
other, if instead you

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.380
have three genes that are
repressing each other,

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:29.670
but in a circular
fashion, then there's

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.060
no stable state akin to what we
have with this toggle switch.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.260
But instead, what
happens is that you

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:39.960
get successive waves of each
of these components going

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:40.650
up and down.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:43.002
So, they oscillate as they
mutually repress each other.

00:32:43.002 --> 00:32:44.960
And I just want to be
clear about what this is.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.132
So, here, these
are E. coli cells,

00:32:48.132 --> 00:32:50.265
where Elowitz put
in this plasmid--

00:32:50.265 --> 00:32:52.890
this circular piece of
DNA-- encoding those three

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.680
genes that mutually
repress each other.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:56.820
And basically, associated
with one of those genes,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.820
he's again attached one of
these fluorescent proteins.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:02.010
So, the level of
fluorescence in the cell

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.760
tells you about the state
of that gene circuit.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:06.880
Let's see if we can--

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:12.320
So, it starts out.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.111
There's a single cell
you can't really see.

00:33:14.111 --> 00:33:15.100
It starts dividing.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.290
Then you see it oscillates--
gets bright, dim, bright, dim.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.730
But you can see that there
are a number of features you

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:24.170
might notice about this movie.

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:30.034
So, first, it does oscillate,
which was huge in the sense

00:33:30.034 --> 00:33:31.950
that it wasn't obvious
that you could actually

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.210
just put these genes together
and generate something

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.404
that oscillates at all.

00:33:37.404 --> 00:33:38.820
On the other hand,
you'd say, well

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.690
it's not such a good oscillator.

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:46.070
In particular, for example, this
started out as a single cell.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:48.880
Now it's dividing under
the microscope on agger.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.080
So, it's getting
some nutrients there.

00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.930
But what you see is
that-- are these cells

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:55.310
all in phase with each other?

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:56.100
No.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:59.580
So, there's patches--
bright, dark.

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.120
So, the question is,
what's going on here?

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.435
And it turns out that this
design of an oscillator

00:34:04.435 --> 00:34:05.727
is perhaps not a very good one.

00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:07.768
And, indeed, one of things
we'll be talking about

00:34:07.768 --> 00:34:10.170
is how you can maybe use
some engineering principles

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:11.780
to design better oscillators.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.530
So, for example, Jeff
Hasty at San Diego

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.795
has done really
beautiful work showing

00:34:15.795 --> 00:34:18.590
that you can make robust,
tunable oscillators in cells

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.940
like this.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:24.110
Now, these oscillations
they were maybe not as good

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.300
as you would like.

00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.290
But this, actually,
is an example

00:34:27.290 --> 00:34:32.306
of how a partial failure--
in the sense that they're not

00:34:32.306 --> 00:34:33.889
great oscillations,
that maybe somehow

00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:37.100
there's noise that's entering
in here that you would not like.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:40.439
This led to the realization
that maybe noise

00:34:40.439 --> 00:34:43.670
is relevant in decision
making within cells.

00:34:43.670 --> 00:34:47.070
And this led-- I'll show
you in a few slides--

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:50.671
to another major advance
that Elowitz had.

00:34:50.671 --> 00:34:52.170
So, this is, I
think, a good example

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:57.340
of how one-- we might
call it a partial failure.

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.640
Some reservations about the
quality of this oscillator

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:03.810
led him to another really
big scientific discovery

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:09.070
on the importance of noise in
decision making within cells.

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:10.810
But before we get
to this noise, we're

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:14.940
going to say something about
the more global structure

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:17.160
of these gene networks.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.950
And, in particular,
we're going to analyze,

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.670
and we're going to read
this paper by Barabasi which

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:26.230
represents a simple
mechanism for how you might

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.400
what are called these power-law
distributions in networks.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.350
So, if you have these
genes that are mutually

00:35:31.350 --> 00:35:32.940
activating-repressing,
what can you

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.990
say about the structure of this
gene network within the cell?

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.701
Now, you can analyze
such global structure

00:35:41.701 --> 00:35:42.950
in a couple of different ways.

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:45.480
One is just to ask, how
many different genes are

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.210
different genes connected to?

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:49.480
And that's maybe the
more Barabasi approach.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.860
But then there was
another major discovery

00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:54.350
that Uri Alon, the author
of our textbook, made,

00:35:54.350 --> 00:35:58.640
which is that you can
ask-- in this crazy network

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:01.020
that you have that describes
the decision making

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:03.290
within the cell-- are
there common patterns

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:06.910
or motifs that appear
over and over again?

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:09.330
So, just like this
idea of autoregulation,

00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:11.982
when a gene represses
or activates itself,

00:36:11.982 --> 00:36:13.690
that's something that
appears frequently.

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.148
So, you can ask,
why might that be?

00:36:15.148 --> 00:36:17.050
Similarly, if there
are other patterns that

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:18.790
appear in these networks,
then maybe they arose,

00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:20.956
or they were selected for
by evolution, because they

00:36:20.956 --> 00:36:22.150
perform some other function.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:25.240
In particular, we're going to
analyze this feed-forward loop

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.600
motif, where you have some gene
that activates, for example,

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.370
another gene Y. Y
activates-- I'm sorry,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.020
this is supposed to be Z. Now,
if X, again, directly activates

00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.607
or represses Z-- this
bottom gene-- then

00:36:40.607 --> 00:36:41.690
what does that do for you?

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.760
Because this is something
you see more frequently

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.310
than you expect, based
on some notion of chance,

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.990
or some null model.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:50.310
So, the question is, why
would these feed-forward loops

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:51.670
appear over and over again?

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.350
And it turns out that they can
provide some nice functions

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:56.870
in the sense that,
for example, you

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:59.010
can provide some
asymmetrical response

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:02.160
to temporary fluctuations of
inputs, et cetera, et cetera.

00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:04.300
So, we'll try to get some
sense of these ideas.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:12.650
So, as I alluded to before in
this idea of the repressilator

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:14.560
that Michael
Elowitz made, he saw

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.400
that it was surprisingly noisy.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.160
And this got him
thinking about the role

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.990
of stochastic
fluctuations within cells.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.160
And I think that this is a
common theme throughout much

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:25.380
of systems biology.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.510
It's the role of
noise in biology.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:31.806
And this could be within a cell
for individual decision making.

00:37:31.806 --> 00:37:33.430
It could be in context
of development--

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:38.720
how is that you robustly
make a body, given noise?

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.150
It could be at the level
of evolutionary ecosystems,

00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:45.640
that maybe noise actually
plays a dominant role in,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.640
for example, determining
the abundance

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.360
or diversity of ecosystems.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.740
So, we'll see these themes
pop up on multiple scales

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.210
throughout the semester.

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:56.220
But in this case,
what Elowitz did--

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.020
this is just two years after
his repressilator paper--

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.280
he showed that if you just
take the-- in a single cell,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.550
you give it the exact
same instructions.

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.160
So, you say, make a red
fluorescent protein,

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.820
and make a green
fluorescent protein,

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.770
with the exact same
instructions to the cell.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.144
And you can say, well, if you
have the same instructions,

00:38:16.144 --> 00:38:18.450
then the level of
the red and the green

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.250
should do the same thing.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:21.810
But what he found
was that, actually,

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:25.130
there was surprising
heterogeneity

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:30.050
of the level of those two
proteins, even in single cells.

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.500
So, the idea is that even-- this
represents a fundamental limit

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.210
to what a cell can
do, because this

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:39.640
is saying that we take-- we try
to do the exact same thing two

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.440
different times.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.815
If you don't get
the same output,

00:38:41.815 --> 00:38:44.706
then that's a real limit
to what you can do, right?

00:38:44.706 --> 00:38:46.330
Because you've done
everything you can.

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.770
You said, here's the
sequence of that DNA that has

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:51.830
the instructions, this
promoter sequence.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:54.770
It's exactly the same, yet you
still get different outputs.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:56.700
So, the question is,
what's causing that?

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:58.610
And also, how is it
that life can actually

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:03.346
function given this intrinsic
noise that's in the cell?

00:39:03.346 --> 00:39:04.720
These are things
that we're going

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:08.960
to look at over the
course of the semester.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.380
And these are
actually some images

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.310
that he took in this paper.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.640
And so, we can see
that some of the cells

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.690
are really rather red.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.630
Some are rather yellowish green.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.330
And so, this is telling us about
the level of those proteins

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:23.190
in individual cells.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.130
So now, we have some notion.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:34.660
So, somehow, noise is important
in these molecular scale gene

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:36.400
expression patterns.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.110
Now, there is what I think is
really quite a beautiful paper

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.270
by Sunney Xie [INAUDIBLE]
at Harvard in 2006,

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.090
where he combined
a single molecule

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:49.470
fluorescence with live
cell imaging in E. coli.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:55.370
And this allowed him to observe
individual expression events

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.760
within individual
cells, where every time

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.260
one of these proteins
was expressed,

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:02.040
he got a little yellow
spot, corresponding

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:06.190
to this equivalent of a
yellow fluorescent protein.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:10.390
And so, he was able to watch
as real, live cells made

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:11.729
individual proteins.

00:40:11.729 --> 00:40:13.520
And from that, he was
able to say, I think,

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:18.130
some very nice things about
what it is that's causing noise,

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.740
such as what we talked
about in that repressilator,

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:22.420
or in the other Elowitz paper.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.180
And a lot of it just
has to with this idea

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:28.310
that if you're talking about
low number events or low numbers

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:31.600
of molecules-- DNA
typically present, only

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:33.730
one or a few copies
per cell-- then

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.290
that means there's some
inherent stochasticity.

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:39.060
Because that piece
of DNA-- it's either

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.140
bound by one of these motors,
this RNA polymerase that

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.550
can make the RNA, or not.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:49.110
And that is intrinsically going
to be a stochastic process.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.370
And that kind of
dynamic can lead

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:54.540
to substantial heterogeneity,
or fluctuations,

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.010
in expression of
individual genes.

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.940
So, it's kind of at
this stage of the course

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.940
that we start to think
maybe a little bit more

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.420
about some of the global
aspects of what it

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:09.750
is that a cell is trying to do.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.660
And in particular, if
a cell is trying to,

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.495
for example, swim to get to
higher concentrations of food,

00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:20.640
what are the fundamental
limitations that cell faces?

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:23.206
How does it know what is
uphill, what's downhill?

00:41:23.206 --> 00:41:25.580
So, these are cases in which
we have to really understand

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.370
something about the
role of diffusion

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:33.192
in the ability of
these small cells

00:41:33.192 --> 00:41:34.730
to move in their environment.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:36.560
And for example, here
is an illustration

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.850
of the Reynolds number, which
is telling you something

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:43.670
about the relative
importance of viscous forces

00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:46.730
versus inertial forces on
these different organisms.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.070
And some of the
way-- for example,

00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:51.750
how an organism
such as us can swim

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:54.290
is just qualitatively
different from how

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:57.690
a microscopic organism,
such as E. coli, can swim.

00:41:57.690 --> 00:42:00.390
So we'll try to understand
how that plays out

00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:04.310
and, in particular, how it
is that E. coli can move

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:07.000
towards higher food sources.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.540
And there's a very
clever way that bacteria

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:14.020
have that allows
them to have really

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:18.780
robust functioning of
this chemotaxis process

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.200
within the cell.

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.840
And I think this is a neat
example of the gene networks

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.510
coupling into a higher
level behavior that

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:28.524
allows cells to
survive in really

00:42:28.524 --> 00:42:29.565
challenging environments.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:34.730
Another manifestation,
actually, of fluctuations

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:37.730
is this idea of
pattern formation.

00:42:37.730 --> 00:42:43.400
And this is actually
experimental data of in vitro--

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.510
so, if you take proteins
outside of the cell

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.510
and you put them on a
two dimensional membrane.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.160
Now, these are
actually the proteins

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.195
that are responsible for
finding the center of the cell.

00:42:55.195 --> 00:42:58.589
So, I told that E. coli, for
example-- it grows in length.

00:42:58.589 --> 00:43:00.880
And then, once it gets long
enough, it wants to divide,

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.770
so it separates in the middle.

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:06.196
And the question is, how does
it know where the middle is?

00:43:06.196 --> 00:43:09.040
You know, if you can just stand
outside a cell and look at it,

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:11.437
then you say, I know where
it is, and you just cut.

00:43:11.437 --> 00:43:12.520
But imagine you're a cell.

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:14.264
How do you know
where this-- once you

00:43:14.264 --> 00:43:16.680
start thinking about all these
challenges that cells face,

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:18.721
it's really remarkable
that they can do anything.

00:43:18.721 --> 00:43:21.830
And what it turns out,
is that they implement--

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:27.200
they use what are called these
Min proteins that display what

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:31.486
seem to be the equivalent
of what you might know

00:43:31.486 --> 00:43:33.930
of as Turing patterns
in order to cause

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:36.450
these oscillations in the cell
that allows it to find where

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:37.780
the center of the cell is.

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:41.580
So, we'll talk about this
and how these authors were

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.620
able to visualize these
beautiful traveling

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:48.190
waves of proteins, where
they successfully bind

00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:50.980
to the membrane, and then
are ejected off of it.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.889
And this results in
beautiful patterns

00:43:52.889 --> 00:43:54.180
that are traveling, as you saw.

00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:01.960
So, this was-- I'd say that
these topics are what you might

00:44:01.960 --> 00:44:03.730
call traditional
systems biology,

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:07.500
in the sense that these
are all things that

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:09.010
of physics branch
of systems biology

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:13.790
were all thinking about
for the first 10 years.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:16.400
And over the last five
years, maybe, there

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.820
has been a greater
interest in trying

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.130
to understand how these
sorts of ideas and principles

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:23.740
may be relevant
for larger scale.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:28.080
And larger the sense of,
instead of thinking maybe

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.850
about genes as this
fundamental unit--

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.960
they try to understand
how genes interact to form

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.610
this decision making process.

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:36.440
Maybe instead, if
you think about cells

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.065
as somehow being that
fundamental unit,

00:44:38.065 --> 00:44:40.250
how is it that
cells come together

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:45.110
to lead to interesting
population level phenomena?

00:44:45.110 --> 00:44:47.670
And so, we talk about
both what you might call

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:49.870
evolutionary systems biology.

00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:52.937
So, how is it that evolution
within a population behaves?

00:44:52.937 --> 00:44:54.520
As well as ecological
systems biology.

00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:56.478
What happens if you have
more than one species,

00:44:56.478 --> 00:44:58.582
and how is that
the kinds of ideas

00:44:58.582 --> 00:45:00.540
we talk about in the
first half of the semester

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.095
are relevant in these
population level phenomena?

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.960
So, in the first example
that we're going to give

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.630
is actually another paper
from Uri Alon's group,

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:16.510
where he showed that there's a
very fundamental sense in which

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:19.080
cells, through the
evolutionary process,

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.012
are implementing a
cost-benefit analysis.

00:45:21.012 --> 00:45:22.470
And the question
that he asked here

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:24.920
is that, if you
take an E. coli cell

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.670
and you put it in different
concentrations of the sugar

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.110
lactose.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:33.040
Now, the question is,
how much of the enzyme

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:35.762
responsible for digesting
lactose-- how much of that

00:45:35.762 --> 00:45:36.720
enzyme should you make?

00:45:39.321 --> 00:45:41.570
You might say, well, you
should just make a lot of it.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:42.970
But he said, well,
at some point,

00:45:42.970 --> 00:45:44.080
there's going to be a problem.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.480
Because if you make
too much of it,

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.688
then you're going to be
spending all of your energies

00:45:47.688 --> 00:45:48.480
making this enzyme.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:50.688
Whereas, on the other hand,
if you don't make enough,

00:45:50.688 --> 00:45:53.300
then you're not going to be able
to get enough of this sugar.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:55.696
So, like always, there's
this Goldilocks principle.

00:45:55.696 --> 00:45:57.820
You don't want too little;
you don't want too much.

00:45:57.820 --> 00:46:00.660
And what he showed is that
if he evolved these E. coli

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:03.380
populations over hundreds of
generations in the laboratory,

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:05.920
but at different concentrations
of this sugar lactose, what

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.780
he saw is that the
concentration, or the level

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.940
of expression of the enzymes
required to make that,

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.500
to break down that sugar--
it changes over time.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:18.551
So, if you have a
lot of the sugar,

00:46:18.551 --> 00:46:20.300
then you want to make
a lot of the enzyme.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:21.800
If you have a small
amount of that sugar,

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.508
then you want to make
less of the enzyme.

00:46:23.508 --> 00:46:24.870
So, that all makes sense.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:27.370
But this is a case where he
could really demonstrate it

00:46:27.370 --> 00:46:30.560
in the laboratory using
these microbial populations.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.130
It's a very beautiful
example of how

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:35.890
simple ideas of
cost-benefit really

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:40.030
give you insight into
the evolutionary process.

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:45.350
Now, I told you before
that part of the reason

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:49.600
that we have to consider the
role of fluctuations, or noise,

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:51.730
in, for example,
cellular decision making,

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:53.720
is because of the low
numbers of molecules

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:55.299
that are often involved.

00:46:55.299 --> 00:46:57.090
So, if you have a small
number of proteins,

00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:59.580
or small numbers of
DNA, then the process

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.460
is intrinsically stochastic.

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.970
Now, the question
naturally arises,

00:47:03.970 --> 00:47:07.390
why is it that we might need
to consider stochastic dynamics

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.060
in the context of evolution?

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.840
Because if you think
about, for example,

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.220
an E. Coli population,
even in a small test tube,

00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:18.070
you might have 1
billion cells there.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:20.140
So, 1 billion is a
big number, right?

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.490
Much larger than 1.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.160
So, it's tempting to conclude
from that, that actually, all

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.400
of this stochastic dynamics,
fluctuations-- maybe it's just

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.910
not relevant for evolution.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:33.380
However, if you think about
the evolutionary process,

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:36.110
fundamentally, any time that
you have a new mutant appear

00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:39.140
in the population that may be
more fit, may be less fit--

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.020
but every new mutant
in the population

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:43.650
starts out as a
single individual.

00:47:43.650 --> 00:47:46.120
It's a trivial statement,
but it has deep implications,

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.410
because it means that every
evolutionary process goes

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:52.365
through this regime
where you have

00:47:52.365 --> 00:47:54.880
a small number of fluctuations.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.780
So, this has very
clear locations

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.750
in many different
contexts, and we'll

00:47:58.750 --> 00:48:00.541
explore it over the
course of the semester.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:06.550
And despite the fact that that
evolution is intrinsically,

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:09.350
you might say, random,
what's interesting

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:14.189
are cases where that
randomness somehow washes out.

00:48:14.189 --> 00:48:15.980
For example, we're
going to talk about what

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.760
I think is a beautiful paper
by Roy Kishony's group,

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:22.490
at Harvard Medical
School, who showed

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:25.232
that if you take a
population and you put

00:48:25.232 --> 00:48:26.690
in some new
environments, there are

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:28.300
going to different mutations.

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:30.550
Some of them are going to
be really good; some of them

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:33.170
are going to be not so good.

00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:36.360
You can imagine that of all
of these possible beneficial

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:40.290
mutations, they describe
some distribution.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:44.580
Whereas, if you asked-- this is
the frequency, or the number,

00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:48.580
of mutations as a function
of how good that mutation is,

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.960
you might say, it should
be some falling function.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.292
Because you just not are
going to get as many mutations

00:48:53.292 --> 00:48:55.000
that are really just
amazing as they are.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.040
They're kind of good.

00:48:56.040 --> 00:48:58.754
But it's not obvious whether
the curve should be exponential,

00:48:58.754 --> 00:48:59.920
or maybe it looks like this.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:03.340
It could look like
many different things.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.120
What Roy's group showed
here in this paper is that,

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:10.242
actually, in some very
reasonable situations,

00:49:10.242 --> 00:49:12.700
it doesn't actually matter what
the underlying distribution

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.440
might be.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:16.290
Because if you look at the
distribution of mutations that

00:49:16.290 --> 00:49:20.930
actually fix or spread
in the population,

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.660
those actually all
look kind of the same,

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.750
in the sense that they're
peaked around some value.

00:49:25.750 --> 00:49:31.640
So, there's some sense in which
the random process of evolution

00:49:31.640 --> 00:49:36.137
leads to some patterns that
are probably not so obvious.

00:49:36.137 --> 00:49:37.595
And on the flip
side, what it means

00:49:37.595 --> 00:49:40.590
is that if you go and measure
how good are the mutations that

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:42.160
actually appear
on the population,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.030
that actually tells you
surprisingly little about what

00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:48.060
that underlying distribution
is, in terms of the effects

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.950
of the beneficial mutations.

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:54.360
So, there's some way in which
the details kind of wash out.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.990
And I think this is fascinating
because a major theme

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:00.190
or major challenge
in systems biology

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:03.470
is we want understand how
these underlying parts lead

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.800
to some higher level
function, but we don't always

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:09.830
know which details
of the interactions

00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:11.590
are important for
leading to that higher

00:50:11.590 --> 00:50:13.180
level of organization.

00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:15.660
In some cases, they're very
important, but in some cases,

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:16.160
not.

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.720
So, a challenge that we're going
to face over and over again

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.012
is trying to understand, what
are the key features that

00:50:21.012 --> 00:50:23.344
are going to influence the
dynamics of this higher level

00:50:23.344 --> 00:50:23.937
system?

00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:25.770
And this is, I think,
an interesting example

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.287
of how some features of
that underlying distribution

00:50:28.287 --> 00:50:29.620
are important, and some are not.

00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:40.180
So, another interesting
analogy between evolution

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.100
and some ideas from
physics is this idea

00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:44.620
of a fitness landscape.

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.420
So, just like an
energy landscape

00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:50.830
tells you something
about the dynamics

00:50:50.830 --> 00:50:53.210
of a system-- for
example, you can say,

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:56.820
a ball should roll down a hill.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.570
Similarly, if you
think about evolution

00:50:58.570 --> 00:51:02.690
in the context of how
fit an organism is

00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:05.810
as a function of some
different parameters,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.330
you can get what might
be nontrivial structure.

00:51:08.330 --> 00:51:11.780
So, this is some illustration
of what's perhaps

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.170
a nontrivial fitness landscape.

00:51:13.170 --> 00:51:16.360
Now, the height here is
some notion of fitness.

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.250
So, we could imagine
this could be

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:20.150
the ability of a bird to fly.

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:22.290
In that case, maybe
these two axes

00:51:22.290 --> 00:51:25.830
could be the length and
the width of the wing.

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:29.130
Now, the shape of this
landscape tells you

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:32.040
something about how
evolution is constrained.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.174
Because if the landscape
looks like this,

00:51:34.174 --> 00:51:36.340
then what that's saying is
that you have to actually

00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:38.600
evolve, in this case,
maybe a wider wing

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.920
before you can
evolve a longer wing.

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.530
So, this is-- if there's
structure to the fitness

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.680
landscape like this, then
it tells you something

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:48.765
about the path of evolution.

00:51:48.765 --> 00:51:50.140
Now, in this case,
we're thinking

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:54.595
about this in the context
of phenotypes-- things

00:51:54.595 --> 00:51:57.340
that you can just look at
the organism and measure.

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.690
But instead of think about
this in terms of phenotypes,

00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:03.490
we could instead think of
it in terms of genotype.

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:06.640
For example, there
is a beautiful paper

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:09.340
that we're going to read
from Daniel Weinreich

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:13.260
where he, in the context
of a gene that encodes

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:17.110
an enzyme that breaks down
antibiotics such as penicillin,

00:52:17.110 --> 00:52:20.120
what he did is he made
all possible combinations

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:24.850
of five point mutations--
single limitations in the gene.

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:27.330
So, he made all 32
combinations of this gene

00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:30.840
and then measured the shape of
the resulting fitness landscape

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:35.060
from those 32 different
versions of the gene.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.200
And from it, what he
found is that there's

00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.620
a very interesting sense
in which evolution,

00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:41.885
at the molecular scale,
is somehow constrained.

00:52:44.664 --> 00:52:46.330
So, the idea there
is that there somehow

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.413
is a rugged fitness landscape
that is constraining

00:52:48.413 --> 00:52:50.775
the path of evolution.

00:52:50.775 --> 00:52:53.150
And so, in all these cases
that we've been talking about,

00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:55.330
there's some notion
that you can say,

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:58.000
this organism has
this fitness so long

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.050
as it has a wing shape
that looks like this.

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:03.840
Now, that is perhaps
find in many cases.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.735
But in some cases,
there are what

00:53:06.735 --> 00:53:09.404
you might call game interactions
between different organisms

00:53:09.404 --> 00:53:10.070
in a population.

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:11.660
And what I mean by
game interactions

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:14.070
is that the fitness of
a particular organism

00:53:14.070 --> 00:53:18.330
may depend upon what other
organisms are out there.

00:53:18.330 --> 00:53:20.570
And in that case,
you can't just say

00:53:20.570 --> 00:53:23.725
that one organism is fit or
not, because it just depends

00:53:23.725 --> 00:53:25.880
on what everyone else in
the population is doing,

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.340
or the genotype of the other
individuals in the population.

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:30.140
So, in that case,
you really have

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.824
to apply some ideas
from game theory

00:53:32.824 --> 00:53:34.990
to try to get insight into
the evolutionary process.

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:38.050
And we're going to talk
about some really nice cases

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.390
where researchers have
constructed, for example,

00:53:40.390 --> 00:53:44.040
a rock, paper, scissors
game using different E. coli

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:45.840
strains.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:48.010
And if you stick
out to that long,

00:53:48.010 --> 00:53:50.066
I'll tell you about
a case in lizards

00:53:50.066 --> 00:53:51.940
where people have
demonstrated a rock, paper,

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:54.510
scissors interaction in the
context of different mating

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.850
strategies of the male lizards.

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.380
So, if that's not
an advertisement

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:02.170
to stick around for a couple
months, I don't know what is.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:05.850
There are other cases where
people have demonstrated

00:54:05.850 --> 00:54:09.510
that microbes interact via
cooperative interactions,

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:11.890
in which it's possible
for cheater strategies

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:13.980
to arise, spread
throughout the population,

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:16.350
and cause some harm
to the population--

00:54:16.350 --> 00:54:18.710
maybe even collapse
of the population.

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:20.520
So, this is a case
where there's tension

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.250
between what's good
for the individual

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:23.500
and what's good for the group.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.850
Now, organisms are able to do
a remarkable set of things.

00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:33.850
So, we saw cases where, for
example, that neutrophil

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:38.100
was able to chase the staph
aureus, that bacterial cell.

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.670
So, that's amazing.

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:41.460
But that's responding
to something

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:45.760
that is an immediate
part of the environment.

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.860
So, it's chasing
a bacterial cell.

00:54:48.860 --> 00:54:52.625
But you might ask, is it
possible for cells to learn?

00:54:52.625 --> 00:54:54.250
And, of course, then
you have to define

00:54:54.250 --> 00:54:55.540
what you mean by learning.

00:54:55.540 --> 00:54:58.510
And there's been some really
interesting demonstrations

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:02.030
of how it's possible
for organisms

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.180
to learn not at the
individual level, necessarily,

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.690
but at the population
level, via evolution.

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:10.654
And in particular, in this
very well written paper,

00:55:10.654 --> 00:55:12.070
what they were
able to demonstrate

00:55:12.070 --> 00:55:16.520
is that both yeast that have
evolved in the context of wine

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:22.390
fermentation and E. coli that
have evolved traveling through,

00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:24.120
for example, our
digestive tracts,

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.000
there are characteristics,
sequences of events,

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.290
in which things happen.

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:32.200
So, the idea is that if a
bacterial cell is ingested

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.300
by a mammal, they will typically
see one carbon source, and then

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:35.800
another one.

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:38.650
So, they might see carbon source
A, and then carbon source B,

00:55:38.650 --> 00:55:40.620
as they travel through
the digestive tract.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.020
But if that is typically
what happens, then

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:46.000
what it means is that
an organism might have

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:49.005
an advantage if, when
it sees carbon source A,

00:55:49.005 --> 00:55:52.550
it starts preparing to
digest carbon source B. So,

00:55:52.550 --> 00:55:55.610
we can actually learn something
about typical environmental

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:56.546
orderings.

00:55:56.546 --> 00:55:58.670
But it's not learning at
the individual cell level.

00:55:58.670 --> 00:56:02.620
It's learning over the course
of evolutionary time scales,

00:56:02.620 --> 00:56:04.300
the typical sequence of events.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:06.660
And in this paper,
they show that this

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.050
seems to be the case
for both E. coli

00:56:10.050 --> 00:56:13.230
and for yeast in the
context of fermentation.

00:56:13.230 --> 00:56:15.220
So, I think it's a
really beautiful example

00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:18.240
of different notions of what
you might mean by learning.

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:26.260
So, another classic
debate within the field

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:31.590
of evolutionary is this
question of, why sex?

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:34.680
And in particular, there's
this classic paradox

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.750
which is saying, sex is costly.

00:56:38.750 --> 00:56:41.300
In particular, if you
take a bacterial cell,

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.450
just one cell turns
into two cells.

00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:45.280
And then two can turn
into four, and you

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.197
get very rapid exponential
growth of the population.

00:56:48.197 --> 00:56:50.030
Whereas, if you have
both males and females,

00:56:50.030 --> 00:56:52.740
then there's what you might
call this twofold cost of sex.

00:56:52.740 --> 00:56:54.220
Because males are,
in some sense,

00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:56.820
not contributing to that
exponential growth rate.

00:56:56.820 --> 00:57:00.610
If you start with a male,
female, and they have two kids,

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:02.580
and you have another
male, female, and then

00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:04.030
you don't get
exponential growth.

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.810
And this is a factor of 2 in
the rate of exponential growth.

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:09.570
So this is what's
in that exponent.

00:57:09.570 --> 00:57:11.150
So, this is a big, big effect.

00:57:11.150 --> 00:57:13.330
And so, I think it's a
major, major challenge

00:57:13.330 --> 00:57:17.277
to ask, why is it that sex is
so common among what you might

00:57:17.277 --> 00:57:18.360
call the higher organisms.

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:22.200
And there are many hypotheses.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.450
We'll talk about some of them.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:26.180
One of the leading ones is known
as the Red Queen hypothesis

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:30.410
from this Lewis Carroll story,
where there's this line.

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.680
The Red Queen has to run
faster and faster in order

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.250
to keep still where she is.

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:36.290
That is exactly what
you all are doing.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:38.623
And the reason that it's
called the Red Queen hypothesis

00:57:38.623 --> 00:57:41.950
is because it's arguing that
perhaps the reason that we

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:45.550
and other animals have
obligate sexual reproduction

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:48.962
is because of some arms
race with parasites--

00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:50.420
that the sexual
reproduction allows

00:57:50.420 --> 00:57:54.390
us to evolve more rapidly
against the always

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.020
adapting parasite populations.

00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.430
And of course,
we'll have to talk

00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:59.680
about exactly what this means.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.530
But there have been some
interesting experiments

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:06.090
in worms, in which they
had different reproductive,

00:58:06.090 --> 00:58:08.110
different sexual
strategies, in the presence

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:09.480
or absence of parasites.

00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:13.140
And this showed that there are
some interesting cases where

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.008
this may be at least
part of what's going on.

00:58:19.570 --> 00:58:22.280
So, at this stage,
we've been talking first

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.160
about decision
making within cells,

00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.710
and then how evolution may
allow cells to anticipate

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:30.870
different environmental
changes, may

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:34.094
be able to play games
against other strategies.

00:58:34.094 --> 00:58:35.760
But at the end, we're
just going to talk

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:39.330
some about inter-species
interactions,

00:58:39.330 --> 00:58:41.220
and what these sorts
of ideas may be

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:43.500
able to say about that process.

00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.920
So, for example, a classic
inter-species interaction

00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.560
are predator-prey interactions.

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.200
And this has been
used to explain,

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.260
for example, why it is that many
natural populations oscillate

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:56.214
over time.

00:58:56.214 --> 00:58:57.755
There are simple
models of a predator

00:58:57.755 --> 00:59:00.267
and prey that lead
to such oscillations.

00:59:00.267 --> 00:59:01.850
And just over the
last 10 years, there

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:04.240
have been some really
fascinating experiments where,

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.819
in the laboratory, they were
able to take predator-prey,

00:59:06.819 --> 00:59:07.860
show that they oscillate.

00:59:07.860 --> 00:59:10.120
But then, in this case,
they saw some features

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.760
that they weren't expecting.

00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.660
The oscillations were
maybe much longer

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.190
than they were anticipating.

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:16.899
And instead of
oscillating 90 degrees out

00:59:16.899 --> 00:59:18.356
of phase-- which
is what you expect

00:59:18.356 --> 00:59:20.260
from standard predator-prey
models-- instead

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.080
they were oscillating
180 degrees out of phase.

00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:25.420
And I think that this
is a good example of how

00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:27.290
quantitative experiments
in the laboratory

00:59:27.290 --> 00:59:30.100
can actually say something
about the classic models

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:31.350
of predator-prey oscillations.

00:59:31.350 --> 00:59:33.192
They are over 100 years old.

00:59:33.192 --> 00:59:35.400
But if you go, and you make
quantitative measurements

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.780
in the lab, you see,
actually, in many cases,

00:59:37.780 --> 00:59:38.710
things are different.

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:40.040
And then, you can ask, why?

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.990
In this case, they
went-- they did modeling,

00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:44.190
and they said, maybe
it's because of evolution

00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:46.130
within the prey population.

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.080
And once they were
able to-- they

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.707
had hypothesized
that from modeling.

00:59:49.707 --> 00:59:51.540
And then they went, and
they did experiments

00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.180
where they prevented
that evolution,

00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.820
or they prevented-- they reduced
the heterogeneity in the prey

00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.460
population.

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.670
And then they were able
to show that those two

00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:59.569
features disappeared.

00:59:59.569 --> 01:00:01.360
So, I think it's really
a beautiful example

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.800
of the interplay that
we always hope for,

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.849
which is that you do
theoretically motivated

01:00:05.849 --> 01:00:08.390
experiments, and experimentally
motivated theory computation.

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:09.680
Ideally, you go back and forth.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:10.660
And together, you
can really learn

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:12.250
more than you would
ever be able to do just

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.333
by doing one or the other.

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:18.100
We're also going to
try to say something

01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:21.490
about the dynamics of
populations in space.

01:00:21.490 --> 01:00:24.260
So, just like these
spatial patterns

01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.960
that we talked about before,
in the context of maybe gene

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.470
networks, there
are also dynamics

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:29.960
of populations in space.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:32.320
For example, when populations
expand into new territory,

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:34.444
what does that mean about
the evolutionary process?

01:00:34.444 --> 01:00:36.760
Once again, some
very nice experiments

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.600
have been done over
the last decade

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.645
to try to eliminate
this process.

01:00:40.645 --> 01:00:44.090
And in particular, one of
the things that was found

01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:47.080
is that this process
of genetic drift,

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.340
the role of randomness in
the evolutionary process,

01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:54.150
is somehow strongly enhanced
in many of these experimenting

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:55.380
populations.

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.520
Because somehow the
effective population size

01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.670
that quantifies maybe
the strength of noise

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:01.660
is somehow enhanced.

01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.810
Because it's not the
entire population matters.

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:05.580
It's just the
population at the front

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.050
of this expanding population
that is somehow relevant.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:13.080
So, we'll explore how
these ideas play out.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.700
And so, towards the
end of the class,

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:18.200
we'll try to think about some
real ecological phenomena.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.667
In particular,
we're going to have

01:01:20.667 --> 01:01:23.250
one lecture where we talk about
tipping points in populations.

01:01:23.250 --> 01:01:25.250
It's a theme that my
group, for example,

01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:27.200
has been very excited
about recently.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.510
So, this here is data from
the Newfoundland cod fishery.

01:01:30.510 --> 01:01:33.800
And it's an example of how
many natural populations can

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.700
actually collapse suddenly
and catastrophically

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:40.180
in response to deteriorating
environmental conditions.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.170
Now, what's plotted
here-- this is essentially

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:45.332
the number of fish that are
caught as a function of time.

01:01:45.332 --> 01:01:47.790
And you may not be able to read
this, but over on the left,

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:51.430
this is 1850, and
this the modern day.

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:54.330
So, this was a very productive
fishery for hundreds of years

01:01:54.330 --> 01:01:57.280
and, actually, even for
hundreds of years before this.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.291
However, in the '60s and '70s,
improved fishing technology

01:02:00.291 --> 01:02:02.290
led to a dramatic increase
in the number of fish

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:03.490
that were caught here.

01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:05.950
And that increase in fishing
led, in the early '90s,

01:02:05.950 --> 01:02:09.910
to a catastrophic collapse
of that population.

01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:11.860
Similar things have
occurred, for example,

01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:14.110
in the sardine
fishery off the coast

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:17.820
of Monterey, and many
other populations.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:24.200
So, the question here is, how
can we understand these tipping

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:26.220
points in populations?

01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.120
And this is a case
where some of the ideas

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:30.020
we studied early in
the semester-- so,

01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:34.270
these cases of interactions--
can lead to sudden transitions.

01:02:34.270 --> 01:02:37.550
And for example, this
early example of a toggle

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:40.150
switch that we talked
about at the beginning--

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:42.350
so, this case where, if
you have interactions

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:46.710
within the population, it can
lead to alternative states.

01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:48.820
And it's the same
basic dynamic here.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.790
If you have interactions
within the population,

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:52.331
then you can get
alternative states--

01:02:52.331 --> 01:02:55.860
maybe healthy and dead,
or extinct, locally.

01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:58.320
So, you can imagine if you
have these alternative states

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.490
due to interactions
within the population,

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:02.895
and if you start out
in this healthy state,

01:03:02.895 --> 01:03:06.740
and you start pushing it, then
it's going to-- the feedback

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.700
loops there will
maintain a state

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:10.400
where it's alive, healthy.

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:12.150
And then all of a
sudden, when it's not

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:14.540
able to counteract this
deteriorating environment, all

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:16.289
of a sudden it's going
to switch and maybe

01:03:16.289 --> 01:03:19.430
collapse in this fishery.

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:21.490
So, these sorts
of ideas have been

01:03:21.490 --> 01:03:24.320
used to both try to understand
why it is that populations

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.290
might experience tipping points,
but also to get some guidance

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:30.970
about ways that we can
anticipate that these tipping

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:32.180
points are approaching?

01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.212
For example, in my group, we've
been excited about this idea

01:03:35.212 --> 01:03:37.499
that there are predictions
that the fluctuations

01:03:37.499 --> 01:03:39.040
of the population
should be different

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.410
when a population is approaching
one of these tipping points.

01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:42.868
And, at least in
the laboratory, we

01:03:42.868 --> 01:03:45.400
were actually able to measure
a change in the fluctuations

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:46.300
before a collapse.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.940
And this is saying that, in
principle, there are maybe

01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.860
universal signatures
of populations

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:56.660
and other complex systems before
one of these tipping points.

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:59.320
Now, in the last
lecture, we're going

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.630
to go maybe to the
largest scale to think

01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.940
about whole ecosystems.

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:08.740
And this is, by its nature,
I'd say, less experimental

01:04:08.740 --> 01:04:11.792
than the rest of the
semester in that,

01:04:11.792 --> 01:04:14.450
in this case, we're trying
to understand questions like,

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:17.490
what is it that determines the
abundance of different tree

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.490
species on Barro
Colorado Island?

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:22.270
So, it's an island in
Panama where they go

01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:25.519
and they just count every
tree within some region.

01:04:25.519 --> 01:04:27.810
They'd say, this is this
country, this is that country.

01:04:27.810 --> 01:04:29.890
They count thousands
and thousands of trees.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:32.040
The question there
is-- some species

01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:35.790
are more common than others.

01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:37.517
And we want to know why.

01:04:37.517 --> 01:04:38.850
It seems like a simple question.

01:04:38.850 --> 01:04:40.724
And the way that we
normally think about this

01:04:40.724 --> 01:04:43.140
is if it's more
common, then maybe it's

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.920
because it's better adapted
to that environment.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.679
And I think that, often,
that's the right answer.

01:04:48.679 --> 01:04:50.970
But there's been an interesting
movement within ecology

01:04:50.970 --> 01:04:54.700
recently where it's been pointed
out that many of the patterns

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.602
that people have observed in
terms of this relative species

01:04:57.602 --> 01:04:59.810
abundance-- how abundant
some species are as compared

01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:01.620
to others-- that many
of those patterns

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:04.740
can actually be explained
by a purely neutral model.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:05.370
I.e.

01:05:05.370 --> 01:05:08.410
This is a model in which you
assume that all of the species

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:09.990
are the same.

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.934
So, this tree is just
the same as that tree

01:05:11.934 --> 01:05:14.100
in terms of-- no tree is
better than any other tree.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.270
But just because of the
stochastic dynamics,

01:05:16.270 --> 01:05:18.640
random birth death
processes, you

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.510
can recover patterns that look
an awful lot like the patterns

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.260
are observed in nature.

01:05:24.260 --> 01:05:26.865
So, you can interpret
this is in multiple ways.

01:05:26.865 --> 01:05:28.740
But, of course, one way
that we should always

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.114
be thinking about
these things is

01:05:30.114 --> 01:05:33.420
that if you observe-- we want
to collect quantitative data.

01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:34.355
We should do that.

01:05:34.355 --> 01:05:36.480
But there's always a
temptation that if you collect

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.229
quantitative data, and
then you write down

01:05:38.229 --> 01:05:40.920
a model that is
consistent with that data,

01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.570
we often take that
as strong evidence

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:45.970
that the assumptions of
our model are correct.

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:48.460
Even though we know
that's not the way we're

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:50.770
supposed to do science,
somehow it's just really easy

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:51.810
to fall into this trap.

01:05:51.810 --> 01:05:55.060
And I think that this particular
example of this neutral theory

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:57.830
of ecology is a very
concrete example of how

01:05:57.830 --> 01:06:01.320
different models that make
wildly different assumptions

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.600
about the underlying
dynamics-- they

01:06:03.600 --> 01:06:06.100
can all look the
same once you look

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.620
at a particular kind of pattern.

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:12.270
And so, it's a nice
cautionary tale saying,

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:15.670
what is it that you can learn
about the dynamics of a system

01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:20.240
or of a process based on a
particular kind of data set.

01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:25.480
And then, after this, we will
just have that final exam.

01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:30.600
That's going to be that
week of 15 to 19, I believe.

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:35.150
So, once again, do not book
your tickets before then.

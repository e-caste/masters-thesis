00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.730
PROFESSOR: Our topics part of
the course by revisiting

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.430
another important topic that--

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.750
one of the most important topics
in economics which is

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.460
where does capital come from.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.950
This is a topic that is
essential in economics.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.120
It's also really central, the
basis, for what is in finance.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.860
So a lot of what we'll
do today is really--

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.100
if you want to learn more about
it you take more in

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.960
economics but also more
courses in Course 15.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.900
So, basically, we spent a lot of
time this semester talking

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.350
about one input to
the production

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.780
function which is labor.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.560
We talked about labor supply,
labor demand, monopsony

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.680
models, et cetera.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.280
We haven't talked much about
the other input into the

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.410
production function
which is capital.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.820
Now, partly, that's because
that's a more awkward concept.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.640
It's clear what labor is.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.900
Labor is the workers working
in the production process.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.820
Capital's a little bit harder
because capital's sort of

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.600
everything else-- the machine,
the land, the buildings, other

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.480
physical inputs.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.870
And we know where labor
comes from.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.780
Labor comes from our working.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.190
But it's less clear where
capital comes from in some

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.330
aggregate concept.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.900
So, basically, the key thing is
that all forms of capital

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.880
have a common feature.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.430
All forms of capital have a
common feature which is what

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.760
capital represents is a
diversion of current

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.870
consumption towards future
production and consumption.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.560
So capital's about diverting
current consumption towards

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.370
future production
and consumption.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.580
So the original concept of
capital came from farming

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.820
where the notion was that
farmers every year would take

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.300
some of their grain, and, rather
than eating it, they'd

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.190
put it aside to become seed to
plant for the next year.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.530
That was their capital.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.620
And so they diverted their
consumption this year which

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
was eating the grain they grew
to produce future consumption

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.730
through planting those
seeds and creating

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.070
consumption for next year.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.390
So, basically, in a modern
economy the idea is the same.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.040
And so when we think about
capital, what I want you to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.710
think about is I want you to
think about, basically, the

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.530
capital as money.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.160
Think of the capital in the
production function as the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.470
money that we invest in all
these other things that aren't

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.650
labor-- that we invest in
machines, and we invest in

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.020
buildings, and we
invest in land.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.120
So we want to think about
capital not as physical

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.360
capital but as financial
capital.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.820
That's the way to be thinking
about that one aggregate

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.160
letter k is this financial
capital.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.720
It's the money that's invested
in producing goods, in

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.940
building machines, and
building buildings,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.510
and stuff like that.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:09.550
OK?

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.550
Now, basically, where do
firms get that money?

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.410
So you're a firm.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.960
You want to build a building
or new machine or

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.620
something like that.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.440
Where do firms get that money?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.500
They get that money in
capital markets.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.585
Capital markets are basically
pools of money that firms draw

00:03:27.585 --> 00:03:31.300
on to invest and
create capital.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.900
So a capital market--

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.410
literally think of it as a pool
of money that's out there

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.930
that firms can tap into if they
want to build a building

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.930
or build a machine
or buy some land.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.890
They tap into capital markets
to make those investments.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.870
So while capital physically
represents lots of different

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.660
things, financially it
represents one thing which is

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.790
the pool of money that firms tap
into to invest, to divert

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.930
current consumption to
future consumption.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:03.560
OK?

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.690
It's the pool of money firms
tap into to invest. That's

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.060
what we mean by capital.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.170
By capital market we represent
that pool of money.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.370
So think of capital as financial
capital, and think

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.740
of where you get financial
capital in a capital market as

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.079
being that pool of money that
firms tap into to make

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.730
investments to divert
towards the future.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.420
Now, where does that supply
of money come from?

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.800
Where does that supply
of money come from?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.380
Well it comes from households'
decisions on how

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.070
much to save. OK?

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.340
So the pool of money in capital
markets, the pool of

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.520
money that firms draw on to
build capital, comes from

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.410
households' decisions
on how much to save.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.545
So now we see the tie to labor,
the other input in the

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:49.690
production function.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.940
Just as households' decisions on
how hard to work determines

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.750
the labor input into the
production function,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.170
households' decisions on how
much to save determines the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:04.045
capital input into the
production function.

00:05:04.045 --> 00:05:07.150
So just as my decision how much
to work determines how

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.450
much labor is available to
firms, my decision on how much

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.370
to save that's what fills
up this pool.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.860
OK?

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.970
So this pool of financial
capital is filled up by

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.550
household savings and then drawn
down by firms' demand

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.410
for investment.

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:24.970
And that's the way a capital
market works.

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.060
So, basically, if we think
about capital market

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.300
equilibrium--

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.750
if you go to Figure 21-1--

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.600
we have equilibrium in
capital markets.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.000
Now this is just like we talked
about-- this is the

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.860
other factor markets.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.320
Just like we talked about labor
markets and determining

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.430
what determines the wage rate
and the optimum amount of

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.530
labor hired, it's same
with capital markets.

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.950
You have some demand
for capital.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.550
That comes from firms' demand
for investment.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.740
Firms want new machines.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.530
They want new buildings.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.430
That's downward sloping because,
initially, there's

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.750
very high demand for capital.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.220
But there's a marginal
diminishing product.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.460
The more capital I have the
less valuable it is on the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.060
margin, the less you are
willing to pay for it.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.215
So there's a downward sloping
demand curve for capital and

00:06:15.215 --> 00:06:17.810
an upward sloping
supply curve.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.120
And the price, in this market,
is the interest rate.

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.460
What is the interest rate?

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.720
The interest rate is the rate
you have to pay households to

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.050
get them to lend you money.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.950
So the interest rate, i, is
the rate you have to pay

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:35.590
households to get them
to lend you money.

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:43.060
So if that interest rate is
very high, firms will not

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.610
demand much investment because
they'll have to pay a lot of

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.910
money to get the financial
capital to finance that

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.510
investment.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.000
But households will be delighted
to supply lots of

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.830
savings because they're
getting paid a

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.080
high price for it.

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.980
So, basically, the interest
rate serves as the

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.290
equilibrating price
in this market.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:06.020
Just as the wage serves as the
equilibrating price in the

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.270
labor market, the interest
rate serves as the

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.650
equilibrating price in
the capital market.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.060
As the interest rate rises,
folks want to save more,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.730
filling more money into
that pool of capital.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.870
And firms want to borrow less,
taking less money out of that

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.260
pool of capital.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:26.900
And when that supply and demand
is equilibrated, at

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.400
point e, is going to be where
the firm's drawing on the pool

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.660
at exactly the rate people are
putting money into the pool.

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.320
And that's going to be
the equilibrium.

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.910
OK, so we want to focus on--

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:42.440
for today's lecture and
next lecture as well--

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:46.180
is what determines the money
that goes into that pool.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.610
We know what determines the rate
at which firms want to

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:49.920
draw out of that pool.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.750
That's basically going to be
determined by the production

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:53.900
function and all the stuff
we learned in lectures on

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.430
production theory.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:58.310
You can get your optimal
demand for capital.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.060
It's going to be determined
by isocosts and isoquants.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.310
And you get some k star.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.730
But what's going to determine
what goes into that pool?

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.620
That's going to be households'
decisions to save. And

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.415
households' decisions to save,
we say, are determined by a

00:08:13.415 --> 00:08:15.950
process we call intertemporal
choice.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.110
Added some extra letters there--
intertemporal choice.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:29.110
Intertemporal choice--

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.960
which is basically, instead
of thinking about someone

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.690
choosing between apples and
bananas, we think of them

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.890
choosing between consumption
today

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.150
and consumption tomorrow.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.040
So think of different periods
like different goods.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.920
And I'm choosing between
consumption today and

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.680
consumption tomorrow.

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.720
That's my intertemporal
choice--

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:56.800
the rate at which I choose to
trade off consumption in

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.240
different periods.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.710
So for example, I'll illustrate
how this works.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.760
Let's say that I'm deciding
whether to just tell MIT,

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.410
"Look, I don't want
to work next year.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.600
I want to stay home and
take care of my kids.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.730
You're not going to pay me.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:15.150
I'm taking an unpaid leave for
a year." Something professors

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.590
can do with enough advance
warning to their

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:18.750
chairman and such.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.300
So I'm going to take an unpaid
leave next year.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.550
I'm thinking about doing that.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.650
And now I have to
say, OK, fine.

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.800
Next year I'm going to take this
unpaid leave so I have to

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.850
decide how to allocate my--
and then I'm going to come

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.840
back and life will be
the same thereafter.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.720
So it's just about next year I'm
going to take this unpaid

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.880
leave. I have to decide how to
allocate my consumption across

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.530
this year while I'm working and
next year while I'm taking

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.360
an unpaid leave.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.930
And let's say my salary
is $80,000 a year.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.520
So one thing I could do is I can
consume all $80,000 this

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.870
year and consume nothing
next year.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.340
That would not be a very
satisfactory outcome as I die.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:05.550
That's obviously not going to
be a satisfactory outcome.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.640
But what's the alternative?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.260
MIT's paying me this year,
and they're not

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:11.480
paying me next year.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.750
What's the alternative?

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:17.380
Well, the alternative is I can
save. And by saving, what we

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.870
mean is I can loan some of the
money that I make out to firms

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:26.140
to invest in their physical
capital in return for which

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.320
they'll give me interest. And
next year I can live on the

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:35.460
interest I've earned from
making that loan.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:40.800
Now, I don't literally go to
Genzyme and Microsoft and

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.480
Apple and say I want to
loan you money and

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.720
negotiate with them.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.350
That obviously would
be impossible.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:49.720
What I do is I implicitly loan
to firms through drawing on

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:53.870
various aspects of the
capital market.

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:57.510
So does anyone know, how can I
implicitly loan to a firm?

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.190
Let's say I want to--

00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.460
Yeah?

00:10:58.460 --> 00:10:59.560
AUDIENCE: Banks.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:10:59.960
PROFESSOR: Banks.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.940
So explain what you mean.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.640
AUDIENCE: You deposit
money in a savings

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:04.820
account for the bank.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:08.170
The bank pays you some interest
rate so that it can

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.054
use your money to loan to bigger
companies that want to

00:11:12.054 --> 00:11:13.010
take money out of the bank.

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.910
And they, in return, get money
from the other companies by

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.417
the companies paying
some interest on

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:20.080
what they took out.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.620
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.260
We call banks financial
intermediaries.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:26.140
What that means is they
basically are the folks who

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:29.060
can get a hold of firms
and make those loans.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.640
So, in other words, I don't
loan directly to Genzyme.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:34.920
I loan to the bank--

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.850
Citizens Bank, my bank,
and Citizens

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.650
Bank loans to Genzyme.

00:11:38.650 --> 00:11:43.240
Citizens Bank pays me an
interest rate on my savings--

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:45.615
now close to zero, we'll come
to that-- but basically pays

00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:48.110
me some interest rate.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.500
Genzyme pays them an interest
rate to borrow money, higher

00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.240
than what they're paying
me, and the

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.210
difference is bank profit.

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:01.970
So, basically, one way I can
loan money is I can put in the

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.080
bank and get paid interest. we
don't think about putting in

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.010
the bank as a loan, but that's
basically what you're doing.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.640
You're loaning it to the bank.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:09.600
And they're paying you interest

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.490
rate, i for that loan.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.850
What else can you do?

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.580
How else can you--

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:13.915
Yeah?

00:12:13.915 --> 00:12:15.730
AUDIENCE: You can
purchase stocks.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.200
PROFESSOR: You could
purchase stocks.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.970
So, in other words, what I could
do is I could directly

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.990
go to a public company, and I
could take some of my $80,000

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:25.730
and buy stock in that company.

00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.690
There I'm essentially directly
loaning to them.

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:29.590
I'm directly giving
them money.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.620
Now, it's not a loan that's paid
back like a bank loan.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:36.280
It's loan that's paid back
hopefully with my stock

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.775
becoming more valuable
or with a dividend.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:42.770
So how can I loan?

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:43.940
One is I can invest--

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.480
I could put it in the bank.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.100
The other is I can buy stock.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.610
I can put it in the bank, and
the bank pays me interest. I

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:56.150
could buy stock, and that stock
pays off in two ways.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:13:00.500
One is many companies pay what
we call a dividend, what is

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.570
called the dividend, which is
a quarterly payment that

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:07.570
companies make to their
shareholders.

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.790
So if I invest in a company
that pays a dividend, then

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.200
I'll be getting a quarterly
check from that company that's

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.020
a portion of my investment.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.450
The other is what we call a
capital gain which is the

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.790
stock could go up in value.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.600
So next year, if the stock goes
up, if the stock market

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.420
moves steadily-- it doesn't,
it jumps up and down, we'll

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.270
come to that--

00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.480
but if it went steadily up I
could just sell some of that

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.050
stock next year and
have extra money.

00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:35.070
So that's the other thing I
could do with my $80,000.

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:37.670
I could loan to a company
by buying their stock.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:38.890
How else can I loan
to a company?

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.645
Yeah?

00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:42.615
AUDIENCE: I don't know exactly
what the difference is, but

00:13:42.615 --> 00:13:44.595
couldn't you also invest
your money in a

00:13:44.595 --> 00:13:45.100
mutual fund or something?

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.100
PROFESSOR: A mutual fund--
that's a good point.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.120
That would be loaning--

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.640
a mutual fund is essentially
loaning money to an aggregate

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.190
collection of companies.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.500
So there are very different
ways I can do stock.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.190
I can do a mutual fund, I can
buy individual stocks.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.560
There's lots of different
ways, but those are all

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:03.830
different ways to buy stock.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:04.150
Yeah?

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.470
AUDIENCE: You could buy bonds.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.640
PROFESSOR: You could
buy bonds.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.070
You could buy company bonds
which is I literally loan

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:09.200
directly to the company.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.090
Stocks aren't really a loan.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.530
I'm literally buying an
ownership share in the

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.900
company, and they're
paying me back.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.722
I could buy corporate bonds.

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:22.630
I could buy corporate bonds, and
the way those work is it's

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:25.310
literally cutting out
the middleman.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.310
I don't loan to Citizens Bank,
and they loan to the company.

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.950
I just loan to the company,
and they pay me back.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.050
That's a corporate bond.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.610
I can also buy, by the
way, I can also buy

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.360
a government bond.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.360
You may know the government's
running more than a trillion

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.620
dollar deficit right now.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.230
Somebody's got to
finance that.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.050
So you can loan to the
government and get paid back

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.500
by the government.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.880
OK, let's put the government
aside for a minute.

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.940
Let's focus where we just--

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.710
we haven't really
had a government

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.490
sector in our models.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.550
We're where it's just you
and the companies.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.220
So let's leave the government
channel aside.

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.640
But the other thing I can do
with my money is I can loan it

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.760
through bonds.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.780
The point is that $80,000--

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:01.800
yeah, I'm sorry.

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.167
AUDIENCE: With stocks, if I
were to buy a stock from a

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:06.937
company, wouldn't it be
primarily and usually through

00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:09.000
the secondary market?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.880
I wouldn't be giving any
money to the company.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.480
I'd just be giving money to
the previous stockholder.

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:15.320
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.560
It basically depends on whether
the marginal stock

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.120
comes from a new issuance as
stock by the company or

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.730
through stock that's already
floating around

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.010
the secondary market.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:23.880
That's a good point.

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:26.540
So in some sense the--

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.650
likewise with bonds.

00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:29.370
A lot of bonds are traded
in a secondary market.

00:15:29.370 --> 00:15:31.270
So I'm thinking about a simple
model where basically new

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:33.270
stock gets issued by the
company, I buy it.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.470
More technically you're right.

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.010
It's just trading among people,
but that sort of makes

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:38.670
things complicated.

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.630
Let's put that aside for now.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.480
So, basically, the point
is is my $80,000--

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.720
there's lots of things
I can do with it.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.520
All of them yield
me some rate--

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.240
the key point is all of them
have the feature that I'm

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.890
diverting today's consumption
for tomorrow's consumption.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:00.980
I'm taking some of my money
and, rather than eating it

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:05.020
this year when I'm working,
I'm loaning it out in some

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.550
way, shape, or form and getting
payback in next year

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.800
when I'm not working.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.090
And we can summarize.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.610
Now this is a very complicated
set of mechanisms, not to

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:18.190
mention the secondary
market issues.

00:16:18.190 --> 00:16:23.060
And this is basically a
semester of 15.401.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.280
This is basically a semester
of finance theory.

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.260
But basically what we're going
to do is compress this all

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.250
down and say that I get some
interest rate on my money.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:35.270
However I do it, let's just say
that somehow I divert my

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:37.790
money through one of these
mechanisms, and it yields some

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.450
effective interest rate, i.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.530
And you can know behind that
there's lots of ways I can get

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.140
that interest. But for now just
simplify it down and say

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.540
the main thing is I'm diverting
my consumption now,

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.800
and it's yielding some interest
earnings on that

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.230
diverted consumption, i.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:59.340
So what that means is that for
every dollar I divert, I get 1

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.350
plus i dollars the next year.

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:05.109
So for every dollar of
consumption I divert, in one

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.030
of these forms, I get 1 plus
i dollars next year.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.319
So, basically, I could
literally--

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.040
if I wanted to-- let's say the
interest rate was 10%, just

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.589
for example.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:21.990
Now what that means is instead
of consuming $80,000 this year

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:24.740
and nothing next year, I could
consume nothing this year and

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.550
$88,000 next year.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.570
Obviously, that's not very
satisfactory either.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.520
So how do we think about that?

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.510
We think about that in
Figure 21-2 shows--

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.060
now this is a complicated
diagram we gotta

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.540
use to figure 21-2--

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:44.280
this shows the intertemporal
choice model, intertemporal

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.520
substitution we also call it.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.430
So the deal is that now instead
of the x-axis being

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:51.630
pizza and the y-axis being
movies or all the other wacky

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.930
things we've done, now the
x-axis is first period

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:55.940
consumption.

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.610
The y-axis is second
period consumption.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:17:58.620
You might say what's a period?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.550
Well a period's whatever I want
it to be-- a day, a year,

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.050
10 years, whatever.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.890
Sometimes I'll say a year.

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:03.930
Sometimes I'll say a period,
but the point

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:04.880
is it doesn't matter.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.150
It's about the trade-off.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:10.400
So in my example, c1 is
consumption this year.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.620
c2's consumption next year.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:18.290
And my trade-off is I can
consume $80,000 this year, or,

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:25.810
given the interest rate, I can
consume $88,000 next year.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:28.150
Now the trade-off-- that's
a typo, by the way.

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:30.350
That should be minus 1.1.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.530
OK?

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.230
This is a 10% interest rate.

00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:38.900
The key point is the trade-off
is that, basically, I can

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:42.230
trade off for every dollar I
don't consume this year, I

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.820
consume 1 plus i--

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.830
1 plus r there, should
be 1 plus i dollars--

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.460
next year.

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:53.940
We use r and i interchangeably
for the interest rate, so 1

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.710
plus i, 1 plus r dollars
next year.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:02.420
So, basically, what does the
interest rate represent?

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:03.370
This is important.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:08.160
The wage rate I defined as
the price of leisure.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.260
Remember what the
wage rate was?

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:17.420
It was the price of leisure,
that basically by working I

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.360
forgoed the ability to--

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.510
I'm sorry, by taking leisure
I forgoed the ability to

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.270
earn a wage, w.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.645
So, literally, that was a price
of sitting around on the

00:19:27.645 --> 00:19:29.740
couch was the wage, w,
I could've earned.

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:33.000
Likewise, the interest rate is
the price of first period

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.440
consumption.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.900
By consuming today, I'm forgoing
the fact that I

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:40.440
could've earned the interest on
that money had I consumed

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.060
it tomorrow or next year.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.200
So the interest rate is the
price of first period

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:50.570
consumption, just as the wage
is the price of leisure.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:51.050
Yeah?

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.445
AUDIENCE: You said before
that r and i are used

00:19:53.445 --> 00:19:59.672
interchangeably for interest.
Does that play into the cost

00:19:59.672 --> 00:20:01.826
function at all?

00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:05.358
Is the cost for capital going
to be the interest rate?

00:20:05.358 --> 00:20:07.080
PROFESSOR: I'm going
to come to that.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:12.300
That's exactly what I'll talk
about next lecture.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.890
So, basically, this is the key
thing, but the key thing to

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.580
understand intertemporal
choice-- and the other

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.540
important point to understand on
why it's a bit harder than

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.070
labor is there's an extra--

00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.950
well it's not harder.

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:21.500
It's the same thing.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.940
Remember, we said we don't model
bads in this course.

00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:25.330
We model goods.

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.000
So we're modeling your choice
of how hard to work.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.280
We model the trade-off between
consumption and leisure.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.560
And then we said define labor
as the total amount of hours

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:33.750
available minus leisure.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:34.690
Same thing here.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.510
We don't model savings.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.450
That's a bad.

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:39.310
Now you might not think
[? some of these ?]

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:41.410
things are good, but
savings really by

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:43.360
itself is not a good.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:44.700
Unless you're Scrooge McDuck--

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.340
does anyone know who
Scrooge McDuck is?

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:48.690
Wow, that hurts.

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:50.546
OK, he was this old cartoon
character when I was a kid who

00:20:50.546 --> 00:20:51.710
used to, like, fill a
swimming pool with

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.490
money and swim in it.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:55.940
Basically, unless you're like
that, the savings itself does

00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:56.770
not give you utility.

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.140
We don't have savings entering
utility functions.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.460
We have consumption entering
utility functions.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.810
Savings is a bad.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:05.350
Savings is the mean by which
you translate consumption

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.570
period one into consumption
period two.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.800
But from the effect of today
you wish you didn't have to

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.910
save. You just do it because
you want to make

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:12.660
sure you eat tomorrow.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.560
So we model the good.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.040
The good is consumption in
period one, and savings is the

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.900
difference between income and
consumption in period one.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.600
So we don't model savings.

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.550
We define savings
as y minus c1.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:31.570
We model c1, and define
savings as y minus c1.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.040
You can see that there
in the diagram.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.310
Now what happens when the
interest rate changes?

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:42.580
Let's go to Figure 21-3.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.550
What happens when the interest
rate changes?

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.670
Actually, go to 21-4.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:45.960
OK?

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:46.680
Skip 21-3.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.990
Got to 21-4.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.190
What happens when the interest
rate changes?

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:54.850
So, initially, we're at a point
like a and then the

00:21:54.850 --> 00:22:00.760
interest rate goes
up from r to r2.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.960
The interest rate goes up.

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.260
Now what does that do?

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.290
Well, graphically, it steepens
the budget constraint.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:13.120
What that means is it's raised
the opportunity cost of first

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.470
period consumption.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.550
First period consumption is now
effectively more expensive

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:22.040
because I'm forgoing a better
savings rate by eating today.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.190
The more of my $80,000 I consume
today, the less I get

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:26.370
to save for tomorrow.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:28.390
And that's now a better deal to
save for tomorrow because

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.720
I'm getting a higher interest
rate on that.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.730
So what does that do?

00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:36.380
Well that has two effects.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:38.640
Just like a change in the wage
rate has two effects-- a

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.920
substitution effect and
an income effect.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:46.650
The substitution effect, which
we can unambiguously sign, is

00:22:46.650 --> 00:22:50.760
the fact that now first period
consumption's gotten more

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.600
expensive, so we
do less of it.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.570
Substitution effects are always
price goes up, you do

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.860
less of the activity.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.530
The substitution effect is first
period consumption's

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.180
gotten more expensive, there'll
be less of it.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.510
Now here, once again, don't
slip into thinking about

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:04.200
savings yet.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.720
You'll really get yourself
in trouble, and

00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.170
it's a natural tendency.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.000
Model consumption that makes
savings a residual.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.880
So the activity we're modeling
here is first period

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.630
consumption.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.810
The price of first period
consumption's gone up, so you

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:15.800
do less of it.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.860
That's the substitution
effect.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.670
The income effect is
you're now richer.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.620
And you might say what do
you mean I'm richer?

00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:26.860
I still have the same
$80,000 in income.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.250
But any given dollar of savings
yields more income in

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.920
the second period.

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.860
So, overall, you're richer.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:38.500
If you take the perspective of
saying I have two periods in

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.910
this model-- first and
second period.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:42.920
Any given level of savings
makes me richer

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.490
in the second period.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.470
That means I'm richer.

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.220
If I'm richer, I consume more of
everything including first

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:50.680
period consumption.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.140
So first period consumption
goes up

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.370
from the income effect.

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.450
I find this confusing.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:56.440
I don't know if you guys do, but
once again-- run through

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.520
this again.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.840
I'm richer because for any given
amount of savings I now

00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:03.770
have a total larger sum of
money over both periods.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.770
When I'm richer I consume
more of everything.

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:09.060
One of the things that I consume
more of is first

00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:10.070
period consumption.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:11.620
So, actually, first period
consumption goes

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:12.870
up, and I save less.

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:15.160
It's sort of bizarre.

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.500
Because I'm getting
more return to my

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:19.480
savings I save less.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:21.090
Here is the way I like
to think of the

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:24.080
intuition to make it easier.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.920
The way I like to think of the
intuition is imagine that you

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.510
have a goal for saving--
something I call a target

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.620
savings level.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.280
Imagine you said, look.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.840
Imagine you said that I really
want to make sure that I have

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:41.950
certain level of savings
to live on next year.

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:45.450
Well if the interest rate goes
up, I can save less to get to

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.030
that target.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.350
Right?

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.930
If I have a target, c2, and the
interest rate is higher I

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:54.490
can consume more c1 and still
hit my target of c2.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:56.150
So that's the income effect.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:58.920
I can effectively consume more
c1 because I'm made richer

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.890
because any given level of
savings allows me to consume

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.270
more the next period.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.450
Now the target's an extreme
case, but I find it a useful

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.240
intuition for thinking about
what's going on.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.190
And that's the income effect.

00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:14.240
Now, obviously, as with
anything, this is ambiguous.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.810
If you go to Figure 21-3 now
here's a case where the income

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.070
effect dominates.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.360
Well, actually, go
back to 21-4.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.710
Let's finish this example.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.280
So here with the substitution
effect dominating, when the

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.570
interest rate goes up I consume
less in period one

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:30.000
which means I save more.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.220
And that was prior intuition.

00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:32.890
A higher interest rate
means you save more.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:35.270
But we'll work through the
mechanics of how we get there.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:37.260
And the reason the mechanics
is important is because of

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.620
Figure 21-3.

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:45.950
Which as in 21-3, the interest
rate goes up, but I save less.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:50.110
The interest rate goes up, but
I consume more in period one

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.620
and therefore save less.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.270
And that's consistent with
this target notion.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:57.520
That basically I'm so--

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.830
All I care about-- let's say
in the limit if all I care

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.650
about in the limit is exactly
what I consume the second

00:26:02.650 --> 00:26:06.590
period, then, basically, my
period one's consumption will

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:09.470
definitely go up from a raise in
the interest rate because,

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:11.480
basically, I'm saying, look, all
I care about is what I get

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:11.950
in the second period.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:14.390
Now I can save less and
get to that target.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.410
So my consumption first
period goes up.

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:19.580
The income effect dominates.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:21.800
So the bottom line is, just
like with labor supply, we

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.350
can't tell.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.900
Unlike with goods where it's
rare to see a Giffen good,

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.530
here we honestly don't know
whether a raise in the

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.870
interest rates will raise
savings or lower savings.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.630
It all depends on the
strength of the

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.880
substitution and income effects.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:40.120
Let me actually say one of the
most disturbing things in

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.480
empirical economics is we
actually do have no idea.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.830
Literally, there's no convincing
study out there

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:48.900
which even tells us which way
the effect of interest rates

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.890
goes on savings.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.380
We think probably the
substitution effect dominates,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.490
but it's been very
hard to find a

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.090
convincing estimate of that.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:57.000
So it's a little bit disturbing

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.370
for empirical economics.

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.970
We'll typically assume it
dominates, but don't

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:03.660
necessarily assume that
in the real world.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.700
OK, questions about that--

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.380
intertemporal choice
framework?

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.120
OK, now, with that in mind,
let's now talk about how

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.400
capital markets work.

00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:19.600
How do capital markets work?

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:22.050
And the key concept for thinking
about capital markets

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:24.560
is the concept of
present value.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.480
And the concept of the present
value is simple.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.360
It's that $1 tomorrow is worth
less than $1 today.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.660
$1 tomorrow is worth
less than $1 today.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:43.880
And why is that?

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.660
It's because if I had the
dollar today, I could've

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:49.670
invested it in something
productive and had 1 plus i

00:27:49.670 --> 00:27:52.190
dollars tomorrow.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.230
So if you give me a dollar today
I could have 1 plus i

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.010
dollars tomorrow.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.740
If you give it to me tomorrow,
I just have $1.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.610
So by definition, $1 today is
worth more because I have the

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:02.920
opportunity to save it.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.150
Whereas a $1 tomorrow
I don't have the

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:04.780
opportunity to save it.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:07.770
It's too late.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:12.510
So the key point is you can't
add up dollars that you

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:16.160
receive in different periods.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:17.920
So, in other words,
if I said to you--

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.430
if this intertemporal choice
graph was back pizzas and

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:25.570
movies, and I said you have
nine pizza plus movies.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:26.490
You have a total of nine.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:28.280
You'd be like, what the
hell does that mean?

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.960
It matters if it's nine pizzas
and zero movies or five movies

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.580
and four pizzas?

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.370
I don't know what that means.

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:33.910
Those are different things.

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.800
You can't add them up.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:37.530
You can't just say
I have nine.

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.360
Well consumption over time--
it's the same thing.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.890
You can't just add up your
consumption tomorrow and

00:28:43.890 --> 00:28:46.840
consumption today or a dollar
tomorrow and a dollar today.

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:50.200
They're different things.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:54.090
And so you have to account for
the fact that $1 tomorrow is

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.360
worth less than $1 today in
trying to add them up.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:02.445
And the way we do that is we
actually do it through the

00:29:02.445 --> 00:29:03.620
concept of present value.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:07.290
And the idea of present value
is to translate all future

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.550
dollars into today's dollars.

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.920
Translate all future dollars
into today's dollars

00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.550
recognizing the fact they're
less valuable in the future.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:21.540
So the concept of present value
is the concept of any

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:26.500
future payment's value from
the perspective of today.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.400
And you should know that any
future payment will be worth

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.050
less than a payment today.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:32.820
How much less-- that's what
present value tells you.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:38.050
How much is a future payment
worth in today's terms?

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:43.010
So suppose that the interest
rate is 10%.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:47.220
Suppose the interest rate
is 10%, and you want to

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:50.300
have $100 next year.

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.170
So you know next year there's
something you want to buy, and

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:56.750
you have to decide how much do
I have to save today to have

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:02.970
$100 in period two.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.490
How much do I have to
save today to have

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:07.000
$100 in period two?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.290
Well if you put in an amount,
PV, into the bank--

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:15.970
you put PV into the bank, then
you know next year you're

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.070
going to have-- if you put in
PV in period one, next year

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:25.210
you're going to have
PV times 1 plus i.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.270
You're going to have your PV
plus all the interest you

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:34.730
earned on it, or in our
example, PV times 1.1.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.870
So what that says is that,
basically, you have to put in

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:43.500
100 over 1.1 into the
bank today, or

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:48.300
90.9 dollars, $90.90.

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:53.810
If you put $90.90 in the bank
today, you will have $100

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.730
tomorrow or $100 next year--
whenever the periodicity of

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.940
the interest rate.

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:05.280
So, basically, more generally,
the present value of any

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:12.570
stream of payments is equal to
that stream's future value--

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:13.695
I'm going to write
it over here.

00:31:13.695 --> 00:31:15.570
It's bigger.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.750
The present value of any stream
of payments is that

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:22.400
stream's future value over 1
plus the interest rate to the

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.000
t, where t is the year in
which you get the money.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.800
So any future money you get in
year t is worth that amount

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.806
you get over 1 plus the interest
rate to the t.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.590
So, basically, the point
is you have to weigt.

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:46.300
Any money you're going to get,
you to weight by how far into

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:49.540
the future it is, just like
if you're adding up these

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:50.380
different goods.

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.950
So, essentially, this is kind
of like saying let's add a

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:57.770
converter machine which can
convert pizza into movies.

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:00.425
Then I could say well I'll
just take pizza, put it

00:32:00.425 --> 00:32:01.760
through the converter machine,
and that'll tell me how many

00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.130
movies I have. That's
what a utility

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.590
function basically does.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.160
This we're saying the
interest rate is

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:09.100
the converter function.

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.490
This present value formula is
the converter function by

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.080
which we convert two goods
that are different

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.350
into the same good.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.730
You convert them through
this formula.

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:24.800
So, basically, suppose that you
say to me, "Look, loan me

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.290
$30, and I'll pay you back $10
a year each of the next three

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:33.450
years." Well I should
say, "Wait a second.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.500
What's the value of that to me?"
Well the present value of

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.320
those repayments is I'm going
to have $10 in one year, so

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:42.470
that's $10 over 1 plus i.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:45.360
Let's say the interest
rate's 10% again.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:46.145
Next year I got $10.

00:32:46.145 --> 00:32:48.510
That's worth 10 over 1 plus 1.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.260
The year after, you're going
to give me 10 more dollars,

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.610
but that's worth 10 over 1 plus
1 squared because that's

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:54.700
in two years.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.730
If I had that money today, I
could've invested it, earned

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:00.600
10% and then 10% on that.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.770
And, likewise, the money you
give me in the third year is

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.180
worth 10 over 1.1 cubed.

00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.260
If you'd given me that money
today, I could've invested it

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.930
and and earned interest
three times on it.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.770
So the bottom line is
your repayments

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:18.110
are only worth $24.87.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.030
So I've just given you $30 today
in return for a stream

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:24.740
of payments that's only
worth $24.87 today.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.980
I've lost money from that loan
because I gave you the money

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.460
today, and you're paying me back
in the future when the

00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:31.780
money's worth less.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.750
So, basically, the general
formula we have is that the

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:41.830
present value of any stream of
future payments is that the

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:45.040
amount of the future payment--
let's call it f for any fixed

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.570
stream of future payments, $10
forever or $15 forever--

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:56.550
fixed stream of that amount, f,
times 1 over 1 plus i, plus

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:03.790
1 over 1 plus i squared, plus
da da da da, plus 1 over 1

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:06.850
plus i to the t.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:09.949
So if you're going to pay me a
fixed amount, f, for t years,

00:34:09.949 --> 00:34:13.210
here what it's worth
to me today.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:15.770
You pay me a fixed amount, f,
for t years, it's worth this

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:17.830
much to me today.

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.680
I'm accounting for how far
off in the future it is.

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:25.989
Now one important trick we're
going to do now for the rest

00:34:25.989 --> 00:34:28.710
of the semester is we're going
to take the trick of saying

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.540
this is actually--

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.210
well this is a messy formula.

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:33.820
It's actually a rather easy
formula to write down if the

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.810
future stream of payments is
infinite, if we have what we

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:40.150
call a perpetuity.

00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:41.400
If we have what we call
a perpetuity.

00:34:45.630 --> 00:34:48.010
A perpetuity is a future stream
of payments that goes

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:52.610
on forever or long enough that
we'd consider it forever.

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:55.199
Fifty years is probably
good enough.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:58.990
If you have a perpetuity,
then this formula

00:34:58.990 --> 00:35:02.940
can be reduced to--

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.140
the present value of any
perpetuity is the amount of

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:09.720
that perpetuity over
the interest rate.

00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.150
It's just taking the infinite
sum of that product.

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:13.480
They're just taking
the infinite sum.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.240
Those mathematically inclined
will know this already.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.920
But it's just taking the
infinite sum here, you can get

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.390
this formula.

00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:22.980
So any perpetuity, if you're
getting a payment forever, the

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:25.660
value of that payment today-- so
if I said I'll give you $10

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.295
forever and the interest rate's
going to be 10% then

00:35:28.295 --> 00:35:31.150
you'd say that's worth
$100 to me.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.630
If I'm going to give you $10
forever at a 10% interest

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:39.310
rate, then you'd say well that's
worth $9.90 the next

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:41.320
year and $8 something the
next year, et cetera.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.640
And if I add all those up, I get
approximately the amount

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:48.270
of the payment over
the interest rate.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:58.490
So, basically, that is what
determines present value.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:02.530
Now we can flip this around and
we could say, OK, well, if

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:05.560
that's present value what
determines future value?

00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:10.510
Well the future value of getting
a payment today--

00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:13.030
So that's the present value of
getting payments tomorrow.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:17.120
The only other thing is what's
the future value?

00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:21.610
What's the future value of
getting a stream of payments

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.710
starting today?

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.390
So let's say, starting today,
I'm going to get $10.

00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.060
I'm going to get it for a
certain number of years.

00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:29.220
What's that going to be worth
at the end of the day given

00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.070
that I can save it
along the way.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:37.910
So, in other words, if you
give me $10 today--

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:42.920
if you give me $10 today, well
then in one year, next year, I

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:48.150
have $11 because I got to save
it at the interest rate.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.670
So if you give me $10 today,
next year I'll have $11.

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:57.870
Now let's say that I
then keep it in the

00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.460
bank for another year.

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:07.490
Well the next year, it's worth
10 times 1 plus i squared, so

00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:13.250
10 times 1.1 squared, 10
times 1.1 squared, or

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:20.660
$12.10 and so on.

00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:27.700
So, basically, the point is that
at the end of each year I

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.280
earn the interest on my original
$10, plus I earn the

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.680
interest on the interest I
earned the previous periods.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:38.750
So in the long run, at the end
of t years, which of the

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:43.140
future value, is the amount
invested, f, times 1

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.110
plus i to the t.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.600
That's your future value.

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.970
So if you invest a given amount
of money today for t

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:54.570
years, you end up
with that much.

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.620
If you invest a given amount,
f, today you end

00:37:56.620 --> 00:37:57.170
up with that much--

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:00.810
And the key point, the key
insight, is the miracle of

00:38:00.810 --> 00:38:03.140
compounding.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.130
The miracle of compounding is
the point that you earn

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:13.580
interest on your interest. And
what this means is the earlier

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:18.110
you save, the more you'll
have later on.

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.420
So there's an example in the
book which is very important.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:23.980
So it's actually thinking
about--

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.540
let's think for a minute
about retirement.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:26.720
You might say this
is sort of crazy.

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.650
Maybe not crazy for an old guy
like me, but you're thinking

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:30.010
I'm just starting
on my career.

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.320
Why would I think about
retirement?

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:33.340
Here's why you want
to think about it.

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.070
Let's say, for example, that
you plan to work full time

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:40.640
from age 22 to age 70.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.990
You've got a great idea.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.290
Screw grad school.

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:44.900
You're going right to work.

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.250
You've got a great idea,
and you know you want

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:47.020
to retire at 70.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:53.640
So you plan to work full time
from age 22 to age 70.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:57.030
And let's say that you want to
save money for your retirement

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.030
because you're going
to retire at 70.

00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.840
You're going to live forever.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.140
You're a healthy young person.

00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.000
You think you're going to
live forever at 70.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.840
So you want to have money
around when you retire.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.230
And let's say that the
interest rate you

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.680
can save at is 7%.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:13.120
So you can save money for your
retirement at 7%, and that's

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:13.600
your choice.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.830
Now let's consider two different
savings plans.

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:21.640
Savings plan one is that I'm
going to save $3,000.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.960
You're going to save $3,000
right off the bat.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.390
And for the first 15 years
of your working life--

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:29.550
so from 22 to 37--

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.450
you're going to save $3,000.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:44.690
You're going to save $3,000 a
year savings for 15 years, and

00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:45.870
then nothing.

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.890
And then once you're 37 and
you've got to start worrying

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.770
about kids' college and
mortgage, you're not going to

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:51.150
save anything.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:53.355
So from 22 to 37, when you're
living high on the hog, you've

00:39:53.355 --> 00:39:56.440
got no obligations, you're going
to save. Once you're 37,

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.280
you've got a house, you've got
kids, you've got things that

00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.730
are expensive, you're not
going to save anymore.

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:01.600
So then you go to zero.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.400
Zero savings from age
37 to age 70.

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.590
That's a pretty bold plan.

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:12.720
You're just going to save 15
years then zero savings.

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.190
Well what do you get?

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:19.360
Well after 15 years, if you use
our future value formula,

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.410
if you save $3,000 every year,
you work out that you will

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:27.670
have $75,387 in the bank.

00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.010
So it's more than 45-- is not
just 3,000 times 15 because

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:33.300
you get the compounding.

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.760
It's not just 3,000 times 15.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.820
You actually get more than
that because you got the

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.980
compounding along the way.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.970
Then if you just let it sit
there in the bank-- you don't

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:42.500
do anything.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.300
No more active savings.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.670
You let it sit there.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:50.460
Then by the time you retire,
you have that $75,387 times

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:54.940
1.07 to the 33 because you
let that money sit

00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:57.960
there for 33 years.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.720
You let that money sit
there for 33 years.

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:08.330
That works out to be $703,010.

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.880
So by saving for 15 years-- all
you did was save $3,000

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.500
for 15 years, a fraction
of your career.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:20.730
And you retire with $703,000.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:23.630
Now we'll contrast that with
an alternative plan.

00:41:23.630 --> 00:41:27.490
My alternative plan is I'm going
to save nothing for the

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:31.460
first 15 years because I figure,
like, I'm young.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.020
I'm gonna party.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:32.900
I'm going to use
the money now.

00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:33.590
I'll save later.

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:35.490
I'm nowhere near retirement.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:36.740
Then I get to 37.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.560
I say, wait a second, I'm

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.690
starting to see more mortality.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:39.910
I better worry about
retirement.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.700
Then I start to save, and I save
for the next 33 years.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:51.270
So the new plan is zero per year
from age 22 to 37, and

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:56.980
then $3,000 a year
from 37 to 70.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.580
So it's a lot more savings.

00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.400
You're saving for more than
twice as long, more

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.180
than twice as long.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.650
What do you end up with?

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:13.760
You end up with $356,800--

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.050
half, just slightly more than
half, than what you end up

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:21.630
with the first plan, even though
you save for twice as

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:22.880
many years.

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.220
This is like the parents'
lecture why you should save.

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:33.620
The point is that saving early
lets you ride the wave of

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.090
compounding for many,
many years.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:39.520
Savings late does not
let you do that.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.370
And as a result, you end
up with less money.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.530
I take my kids to the science
museum, and at the science

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.960
museum they have these
little ramps.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.010
And you can drop a ball.

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:51.770
And one is flat then steep, and
one is steep then flat.

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:54.420
And the one that's steep then
flat always wins because

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.450
there's compounding in
acceleration the same way.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.430
The point is building up early
and then riding that velocity

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:05.610
going forward is a lot better
than starting late.

00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:08.070
Questions about that?

00:43:08.070 --> 00:43:10.640
So make sure when you get those
jobs, and they offer

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:12.245
you-- we'll talk next time about
savings incentives-- and

00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:15.230
they offer you those good 401K
packages, that you take them,

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.810
and don't say I'll worry
about that later.

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:20.580
Now, one last thing.

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.650
Last thing I want to cover is
that we've ignored, so far,

00:43:23.650 --> 00:43:25.920
the whole concept
of inflation.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.330
When I've talked about savings,
I've presumed that

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:29.660
you've saved the money and
it's worth something.

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:31.750
But who the hell knows
what $703,000 will

00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:36.180
be worth in 48 years?

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.450
What's that even going
to be worth?

00:43:37.450 --> 00:43:38.750
How do we even think
about that?

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:41.160
Well we have to account for the
fact that stuff's going to

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.880
be more expensive.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.880
So we have to account for
inflation in doing this.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.710
And the way we do this is by
recognizing that what we've

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:51.940
done so far is we've
talked about the

00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.950
nominal interest rate.

00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:56.635
By the nominal interest rate, I
meant the interest rate that

00:43:56.635 --> 00:43:59.620
you actually see posted
in the bank.

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:04.620
But what matters, ultimately
for your well-being, is the

00:44:04.620 --> 00:44:09.400
real interest rate which is
what your money can do in

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.010
terms of actually
buying goods.

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:18.390
So I should not care about how
much money I have next year.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:22.390
I should care about how many
goods I can buy next year.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:23.940
The money's just paper.

00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:26.530
What matters is what
I can get with it.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.760
That's what matters.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.700
So let's say, for example,
I want to use

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.190
all my money on Skittles.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.070
That's just what I want
to use my money on.

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:38.960
So let's say I have $100,
and I want to spend

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.230
that money on Skittles.

00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:43.530
And let's say Skittles
today are $1 a bag.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:52.500
And let's say the interest
rate, once again, is 10%.

00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:55.080
And let's say there's
no inflation.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.330
Inflation equals zero.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.930
So my choice is I can spend
$100 on Skittles

00:45:03.930 --> 00:45:06.020
today and get 100 bags.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.640
So I could have 100
bags today.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:15.050
Or I can save it, have
$110 tomorrow and

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:20.700
get 110 bags of Skittles.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:21.440
That's my choice.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.690
That's my trade-off.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.650
Now let's say there's
inflation.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:33.450
Let's say that prices are rising
at 10% a year, as well.

00:45:33.450 --> 00:45:35.910
So the prices are rising
10% a year, as well.

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:40.580
What that means is next year
Skittles cost $1.10 a bag.

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.150
So now what's my trade-off?

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:44.480
That means I could
have 100 bags

00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:47.940
today or 100 bags tomorrow.

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.650
I don't get any more
Skittles tomorrow.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.820
I get 10 more dollars,
but who cares?

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.230
Everything costs more.

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.930
If everything cost 10% more and
I get a 10% interest rate,

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:02.070
that interest rate is
effectively zero in terms of

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:03.200
what I can buy.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:07.410
The real interest rate
is the nominal

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:10.490
interest rate minus inflation.

00:46:13.070 --> 00:46:15.880
What I care about is
what I can buy.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.560
So I have to take out
of the interest rate

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.700
what happens to prices.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.890
Because if prices go up,
it offsets what I'm

00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:26.240
earning in the bank.

00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.270
And so what I care about is I
care about what the bank posts

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:32.790
minus what inflation will be.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:33.680
So it's even trickier, right?

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.070
Because it's not about what
inflation was, it's what

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:35.710
inflation will be.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.310
You'll have to guess what
inflation is going to be.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.840
And so what we care about is
this real interest rate.

00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:45.680
And that's why the interest rate
that banks pay, a primary

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.700
determinant of it
is inflation.

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:51.320
Right now, we are in the lowest
inflation period this

00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.110
nation's seen since
World War II.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:55.380
Core inflation--

00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:56.920
we don't really get into
inflation in this course-- but

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:59.170
core inflation, which is
inflation minus some things

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:04.870
which fluctuate a lot, is
basically zero in the US.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.790
So, basically, nominal interest
rates are the same as

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.770
real interest rates, and that's
why the interest rates

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:12.290
you see posted are so incredibly
low because there's

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:13.760
no inflation.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.490
In the late 1970's, when
inflation was running at

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:21.170
10-15% a year, interest rates
were 15 to 20% a year.

00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:23.110
Now it wasn't that you could
get so much more for your

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:24.500
savings in the 1970's.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:27.010
It was just that stuff was going
to cost more next year,

00:47:27.010 --> 00:47:29.820
so banks, if they wanted to
induce you to save, had to pay

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:31.550
you a higher interest rate.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:33.120
So, essentially, banks are going
to have to pay you to

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:34.850
get you to put your money in.

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:40.230
If in 1978, when the inflation
rate was 15%--

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:43.500
if banks had offered a 3%
interest rate no one would've

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:49.880
put money in the banks because
you would end up losing

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:50.310
effectively.

00:47:50.310 --> 00:47:52.760
Effectively, that's a negative
12% real interest rate.

00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.020
So what matters is how much
the bank pays you in cash

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.830
minus how much more stuff is
going to cost. And that's

00:47:58.830 --> 00:47:59.570
often what matters.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:00.980
Now that's a distinction
we won't spent a lot of

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:02.880
time on later on.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.860
I'll just say interest rate.

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:05.370
I won't say real
versus nominal.

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:07.840
But you've got to know in your
head that what matters is the

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.480
interest rate is the real
interest rate, what the bank

00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:12.880
pays you, minus how much more
stuff's going to cost.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.800
Questions about that?

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:15.910
Alright, we'll come
back next time.

00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:16.740
There is class on Wednesday.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:17.940
It does matter.

00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:19.360
And on Wednesday we're going
to talk about the rest of

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:21.000
capital markets and people's
savings decisions.

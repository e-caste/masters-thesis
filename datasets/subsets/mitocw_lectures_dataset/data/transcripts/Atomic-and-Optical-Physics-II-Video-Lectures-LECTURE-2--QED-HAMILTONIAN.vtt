00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.340
PROFESSOR: My first
question is, do you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.240
have any questions about
the last class, about

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.930
the introduction, about the
course overview, the syllabus,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.050
any requirements of the
course, formalities?

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.360
It should be pretty clear.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.055
So today, we start
from first principles.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:03.370
I want to give you a
rigorous derivation of what

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.590
this course is based,
namely, the Hamiltonian

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.340
to describe the interaction
between atoms and light.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.820
I mentioned to you last
week that atomic physics can

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.470
be defined about
everything that is

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.560
interesting about the building
blocks of nature, atoms

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.040
interacting with light
electromagnetic fields, Coulomb

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.190
fields, and today, we'll talk
about the first principle,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.690
Hamiltonian.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.770
The reference for
that, and I'm closely

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.070
following that derivation,
is the book Atom-Photon

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.215
Interaction, the green book
by Cohen-Tannoudji, Grynberg,

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:52.100
and others, and it's
taken from the appendix.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.360
And if you flip
through the appendix,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.675
you will find out that there
are about 100 equations.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.039
Today, we'll discuss
every single of them.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.020
However, the good
news is the result

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.720
in the end is simple
and intuitive.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.590
In the end, we
have what we want,

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.870
that the electromagnetic
field couples different energy

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.160
levels, and then we can play
around with quantum case,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.030
with laser cooling.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.190
All we need is a
coupling matrix element.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.850
And for most of the
course, I will not even

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.120
elaborate what this
matrix element is about.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.480
But here, we derive it
from first principles.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.110
The result we will
use most often

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:02.910
is actually the electric
dipole approximation,

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.310
which I'm sure you have
already seen many, many times.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.010
So in that sense, I sometimes
have second thoughts.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.950
Should I dedicate
a whole lecture

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.680
to derive something
you know already?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.330
On the other hand, this is sort
of the meat of atomic physics,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.440
and I want to go
as deep as possible

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.140
into it, that
whenever you wonder

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.750
what form of other
interactions exist,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.780
you have a reference
to look it up.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.780
And so to some extent,
I want to also encourage

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.080
you to read more about the
fundamental nature of how light

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.790
and atoms interact.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.890
I will give you another
reference a little bit

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.820
later on.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.460
But as a motivation,
I want to tell you

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.520
what I learned when I
prepared this lecture,

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.340
and I hope that
there is something

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.400
that you will learn
from this treatment.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.785
One is a rigorous
separation of local fields

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:16.045
from radiation fields.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.230
Let me just write it
down, rigorous separation

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:45.115
of local Coulomb fields
from radiation fields.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.820
So to clearly separate the
terms in the Hamiltonian,

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.653
let me explain that.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.630
When we introduce
electromagnetic fields

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.560
into our world, we would
say we introduce them

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.990
by saying particles have charge.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.770
But some parts of the
charged particle physics

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.190
is something we want to include
in the description of atoms,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.310
and that's the Coulomb
field of protons.

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.860
The structure of atoms
is electromagnetic,

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.200
but when we now introduce
electromagnetic field

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.310
as a new degree of
freedom-- photons

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.200
can be admitted,
absorbed, and such--

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.450
we only want to talk about
the electric field which

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.630
belongs to the photons and
not the electric field which

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.230
belongs to the atoms.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:35.820
And you may wonder,
can you distinguish

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.930
between two kinds
of electric fields?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.420
The answer is yes, and I want to
show you how mathematically you

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.110
distinguish when you introduce
electromagnetic fields

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.700
between the fields which stay
with the atom, which don't have

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.960
an extra degree of
freedom, and if you

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.815
do canonical quantization,
they don't enter

00:05:55.815 --> 00:05:59.700
as an extra variable, and the
fields which are the photons,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.543
and these are the extra
objects we have to consider.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.490
What is also related is when
you do second quantization,

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.350
if you wanted, I could quantize
electromagnetic field for you

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.320
in five minutes.

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.180
Just say it's
harmonic oscillator.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.888
You're familiar with
harmonic oscillator,

00:06:19.888 --> 00:06:22.390
and let's just do it.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.780
Yes, this is correct, and I will
remind you of that a little bit

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:29.660
later, but there is
one non-trivial aspect

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.460
if you want to do quantization
of a field theory,

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.040
you have to make sure that
before you quantize it,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.050
you know which degrees of
freedom are really independent.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.440
So the question is, how
many independent fields

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.530
does the electromagnetic
field have?

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.920
The naive answer is three
electric field components,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.030
three magnetic field
components, that makes six.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.790
But of course they're
not independent,

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:57.015
and we will discuss that.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.750
So we'll spend some time
in the identification

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:20.390
of truly independent field
components, or degrees

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.530
of freedom of the
electromagnetic field.

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:38.600
So all that is an excursion
into classical physics

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.830
because it is just reformulating
classical electrodynamics

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.460
to be ready for quantization.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:08:00.860
Actually, all the work is
done to discuss and derive

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:02.550
the appropriate
classical description.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.850
That means to eliminate
all redundant variables,

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.970
and then at the end, have
variables which, yes,

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:22.440
will look like a
harmonic oscillator.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:26.440
And once we have reduced it
to degrees of freedom which

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:33.340
look like a harmonic oscillator,
it is very straightforward

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:38.030
to do the field
quantization following

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.640
the recipe of the
harmonic oscillator.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:49.260
There's one more highlight,
if I want to say so,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:58.830
and this is a truly
rigorous derivation

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.596
of the electric
dipole approximation.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:17.980
In most quantum
mechanics textbooks,

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.240
you do a dipole
approximation and you wind up

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.590
with the electric dipole
Hamiltonian, which

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:29.550
I have already put up
there, but you do actually

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:32.460
unnecessary
approximations in terms

00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:36.040
of neglecting an a squared
term, and there are often

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.140
confusing discussions
what happens

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.720
with the a squared term.

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.010
I want to show you a
more rigorous deviation

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.600
of the electric dipole
approximation, which

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:50.160
is including the quadratic term.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.550
That actually means--
that's the take home

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:02.940
message-- the electric dipole
approximation is actually

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.515
better than many of you
have thought so far.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.530
Since I don't want to
write out 100 equations,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:20.500
I copied them and summarized
them out of the book.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.050
You'll find them all,
as I mentioned before,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.850
in the appendix of
Atom-Photon Interaction.

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.580
But I sort of want
to walk you through.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.280
What I'm aiming at
is that you have

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.040
sort of a complete overview how
is everything coming together,

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.060
and if it's just mathematical,
well, mathematics

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.320
is always exact.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.890
I can go faster,
but I really want

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:46.550
to highlight here every
single physical concept

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:48.342
and approximation we are doing.

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:55.330
When we start out with
Maxwell's equations,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:04.570
we have actually six components
of the electromagnetic field,

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:10.720
and we will see in a moment
that this is redundant.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:22.310
What will turn out to be
very important to separate

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:25.190
the local fields from
the radiation field

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:38.930
is a Fourier transformation,
so we introduce an expansion

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.490
into plain waves.

00:11:41.490 --> 00:11:43.880
And what then
happens, of course,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:49.400
is the derivative operator
becomes the k vector.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.660
So therefore, when you
have Maxwell's equations

00:11:52.660 --> 00:12:00.050
with the curl, del cross
B, it turns into k cross

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:08.700
B. This is now important because
we have now separate equations

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:11.830
for the component of the
electric and magnetic field,

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:16.140
which is parallel to
k, projected onto k,

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.910
and of course, the
cross product takes out

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.150
the component which
is perpendicular to k.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:27.800
So that's something
which is sort of nice,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:34.750
that the Fourier transform
it allows us to separate

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:41.910
the fields into
longitudinal fields, where

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:45.110
the vector of the
Fourier component

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:52.253
is parallel to the k vector,
and into transverse components.

00:12:52.253 --> 00:12:53.169
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:04.020
PROFESSOR: The difference
between curly and non-curly

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:05.590
vector is one is a
Fourier transform,

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.630
the other one is other
spatial components.

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:16.760
I have to actually
say the book API

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:21.350
tries to be super accurate
in choosing [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.670
Claude Cohen-Tannoudji
is really a master

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:25.810
of elegance and
perfection, so they

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:28.270
don't want to use
the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:32.190
for a spatial component and
for the Fourier component.

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.910
On the other hand, I have
to tell you one thing.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:37.790
For the next hour, use a
little bit your intuition.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.790
If you see e, it
means electric field.

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:43.290
Whether it is curly,
whether it's italic,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.450
whether it's bold
face, don't let

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:50.130
those differences
clutter your view.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.890
So I would say don't
ask me too often,

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.320
what exactly does it
mean now because you

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.720
have gone from
curly to non-curly?

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.750
It is explained in the appendix.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.350
I will tell you everything
which is necessary,

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:08.210
but these are
subtleties which are

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:12.620
more to present the mathematics
in a more rigorous way.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.420
We have the spatial
Fourier components,

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:27.300
and as I mentioned, what you can
do only because of the Fourier

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:38.756
transform, you have
now the distinction,

00:14:38.756 --> 00:14:49.180
a rigorous separation
between the parallel

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.346
and the longitudinal fields.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.090
So of course, you
can also now get back

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.900
what is the longitudinal
field, not in Fourier space

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.460
but in position
space, by just taking

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:23.000
the longitudinal or transverse
components of the Fourier

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.290
transform and
transforming them back.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:27.300
Why I'm elaborating
on that is we

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:30.510
will see in the next few minutes
that the transverse field

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:32.200
is the field which propagates.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.720
The longitudinal field
is the Coulomb field.

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.080
It belongs to the
atoms and will not

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.830
become a new degree of freedom.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:48.150
And we see that immediately
in the next equations.

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:56.270
When we look now at
Maxwell's equations,

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.890
we find that the transverse and
longitudinal fields decouple.

00:16:00.890 --> 00:16:06.810
We have two kinds of equations
which are completely decoupled.

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:11.890
The longitudinal electric field
is the Coulomb field associated

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:17.210
with a charge density, whereas
the transverse fields are

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.710
creating themselves,
and this is radiation,

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:23.675
how the electric and magnetic
fields create themselves

00:16:23.675 --> 00:16:24.425
as they propagate.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:46.200
Now, the fact that the
parallel electric field

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:52.790
can be expressed by
the charge density,

00:16:52.790 --> 00:17:06.930
or it's expressed by the
momentary position of charges,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:14.079
and this means immediately that
the longitudinal field is not

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:18.169
an independent variable or
an extra degree of freedom.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.514
Canonical, of course,
with how we describe

00:17:25.514 --> 00:17:29.680
particles by their position,
and here you see explicitly

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.350
that the longitudinal
field which

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:39.850
we defined the way we did it,
that this part of the field

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:44.124
only depends on the momentarily
electric field, the Coulomb

00:17:44.124 --> 00:17:45.540
field associated
with the charges.

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:06.480
The next thing, of course,
is to define the vector

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.080
potential and the
scalar potential.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.640
By using the standard
substitution,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:23.670
we can now express electric
and magnetic fields

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.735
by a scalar potential and
by a vector potential.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:37.050
We continue to
have the separation

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.570
between longitudinal
and transverse fields,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:49.210
namely the transverse
electromagnetic fields

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.700
depend only on the
transverse component

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:54.700
of the vector potential.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:04.860
And the transverse component
is gauge invariant.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:11.910
In other words, you know
there are different gauges we

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:15.050
can consider when we introduce
electromagnetic potentials,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:20.000
but the choice of gauge does
not affect the transverse vector

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.500
potential.

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:31.190
Now we want to pick
our gauge and repeat

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.820
the gauge which is
most convenient.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:38.200
This is typically, for low
energy quantum physics,

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:42.380
for describing atoms and
radiation, the Coulomb gauge.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:45.700
So we have the freedom of
gauge, and the Coulomb gauge

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:53.075
is written by the divergence
of the vector potential is 0.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.800
If you now think about
Fourier transform,

00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:03.130
this means k dot the
Fourier component is 0,

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:07.230
and that means the
vector potential does not

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:09.020
have any longitudinal component.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:33.660
So with that, we have
now reduced equations

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.860
for six variables, three
electric fields, three

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.640
magnetic field components.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:43.200
By introducing vector and scalar
potential, you go to four.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.230
We've eliminated one more
with the Coulomb gauge,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.780
so we have three.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.400
The scalar potential is
the Coulomb potential.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.170
It's not an extra
degree of freedom.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:21:02.320
And what is left are
the two field components

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.050
of the transverse
vector potential.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:29.112
And these are now, as we will
see, the independent variables

00:21:29.112 --> 00:21:30.890
of the radiation field.

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.440
So in other words, when we talk
about the electromagnetic field

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.550
in the remainder of
the course, the part

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:45.580
of the electromagnetic
field we are interested in

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:49.450
are the fields generated by the
transverse vector potential.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:10.960
Now, what is next is to
go into normal modes.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.310
The reason is that
we want to identify

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:18.680
each normal mode of the
electromagnetic field

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.760
as an independent
harmonic oscillator.

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.680
Now, I'm showing
you those equations,

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:30.960
but you sort of have to sit
back because now there will be

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:35.230
alphas, a's, lower
a's, upper A's.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.020
They all mean pretty
much the same.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:42.940
In one case, you are
normalized, maybe something

00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:44.430
has to be factored out or not.

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.440
The derivation in
the appendix of API

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.140
is exactly [INAUDIBLE]
distinction,

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.090
but let me just give
you a flyover here.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:23:00.560
And that is we are now taking
the transverse components

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.220
from the electromagnetic field,
and we define new parameters,

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.190
which are the normal modes.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:10.990
What we actually want
to see in a moment

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.000
is that those normal
mode variables

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.100
are harmonic oscillators.

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.650
Those normal modes can be
defined by the original field,

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.450
which are transverse,
but since we

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:26.090
have expressed the transverse
field by the transverse vector

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.972
potential, they also
simply can be expressed

00:23:28.972 --> 00:23:30.430
by the transverse
vector potential.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.875
So to remind you, we've
done a Fourier transform

00:23:35.875 --> 00:23:38.090
in the spatial
coordinate, but not

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.940
yet in the temporal coordinate.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.620
What we obtain
now is an equation

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.565
of motion for the
normal mode variables.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:05.440
And here, I have reminded you
that the transverse vector

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:10.790
potential, how it can be
expressed by the normal mode

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:11.990
variables.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:16.180
In other words, yes, it looks
complicated and a little bit

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.300
messy, but it's classical
physics, and all we have done

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:24.000
is introduce normal modes in a
just more complicated notation,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.690
as you may have seen it in
803 or some other course

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.380
where for the first
time you talked

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.735
about normal modes of a
pendulum or a chain of springs.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:40.230
So we have identified normal
modes by the equation above,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:43.452
and then it's a
mathematical identity

00:24:43.452 --> 00:24:47.260
that our radiation field, our
transverse vector potential,

00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:50.020
can simply be expended
into normal modes.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:44.250
So the equation of motion
for the transverse fields

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.400
involves of course, the
transverse vector potential.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:25:58.640
I should have scrolled back.

00:26:05.822 --> 00:26:10.930
Here we have our equations
for the transverse fields.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.480
This is what we
want to describe,

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.020
and if we express everything in
terms of the vector potential,

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:27.280
then we have an equation which
involves the transverse vector

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.720
potential, but in addition,
because it's a differential

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.283
equation, the first
and second derivative.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:49.660
That means that if you have
a second order differential

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.100
equation, which is
the full description

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.580
of the electromagnetic
field, then

00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:00.600
you know that the solution
of the second order equation

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.210
needs as an initial
condition the field itself

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.950
and the first derivative.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:11.060
Therefore, our
classical fields are

00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:22.410
determined by a perpendicular
and its derivative

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.450
at the initial time.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:53.420
So we need a and we need a
dot, and they are coupled,

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:56.420
but what we are
doing right now is--

00:27:56.420 --> 00:28:01.270
and this is the idea behind the
normal modes-- the normal modes

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.690
coordinates combine a and a dot.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:07.430
It's the same when you
have a harmonic oscillator

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.560
and you want to
introduce coordinates

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.670
for the normal mode,
they are a combination

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.150
of position and momentum,
and then they are decoupled.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.390
But position and momentum
always couple or oscillate

00:28:19.390 --> 00:28:21.800
back and forth, and
the same happens here

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.190
between a and a dot, and
the normal mode coordinates

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:26.340
are the linear combination.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:46.550
In other words, the
equation of motion

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:53.810
coupled source and
normal mode means

00:28:53.810 --> 00:29:05.960
that we have introduced
he decoupled normal modes.

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:15.200
And whenever, in classical
physics, we have normal modes,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.480
normal modes means that time
dependence is e to the i omega

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:24.660
t, then we have distilled the
problem of coupled components

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:26.500
to decoupled
harmonic oscillators.

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:42.940
So at this point, each mode
acts as an independent harmonic

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.440
oscillator.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:30:00.470
So what I wanted to show you
here is clearly, as a flyover,

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.370
and as an appetizer to
read more in the book,

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.836
that we can start with
the electromagnetic field

00:30:05.836 --> 00:30:06.335
components.

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.810
We haven't just assumed
we have now empty space

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.490
and only [INAUDIBLE] radiation.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.460
We have rigorously separated
the electromagnetic field

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.330
in what belongs to the atoms
and what belongs to radiation,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.730
and the trick was a
spatial Fourier component.

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:26.020
At that moment, we
had a description

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.380
in terms of the transverse
vector potential,

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:31.630
and by using purely
classical physics,

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.310
by combining the vector
potential and its derivative,

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:38.567
we found normal modes,
and they are now

00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:40.400
completely independent
harmonic oscillators.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:46.740
This approach, and I
wanted to show that to you,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.380
involved a lot of notation--
a's, little alphas,

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.670
normal modes, and such.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.240
Let me just simply show you
another much, much shorter

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.630
pathway how you see that
everything looks and smells

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:01.110
like a harmonic
oscillator, and then we'll

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:03.950
do the last step, which
is rather straightforward.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.990
We quantize the
electromagnetic field.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.015
I could quantize it
right now, but we

00:31:08.015 --> 00:31:11.430
should take a short break from
the appendix in Atom-Photon

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:14.700
Interaction and do a
more intuitive shortcut

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.550
to the same physics.

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.010
Any questions at this point?

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.870
If you feel it's
confusing, remind yourself

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:26.980
this is just classical physics.

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:31.810
We are just rewriting Maxwell's
equations in new variables.

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.420
So what we do now is,
as I said, let's repeat

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:59.610
some of this deviation
by focusing on energy.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:26.150
If you write down energy for
our systems of atoms, photons,

00:32:26.150 --> 00:32:33.020
and Coulomb fields, we
have particles alpha

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.270
with mass m alpha
and velocity v alpha.

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.340
This is our kinetic energy.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.950
And then we use the
well known expression

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:46.040
for the electromagnetic
field, which

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:52.710
is the spatial integral over
E squared plus B squared.

00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:13.210
This integral over the
electromagnetic field energy

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:18.060
density can actually
be nicely separated

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:25.190
into integral over the
longitudinal field which

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:30.790
we have introduced and
a second integral, which

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:33.830
involves the transverse field.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.880
Of course, the magnetic
field is only transverse

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.460
because the divergence of
the magnetic field is 0,

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:44.847
and that means the
magnetic field does not

00:33:44.847 --> 00:33:46.180
have any longitudinal component.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:34:05.560
So this part here, as
we actually have shown,

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:22.320
is given by simply the
Coulomb energy where

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.630
we have charge
density at position r

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.580
and r prime interacting with
the Coulomb interaction.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.429
Eventually, if you want
to treat that further,

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:51.199
this Coulomb energy should be
split into some divergent self

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.600
energy, which is the energy
of the electron interacting

00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.829
with itself, and
people know how to deal

00:34:56.829 --> 00:35:02.090
with that, and the
interaction energy,

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.360
for example, between the
proton and the electron,

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.400
which is responsible for
the atomic structure.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.750
So in other words, we know
how to deal with that.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.880
This actually becomes
atomic structure.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.870
This is in contrast
to this part here,

00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:36.020
which is the classical energy
of the radiation field, which

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.670
is sort of the transverse
part of the energy.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:55.790
To describe now
radiation, we have

00:35:55.790 --> 00:36:02.750
to focus on this
transverse part,

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:10.240
and we are now expressing
the transverse part

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:16.340
by the vector potential
and its derivatives.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.260
So we introduce the vector
potential as before,

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.600
and I don't want to go
through the re-derivation.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.740
I just want to show you
how the total energy now

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.790
appears in terms of
the vector potential.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:33.840
And what we need for that
is, of course, the vector

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:38.880
potential and its derivative.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.790
The vector potential
depends on polarization,

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:44.630
depends on the
Fourier component,

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.780
and we call this
derivative of the vector

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.560
potential the
conjugate momentum.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.440
So now focusing on
energy, we, of course,

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.874
reduce everything as before
to the vector potential

00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:05.665
and its derivative.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:14.280
So we sum over polarization.

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.420
We integrate over all
Fourier components.

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:46.160
and the integral involves
now the vector potential,

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.060
the square of it, or
in complex notation,

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:53.650
the complex conjugate,
depends on polarization.

00:37:53.650 --> 00:37:58.010
We have c squared k square.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.840
This part, of course, comes
from the magnetic field,

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.760
which depends on the
vector potential.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.730
It's a spatial
derivative, the curl,

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:07.830
and this gives the k
squared, whereas the part

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.430
of the electromagnetic
energy, which

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:14.400
is related to the electric
field, the electric field

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.440
is a temporal derivative
of the vector potential,

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:21.540
and therefore, it involves
the temporal derivatives which

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.440
are now the canonical momenta.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:33.830
So this equation should
really remind you now--

00:38:33.830 --> 00:38:40.920
it's an energy equation-- of the
energy of a harmonic oscillator

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.160
because the energy is now
a sum over all oscillators,

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:50.010
but this is sort of x squared,
the amplitude of the oscillator

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.100
squared, this is the
potential energy.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.160
And here we have the derivative
of x, the velocity or momentum,

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.160
and this should remind
you of the kinetic energy

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:59.201
of a harmonic oscillator.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.900
In other words,
this should tell you

00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:08.470
that by focusing on the
transverse component

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:13.640
of the vector potential, it's
about lots of summation-- k

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.050
summation,
polarization summation.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.799
We in the end find
that each such mode

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:19.840
is a harmonic oscillator.

00:39:27.892 --> 00:39:28.475
Any questions?

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.480
Let me just show
you now, and it may

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:40.520
help you to go through
the previous derivation,

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.530
let me know introduce what I
did before, the normal modes,

00:39:46.530 --> 00:39:49.210
and then show you
how the energy looks

00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:53.300
like defined in normal modes.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:57.370
So we have these
normal mode variables,

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:06.790
which are defined as a
superposition of A and A dot.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.850
And I'm not telling you
here with all the indices

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:19.500
whether it's the polarization
component, the k component.

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.450
I just want to tell
you the structure.

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:26.390
The normal mode is a
superposition of A dot and A.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:32.890
And with that, the energy
of the electromagnetic field

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:36.290
can be written--
well, we always have

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:38.817
to sum over Fourier components.

00:40:38.817 --> 00:40:40.650
We always have to sum
over the polarization.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:52.410
But then we have something
which is very, very simple

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.360
and intuitive.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:41:04.750
It's just the square of alpha
with the correct polarization,

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:09.920
the pre-factor is
h bar omega over 2.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:16.110
It looks like quantum mechanics,
h bar omega times A dagger

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:23.730
A plus 1/2, but this
is purely classical.

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:26.240
There is no quantization,
there is no operator.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:31.180
We've simply defined
something new, namely alpha

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:33.322
in terms of the
vector potential.

00:41:33.322 --> 00:41:36.060
In that sense, if you're going
to go back to the derivation,

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:39.960
the alphas are nothing else
than some elaborate combination

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.271
of the transverse electric
and magnetic field.

00:41:42.271 --> 00:41:42.770
Colin?

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:44.150
AUDIENCE: Where does
the h bar come in?

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:45.530
Is that the
coefficient of alpha?

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:50.670
PROFESSOR: h bar
only enters through

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:53.920
the constant in the definition
of the normal mode parameter.

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.640
So actually, I have
introduced h bar

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:00.070
by choosing this parameter
wisely in such a way

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.310
that it connects with
quantum mechanics.

00:42:02.310 --> 00:42:08.270
But it's a completely
arbitrary introduction here.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:09.930
I could have said h bar to 1.

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:21.030
I hope you enjoyed,
or at least did not

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:24.520
dislike this excursion
into classical physics.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:30.730
We have now two
equations for describing

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:32.780
the energy of a
harmonic oscillator.

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:44.550
So both of these equations look
like a harmonic oscillator,

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:47.100
but if something looks
like a harmonic oscillator,

00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:48.410
it is a harmonic oscillator.

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:58.230
And I think I should
always remind you

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:05.100
that so far, everything
has been purely classical.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:22.846
And also, let me write down
that h bar enters solely

00:43:22.846 --> 00:43:30.052
through the constant in the
definition of the normal mode

00:43:30.052 --> 00:43:30.760
parameter, alpha.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:56.410
If you want to
know more about it,

00:43:56.410 --> 00:43:59.555
there is a second reference.

00:43:59.555 --> 00:44:03.560
I will actually show you the
cover page in a few moments.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.040
But there is a second book
by Claude Cohen-Tannoudji

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:10.440
and collaborators, not
Atom-Photon Interaction,

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:12.560
but called Photons and Atoms.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:17.130
It's a whole book on
rigorously defining QED.

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.430
So a whole book has been
written about the subject

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:25.690
of this lecture, and on page 27,
you can read more about that.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:45.870
So enough of classical physics.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:49.470
All we have done so far--
I'm sorry for repeating it,

00:44:49.470 --> 00:44:53.400
but I think I can't repeat
it too often with so many

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:58.300
complicated equations on the
screen-- all we have done so

00:44:58.300 --> 00:45:01.020
far is we have rewritten
Maxwell's equations.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:04.830
We have rewritten Maxwell's
equations in Fourier space,

00:45:04.830 --> 00:45:07.970
with the vector potential,
eventually with normal modes.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.820
That's all we have done.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.010
But now what we
are doing is we do

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.210
the step in quantum mechanics
which you have already

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:19.650
seen a few times, and this
is you have written equations

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.080
in such a way that they look
like harmonic oscillators,

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:28.480
and then you postulate that
the classical quantities become

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.840
operators.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.220
The transverse vector potential
and the conjugate canonical

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:37.400
momentum fulfill
now commutators,

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:43.735
and we use those commutators
to define them as operators.

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:50.560
Now, it looks particularly
easy when we use normal mode

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:53.110
operators because the
normal mode operators

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:56.190
after quantization become
our a's and a daggers.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.020
That was one of the things
I wanted to show you,

00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:05.500
that you can go through
everything introducing

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.990
classical normal modes,
and then the normal modes

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:11.920
turns into operators, and
now we have all your creation

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:13.130
and annihilation operators.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.520
In other words, quantization
cannot be rigorously proven.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.594
I mean, you cannot prove quantum
theory from first principles.

00:46:24.594 --> 00:46:26.135
You can have a
mathematical framework

00:46:26.135 --> 00:46:29.470
and check it against nature.

00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:33.400
What we have done here is to
formulate the quantum theory.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:39.140
At this point, we've
made a postulate

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:47.440
that we have operators which
fulfill a commutation relation.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.230
And it is now your
choice if you want

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:55.080
to formulate postulate
the commutator

00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.710
for the transverse
vector potential

00:46:58.710 --> 00:47:03.770
and its conjugate momentum,
or if you immediately

00:47:03.770 --> 00:47:05.930
want to jump at
the normal modes,

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:09.470
and that would mean you have the
commutator for a and a dagger.

00:47:20.382 --> 00:47:21.590
We are almost done with that.

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.960
We started with the
electromagnetic fields.

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.150
We went through
transverse fields, vector

00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:33.850
potential, normal
modes, now we quantize.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:37.760
But now all the equations, all
the substitutions we have made,

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.570
we can go backward.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:43.870
Therefore, we can now
express the transverse vector

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:46.710
potential, the electric
and the magnetic field,

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.230
by the normal
modes, or that would

00:47:49.230 --> 00:47:52.520
mean in quantum mechanics,
after quantization, we

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.240
can express them by
the a's and a daggers,

00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:59.221
and this is how we define
the operator of the electric,

00:47:59.221 --> 00:48:01.096
the magnetic field, and
the vector potential.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:11.040
So now, our fully
quantized theory

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:17.840
has operators, a of a
dagger, or if you want now,

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:20.870
the first defined operators
of vector potential, electric

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.140
and magnetic field.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.190
And just to remind you,
since atomic physics is

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:29.890
between fields and
particles, we have

00:48:29.890 --> 00:48:35.130
exactly the standard definition
of the particle operators.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:38.620
Each particle is described by
its momentum and its position.

00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:55.680
So with that, we
have our Hamiltonian,

00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.790
and a lot of what we
discuss in this course

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.620
are understanding
this Hamiltonian,

00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.440
understanding its
solution, understanding

00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:06.210
what is the physics
described by that.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.340
So this Hamiltonian, this
is the kinetic energy.

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:25.630
The canonical momentum
minus the vector potential

00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:27.500
is the mechanical velocity.

00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.880
This is kinetic energy.

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.970
And we have separated the energy
of the electromagnetic field

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:38.790
into the Coulomb energy,
which is written again here,

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.070
and the radiation field.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:44.590
There is now one
more term which we

00:49:44.590 --> 00:49:50.580
need later on, which
is this one here.

00:49:50.580 --> 00:50:00.350
And at this point, I would say--
I'm just heuristically adding

00:50:00.350 --> 00:50:10.370
it by hand-- classical
we don't have spin,

00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:14.070
but our particles have spin,
and now we need [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:14.070 --> 00:50:15.530
coupling, how does
the spin couple

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:17.620
to the rest of the world?

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:21.600
Well, the spin, if you
multiply it with the g factor,

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:23.970
the Bohr magneton has
a magnetic moment,

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:27.650
and what we simply
add here is mu dot p,

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.430
be the interaction of
the magnetic moment

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:32.342
with the magnetic field.

00:50:32.342 --> 00:50:34.550
So in that sense, we have
been classical all the way.

00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:36.730
Now at the end we
said, we need the spin.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:41.020
Let's put it on by simply
taking an interaction, which

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.000
is mu dot p.

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.340
If you don't like
that because I try

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:53.170
to be very fundamental today
and go from first principles,

00:50:53.170 --> 00:50:57.890
for electrons, you
can get that by taking

00:50:57.890 --> 00:51:02.330
the non-relativistic unit
of the Dirac equation.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:07.140
So if you have
electrons, you can

00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:13.050
start with the Dirac equation
and do the Pauli approximation,

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:28.950
which is the non-relativistic
limit of the Dirac equation.

00:51:32.357 --> 00:51:32.940
Any questions?

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.650
So these are all the
terms in the Hamiltonian.

00:51:49.060 --> 00:51:51.160
I mentioned, but I
don't want to dwell on,

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:56.740
that the Coulomb energy has
to be separated into a Coulomb

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:59.250
self energy and an
interaction energy

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:02.140
between the charged
particles, but all of that

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:05.760
becomes just one term
in our Hamiltonian.

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.010
This is the atomic structure.

00:52:08.010 --> 00:52:10.825
When we assume that
atoms have energy levels,

00:52:10.825 --> 00:52:13.320
all the energy is
included in that,

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:16.535
so we will not discuss any
further the Coulomb energy.

00:52:16.535 --> 00:52:20.690
We will simply assume we have
an atom which has certain energy

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:28.480
levels, and that includes
all the Coulomb terms.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:32.150
But we will talk a lot
about the Hamiltonian

00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:33.960
for the radiation field.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.380
The Hamiltonian for
the radiation field

00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.000
can be conveniently
written in a and a dagger,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.110
but I have a few equations
up there I rigorously

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:49.950
defined for you operators E and
B in terms of a and a daggers,

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:53.210
and those two equations
are identical.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:57.240
So this looks very quantum,
this looks very classical,

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.880
but if you interpret the
electric and magnetic field

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.600
as operators, we have
identical equations

00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:05.520
for the Hamiltonian of
the radiation field.

00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:31.020
What we want to study
are interactions

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.140
between light and atoms,
and of course, this

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.960
comes from the vector potential.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.740
And in particular,
when we square it out,

00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:46.390
the canonical momentum of
the atoms times the vector

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:50.500
potential has this
cross term, p dot a.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:53.990
So let me know just
take this Hamiltonian

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:58.546
and write it in the way how we
will need it for this course.

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.190
We want to take the Hamiltonian,
and I will often refer to that.

00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:12.110
We want to take the
Hamiltonian and split it

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:17.550
into three parts, the
atoms, the radiation

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:22.200
field, and the interaction
between the two.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:27.900
The Hamiltonian for the
particles, H subscript P,

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.870
has the momentum
squared, and it has

00:54:31.870 --> 00:54:37.320
the part of the electromagnetic
fields which are longitudinal,

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:40.152
the energy of which can
be described by a Coulomb

00:54:40.152 --> 00:54:40.652
integral.

00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:47.130
We have already discussed
the radiation field.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:50.740
The radiation field
was nothing else

00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:57.360
than h bar omega, a
dagger a, but the new part

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:01.790
which we need now is
the interaction term.

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.990
I want to show you
now, or remind you

00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:10.369
by just summarizing the term,
that the interaction part has

00:55:10.369 --> 00:55:11.660
actually three different terms.

00:55:18.030 --> 00:55:22.990
The first one is the cross
term between p and A.

00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:25.925
The second one, when we had
p minus A and squared it,

00:55:25.925 --> 00:55:28.750
is the A squared term.

00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:31.290
And the third one
is the interaction

00:55:31.290 --> 00:55:34.790
of the spin with the magnetic
component of the radiation

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:35.480
field.

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.820
This is the mu
dot B interaction.

00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:44.460
I don't think it's an
exaggeration when I tell you

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:48.110
that with those
three equations, you

00:55:48.110 --> 00:55:49.970
can understand all
of atomic physics.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:07.340
This term here that's
important is second order

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:11.400
in A, which of
course also means it

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:16.070
will be very important for
very strong laser palaces,

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:18.360
but there's more to
be said about it.

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:43.710
If you're interested
in this subject,

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:46.550
and I couldn't do
full justice to it,

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.750
you may want to look at
this book from Claude

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:51.170
Cohen-Tannoudji, Jacques
Dupont-Roc, and Gilbert

00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:54.000
Grynberg about
photons and atoms.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.625
The whole book is
dedicated how to describe

00:56:57.625 --> 00:57:00.180
the interaction of atoms
with electromagnetic fields.

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:07.950
In this book, they go
through different ways

00:57:07.950 --> 00:57:10.170
of formulating the
electromagnetic field

00:57:10.170 --> 00:57:10.990
classically.

00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:14.160
They use Lagrangian formalism
for the electromagnetic field

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.370
and show the Euler-Lagrange
equation or Maxwell's equation.

00:57:18.370 --> 00:57:21.690
There are lots of
different approaches,

00:57:21.690 --> 00:57:27.780
and also, one can
say what we did

00:57:27.780 --> 00:57:30.630
here, which is the
simplest way of describing

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:41.080
light-atom interaction,
will work in the Coulomb

00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:44.240
gauge, which is not the gauge
you would choose when you want

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:46.040
to describe
relativistic physics.

00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.440
There is the other gauge,
the Lawrence gauge.

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:52.230
It makes the field quantization
much more difficult,

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:57.680
but when you ever wondered,
why is the quantization done

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.890
in the way I did, and you think
something I did was arbitrary--

00:58:01.890 --> 00:58:03.550
why did I pick
the Coulomb gauge?

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:04.305
Read this book.

00:58:04.305 --> 00:58:07.350
There are hundreds of pages
which explain it to you.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:11.540
And I'm not joking here,
it's wonderful reading.

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.840
I got the book just
looked up a few things

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.300
and I almost got hooked on
it and read more and more.

00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:21.250
It's a fascinating story how
deeply people have thought

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:26.830
about how to describe
this aspect of the course

00:58:26.830 --> 00:58:28.590
and how profound
the thoughts are.

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:34.080
What this book will
emphasize-- and this

00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:36.060
is what I want to
tell you in closing

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:41.842
about the quantization of
the electromagnetic field--

00:58:41.842 --> 00:58:42.550
is the following.

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:53.230
We were really working hard
with classical field equations

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:58.090
to describe the electromagnetic
field classically by completely

00:58:58.090 --> 00:59:00.360
eliminating redundant variables.

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.260
We started with six components
of the electric and magnetic

00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.530
field and reduced it
to two components,

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:09.800
the two components of the
transverse vector potentials.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.450
And as those masters
say, as a result,

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.890
the field can be quantized
with a great economy

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:19.250
in the formalism.

00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:25.430
If you want to have more
symmetric formulations, where

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:29.050
you don't eliminate the
variables using the Coulomb

00:59:29.050 --> 00:59:32.760
gauge, the problem is
you have variables,

00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:35.310
which are not independent.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:37.370
And now I think if
you quantize, you

00:59:37.370 --> 00:59:40.700
have to formulate
auxiliary conditions

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:44.380
between the not
independent operators.

00:59:44.380 --> 00:59:46.560
Aesthetically, it
may be pleasing

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:50.310
because the approach
is more symmetric,

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:53.290
but mathematically,
it's much more involved.

00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:54.940
Anyway, if you're
interested, this book

00:59:54.940 --> 00:59:58.940
has a wonderful discussion
on the different ways how

00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.114
you can approach
interactions of atoms

01:00:01.114 --> 01:00:02.280
with electromagnetic fields.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.250
I hope nobody has a
question about that,

01:00:09.250 --> 01:00:11.880
because I'm not able to explain
to you much more than that.

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:15.340
Anyway, questions?

01:00:21.870 --> 01:00:26.970
We have derived from first
principles the Hamiltonian,

01:00:26.970 --> 01:00:30.760
and the result is
something many of you

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:34.208
are already familiar with.

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:40.250
Let me now spend the
next 10 or 15 minutes

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:43.275
on what is called the
dipole approximation

01:00:43.275 --> 01:00:44.400
and the dipole Hamiltonian.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:58.210
We are talking know about
one further expansion

01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:01.380
of our expressions, and this
is the multipole expansion.

01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:10.670
Let me first give you the
simple derivation, which

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:12.442
you may have seen,
but then you can

01:01:12.442 --> 01:01:13.900
appreciate the
rigorous derivation.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:23.230
Either directly or through
the vector potential,

01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:26.360
we have formulated
our theory in terms

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:29.610
of the electric
and magnetic field

01:01:29.610 --> 01:01:31.890
as a function of position.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:37.500
But what we now want to
exploit is that atoms are tiny,

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:40.400
and usually, the electric
or magnetic field

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:45.420
is not changing over the
extent of an atom or molecule.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.980
In other words,
what I'm telling you

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:51.450
is the relevant frequencies,
the relevant components

01:01:51.450 --> 01:01:53.790
of the electric
and magnetic fields

01:01:53.790 --> 01:01:55.480
will, of course,
be the components

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:58.790
which are in resonance with
the atoms and molecules.

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:02.020
What I'm telling you is that
in many, many situations,

01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.560
the wavelengths of
the relevant modes

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:07.320
of the electromagnetic
field are much, much longer

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.750
than the size of an atom.

01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:15.990
So therefore, if we pinpoint
our atom at the origin,

01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:20.940
we may be able to neglect
the spatial dependence

01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.840
of the electromagnetic
fields and replace it

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:27.520
by electric and magnetic
fields at the origin.

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.930
Or, if you want to go higher
in a Taylor expansion,

01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:32.700
we use gradients of it.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.220
We've talked more
about that, actually,

01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:44.260
in 8.421, when we talked
about multipole transitions,

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:52.290
but here I want to only focus
on the lowest order, which

01:02:52.290 --> 01:03:03.560
is called the electric
dipole approximation,

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:10.510
because this is the most
important case which

01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:13.410
is used in atomic physics.

01:03:13.410 --> 01:03:21.740
So for the electric
dipole approximation,

01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:26.370
we make actually
several assumptions.

01:03:26.370 --> 01:03:32.720
One is we neglect the quadratic
term, the a squared term.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.490
And now if you look
at the A dot p term,

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:41.820
and we are looking for
matrix elements between two

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:48.650
atomic levels, we expand
the vector potential

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:49.555
into plain waves.

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.220
Well, it's called the
electric dipole approximation,

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.670
so maybe we want
to express things

01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:03.090
by the electric field, which
is the derivative of the vector

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:05.320
potential.

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:13.990
So with that, we have
now described things

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:16.850
by the electric field.

01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:24.810
And what is needed now is if
we assume that kr equals 0,

01:04:24.810 --> 01:04:28.490
or r over lambda is
very, very small,

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:33.060
the exponential, the plain wave
vector, is approximated by 1,

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:37.330
and we are simply left in the
electric dipole approximation

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:45.425
with the a element of
the momentum operator.

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:59.460
We can simplify it further by
writing the momentum operator

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.430
as the commutator
between the position

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.620
operator and the Hamiltonian.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:10.660
If you take the commutator
between r or x and p squared,

01:05:10.660 --> 01:05:13.050
you'd simply get
p and p factors,

01:05:13.050 --> 01:05:14.950
so that's what we are using.

01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:24.850
And now the matrix
element becomes-- so what

01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:31.510
we have here now is rH
minus Hr, but H acting on 1,

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:35.160
because 1 is an eigenstate,
gives the energy, E1.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.570
And for the flipped
part, we have Hr,

01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:42.670
and now H acting on state
two gives us the energy, E2.

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:47.940
So therefore, by taking care
of the Hamiltonian, which

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:53.500
gives us, depending on which
side H appears, E1 or E2,

01:05:53.500 --> 01:06:00.180
we have reduced it to now
a position matrix element.

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:03.430
And what we have
here is, of course,

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:08.782
the transition frequency
between the levels one and two.

01:06:08.782 --> 01:06:14.120
I know you have seen it, but if
I can derive it in two minutes,

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:15.880
it's maybe worth the exercise.

01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.380
What I've shown you is that
the momentum matrix element

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:25.920
can be replaced by the position
matrix element multiplied

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:35.140
by the resonance frequency.

01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.280
But now we want to
put things together,

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.040
and what I want to
point out for you

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.730
is that we have an
omega here, which

01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:44.360
is the frequency of the
electromagnetic field,

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:47.950
and we have an omega 12 here,
which is the transition energy.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.020
So therefore, if
I put it together,

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.220
I started with a p
dot a Hamiltonian,

01:06:59.220 --> 01:07:02.965
but the p matrix element
became an r matrix element.

01:07:02.965 --> 01:07:05.815
The a was expressed
by the electric field.

01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:15.530
So therefore, we have
now the electric field

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:19.210
times the position
matrix element,

01:07:19.210 --> 01:07:21.060
or the dipole matrix
element, if you

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:24.207
multiply the position of the
electron with the charge two.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:35.190
But in addition, we
have this prefactor.

01:07:35.190 --> 01:07:41.530
So this becomes the
dipole Hamiltonian

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:52.950
E dot d when we replace
that by 1, assuming

01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:58.560
that we are interested anyway
only in interactions with atoms

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:00.950
where the radiation
field is near resonance.

01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:14.870
So it seems that we have
actually made three assumptions

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:18.520
to derive the electric
dipole approximation.

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:26.439
One was the long
wavelengths approximation.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:31.720
The second one was that
we are near resonance,

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:38.640
and the third one was that we
neglected the quadratic term

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:40.080
in the light-atom interaction.

01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:02.580
There are often people who
are wondering about it.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.460
When I said we are
only interested when

01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:08.970
the atoms interact with
electromagnetic radiation

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:12.649
near resonance, that's
OK, but atomic physics

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:16.460
is the area of physics
with the highest precision.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.689
We can make measurements with
10 to the minus 16 and 10

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:21.750
to the minus 17 precision.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:25.229
So therefore, if you have an
electromagnetic field which

01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:27.939
resonates with atoms--
the typical frequency

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:30.899
of visible light is
10 to the 14 Hertz--

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:33.740
and you're just one megahertz
away from the resonance,

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.620
it's 10 to the minus 8.

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.399
So the question is, would
we observe a correction

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:45.950
to the dipole approximation if
omega 12 is not exactly omega?

01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:55.520
Well, the answer is no because,
as I want to show you now

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.650
in the next few minutes,
and this is also

01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:01.090
the end of our flyover
over the appendix

01:10:01.090 --> 01:10:04.399
of atom-photon interaction,
the last two assumptions

01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:05.440
are not really necessary.

01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:15.370
In other words, we go back
to atom-photon interaction,

01:10:15.370 --> 01:10:26.510
to this long appendix on
the derivation of the QED

01:10:26.510 --> 01:10:27.010
Hamiltonian.

01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:34.410
We go back to our
fundamental Hamiltonian,

01:10:34.410 --> 01:10:37.130
and we want to do
one approximation

01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:42.060
and this is the only
approximation which is needed.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:48.770
It is the dipole
approximation, and that

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:54.770
means that the vector
potential-- of course, we

01:10:54.770 --> 01:11:00.235
only need the transverse part
of it-- is replaced by its value

01:11:00.235 --> 01:11:01.470
at the origin.

01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:09.610
That's the only approximation.

01:11:09.610 --> 01:11:13.120
So here is our Hamiltonian
in its full beauty,

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:16.890
and the only thing we have
done is we've put in the origin

01:11:16.890 --> 01:11:19.080
here.

01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:25.720
For later convenience, we
introduce the dipole operator,

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:28.300
which is the position
operator of particle

01:11:28.300 --> 01:11:31.630
alpha times the charge
of particle alpha.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:40.110
And then we do simply
a transformation.

01:11:40.110 --> 01:11:50.200
So this is a unitary
transformation,

01:11:50.200 --> 01:12:00.910
and we transform from the
original Hamiltonian, which

01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:05.295
includes the p dot a term
and the a squared term

01:12:05.295 --> 01:12:09.860
to a transformed
Hamiltonian, H prime.

01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:19.120
And this transformed Hamiltonian
has now the electric dipole

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.565
approximation.

01:12:20.565 --> 01:12:23.560
It's sort of written in
polarization Fourier space,

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:29.992
but this is the electric field,
and a, a dagger gives position.

01:12:29.992 --> 01:12:30.632
I'm sorry.

01:12:30.632 --> 01:12:31.590
These are normal modes.

01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:35.890
It's a dipole operator
times the electric field,

01:12:35.890 --> 01:12:39.700
and the A squared
term has disappeared.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:55.430
So after the transformation,
we have no quadratic term,

01:12:55.430 --> 01:13:04.010
and all we are left is
this is nothing else

01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:08.480
than d dot e, the
dipole interaction.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:14.270
And there is no prefactor
omega 12 over omega.

01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:20.970
This is a rigorous
unitary transformation

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:21.745
to another basis.

01:13:25.754 --> 01:13:34.170
In full disclosure, it
involves a dipolar self energy,

01:13:34.170 --> 01:13:36.890
which is sort of
a constant energy.

01:13:36.890 --> 01:13:43.560
And if you look at the
transformed velocities,

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.480
the transformed
velocities v prime are now

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.050
identical to the original
canonical momentum.

01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:57.330
So after that, what was
the canonical momentum

01:13:57.330 --> 01:14:00.860
in the original
Hamiltonian, H, becomes

01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:05.730
now velocity times mass.

01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:08.445
So p becomes now the
mechanical momentum.

01:14:12.090 --> 01:14:14.692
And therefore, p squared
is the kinetic energy.

01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:21.610
Anyway, I think
this is important

01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:24.960
that we have this much
more rigorous deviation

01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.423
of the dipole approximation.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:39.390
I don't want to go through that.

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:41.760
I just want to make
sure you have seen it.

01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:47.190
If you want to do it
really rigorously,

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:51.700
then you have to distinguish
between the electric field

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:59.180
d and E. So you have
an electric field here,

01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.480
and here you have
the polarization.

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:07.675
It's pretty much the same
as in classical e and m.

01:15:14.150 --> 01:15:27.010
At the end of the day, we have
now, for the prime operator,

01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:29.720
for the Hamiltonian after
the canonical transformation,

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:33.770
after the unitary
transformation,

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.790
the only interaction
term which remains

01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:41.070
is the electric dipole
interaction between the dipole

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:46.830
and this field d, but this
field d prime corresponds

01:15:46.830 --> 01:15:50.510
to the original a
transverse electric field.

01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:52.855
I'm not going to explain
the difference between E,

01:15:52.855 --> 01:15:54.660
E prime, d, and d prime.

01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:56.310
It can be done rigorously.

01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:58.680
But the take home message
is-- and with that, I

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:03.657
want to conclude-- that
for most of this course,

01:16:03.657 --> 01:16:05.490
the interaction of the
electromagnetic field

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:08.690
with our atoms is
described by this term.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:11.290
We take the transverse
electric field.

01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.360
This is our radiation
field, and it

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:17.078
couples to the operator of
the atomic dipole moment.

01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:24.690
I hope you got the
take home message

01:16:24.690 --> 01:16:29.540
that whenever you have
any doubts about any part

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:32.600
of this deviation, or if you
have any doubts whether it's

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.380
rigorous or not,
you know now where

01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:39.294
to look it up and learn
everything about it.

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:40.268
Any questions?

01:16:53.930 --> 01:16:56.460
OK, then that's it.

01:16:56.460 --> 01:17:00.570
We'll probably post the first
homework assignment tomorrow--

01:17:00.570 --> 01:17:04.240
I will meet with the TAs-- and
it will be due in about a week,

01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.820
but you will see all
of that on the website

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:08.070
and hear from me on Wednesday.

01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.186
Have a good afternoon.

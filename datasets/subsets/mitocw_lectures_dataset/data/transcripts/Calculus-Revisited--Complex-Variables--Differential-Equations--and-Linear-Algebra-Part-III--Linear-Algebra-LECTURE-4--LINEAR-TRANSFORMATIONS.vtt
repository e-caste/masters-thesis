00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:33.040
HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.860
Several times in our
course up until now,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.530
we have referred to linearity.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.960
We referred to it when
we talked about systems

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.580
of linear equations.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.220
We referred to it when
we talked about systems

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.290
of linear differential
equations.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.680
We referred to it when we
talked about Laplace transforms.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.290
We referred to it when
we were mapping the xy

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.130
plane into the uv plane and
talking about differentials.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.830
And now, what we'd like
to do in today's lesson

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.580
is to show how the general
concept of a vector space

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.120
gives us a very nice
vehicle to tie together

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.435
all of these different
applications of linearity.

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:12.820
In fact, today's
lesson is called

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.830
"Linear Transformations."

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.280
And by way of a very
quick definition,

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.970
one which I will not bother
motivating because we've

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.210
seen the definition on many,
many different occasions.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.820
All we're doing now
is formalizing it.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.980
Let's suppose I have two vector
spaces, V and W, and a mapping

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.610
f that carries V
into W. Remember,

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.860
these vector spaces
are in particular sets.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.360
And we've talked about functions
that map sets into sets.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.437
Now we're mapping
a set into a set

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.770
where the set has a structure,
the structure of a vector

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.670
space.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.510
And what we're saying is that
a function that maps a vector

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.480
space V into a vector space W is
called a linear transformation

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.070
if, given any linear combination
of elements in the domain,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.630
say C1 alpha 1 plus C2
alpha 2, where C1 and C2 are

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.350
real numbers, and alpha 1
and alpha 2 are vectors in V,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.500
if f of that is C1 f of alpha
1 plus C2 f of alpha 2--

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.710
the same linearity definition
that we've had in the past.

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.530
And again, if this is
hard for you to visualize,

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.420
think in terms of pictures.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.110
Think of V as, for example,
being the xy plane.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.050
Think of W as
denoting the uv plane.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.010
And we're mapping the xy
plane, say, into the uv plane.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.520
Not all such mappings
will be linear.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.370
We studied that when we
talked about linear systems

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.180
of equations.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.390
Now, what we would
like to do now

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.700
is to show how many
of the properties

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.490
of linearity that
we've used in the past

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.480
are immediate consequences of
this particular definition.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.760
Well, let's take a look at
some of the consequences.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.460
The first thing I
claim is that if f

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.550
is a linear transformation,
it must map the 0 element of V

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.860
into the 0 element of W. In
other words, f acting on 0 maps

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.000
it into 0.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.950
And the easiest
way to prove that

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.390
is to notice that since
0 is equal to 0 plus 0,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.260
by that property, f of 0 is
certainly the same as f of 0

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.820
plus 0.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.120
And now by linearity, f of 0
plus 0 is f of 0 plus f of 0.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.310
And now, comparing
this with this,

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.090
remember, these are vectors,
the cancellation rule

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.460
applies for vectors.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.430
We then obtain that f of 0 is 0.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.990
And by the way, this is a
rather interesting subtlety

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.890
that comes up.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.190
Remember when we talked about
linear equations in the plane?

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.640
In other words, f of
x equals mx plus b.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.550
That is not the same as
a linear transformation.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.740
In fact, let me just see
if I can scribble something

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.450
in over here.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.090
Look at this.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.000
Suppose I have that f of
x is equal to mx plus b.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.080
See, that's the equation
of a straight line.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.500
What is f of 0?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.540
If f of x is mx plus b, if I
replace x by 0, I get what?

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.588
0 times m, which is 0, plus b.

00:04:19.588 --> 00:04:24.020
And therefore, for f to
be a linear transformation

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.950
according to our definition,
this must equal 0.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.750
And therefore, what this means
is that b itself must equal 0.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.090
In other words,
even though we think

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.980
of a straight line
as being linear,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.840
to represent a linear
transformation,

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.350
the straight line must
pass through the origin.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.780
But I don't want to
harp on that now.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.270
I want to let that
go for the exercises

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.910
because I'm afraid, again, if we
spend too much time on details,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.120
you will fail to get
the overall picture.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.030
But at any rate, one property
of a linear transformation

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.110
is that it maps the 0
vector into the 0 vector.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.780
Now, of course, other vectors
may be mapped into the 0 vector

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.280
as well.

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.950
I mean, we'll talk about that
in more detail in the form

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.630
of a review, in fact, later on.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.060
But for the time
being, let me show you

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.610
the next property of
linear transformations

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.940
that are very important.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.410
And that is that
if V1 and V2 are

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.520
mapped into 0 by the
linear transformation f,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.640
then any linear
combination of V1 and V2

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.710
is also mapped into 0.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.320
And by the way,
you may think when

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.210
I say this-- this
may ring a bell

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.980
and remind you of
what we were doing

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.120
when we talked about homogeneous
linear differential equations.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.040
And the interesting
point is that this

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.160
is exactly the same as
what we were doing there,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.540
only now, we're not
restricted to be dealing only

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.500
with linear
differential equations.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.580
This is now any linear
transformation from one vector

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.750
space into another.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.220
And the proof goes
exactly the way

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.800
it did in the linear
differential equation case.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.060
Namely, given f
of C1V1 plus C2V2,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.010
we certainly know that
by linearity, that

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.270
C1 f of V1 plus C2 f of V2.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.320
But given that f of V1
is 0, and f of V2 is 0,

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.530
certainly, this then
becomes 0, which

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.450
is what we wanted to show.

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.090
In other words, if you have
a linear transformation,

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.260
the set of elements that are
mapped into the 0 element

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.700
are more than a set.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.305
They are themselves a vector
space, a subspace of V,

00:06:31.305 --> 00:06:34.080
a subspace of the domain of f.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.310
Because why?

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:42.480
Any linear combinations of
elements mapped into 0 by f is

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.400
itself-- any linear
combination is itself--

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.840
mapped into f.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.360
In other words,
let's define n to be

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.300
the set of all elements eta
in V, such that f of eta is 0.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.790
And that space is called
the null space of f.

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.940
It's a subspace of
the domain of fV.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.360
And all we're saying is
by our previous remark,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.850
if two elements belong to
n, their sum belongs to n,

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:14.490
and any scalar multiple of an
element in n also belongs to n.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:20.280
So n is indeed a subspace of V.
It's a very important subspace.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.050
It's called the null space.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.160
And one of things
about the null space--

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.730
and by the way, many people
get confused by this name.

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.660
They say the null space, they
think of "null" as being empty,

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:31.360
nothing.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.540
And they say that null
space has nothing in it.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.170
No.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:36.090
Think of it in terms
of the mapping.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.540
The null space is
part of a domain.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.210
And what it is-- it's
that part of the domain

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.500
that's mapped into the
0 element of the image.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:47.340
You see?

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.330
It is not nothing.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:51.780
It's the set of all elements
that are mapped into 0.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.450
And what we're saying
is that that subspace

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.610
is enough to determine
the entire mapping.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.160
Let me show what I mean
by that abstractly.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.520
I claim that n determines
the image of f.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.990
Namely, I claim that if I
know that f of alpha equals f

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.050
of beta, and f is a
linear transformation,

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:15.000
alpha and beta cannot be very
random elements of V. In fact,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.880
what I claim is that the
difference between alpha

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.970
and beta must be an element
of the null space n.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.190
Or another way of
saying that, I claim

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:27.120
that alpha has the form
beta plus eta, where eta is

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.480
an element of the null space n.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.400
And again, this may ring
a familiar bell for you

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.500
when you think in terms
of linear differential

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.260
equations and the like,
where we essentially

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.240
saw that any two solutions
of a differential equation,

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.610
that their difference
was a solution

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.330
of the homogeneous linear
differential equation.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.580
But again, I don't want
to dwell on that now.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.090
I want to talk on the most
abstract version of this.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:56.652
How do I know that this is true?

00:08:56.652 --> 00:08:57.360
Well, look at it.

00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:01.500
What does it mean to say that
f of alpha equals f of beta?

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:05.100
It means that f of alpha
minus f of beta is 0.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.790
But by linearity, f of
alpha minus f of beta

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.490
is the same as f of
alpha minus beta.

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:15.030
Therefore, the fact that f
of alpha minus f of beta is 0

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:18.030
says that f of alpha
minus beta is 0.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:20.490
By definition of
the null space n,

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:23.790
the fact that alpha minus
beta is mapped into 0

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.480
means that alpha minus
beta belongs to n.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.350
And that's the same
as saying what?

00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.230
That alpha minus beta
is some element in n.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.880
Or alpha is beta plus
some element in n--

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.410
same thing as we asserted.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.540
By the way, another
interesting way

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.570
of seeing one to oneness
of a linear transformation

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.330
is that since the only way
that two elements can have

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.970
the same image is
for one of them

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:51.510
to equal the other plus
something that belongs to n,

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.750
the only way we can be
sure that alpha equals

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.420
beta is if this
element must be 0.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.060
You see, alpha
equals beta plus 0.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.990
We'll say that
alpha equals beta.

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:06.660
So in particular, if a linear
transformation is one to one,

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:10.080
the null space must
consist of 0 alone.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.620
And conversely, if the null
space consists of 0 alone,

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:16.240
the linear
transformation is 1 to 1.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.060
Notice, by the
way, the null space

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:21.420
can never be empty because
by our first property,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:25.320
we show that the 0 vector
is always mapped into 0.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.680
So at least the 0 vector
belongs to the null space.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.050
If other vectors belong
to the null space,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.600
the linear transformation
will not be 1 to 1.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.900
If 0 is the only vector that
belongs to the null space of f,

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:40.260
then the linear
transformation will be 1 to 1.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.630
Now, I think the time
has come to illustrate

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.000
some of these remarks in
terms of concrete examples.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.720
For my first
example, let's recall

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:54.000
that the mapping that maps
functions into their derivative

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.470
is a well-defined linear
transformation on the set

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:59.670
of differentiable functions.

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.270
Remember, the
derivative of a sum

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.648
is the sum of the derivatives.

00:11:02.648 --> 00:11:04.440
The derivative of a
scalar times a function

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.820
is a scalar times the
derivative of the function.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.970
In other words,
then, the mapping D,

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:14.740
which maps a function into its
derivative, is a vector space.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.310
It's a linear transformation
from one vector

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:18.880
space to another.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.690
In particular, what does
the null space look like?

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.820
The null space of
D must be what?

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.930
All functions f, such
that D maps f into 0.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:32.310
The only way that D of f
can be 0 is if f prime is 0.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.760
But f prime being identically
0 is the same as saying

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.360
f equals a constant.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.570
Therefore, the null
space in this case

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.880
is the set of all constants.

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:44.160
Notice, by the
way, the null space

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.140
does not consist of 0 alone.

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.750
It consists of infinitely
many numbers, namely

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:50.040
all the constants.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:52.620
By the way, that shouldn't
be too surprising

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.970
because after all, the
derivative is not a one to one

00:11:56.970 --> 00:11:59.520
mapping of
differentiable functions

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.930
into the set of functions.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.830
Namely, two different functions
can have the same derivative.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:06.780
In fact, what is the property?

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:12.480
For D of f to equal D of g,
it's necessary and sufficient

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.590
that f and g differ
by a constant.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:20.070
And notice that that's the same
as saying what we said before,

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.700
that for two elements
to have the same image

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:25.560
under a linear
transformation, they

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.220
must differ by, at most, an
element in the null space.

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:32.850
That's exactly what happens
in this particular example.

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.130
As a second example,
let's go back

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:38.970
to our study of linear
differential equations.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.590
We wanted to find the solution
of the equation L of y

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:44.970
equals f of x.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:49.080
Notice that L is a linear
transformation mapping

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.970
functions into functions.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.470
The interesting
point was, you may

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:56.550
recall, that we emphasized
the homogeneous equation,

00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:59.310
where the right-hand
side was replaced by 0.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.300
Notice that the null
space of the mapping L--

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.690
see, the null space--

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:04.500
namely what?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:09.113
All functions y that map
into 0 with respect to L.

00:13:09.113 --> 00:13:09.780
That means what?

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.310
L of y is 0.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:12.840
Well, the null
space is just what?

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.300
The solution set
of L of y equals 0.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.790
That's just the
homogeneous equation.

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.830
And to show you what
we mean by this,

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.440
notice what the general theory
was for linear differential

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.310
equations.

00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:26.850
Namely, the general solution
was the homogeneous solution

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.580
plus a particular
solution, noticing

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.470
that for the
homogeneous solution,

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.340
it was characterized
by the fact that it

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:34.920
belonged to the null space.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:37.620
Namely, L of y sub h was 0.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:41.220
The particular solution was
just anything in the space,

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:45.450
namely L of yp equals f of
x, same as we have over here.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.570
And so that structure for
linear differential equations

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:53.040
was not an exception, but
rather one concrete illustration

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.260
of what a really a
transformation means

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.210
in an abstract vector space.

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:01.140
As a third and final
and more visual example,

00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:05.310
let's go back to mapping the
xy plane into the uv plane.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:08.700
Let's suppose I take the
mapping u equals x plus y,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.820
v equals 2x plus 2y.

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:13.770
And notice, by the
way, that's just

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:17.070
another way of saying
v equals twice u.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.770
The induced function
is the one that

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:23.400
carries x comma
y in the xy plane

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:28.600
into u comma v in the uv plane,
so my induced function f bar

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:35.050
is the one that maps x comma y
into x plus y comma 2x plus 2y.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.390
w

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:41.110
And you can look at x comma
y as being the vector xi

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:43.570
plus yj in the xy plane.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.360
Or you can look at it as
being the point x comma

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:47.775
y in the xy plane.

00:14:47.775 --> 00:14:49.150
I don't care which
interpretation

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.570
you want to use there.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.300
But the point is,
what we now would

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.310
like to know in terms
of the null space

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.450
is what points x comma
y are mapped into 0,

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:03.070
0 in the uv plane under
the mapping f bar?

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.530
Or in terms of
vectors, what vectors

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:10.990
xi plus yj are mapped into the 0
vector under the mapping f bar?

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:16.420
Well, notice that for this
to be 0, we must have what?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.280
That both components are 0.

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.750
That means that x plus y must
be 0 and that 2x plus 2y is 0.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:25.610
But of course, that's the
same as this condition.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:30.940
In other words, f bar of x
comma y is 0, meaning what?

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:37.300
It's mapped into the origin
if and only if x plus y is 0.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.800
In other words, the
null space of f bar

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.400
is the set of all points
in the plane x comma y

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.530
for which x plus y equals 0.

00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:49.810
Or again, if you want to
state this vectorially,

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.080
it's all vectors xi
plus yj in the xy

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.770
plane, for which x plus y is 0.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:59.140
And what this means
pictorially is this.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.170
Notice that the set n is
nothing more than what we

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.470
call the line y equals minus x.

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:08.430
In the set of all points x comma
y, such as x plus y equals 0,

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:10.780
is the same as the set
of all points x comma y,

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:12.700
such that y equals minus x.

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.670
y equals minus x, or
x plus y equals 0,

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.680
is a straight line
through the origin.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.420
Notice again that key point.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.240
f of 0 must be 0 for a
linear transformation.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.370
If that line didn't
pass through the origin,

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:26.500
the mapping wouldn't be linear.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.260
Now, notice, by the way,
if I come back here,

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:32.830
the mapping defined
by u and v maps

00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:37.130
the xy plane into the
single line v equals 2u.

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.730
In other words, the
xy plane is mapped

00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:42.700
into the line v equals 2u.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.940
And the entire line
x plus y equals 0

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.290
is mapped into the
origin over here.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.180
In other words, the null
space here is an entire line.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:53.080
What line is it?

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.270
It's the line x plus y equals 0.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.280
Why is it called the null space?

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.280
It's called the null space
not because it has no points,

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.610
but rather because its image
consists of the single point

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:06.430
0 in the uv plane.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.170
And by the way, notice again
the parallelism here and that

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.420
which would happen when we
studied linear differential

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:14.420
equations.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:16.030
Let's suppose for
the sake of argument

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.790
that I want to find all points x
comma y that map into the point

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.589
1 comma 2 in the uv plane.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.230
Essentially, what I want is
a particular solution here.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:29.890
I would like to find one point
that maps into 1 comma 2.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:33.580
And my claim is that knowing
the null space, once I know one

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.530
such point, I know them all.

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:40.690
Well, one point that maps into 1
comma 2 trivially is 0 comma 1.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:46.090
Namely, 0 plus 1 is 1, and
twice 0 plus twice 1 is 2.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.550
So 0, 1 is mapped into 1
comma 2 by the mapping f bar.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:55.480
Now the question is, what other
points map into 1 comma 2?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:59.530
And the answer is it's every
point on the straight line

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:03.550
which passes through 0 comma
1 and is parallel to the line

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.920
x plus y equals 0.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.570
In other words,
the line x plus y

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:12.490
equals 1 is the line which
maps into the point 1 comma 2

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.290
under the mapping f bar.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:18.280
And the easiest way to see this,
I would say, is vectorially.

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.380
Pick any point on this line.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.990
Look at it as a vector.

00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:26.470
That vector is the sum
of these two vectors.

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.410
This vector, being a
member of the null space,

00:18:32.410 --> 00:18:34.070
is mapped into--

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.570
I'm sorry.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:36.710
I don't want to do it this way.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:38.220
I'd rather do it-- excuse me.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.880
I'd rather do it this way.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.180
I want to utilize the fact
that I know that this vector is

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:45.520
mapped into this vector.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.210
So I'll break down this vector
into components this way.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:53.590
I'll take one component
like this and one like this.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:57.910
You see, this component here is
indeed the same as this vector

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.930
because these two
lines are parallel.

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:04.150
So therefore, f of this is
f of this plus f of this.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:08.080
By linearity, that's f
of this plus f of this.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.200
This being a vector in the
null space maps into 0,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.640
so the image is just whatever
f of this happens to be.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.230
You see the idea again?

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.450
Call this vector,
if you will, alpha.

00:19:19.450 --> 00:19:21.310
Call this vector here beta.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.740
f of alpha plus
beta is f of alpha,

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:27.430
which is 0, because alpha
is in the null space,

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:31.030
plus f of beta, which
is just 1 comma 2.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.970
Again, I think I've made
too much of a mountain out

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.850
of a molehill, not because
this isn't important,

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.240
but because you will recall
back in our block four

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.260
treatment of linear equations,
linear algebraic equations,

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:45.880
we discussed things like this.

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.890
And I don't want to
get too deeply involved

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.390
in reviewing the details.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.460
What I am interested
in seeing is

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.390
that you see the structure of
what a null space really is.

00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:57.400
And by the way,
let's continue on

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.310
with what the properties
of a linear transformation

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.445
happen to be.

00:20:01.445 --> 00:20:03.070
Let's leave this go
for the time being.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.210
That's enough in
terms of examples.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.470
Let's go on with the properties.

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:11.740
Our fourth property is that
if V is a vector space,

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.940
and we pick a particular
basis, u1 up to un,

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:17.710
then V is neatly determined.

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.400
I say "neatly determined" by
its effect on the basis vectors

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.810
u1 up to un.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.850
What I mean by neatly
determined is the following.

00:20:25.850 --> 00:20:27.400
Let's do a specific example.

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.950
Suppose for the sake of
argument that n is 2.

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.720
Let's look at V, which has
as its basis u1 and u2.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.730
Pick any vector little v and
v. Relative to u1 and u2,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.450
v has a unique representation
x1u1 plus x2u2.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.230
f of v by the linear
property of f-- f

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.160
being a linear transformation--
is simply what? x1 f

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.130
of u1 plus x2 f of u2.

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.930
And notice that once we know
what f does to u1 and u2,

00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:02.680
we now know what it does to
every vector in the space.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.760
Namely, you see, to
find what f does to V,

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.120
we simply look at
the same vector as V,

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.520
only with u1 and u2 replaced
by f of u1 and f of v2.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.560
And by the way,
because we can do this,

00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:20.380
it implies that
linear transformations

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.650
may be represented also
very conveniently in terms

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:25.150
of matrix notation.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.990
And I think that both of these
last two remarks, 4 and 5,

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.680
can be best illustrated
in terms of an example.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.925
Let me first give you a
fairly abstract example

00:21:35.925 --> 00:21:37.840
so that you see the terminology.

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.610
And then I'll make
this more concrete.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:43.435
And the concrete example will be
our finale for today's lesson.

00:21:43.435 --> 00:21:48.370
But first of all, by
means of an example--

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:49.360
example number 4.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.710
Again, let V be a
two-dimensional space

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.570
with u1 and u2 as a basis.

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.700
Let's assume now for
the sake of argument

00:21:57.700 --> 00:22:03.390
that the linear transformation
f maps V into V itself--

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.810
in other words, that V and
W are equal in this case,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.090
just for the sake of argument.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:08.320
Now, what did I just say?

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.260
I said before that
the transformation

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.780
is uniquely determined
once we know what it does

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:15.910
to each element of a basis.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.670
What does f do to u2 and u2?

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.730
Well, since f is
mapping V into V,

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.880
and since this implies
that every vector in V

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.910
is going to be with respect
to a coordinate system u1,

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.840
u2, what I do know is that
whatever f of u1 and f of u2

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.480
are, they are linear
combinations of the basis

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.970
vectors of V u1 and u2.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.700
So let's say for the sake
of argument that f of u1

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.100
is this linear
combination. f of u2

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.870
is this linear
combination, where we're

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:48.220
using the usual double subscript
notation that seems to indicate

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.560
a matrix treatment coming up.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.140
Well, let me show you
now what happens next.

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:56.440
Let's suppose we again
pick our arbitrary vector

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.030
and fix it-- some
arbitrary vector

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:02.920
V in our space V. Let's suppose
that relative to u1 and u2,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.830
that vector v is x1u1 plus x2u2.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:10.090
Well, we just saw that
f of v must therefore

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:14.290
be x1 f of u1 plus x2 f of u2.

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:17.290
But now, we know what f
of u1 and f of u2 look

00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:21.730
like explicitly as linear
combinations of u1 and u2.

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.720
And therefore, simply by
substituting these expressions

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.040
for f of u1 and f of u2
in here, leaving again

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.460
the details for you
to verify, I find

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.880
that relative to a
2-tuple notation, where

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:40.820
we're using u1 and u2 as our
basis vectors, that f of v

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:48.690
is x1a11 plus x2a21
comma x1a12 plus x2a22.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.520
Now, this, at first
glance, may not

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.620
seem to suggest a matrix to you.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.300
But at second
glance, hopefully it

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:02.930
will, namely, if I look at
the matrix a11, a21, a12, a22.

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:06.110
And notice, by the way, now,
a very important subtlety

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.040
that's come up here.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.690
In the past, the
matrix has always

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:15.830
been written a11, a12, a21,
a22 to match the coefficients

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.280
as they occur in these
expressions, here.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.740
But notice, I know what
the answer has to be.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.120
It has to be this.

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:26.060
All I'm saying is if you look
at this particular matrix,

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:26.720
this is what?

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.230
A11, x1 plus a21, x2.

00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:33.470
And if you want the matrix to
represent the right 2-tuple,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:35.210
it has to be written this way.

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:38.480
By the way, this is
a two-row matrix.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:40.700
To make the thing come
out exactly right,

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.640
I simply take the
transpose of this.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.400
In other words, notice that
this, without the transpose,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.390
comes out to be two
rows and one column,

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:52.100
where this is the first
row, this is the second row.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.550
To make this look exactly right,
I put the transpose in here.

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.950
By the way, remember
that we have already

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:04.850
seen that to take the transpose
of the product of two matrices

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.390
A, B, it's B
transpose A transpose.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:10.040
So the transpose would be what?

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.970
You transpose this, which
is x1, x2, and multiply that

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:20.540
by the transpose of this,
which is a11, a12, a21, a22.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.330
In other words, if you
do want this matrix

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:26.720
to look exactly like the matrix
of coefficients, what we're

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.010
saying is you are going to
have to write the vector x1, x2

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.250
on the left-hand side rather
than on the right-hand side.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:37.850
And by the way, that's
why in many textbooks that

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.860
deal with matrix
algebra and the like,

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.500
they always put the variable
on the left-hand side.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.080
It's because if you put the
variable on the left-hand side,

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:47.030
you can identify
the matrix as it

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:51.680
stands with the matrix of
coefficients verbatim, here.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.570
If you don't do
that, if you want

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.750
to write the x1,
x2 on the right,

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:59.780
then you have to remember
that the matrix that you're

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.070
multiplying it by has its first
column, not its first row,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.950
representing f of u1,
and its second column

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:08.780
representing f of u2.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.260
And now, let's illustrate
that by means of a still more

00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:14.610
concrete example.

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:18.590
Let's again let f be a
linear transformation

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:24.680
that maps V into V. Again,
let's assume that V is given

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.590
in terms of a basis u1 and u2.

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:31.220
But let's become more concrete
now and replace the as

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.660
by specific numbers.

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:35.330
Let's assume, for example,
that we know that f of u1

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.550
is 3u1 plus 4u2.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:40.940
f of u2 is 5u1 plus 7u2.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.400
What we're saying now
is that by linearity, we

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.620
know exactly what f does
to every vector in V,

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.720
simply in terms of
what it does here.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.230
Now, let's see how that works.

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.130
Let me pick an arbitrary
vector in capital V. Let's say,

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.120
for example, it's 2u1 plus u2.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.660
According to my theory of the
previous example, what must

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.790
f of V equal?

00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:10.280
Well, what I do is I take the
matrix whose first column has

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:13.340
3 and 4 as entries and
whose second column

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.830
has 5 and 7 as entries.

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:20.270
And I multiply that by
the column matrix 2, 1.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:23.420
And to make this come
out to be a row vector,

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.760
I take the transpose of this.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.930
And that, indeed, does
turn out to be what?

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:31.015
3 times 2, 5 times 1.

00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:32.180
That adds up to 11.

00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.290
4 times 2 is 8.

00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:34.550
7 times 1 is 7.

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.780
That adds up to 15.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.320
That's the vector 11 comma
15, relative to the basis

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.670
u1 and u2.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:43.340
Again, if you
don't like the idea

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:46.790
of having to
transpose this, if you

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.540
want to be able to write the
matrix 3, 4, 5, 7 directly,

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.690
the way you do it is write
that matrix directly.

00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:58.640
But now, write the vector v as
a row vector on the left side

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.100
of this matrix.

00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:00.600
You see?

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.308
Again, I'll get the
same answer, won't I?

00:28:02.308 --> 00:28:03.770
2 times 3 is 6.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.150
1 times 5 is 5.

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.550
6 plus 5 is 11.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.110
2 times 4 is 8.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.520
1 times 7 is 7.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.500
I get 15.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:14.690
Now, whichever way I do
this, notice that f of v

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:17.450
is 11u1 plus 15u2.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.640
And notice also, there
was nothing sacred

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:23.540
about this choice of v. I
just picked a concrete example

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:28.130
to show you how I can determine
what the image of any vector

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:30.830
v with respect to the
linear transformation f

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:34.370
looks like once I know
the matrix of coefficients

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:37.700
of f relative to
the basis u1 and u2.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:40.280
By the way, in
every lecture so far

00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:44.120
I've been coming back to
this rather difficult point

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.810
that everything seems to
depend on what basis we choose.

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.670
And the interesting
point is that whereas

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.930
a linear transformation
is defined independently

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.590
of any coordinate system,
the matrix that represents

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.370
that linear transformation
does indeed depend

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:01.780
on the coordinate system.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.730
For example, let
me just say that.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:06.970
The matrix of f does depend on
the basis that you've chosen.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.070
And by means of
an example, let's

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:15.710
let f u1, u2, and v be the same
as in the previous exercise.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.900
Remember what that is, now.

00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:20.140
Now, I'm going to pick a new
basis for my vector space

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.160
v. In fact, let's call
capital V the same thing, too.

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:27.080
Let all this be the same as
in exercise 5, example 5.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.740
Now, I'm going to pick a new
basis, alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:34.300
Relative to u1 and u2,
alpha 1 is 2u1 plus 3u2.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.520
Alpha 2 is u1 plus u2.

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.560
Since these are not
constant multiples of one

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.560
another, alpha 1 and alpha
2 are linearly independent.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.390
Because they're
linearly independent,

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.210
they form a basis
because they are what?

00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.740
The dimension of V is 2.

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:50.800
And so any set of two
linearly independent vectors

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:53.890
in a two-dimensional space
will be a basis for that space.

00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:57.190
So I now have a new basis
for V, alpha 1 alpha 2.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:00.130
By the way, in the same way
that I can express the alphas

00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:04.300
in terms of the us, I can invert
this by any method that I wish

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.160
and show that the
us can be expressed

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.590
in terms of the
alphas in particularly

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.450
in this particular manner.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.880
What this means now, of
course, is that V is still

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.410
the same vector space.

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:18.640
But I can view it as being with
respect to the basis alpha 1,

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.630
alpha 2.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.350
But it's the same vector space
that I had back in example 5,

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:27.520
when I was viewing this with
respect to the basis u1 and u2.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.740
Now the thing that
comes up now is can I

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.680
convert everything
from example 5

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:35.080
into the language of the alphas?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.480
For example, we knew in example
5 that v was 2u1 plus u2.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.480
But now, knowing what u1
and u2 look like in terms

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.270
of the alphas, I simply
make this substitution,

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.910
replacing u1 and u2
by what they look

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:50.440
like in terms of the alphas.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.460
And I conclude that in terms of
the alphas, v is minus alpha 1

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.150
plus 4 alpha 2.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.370
In other words, notice that
v is the 2-tuple minus 1

00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:04.290
comma 4 relative to the
basis alpha 1, alpha 2.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:08.920
But if the 2-tuple 2 comma
1 relative to u1 and u2 is

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.760
the basis--

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.450
but that we already knew
from the previous lecture

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:16.540
that this was the case,
that the 2-tuple depended

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.537
on the basis that was chosen.

00:31:18.537 --> 00:31:20.620
But now, I'd like to show
you that the matrix also

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.330
depends on the basis chosen.

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:25.180
Well, how do we
write f of v relative

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.950
to alpha 1 and alpha 2?

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:30.280
According to my general
theory, all I have to know

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:34.210
is what alpha 1 and
alpha 2 get mapped into.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:35.280
And then I'm home free.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.530
In other words, I would like
to know what f of alpha 1

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:39.430
and f of alpha 2
look like, but now

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.640
as linear combinations
of alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.330
All right, how do I do this?

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:48.970
How do I express f of
alpha 1 and f of alpha 2

00:31:48.970 --> 00:31:51.790
as linear combinations
of alpha 1 and alpha 2?

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.760
Well, from the previous
example, the easiest thing to do

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.610
is to express f of
alpha 1 and f of alpha 2

00:31:57.610 --> 00:31:59.470
in terms of u1 and u2.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.440
Namely, f of alpha 1 is what?

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.940
The matrix relative to
u1 and u2 is 3, 5, 4, 7.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:12.430
Alpha 1 written in u1 and u2
components is 2u1 plus 3u2.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:17.400
So f of alpha 1 is the
2-tuple 21 comma 29,

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.180
where this is
relative to u1 and u2.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.880
In other words, f of
alpha 1 is 21u1 plus 29u2.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.450
We know what alpha 1 and alpha
2 look like in terms of alpha 1

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:29.500
and alpha 2.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.210
We just were talking about that.

00:32:31.210 --> 00:32:35.620
Leaving the details to
you, replacing u1 and u2

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.830
by what they're equal to in
terms of alpha 1 alpha 2,

00:32:38.830 --> 00:32:43.360
we see that f of alpha 1 is
8 alpha 1 plus 5 alpha 2.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.740
We have now, you see,
expressed f of alpha 1

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:52.060
as a 2-tuple relative
to alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:58.590
In a similar way, f of alpha 2
is given by this, which, again,

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.510
replacing u1 and
u2 by what they're

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:04.080
equal to in terms of the
alphas, turns out to be this.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:10.470
So I now know the matrix
of f in terms of what

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.060
it does to alpha 1 and alpha 2.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:13.830
In fact, what will
that matrix do?

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:16.620
Writing it in terms of
the transposed idea here,

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:20.190
the first column of my
matrix will be 8, 5.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.950
The second column will be 3, 2.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:27.510
So the matrix now
of f is 8, 3, 5, 2.

00:33:27.510 --> 00:33:32.250
I multiply that by the vector v,
which as we just saw over here,

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:36.320
is minus 1 comma 4.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.750
If I carry out this
operation, I have what?

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:43.580
Minus 8 plus 12, which is 4,
minus 5 plus 8, which is 3.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.850
So f of v is now
the 2-tuple 4 comma

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.640
3 relative to the
basis alpha 1, alpha 2.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:54.920
In other words, f of v is
4 alpha 1 plus 3 alpha 2.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.900
And remembering that
alpha 1 was 2u1 plus 3u2,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:03.320
and that alpha 2 was u1 plus
u2, I can now as a check

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.100
convert this into us.

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:07.548
And I then find what?

00:34:07.548 --> 00:34:08.090
What is this?

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.739
8 plus 3 is 11.

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.020
12 plus 3 is 15.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.639
f of v is, indeed,
11u1 plus 15u2,

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:21.560
which does check with our
result of the example--

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.880
what number was it?

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:27.110
Example 5, the previous example,
where we did the same problem

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.400
in terms of the us.

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.580
And what I want
you to see is this.

00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:33.739
Obviously, v is a fixed vector.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:36.570
f is a fixed linear
transformation.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:39.260
So f of v must be
the same vector,

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.900
no matter what the basis is.

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:45.679
But in terms of one basis, f
of v is the 2-tuple 4 comma 3.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:50.060
In terms of another basis,
it's the 2-tuple 11 comma 15.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.909
In terms of one basis,
f is represented

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.760
by the matrix 8, 3, 5, 2.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.640
In terms of another
basis, f is represented

00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.190
by the matrix 3, 5, 4, 7.

00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:04.310
So what you see, indeed,
is nothing more than this--

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:06.080
that there are two
difficult problems

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.700
that we have to deal with.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.740
One problem, which
is relatively easy,

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.930
once you get the
basic ideas down,

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.330
is the fact that linear
transformations have nothing

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:15.900
to do with the basis.

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.400
You see?

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:19.640
It's defined for a vector space.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:22.050
But the difficult point
is that in many cases

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:24.080
we are dealing with
a specific basis.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.360
In the middle of a problem,
we change from one basis

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.290
to another.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.420
Consequently, the
basis that represents

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.350
the linear transformation
will, in general, change,

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:35.960
as we go from one
representation to another.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.050
And this is where a lot of
computational difficulty

00:35:39.050 --> 00:35:40.340
seems to creep in.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.820
Again, I will hammer this
home during the exercises.

00:35:43.820 --> 00:35:46.700
But for now, what I hope you
have gotten out of this lecture

00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:50.840
is the overall view of what
a linear transformation means

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:53.570
and how, in terms
of vector spaces,

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.700
the concept of linearity
finds a very nice unified home

00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.540
to live in.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:04.770
At any rate then, until
next time, goodbye.

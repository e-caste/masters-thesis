[CLICKING]

00:00:18.389 --> 00:00:20.390
PROFESSOR: So I'm
going to come to 8.20--

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.350
Special Relativity.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.260
It's a great pleasure to
introduce David Kaiser.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.520
David is a faculty in
the physics department.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.780
He's also a
historian of science.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.080
So he's in a super
great position

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.830
to talk about Einstein
and special relativity

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.210
and give kind of the
frame for this class.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.290
So please welcome David.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.247
And take it along.

00:00:44.247 --> 00:00:45.080
DAVID KAISER: Great.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.200
Well, hello, everyone.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.000
Happy New Year.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.640
Welcome back at least
virtually to MIT.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.070
It's really a great pleasure
to talk with you today

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.920
about this material.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.260
I love this material.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.500
So hopefully you can all
see that first slide--

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.030
smiling Einstein on the bicycle.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.470
OK.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.290
So I want to talk about
three main parts today

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.580
for the material.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.900
And we'll talk about
how all of the most

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.600
accomplished physicists were
thinking about motion of bodies

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.020
through space and time
during the middle, late years

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.200
of the 19th century, roughly,
say, 100 to 150 years ago,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.110
give or take, because
that really sets up

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.930
a pretty sharp contrast
with how at the time

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.270
a rather young and
very little known

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.660
person named Albert Einstein
began asking similar questions

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.620
but often in very
different ways.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.620
So we'll start with some
of this context of what

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:40.350
was happening before Einstein
even came on the scene

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.380
to help us better make sense
of why his approach seemed

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.500
really so unfamiliar and
so surprising at the time.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.350
And then for the last part--

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.780
I find it really
fascinating, drawing on work

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.450
from some of my friends and
colleagues, other historians--

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.150
we'll try to ask, what was
going on with Einstein?

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.740
Why was Einstein's
approach so different?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740
And can we make sense of
it since it wasn't just

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.260
the ordinary routine that we
might have otherwise expected?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.650
That's that last part
about coordinating clocks.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.470
Well, let's jump right in.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.970
Let's start not
with Albert Einstein

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.500
but with another very familiar
name, James Clerk Maxwell.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.012
I thought about growing a
beard like that during COVID.

00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:17.220
I haven't made much progress.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.020
But that's a typical 19th
century, fine Cambridge beard--

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.640
Cambridge, England.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.950
So we all know Maxwell's name.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.830
Many of you probably
own a t-shirt

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.800
with Maxwell's equations on it.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.000
If you do, I'm very jealous.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.042
I don't have one anymore.

00:02:34.042 --> 00:02:37.440
Anyway, so we still
use his approach

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.590
to electromagnetism, as of
course you all know very well.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.360
And we've been able
to boil it down

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.300
to basically a tweet
or a single t-shirt.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.980
It turns out, as
you may know, what

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.450
we now call Maxwell's equations
were hammered out by Maxwell

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.160
and actually some
other colleagues

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.130
during the 1860s
and early 1870s,

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.620
so approximately 150 years ago.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.640
And in fact when he
first wrote them down,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.910
they weren't in such
a nice, compact form.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.620
It was in a 900-page, two-volume
treatise that was first

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.480
published in 1873--

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.640
two volumes, a
total of 900 pages.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.463
It was a weapon.

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:14.130
You could hurt someone
with these books,

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.740
it was so fat, even though
now we can boil it down

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.570
to a simple t-shirt.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.640
And so what's even
more interesting to me

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.090
is that even though we still
use Maxwell's equations, what

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.220
we think they say
about the world

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.080
is really, really
different than what

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.600
Maxwell and his
immediate circle thought.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.490
And the biggest
difference of all

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.580
is that for Maxwell and really
for all of his contemporaries

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.420
and his students, the equations
of electricity and magnetism,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.820
as far as they were
concerned, had everything

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.940
to do with some
physical substance,

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.300
a medium that they called
the ether that they assumed

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.600
must be spread evenly
throughout the entire universe,

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.190
filling every nook
and cranny of space.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.310
So all of the phenomena
that we would associate

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.030
with electricity or magnetism,
the flow of currents,

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.970
the splaying of iron
filings around a bar magnet,

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.240
and even much more
complicated things,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:10.650
to Maxwell and his group,
these were all just

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.420
evidence of the state of
stress of this underlying

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.140
physical medium.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.709
It was like a springy,
substantial, resistive medium

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:21.185
that they called the ether.

00:04:21.185 --> 00:04:23.310
And he says that in the
opening pages, for example,

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.130
of his now very famous
treatise and throughout,

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.830
that the whole point of studying
this field, as far as he

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.610
was concerned, was to study the
behavior of the distribution

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.850
of stress in this medium
extending continuously

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.400
throughout the
universe, the ether.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.050
It wasn't just Maxwell.

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.100
His a little bit more senior
colleague, William Thomson,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.160
who went on to be known as
Lord Kelvin, like the Kelvin

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.870
temperature scale
and many things

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.460
we still use from
Thomson's work,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.330
he wanted to give a
sense to non-scientists

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.360
a few years later in
a popular lecture what

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.860
all the excitement was about.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.420
He said, here's
what we're doing.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.420
We want you to get a sense
for what we're doing.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.980
We're studying the physics of
this elastic, physical medium

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.240
called the ether.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.390
And he instructed his very
elite, very fancy audience

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.940
who went to one of
these popular lectures,

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.700
stick your hand in a bowl
of jelly, he tells them.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.642
And see how it
wiggles and vibrates

00:05:19.642 --> 00:05:20.850
as you move your hand around.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.080
That's the highest of high-end
physics in the 1860s and '70s.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.970
It was all about
understanding the behavior

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.840
of this elastic medium
called the ether.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.740
And that had very specific
follow-on implications

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.710
for this group.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.400
So one of the first things
that you all know already,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.640
one of the most exciting
features of Maxwell's work

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.710
that really got himself excited
and solidified his reputation

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.740
was this unexpected unification
that he put together

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.420
in the 1860s.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.160
Not only was there
a deep relationship

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.140
between electricity
and magnetism.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.050
That had been wondered about
but never really formalized.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.890
But even more surprising,
that these two areas,

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.260
electricity and
magnetism, were also

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.130
deeply associated with optics,
with the propagation of light.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.500
So it was Maxwell, as I'm
sure you know and probably

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.240
have already done
this on problem sets

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.770
by now yourselves--

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.510
using Maxwell's
equations, you can

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.220
derive the quantitative
behavior of light

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.110
as it travels through space.

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.530
Light, as Maxwell
intuited, was nothing

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.800
but a certain pattern
of propagating

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.380
electric and magnetic fields.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.160
Again, to Maxwell, these were
propagating in this material,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.570
physical ether.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.510
They were disturbances
propagating,

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.960
skittering through this physical
stuff that filled all of space.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.900
And in fact, by trying
to calculate the speed

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.830
with which disturbances would
travel through space based

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.510
on other properties
of the ether that he

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.177
and his colleagues
had already measured,

00:06:53.177 --> 00:06:55.410
basically sets up
like spring constants,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.900
he found that the
speed of propagation

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.930
would be equal to the
value that had already

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.470
been calculated many years
before for the speed with which

00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:06.130
light travels.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.000
And he says in his own words,
in this lovely old-fashioned

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.110
phrasing, "The velocity of
transverse undulations"--

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.240
a certain kind of wave--

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.480
"in our hypothetical
medium agrees so exactly

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.760
with the velocity
of light calculated

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.000
from optical experiments"--
mostly astronomy at the time--

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.370
"that we can scarcely
avoid the inference

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.910
that light consists of
the transverse undulations

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:32.490
of the same medium
which is the cause

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.200
of electric and
magnetic phenomena."

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.060
That's why his book
was 900 pages, right?

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.110
Today we can put
in on a t-shirt.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.527
He was really just walking
through this very old fashioned

00:07:39.527 --> 00:07:41.340
language to come
to the point saying

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.140
light was nothing but a certain
kind of pattern in the ether.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:49.320
And so in fact they often
called this not just the ether

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.970
but an even fancier name.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.070
They called it the
luminiferous ether.

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.730
And from the Latin, it
means "light bearing"

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.080
or "light carrying."

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.190
So "lumin", like "lumos" for
you Harry Potter fans, that part

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:03.240
you probably recognize.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.730
And the "ferous" is
like a Ferris wheel.

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:10.690
That means, like, to carry
or to move through space.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.130
So this was the light-bearing
or light-carrying ether.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.840
And that's what
Maxwell and really all

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.580
of his contemporaries
were convinced

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.160
was most exciting
about Maxwell's work,

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.720
that this was a way
of characterizing

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.470
the state of the ether including
these optical phenomena.

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:30.180
OK, so that's where things
stood in the 1860s and 1870s.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.830
But that led to a whole
new set of questions.

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:36.480
And the next generation
quite understandably

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.039
wanted to kind of
follow up on that

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.880
and ask ways to
generalize that framework.

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.010
Maxwell's work
had really assumed

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:46.800
that there was no relative
motion between either

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.348
the source of light or
the receiver of light,

00:08:49.348 --> 00:08:51.390
that everything was analyzed
in what we would now

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:55.530
call the same rest frame,
or frame of reference,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.060
as the ether itself.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:59.640
But of course that wasn't
the most general situation,

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:04.200
as Maxwell's own contemporaries
or the next younger generation

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.790
began to wonder about.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:08.250
One of the most influential
of that next wave

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.800
is this gentleman shown
here, Hendrik Lorentz

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.320
from the Netherlands,
from Leiden.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.830
So Lorentz wanted to ask about
the electrodynamics of moving

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:17.340
bodies.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.000
What if either the emitter of
light or the receiver or both

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.630
were moving with respect to
this all-pervasive medium?

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.760
And so Lorentz,
as we'll see, had

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:29.970
really two distinct
motivations in mind

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.420
when he tried to think about
the electrodynamics of moving

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:37.380
bodies, or let's say optics for
moving sources or receivers.

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.095
He had a kind of mathematical
set of quandaries.

00:09:40.095 --> 00:09:42.870
And we'll talk
about those first.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.600
But he also had a series of very
puzzling experimental results.

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.900
So he had an
empirical set of ideas

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:51.000
that we'll come to in a
moment and also these more

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.380
formal or mathematical.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.750
We'll start with the math.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.050
Lorentz was really one of
the best-trained, leading

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.390
mathematical
physicists of his age.

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.150
So he knew very well how
to handle relative motion.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.330
Galileo had derived
that in the 1610s.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:09.510
That was hardly
news in the 1890s.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.570
We would do what we still
call the Galileo-Newton

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.670
transformation.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.770
For example, Galileo
wrote very famously

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:20.580
in his charming dialogues
in the 17th century,

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.850
if you watch your friend float
down a river on a boat that

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:26.850
moves at a constant speed,
neither speeding up nor slowing

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:28.890
down, then you
know very well how

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.760
to compare the coordinates
between you, sitting

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.280
at rest on the
bank of that river,

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.670
and your friend as she
floats down on her boat,

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.280
that what you call the
origin, the spatial origin,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.730
of your coordinate system, you
can fix at, say, x equals 0.

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.460
But your friend could call
the center of her boat

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.530
the origin for her
coordinate system.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.450
And then you can see how
her system coordinates will

00:10:53.450 --> 00:10:55.320
move with respect to yours.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.530
If the boat moves
at a constant speed,

00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.650
little v, then you
just have to calculate

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:04.430
the offset between where the
origin, the center of her boat,

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.000
is as it floats further
and further down the river.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.260
So what she calls the origin
of her spatial coordinates

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.050
will be offset from yours
because this relative motion,

00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.550
this relative drift.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.100
Meanwhile, as Newton
himself famously said

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:22.520
in the beginning
of his Principia

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.370
where we learn about
Newton's laws of mechanics,

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.900
that time is time is time.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.460
There's some absolute time.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.950
He actually referred it
to the sensorium of God.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.080
He thought there was only one
possible time to consider.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.690
And so formally
there'd be no change

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:37.940
to the rate at which
your clock ticked

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.730
versus the rate at which
your friend's clock ticked

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:41.810
on her boat.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:44.180
This is called the
Galileo-Newton transformation.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:45.380
I made a big deal out of it.

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:47.380
You probably would have
done this in your sleep.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.260
Lorentz did this in his sleep.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:51.085
However, it drove
him to nightmares

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.460
because when he
then applied this

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.770
to Maxwell's really
beautiful and much newer

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.780
set of equations for
things like optics

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:00.020
or the propagation of electric
and magnetic disturbances

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.180
in the ether, he
found that in that

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.220
transformed reference
frame if you

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:07.550
take into account that relative
motion between either emitter

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:11.300
or receiver of light, then
Maxwell's beautiful description

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.470
of light, his quantitative
description, looked very ugly.

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:17.330
And in particular,
it would no longer

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.300
suggest that light should
behave as oscillating

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:21.770
sines and cosines.

00:12:21.770 --> 00:12:23.760
It worked beautifully
with Maxwell's equations

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.090
if you look only at both sources
and receivers of light that

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.880
are fixed in place and
not moving with respect

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:32.870
to the ether.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.560
Once you apply the very, very
well-known transformation

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.330
to take into account
relative motion,

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:41.120
then your description of
light gets all literally out

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.020
of whack.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:44.750
And this was a mathematical
conundrum for Lorentz.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.060
It didn't seem to make any
sense because on the Earth,

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.762
on the moving Earth presumably
moving through the ether,

00:12:50.762 --> 00:12:52.220
he and his colleagues
could measure

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.590
light to behave like beautiful
sines and cosines all the time.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:00.170
So we have an empirical reminder
that Maxwell's description

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:03.260
seems really, really accurate
for describing optics

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.020
even on our own moving
ship of the Earth.

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:08.340
So this is a real
conundrum for him.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.760
He was a very, very
clever, mathematically

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.860
gifted physicist.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:15.080
So he introduced a
mathematical clue.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:20.210
He introduced a mathematical
stopgap to address this.

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:22.160
He called it local time.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.140
And he was actually very
clear in his writings.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:26.160
He said it was a
mathematical fiction--

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:26.660
his word.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:29.780
It was literally just
a mathematical trick.

00:13:29.780 --> 00:13:31.970
If he introduced a
new transformation

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:35.840
for the time variable, so when
you compare your coordinates

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.770
with those of your
friend on the boat,

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.600
what if you actually did make
a transformation of t prime,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.580
not just of x prime?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:45.650
And the transformation
he kind of worked out,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.690
he reverse engineered
the form it

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.690
would need to have so
that Maxwell's description

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.470
of light waves would be
restored to the very simple form

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:57.600
that Maxwell himself had written
down a few years earlier.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.810
So this is where we still
call this the Lorentz

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:00.590
transformation.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:01.550
Many of you might have seen it.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.717
If not, you'll have plenty
of time to learn about it

00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:05.480
and practice it during IAP.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.490
We call it Lorentz,
not Einstein,

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:10.820
because Lorentz derived these
equations first in a series

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.250
of papers in the 1890s.

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.340
And he was responding to this
question of the electrodynamics

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:17.300
of moving bodies.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:20.630
How do you preserve this
beautiful description of light

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.080
from Maxwell even if there's
relative motion with respect

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.100
to the ether?

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.190
He said it was a trick.

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:27.380
It was merely mathematics.

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:31.180
But it would at least
get the right form back.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.540
So that was the
mathematical motivation.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.730
Lorentz, as we know,
was also concerned

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.180
about an empirical or
experimental curiosity.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:41.850
He was following
very closely the work

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:44.460
of a US-based physicist
named Albert Michelson.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.270
Michelson's story is
really fascinating.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.290
I won't take too much time
now, but super interesting.

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:53.010
He was actually an immigrant
from what's now Germany,

00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:55.650
was often part of
Poland, central Europe.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:58.050
He moved to the US when he
was about two years old, very

00:14:58.050 --> 00:14:59.910
young, and was raised
right around the time

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.932
of the gold rush in California.

00:15:01.932 --> 00:15:03.390
And before I get
carried away, I'll

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:04.800
stop talking about
Michelson, although he's

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.670
super interesting.

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.400
So what Michelson
wound up doing was

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.250
he was fascinated by this
question of Maxwell waves,

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.730
of waves of electricity
and magnetism in the ether.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.920
And he was convinced that
if we are on this moving

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.560
ship of the Earth moving
through the ether,

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.370
that should have a measurable
impact on the light waves

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:27.600
that we can produce and
measure here on Earth.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.250
So he set really his life's
goal starting from very,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.850
very early trying
to build devices,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.550
extremely sensitive
instruments with which

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.530
he could measure the
fact that the Earth was

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.080
moving through this ether.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.090
Like all his
contemporaries, Michelson

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.820
believed without any
hesitation that there must

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.030
exist the material, the ether.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:51.630
What else could light waves be
but disturbances in the ether?

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:53.820
And then he figured
that much like

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.540
if a bicyclist going
for a bike ride,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.040
we should be able
to tell that we're

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.550
moving through that medium.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.390
So before I describe his device
called the interferometer,

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:06.300
let me just give a little more
of an analogy for why Michelson

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.690
was so convinced there should
be a measurable effect.

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:12.900
If we walk outside our houses,
which is now a luxury--

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.000
we can still do
it with masks on--

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.930
walk outside on a still day when
there's no wind or no breeze,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.090
we won't feel any
particular wind on our face

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.660
if we're standing still.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.460
So we're outside in
a physical medium.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.230
There's a physical atmosphere.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.740
But if we're at rest with
respect to that atmosphere,

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.620
if there's no wind, we
don't feel it on our face.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.170
On the other hand, if
it's still a still day,

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.780
there's no breeze, when
we get on our bicycle

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.290
and pedal really quickly, we'll
now feel a breeze on our face

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.290
because we're moving through
that physical medium.

00:16:43.290 --> 00:16:45.510
We're moving through
the Earth's atmosphere.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:47.670
Even if the atmosphere
seems to be perfectly

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.920
at rest, no strong
breeze, no hurricane,

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.560
whatever, if we're going
quickly enough through it,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.450
we'll feel a breeze on our face.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.950
And Michelson thought
the same thing

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.930
should be happening
for light waves

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:01.980
as they are carried by the
Earth through this medium, not

00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:05.400
the Earth's atmosphere but this
all-pervasive, light-bearing

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:06.240
ether.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.430
So he really thought it
would be like the bicyclist.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.000
Now, his real genius was
devising this device,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.800
we now call it the
interferometer,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.390
with which he could
try to measure

00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:19.140
the impact of that motion of
the Earth, the entire Earth,

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:20.640
through the medium.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.260
So he took a source of light.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:24.960
Today we use lasers
because they're awesome

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.640
and they're also monochromatic.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:30.540
Their light shines basically
at one frequency, or very

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.040
dominantly one frequency.

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.530
Lasers of course weren't
available to Michelson.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:38.040
So he used very bright
sodium arc lamps.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.580
Sodium lamps will shine
mostly at one dominant color,

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:43.770
not nearly so monochromatic
as modern lasers.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.600
But they were the industry
standard at the time.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:48.060
So he basically
took sodium lamps

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:51.270
that mostly shine a particular
yellow color, shined them

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.490
at what we now call
a beam splitter.

00:17:53.490 --> 00:17:56.340
It was a half-silvered
mirror, as its name implies,

00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:58.290
that would let half
the light through.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.240
It would act like a window
roughly half the time.

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.850
But it would act like a mirror
the other half of the time.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:07.050
So half of this incident beam
will go right through this

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:09.420
as if it were just
a plate of glass.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.010
It would be transmitted.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.470
It will then make its way to
a fully reflecting mirror--

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.385
sorry-- a fully reflecting
mirror at the end of the path.

00:18:16.385 --> 00:18:17.760
It'll be reflected
and come back.

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.400
And then, again, half
of that return light

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.910
will be reflected by the mirror
and come out to a screen.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.190
Meanwhile, you can run
the same kind of story

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:29.190
for light that gets
deflected towards path 2.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:32.400
From that same, single
incident source,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.900
half of the incident
beam will be

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:36.990
reflected by that beam splitter,
that half-silvered mirror.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.300
It'll travel a path down to a
fully reflecting mirror, come

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:40.800
back.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:43.900
And then half of that returning
light will be transmitted.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:46.350
So you have light coming
together on some detector

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:49.500
screen, that it started
out as a single light wave

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.350
from a single, nearly
monochromatic source.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.570
But you split it into
two beams so the beams

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.490
travel different paths.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.640
And now the light starts out
fully in phase with itself.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:00.660
It's one light beam.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.720
So crests are with crests
and troughs with troughs.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:05.580
And the idea was
that you then split

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:09.270
it to set up a race
to see if there

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.820
was any difference in
the travel for light

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:13.740
that traveled through
path 1 and out

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.750
to the screen versus
light that traveled

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.090
path 2 and back to the screen.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:21.420
All the light starts as a single
light wave in sync or in phase

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:22.380
with itself.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:25.110
If there was any
difference in the travels

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.970
of that light between
path 1 and path 2,

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:30.210
you should see a shift in
the interference pattern.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:33.120
Crests should no longer
arrive lining up with crests

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.210
or troughs with troughs.

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:35.877
You should see a very
characteristic set

00:19:35.877 --> 00:19:37.140
of interference fringes.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:38.880
What is called an
interferometer,

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.070
extremely sensitive.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:43.980
Now, his idea was if,
like the bicyclist,

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:47.700
we're on the moving Earth, then
the path is heading directly

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.720
into the ether.

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:51.780
That is, say, the path that's
along the Earth's motion

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.840
through the ether should be
just like the bicyclists feeling

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.260
the direct headwind of
that breeze directly

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.900
on her or his face.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:02.650
That means the effective speed--

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:05.160
let's say this is the direction
of the Earth's motion.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.080
The effective speed with
which this light beam

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.180
could travel toward
its mirror should

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:13.530
be experiencing a direct
headwind for its upward path

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.350
and a direct tailwind
for its downward path.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.290
It should have a different
speed than the light that

00:20:19.290 --> 00:20:22.530
follows the more orthogonal path
so that even the light starts

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.750
out perfectly in
phase, you should find

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.430
a shift in the
interference fringes

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:30.270
because the light's effective
speed through the medium

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.880
is different for
path 1 than path 2--

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:35.100
again, an analogy to the
ether wind of a bicyclist

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.060
through the atmosphere.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:39.820
Not only that-- a
little foreshadowing

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.050
for what's to come later--

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.240
this device is so
sensitive, it's

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.240
sensitive to second order
in a very small quantity.

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.790
So it could measure
differences to the second order

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:55.120
in the relative speed of, say,
the Earth through the ether

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.040
compared to the speed of light.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:00.220
So that's called a second
order because it goes

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.200
this small quantity squared.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.450
That's how sensitive this
really ingenious device was.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:06.280
And as many of
you might know, we

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:08.800
use interferometers all
the time now in all kinds

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.060
of industrial applications.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.010
Even more, my
favorite example is

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:16.510
from our friends who detect
gravitational waves with LIGO.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:19.060
That's essentially a
super-sized interferometer

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.610
with very, very similar
principles of design.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.670
So Michelson was doing
this really cool work.

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:26.350
It was among the
earliest work that any

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:29.050
of the super fancy,
elite European scientists

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.660
paid any attention to
coming out of the US.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.190
Michelson was
among the first who

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:36.250
made even the people like
Hendrik Lorentz sit up and pay

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:39.850
attention at a time when the US
was still otherwise pretty much

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.680
a scientific backwater.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.060
So it's a really cool idea.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.690
It's a remarkably clever
design for a device.

00:21:46.690 --> 00:21:48.670
Michelson built a
small prototype.

00:21:48.670 --> 00:21:51.760
Then he super sized it with
his colleague Edward Morley.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.130
They built a device
11 meters long

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.610
for each arm, so roughly
33 or 34 feet long--

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.940
huge, huge for its
day, very long arms.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.290
They floated the whole
thing in a vat of mercury,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.450
which I don't recommend.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.760
But they were trying to
tamp down any vibrations

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.040
from nearby cable cars.

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.320
They wanted to have a clean
laboratory environment.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:13.000
Then they did this
for years and years

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.340
and years, months and
months and years and years

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.780
because, of course,
you never know

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:21.040
what the ether's
actual rest frame is.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.690
Who's to say that
at this moment,

00:22:22.690 --> 00:22:24.348
this is the direction
of the Earth's

00:22:24.348 --> 00:22:25.390
motion through the ether?

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.300
Maybe it's this direction or
some other angle in between.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.790
They would look for day
to night variations.

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:32.590
They would look for
annual variations

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:34.840
as the Earth went around
its orbit around the sun.

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.890
They would try to find any
time, day or night, winter

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:41.710
versus spring, year
after year when

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.950
they could measure some
measurable offset or change

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.220
in those interference fringes
because at some point,

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.690
this direction
should have lined up

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:51.232
with the Earth's
direction of motion,

00:22:51.232 --> 00:22:52.750
even it wouldn't be every time.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:56.270
That's why they kept doing this
over and over and over again.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.370
And as you might know,
they found nothing.

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:06.010
So after years of
painstaking data collection,

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:10.330
they found no compelling
empirical evidence

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.640
of the Earth's motion
through the ether.

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.640
Michelson won the Nobel Prize
for this and related work.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.150
He was an astoundingly
accomplished experimentalist.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.010
He was the first
US-based physicist

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:22.660
to win the Nobel Prize.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.610
He lived 20 more
years after that

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:27.440
and died considering
himself a failure.

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.023
So I hope you all
win the Nobel Prize.

00:23:29.023 --> 00:23:30.732
And I hope you think
better of yourselves

00:23:30.732 --> 00:23:32.620
and give yourselves more credit.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.950
Michelson knew for certain
the ether must exist.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:38.140
And yet he had
failed to find it.

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.970
So Lorentz was following
this back in Europe.

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:43.300
And this was really his
second main motivation

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.820
to think about these
funny ways of handling

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.010
coordinates in what we now call
the Lorentz transformation.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:51.010
So I mentioned his
mathematical concerns

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.660
about the transformation
properties

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:54.550
of Maxwell's equations.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:57.783
He was also following
the Michelson-Morley work

00:23:57.783 --> 00:23:59.200
with great interest
and citing it.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.570
And we know he was really
following each update.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.730
So he was concerned
about this failure

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:08.043
to measure a shift in
the interference fringes.

00:24:08.043 --> 00:24:09.460
But Lorentz said,
oh, but actually

00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:12.080
maybe there's a physical
reason to account for that.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.040
If there really is, as
he knew there must be,

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.400
this physical, resistive
medium, kind of elastic medium

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.150
through which the Earth and
everything else is moving,

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:27.220
then there must be a force
exerted by that viscous medium

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:29.530
on every single
atom and molecule

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:32.350
making up all the stuff
in Michelson's device

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.010
as well as in everything else.

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:36.910
And so it would be like
picturing a beach ball.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:39.370
If you try to drag a
beach ball underwater,

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:42.400
in a resistive medium,
the shape will be deformed

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.730
along the direction of motion.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.600
If you drag that beach ball
fast enough underwater,

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.400
it will shrink in the
direction of motion.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.830
It will be deformed
like this picture here.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.710
And so Lorentz said
that must be happening

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:57.220
for every bit of matter
in the arm of Michelson's

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.880
interferometer that's most
subject to that resistive force

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.720
of the ether.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.013
There should be a contraction
along the direction of motion.

00:25:05.013 --> 00:25:06.430
So then, again
because he's a very

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:08.470
gifted mathematical
physicist, he

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:11.110
calculated exactly how
much shift must there

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:17.440
be for the resultant path to be
shortened just enough to make

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.610
it a tie race after all.

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.540
So the arm of the
interferometer that's

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:25.600
experiencing this
shrinking, this extra force

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.880
due to the resistive
medium, would

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.520
have to shrink by a
specific calculable amount.

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.285
We now use the
Greek letter gamma.

00:25:33.285 --> 00:25:34.660
If you haven't
seen that already,

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:37.620
you'll see it throughout IAP
and the rest of your life.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:40.050
It takes this somewhat
simple-looking form--

00:25:40.050 --> 00:25:44.790
1 over the square root of
1 minus v over c squared.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:46.800
If you plot it, you
can see it diverges.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.200
When the relative speed gets
close to the speed of light,

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.990
you have 1 minus 1
in the denominator.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.400
You divide by 0.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:54.210
Your eyes bug out.

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.230
And cats and dogs live together.

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:56.290
Everything goes crazy.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.650
So it diverges at v equals c.

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.240
On the other hand,
for small speeds,

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.250
small compared to
the speed of light,

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.130
this factor is
indistinguishable from 1.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.720
So here's a quick plot.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.450
For ordinary speeds that we
encounter on the highway,

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.760
let alone on a
bicycle, our speed

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.500
compared to the speed of
light is vanishingly small.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:18.150
So this factor gamma is
very, very close to 1.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.640
Only when you get to speeds
approaching the speed of light

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.820
would you expect to measure
any shift from that.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.010
Nonetheless, Lorentz
said in principle this

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.930
happens at any speed.

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.630
And the shrink, the
amount of contraction,

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.310
is governed by
that relative speed

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.440
given by this
Greek letter gamma.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.170
So gamma is always greater
than or equal to 1.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:41.670
That means 1 over gamma
must be smaller than 1.

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.950
And that's saying that the
contracted length of one

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.450
of those arms of
the interferometer

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.620
got shorter by a
certain amount depending

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.930
on the relative speed.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.080
That would be enough to
account for this null result,

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.010
Lorentz argued.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:58.080
It turned out that
exact form of gamma

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:03.030
was the same form he'd found
for his mathematical local time

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.050
manipulations.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.932
So here's how we can
live in a physical ether

00:27:06.932 --> 00:27:08.640
even though we don't
measure its effects.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.960
OK.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.870
Let me now shift to how
a different person began

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.510
thinking about very familiar
questions by that point

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:17.460
but coming at them
quite differently.

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.650
That's young Albert Einstein.

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:22.170
So Einstein was born in
the midst of all this.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.740
He was born in 1879
in kind of rural,

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:27.510
roughly speaking,
nowheresville Germany,

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:29.370
not near any of the big cities.

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:32.670
So Lorentz was already
a practicing physicist

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.230
when Einstein was born.

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:36.030
He was much younger.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.710
Einstein's main
ambition was actually

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.680
to become an electrical
engineer at a time

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.860
when that term itself
was actually brand new.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.830
Einstein's father and uncle
had gone into business

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.380
together in this
really brand new field

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.530
of electrical engineering.

00:27:50.530 --> 00:27:52.560
This was the age
of electrification.

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.260
Think about extended
street lighting,

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.730
trolley cars with the
shared electric lines above.

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:02.730
This was transforming
the face of everyday life

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:05.520
in cities and eventually
even in more rural areas.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.520
And Einstein's father and
uncle were in on that.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.497
They were early professionals
in this new field

00:28:10.497 --> 00:28:11.580
of electrical engineering.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.497
And Einstein loved it.

00:28:12.497 --> 00:28:17.100
He loved to tinker with
electrotechnical gadgets.

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.280
He had many strong
feelings about many things.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.020
Among them, he hated
what he considered

00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.650
the overly militaristic German
high school that he attended.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.157
He would argue and
insult his teachers.

00:28:28.157 --> 00:28:29.490
They didn't like him any better.

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:31.110
They were delighted
when he dropped out,

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.190
so they didn't have
to kick him out.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.290
He was really very
obnoxious, it turns out.

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.600
So he was a high-school dropout.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:42.368
He dreamed of entering the Swiss
Federal Technical Institute.

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:44.160
It was kind of like
the MIT of Switzerland.

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.123
Except to be more proper, MIT
is the Massachusetts version

00:28:48.123 --> 00:28:48.790
of their school.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.640
Zurich's was founded first.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.020
It's often called the ETH, or
the Eidgenossische Technische

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.080
Hochschule.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.330
It was really a very
elite technical university

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.250
in Zurich, Switzerland.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.260
Einstein, by this
point, had renounced

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:02.560
his German citizenship.

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.810
He dropped out of high school.

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:06.323
And one of the best things
about this technical university

00:29:06.323 --> 00:29:07.740
in Zurich was that
you didn't have

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.000
to have a high school diploma.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:09.750
He said, perfect.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.490
That's the place for me.

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:14.820
So they had an entrance exam,
which he very dutifully studied

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:17.160
for and then failed
because, after all, he

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.750
ignored the topics that
weren't of interest to him.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:22.560
He did well enough on
the physics and math

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.413
portions of the overall exam
that a kindly physics professor

00:29:27.413 --> 00:29:28.830
took him aside and
said, you know,

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.740
if you go to basically a
kind of regional, something

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.360
almost like a
community college, go

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.610
to a local, regional
school for a year,

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:37.792
study up, retake the
exam, you might do better.

00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:39.000
And that's what Einstein did.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.680
So he went to a
little regional school

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.610
in, again, in rural
Switzerland for a year,

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:46.690
took the exam again, and passed.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.330
So now he's able
to enter his dream

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:51.030
school, the ETH in Zurich.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:52.680
Once he then worked
so hard to get in,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.150
he proceeded to cut classes.

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:56.040
This guy was a horrible student.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.110
Whatever you do, don't
be like Albert Einstein,

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.213
at least while
you're in university.

00:30:00.213 --> 00:30:01.380
He worked so hard to get in.

00:30:01.380 --> 00:30:03.338
And then he, again, would
insult his professors

00:30:03.338 --> 00:30:05.430
as much as he'd insulted
his high school teachers.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.195
He thought everything
they did was boring.

00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:09.070
They didn't know what
was really interesting.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.862
So he would cut classes
and read on his own

00:30:10.862 --> 00:30:12.630
and then borrow notes
from his girlfriend,

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.240
his long, suffering, very
patient girlfriend, Mileva

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.970
Maric, who was doing very well
in her own physics and math

00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:18.470
courses.

00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.595
And likewise, he borrowed
notes from another friend

00:30:20.595 --> 00:30:21.690
of his, Marcel Grossmann.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:24.450
So he'd just cram and scrape
through for the exams.

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:26.550
Not an ideal student.

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.190
For some reason that Einstein
couldn't possibly fathom,

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:31.650
because he actually
was a dolt frankly,

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:34.320
he impressed none
of his professors.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.487
So when it came time to
graduate, none of them

00:30:36.487 --> 00:30:38.570
would write him a strong
letter of recommendation.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:42.860
Again, his life bears many
important lessons for us today.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:43.760
Attend class.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.760
And be slightly less
obnoxious to your instructors.

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.390
And maybe things
will turn out better.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:49.730
So none of his teachers
would basically

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.650
support him because
he had middling grades

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:53.610
and he was rude to them.

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.040
So he couldn't get a
job after graduation.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.250
So finally one of
his close friends,

00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:59.960
Marcel Grossmann,
one of the folks

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:03.470
from whom he'd borrowed notes,
his father had connections.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.240
And so basically
through connections,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.720
he was able to get Einstein
an entry-level civil service

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.810
job at the patent office
in Bern, Switzerland.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.320
So still in Switzerland.

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.867
He was a patent
officer, third class.

00:31:15.867 --> 00:31:18.200
As I'm always fond of saying,
there was no fourth class.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.900
You were the lowest
entry-level gig.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.570
So even for young Einstein,
it wasn't what you know.

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:24.980
It was who you know.

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:27.320
What he then
proceeded to do was he

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:29.060
had a day job at
what they called

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:32.570
the electrotechnical desk, much
like what his father and uncle

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.290
were doing.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.970
He was a patent
examiner for a lot

00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:37.490
of these cool, new
electrical gadgets.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:39.470
And then he would go
hang out with a bunch

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:43.610
of friends and drink
beer a lot at the pubs.

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.190
So they formed what they
called the Olympia Academy.

00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:47.780
And this was very ironic.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.275
They gave themselves
the most elite

00:31:49.275 --> 00:31:50.900
sounding name because
they're basically

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.760
three semi-bums
hanging out, reading,

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:54.680
and blowing off their families.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.318
So they gave themselves a
very, very prestigious name,

00:31:57.318 --> 00:31:59.360
even though it was literally
three recent college

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.310
graduates hanging out.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:04.310
It was Maurice Solovine,
Conrad Habicht,

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.200
and young Albert Einstein.

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.620
And they would go and sometimes
drink coffee, often drink beer,

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.750
and talk about
stuff they'd read.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.370
And they would read
a lot of physics

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:16.290
and read a lot of philosophy
and talk about it.

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:19.220
And one of the books that we
know from their correspondence

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.410
at the time that they
were really interested in

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:25.160
was this fascinating book
by an Austrian polymath

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.120
named Ernst Mach.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.120
Here's the book translated
into English, known

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.490
as The Science of Mechanics.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:33.710
It had come out in the 1880s.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.610
Mach was really remarkable.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:38.390
He was both a
mathematical physicist

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:39.680
and experimental physicist.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.110
You might know the
terminology for Mach number,

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.710
like speed of sound, Mach 1,
Mach 2, Mach 3-- same Mach.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.930
He did a lot of studies
of acoustics and optics

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.960
but also of what we would
now call psychology,

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.190
like sensory experiments
and so on, and eventually

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.543
medical surgery.

00:32:56.543 --> 00:32:57.960
And then at the
end of his career,

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.600
he was a professor of the
history and philosophy

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.100
of science.

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.650
This guy did it all.

00:33:01.650 --> 00:33:05.930
He wrote these very, very
dense, conceptual critiques

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.790
of Newtonian physics,
among other things.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:12.200
And Mach was convinced
that Newton was really

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.330
getting himself into
a horrible muddle

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:16.370
because he had not paid
sufficient attention

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:17.450
philosophically.

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.120
And this is what the young
members of the Olympia Academy

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.260
got really excited about.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.020
We know from their letters
and their notes at the time.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.050
Mach was advocating
a position that

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:29.450
came to be known as positivism.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.360
According to Ernst Mach,
unlike Isaac Newton,

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:36.320
or for that matter even some
folks like Maxwell, Mach

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.360
argued that only quantities
that could become objects

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.360
of positive experience,
that is to say things we

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:45.530
could actively measure or
sense or feel or touch,

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:48.860
only those things belonged
in our scientific theories.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.620
Anything else was just
like mere speculation,

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:53.660
like counting the number
of angels that could

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:54.785
dance on the head of a pin.

00:33:54.785 --> 00:33:57.290
He was scathingly
critical of Newton.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.960
And in particular,
Mach wrote in detail

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.600
that Newton's notions
of absolute space

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.000
and absolute time had no
meaning because how could you

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.290
ever measure absolute time?

00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:08.960
Show me the clock that
could measure absolute time.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.449
That was the kind of
classic Machian response.

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:14.540
I can measure the passage
of time by using a clock.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.239
But who says that's what
Newton wrote absolute time was?

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:22.699
This had an amazing impact, as
we know, on the young Einstein.

00:34:22.699 --> 00:34:23.989
So he's in this milieu.

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:26.239
He's now not in a
university setting.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:29.000
He scraped through his
undergraduate studies.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:30.949
He has a nice day job.

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:34.025
But he's not doing particularly
well professionally.

00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:35.400
He's hanging out
with his buddies

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.449
and reading some interesting
and hard, obscure philosophy

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:40.580
science in the evenings.

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.909
Well, he has what's now commonly
called his miraculous year,

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:46.614
his annus mirabilis, in 1905.

00:34:46.614 --> 00:34:48.239
In fact, he only took
about six months.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:50.870
It was, like, half a year,
during which he submitted

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.662
four really astonishing,
original papers to the leading

00:34:54.662 --> 00:34:56.120
journal of physics,
the Annalen der

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:58.820
Physik in Germany at the time.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:01.130
They've since been
published and translated.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.690
There's a particularly
nice edition

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:07.370
you can find edited by John
Stachel with very nice essays

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:08.190
to accompany them.

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.550
You can find them online.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.470
So for IAP and for
the rest of today

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.570
and even throughout
the month, we're

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:17.030
really interested in what was
the third of these articles

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.960
that he submitted.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.600
He submitted it to the
journal in June of 1905.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.330
It's on what we would now
call special relativity.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.340
Its title, as you
can see up top,

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:28.760
was actually, in translation,
"On the Electrodynamics

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.480
of Moving Bodies," a thoroughly
familiar title, exactly what

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.670
Lorentz and all of
Lorentz's colleagues

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.380
have been talking about
for decades by that point.

00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:40.160
So the title of
Einstein's paper in 1905

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.410
was not surprising, even
though, as we'll see,

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:43.760
his approach was quite distinct.

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.020
He begins this now very well
done paper not by saying,

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.420
I found an error in
Lorentz's calculation.

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:58.570
There was a missing factor
of 2 pi or whatever.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.910
He doesn't say, I conducted
my own measurements.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.180
And I found these results
with an experimental error.

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:06.640
He starts out by saying
there's an asymmetry

00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:09.940
in the explanation which is
not present in the phenomena.

00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:12.820
It sounds very philosophical.

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.220
He goes on in his
very opening paragraph

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.180
to say that when we use
Maxwell's equations,

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:22.240
we come up with very different
kinds of accounts for what

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:24.010
should be the same phenomenon.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:24.760
Very simple.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:26.650
Nothing super fancy
like an interferometer.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:30.280
Just take a bar magnet and
a coil through which current

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.510
could flow.

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:34.330
And make sure you have a current
meter, an ammeter attached

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:35.390
to the coil.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:38.627
So if electric current
flows through the coil,

00:36:38.627 --> 00:36:39.460
it will be measured.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:41.410
The ammeter needle
will be deflected.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:45.160
And we are free to move
either the magnet or the coil.

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.980
In his opening paragraph,
Einstein says, physicists

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.970
had treated this situation
completely orthogonally even

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.770
though, as far as
Einstein was concerned,

00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.320
there's only one
explanation needed.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.210
And so with case
1, if you assume

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.640
the bar magnet is moving,
you're shaking the magnet

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:05.300
back and forth and keeping
the coil fixed in location,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.810
then you would appeal to one
set of Maxwell's equations.

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.720
And again, on the t-shirt
it would be this one.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.910
You have a time-varying
magnetic field

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:17.810
which will induce a spatially
varying electric field.

00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.890
And that will exert a push,
a force on the little ions,

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:24.170
the little electric
charges within that coil.

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:25.100
They'll feel a push.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.630
They'll move along the coil.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.030
Electric current, as
Maxwell himself had argued,

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:33.650
was nothing but the motion of
these electric-charge bearers.

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:36.200
So because you have a
time-varying magnetic field,

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:39.650
the little bits of matter in
the coil will be pushed along.

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.480
You'll induce a current.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.600
That's case 1-- moving
magnets, stationary coil.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.790
But if you want to analyze
the other situation,

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:50.420
to hold the magnet
rigidly fixed in place

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.460
and shift the coil
back and forth,

00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:55.580
then physicists would give an
entirely separate explanation.

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.610
They would appeal to a different
one of Maxwell's equations.

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:02.150
Now they'd say that there's
a static magnetic field that

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:03.590
varied in space.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:06.800
It's spatial gradients
were non-vanishing.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.250
And that would exert a force,
like a kind of Lorentz force

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:11.900
law, on those charges.

00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:15.170
So they have some velocity
in a magnetic field.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:16.700
They'll be pushed
along the wire.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.600
And you'll measure a current.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.710
Einstein said that's one
explanation too many.

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.330
All that we could ever measure--

00:38:23.330 --> 00:38:26.660
again, you can almost hear the
kind of Mach coming through--

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:29.810
all we can ever see as an
element of positive experience

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:33.590
is some relative motion
between the magnet and the coil

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:35.540
which induces an
electric current.

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.580
Who's to say one
was actually still

00:38:37.580 --> 00:38:38.780
while the other was moving?

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.940
So Einstein begins
this paper by saying

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.980
that there's something
wrong with the stories

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:44.660
we tell about the equations.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.310
He doesn't argue
about the equations.

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:47.960
He argues about
our interpretation

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:48.740
of the equations.

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:50.530
Very striking.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:53.170
He then goes on, just in,
like, paragraph 3-- still

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:57.640
very early in the introduction--
to posit two postulates.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.600
He doesn't prove them.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.340
He doesn't derive them.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.340
He doesn't say, I have
demonstrated these

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.960
by doing experiments.

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.170
He says, let me hypothesize
these and see what follows.

00:39:08.170 --> 00:39:11.800
And these are the two
in rough paraphrase.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.500
The first one was
actually already called

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:16.840
the principle of relativity,
or sometimes simply called

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:21.070
Galilean relativity, going
back again to the 17th century.

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:24.040
Galileo had argued by
thinking about that boat

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.550
floating down the river, that
to a person on the boat, as long

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.070
as the boat is moving
at a constant speed,

00:39:30.070 --> 00:39:32.200
neither speeding up
nor slowing down,

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.990
that all the laws of mechanics
should work perfectly well

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:37.090
for that observer the
same as they would

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:40.030
for us at rest on the shore.

00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:42.417
If you toss a ball, it'll
land back in your hand

00:39:42.417 --> 00:39:43.000
as you expect.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.850
Even though to us,
we see the ball trace

00:39:45.850 --> 00:39:49.060
a complicated parabola,
to the person on the boat,

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.370
she's perfectly entitled to
say, I'm sitting at rest.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:53.050
The ball went straight
up and landed straight

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:53.717
back in my hand.

00:39:53.717 --> 00:39:56.170
All the laws of mechanics
should work equally well

00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.320
in any reference frame that's
moving at a constant speed.

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.600
Einstein just takes
that existing principle

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.760
of relativity from
mechanics and just assumes,

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.120
just hypothesizes
that that should

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.390
apply not only to mechanics but
to every physical phenomenon--

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:13.002
electricity, magnetism,
optics, thermodynamics.

00:40:13.002 --> 00:40:13.960
And that's just a leap.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.100
He just says, what if?

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.100
What if this applies to any
kind of physical phenomenon, not

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:19.660
just mechanics?

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:22.270
And then he introduces
the second postulate

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:25.970
which seems actually to be in
tension a bit with the first.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:27.940
His second postulate
is, the speed of light

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:32.740
is a constant independent
of the motion of the source.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.280
What?

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.540
That doesn't sound right.

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.820
If you go back to Galileo
and watching his friend

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.940
on the boat, if
she fires a cannon,

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.370
the speed with which we
measure the cannonball

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:45.760
is different than the speed
she measures it, right?

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:49.030
If you watch her
lobbing a tennis ball,

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.550
our measurement of the speed
of an object in her reference

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:52.820
frame is not the same as ours.

00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.430
And Einstein here
is saying light

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:58.000
is special, that unlike
tennis balls, ping pong balls,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.580
cannonballs, or trains,
or anything else,

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.040
the speed of light,
as a postulate,

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.500
will be constant
for any observer

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:08.950
as long as they're in an
inertial frame of reference.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.437
And here's an excerpt from
the English translation.

00:41:11.437 --> 00:41:12.520
I won't read all this out.

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.220
But he says, what follows
from these postulates

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.860
is that the luminiferous ether
will prove to be superfluous--

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.660
[GERMAN]

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.380
He doesn't say, I've
disproven it, ether.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:23.290
He says it's just irrelevant.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:26.560
50 years' worth, by that point
100 years' worth of study

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.950
by all of Europe's most
prestigious physicists was

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.163
irrelevant.

00:41:31.163 --> 00:41:33.580
That's probably why he didn't
have many friends in physics

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:34.280
at the time.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.860
So he doesn't
disprove the ether.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:38.170
He says we just won't even
need to refer to it anymore.

00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.210
It makes the entire
set of questions

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:42.100
that had driven
people like Lorentz

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:44.440
really kind of fall away,
at least as far as Einstein

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.640
himself is concerned.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.180
So why does Einstein introduce
that second postulate?

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:52.690
And again, historians and
physicists and philosophers

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.700
have studied this
question a lot.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.560
And we have some good
documentary evidence

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:58.570
because Einstein was
writing letters and diaries

00:41:58.570 --> 00:41:59.530
and stuff all the time.

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.610
And a lot of those
have survived.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:03.970
So we have some contemporaneous
documentation as well as

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.340
his own later
recollections and so on.

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.520
We know that actually 10
years before this paper, back

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:12.370
when Einstein was
a mere teenager,

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.590
he'd like to pose these
kind of thought experiments

00:42:14.590 --> 00:42:16.133
or questions to himself.

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:17.800
And one of the questions
he would return

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.560
to really over the
course of a full decade

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.410
was, what would it look like,
what would you experience,

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:25.390
if you could catch
up to a light wave?

00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:29.680
And he reasoned it would be like
a surfer riding along an ocean

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:32.200
wave, that to us
on the shore, we'd

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.700
see both these things moving.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:38.380
We would see a dynamical
wave moving over time,

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:41.110
not just a frozen
waveform in space.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:42.940
But to the surfer,
if she's really

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.880
moving at the same
speed as the wave,

00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:50.090
then she would see the
wave frozen in time.

00:42:50.090 --> 00:42:55.000
It would be a crest
here, a trough there.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.980
At least for some
extended period of time,

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.140
the surfer would
see the wave frozen,

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:04.090
not dynamical-- a frozen
waveform varying in space

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.077
but frozen in time.

00:43:06.077 --> 00:43:08.410
So Einstein said that doesn't
make any sense if we think

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:09.493
about Maxwell's equations.

00:43:09.493 --> 00:43:11.320
When he got a little
more sophisticated

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:13.210
and learned more
about Maxwell, he

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.120
said there's no solution
to Maxwell's equations.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.980
If you're in a
source-free region,

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.500
if there's no clump of
electric charge around,

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.520
no electric currents around,
if both rho and J vanish,

00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:27.730
then there's no way to
have spatially varying

00:43:27.730 --> 00:43:30.430
electric and
magnetic fields that

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.130
are nonetheless static, right?

00:43:33.130 --> 00:43:34.820
That seems to be
a contradiction.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:36.730
So how do you get out
of this contradiction

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:40.460
of thinking you would have
a static waveform of light

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.460
if you could catch up and
move at the same speed

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.063
as that light wave?

00:43:44.063 --> 00:43:44.980
How do you avoid that?

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:47.650
You just make sure you can
never catch up to the wave.

00:43:47.650 --> 00:43:50.170
How can you never ever
catch up to the wave

00:43:50.170 --> 00:43:52.960
if the wave is always
traveling at the speed c

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.240
even if you're traveling
on a very fast train or now

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.040
a hypersonic jet or a
spaceship of your imagination?

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:03.130
That second postulate
for Einstein we now know

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:06.280
was really the endpoint of
a 10-year series of thought

00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.200
experiments about,
what would it look

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.940
like to catch up
with a light wave?

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.030
And he said that would make
so many other things mutually

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.630
inconsistent.

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.210
Let's make sure no one could
ever catch a light wave.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.130
And that's what
starts driving much

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:21.190
of the rest of his thinking, not
worrying about interferometers

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.400
and all the rest.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:26.080
So what he does, unlike Lorentz
and really all the masters

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.990
in the field at
the time, Einstein

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:32.950
begins with kinematics,
with the force-free motion

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.330
of bodies through
space and time,

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:36.940
which is a very
Machian thing to do.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:37.780
What can we see?

00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:40.750
We measure objects moving
through space and time.

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:43.243
Whereas people like Lorentz,
and Maxwell for that matter,

00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:45.160
have been starting with
forces, with dynamics.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.290
Remember, Lorentz
has this great idea

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:49.570
that there's a force from
the ether on the matter.

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:51.430
And in Michelson's
instrument, it's

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.500
all about dynamics, forces.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.125
Einstein inverts that order.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:56.500
He says forces
will be important.

00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:59.140
But first let's make sure we
understand force-free motion

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.620
kinematics first.

00:45:00.620 --> 00:45:03.190
After all, that's
what could become

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:05.962
objects of positive experience.

00:45:05.962 --> 00:45:07.670
And so he has these
wonderful quotations.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:09.970
It's now from the
introduction of the paper.

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.280
It's on the bottom of page 2.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.360
He's really redescribing
how to lay out coordinates.

00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.500
It sounds childish.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.170
It sounds thoroughly
unprofessional to the folks

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:22.660
of the time.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.110
Hendrik Lorentz says don't
bother with 'what do we mean

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:26.920
by coordinates?'

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.337
But Einstein was
convinced we have

00:45:28.337 --> 00:45:30.600
to think through how
do we describe motion

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:32.333
through space and time first.

00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.750
And I won't bother
reading it out.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:34.700
I'll share this slide.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:35.000
And you can see it.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.208
But that's really what he's
doing in the very opening

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:39.230
paragraphs of this paper.

00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:42.090
And that leads him to other
follow-up conclusions,

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:44.270
one of which very
famously becomes

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:45.993
known as the relativity
of simultaneity.

00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:47.660
And you might have
heard of that before.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:51.140
You'll spend more time
with this in IAP, I'm sure.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:53.450
If there's no such
thing as absolute time,

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.660
if time is what we measure
with time-measuring devices

00:45:56.660 --> 00:45:58.910
like clocks, if
that's all time is,

00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:02.120
is what can be measured by an
actual instrument like a clock,

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.840
then how can we compare the
times in different places?

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:08.150
After all, I'm sitting
here with my clock.

00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:09.740
Well, he says one
thing we could do

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:12.470
is trade light signals
because, at least according

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.650
to his postulate number
2, light is special.

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:18.620
If I throw ping pong balls,
that's not so special

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.880
because we will disagree
on the speed with which

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.500
those ping pong balls travel.

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.870
If I send a light wave,
then we had better

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:29.080
agree on the speed with which
that light moved from point A

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.210
to point B because
of postulate 2.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.460
So he starts thinking about
one of his favorite things

00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.870
in the universe, trains.

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:36.190
He loved trains.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.610
It came up all the time.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.000
So he imagines a train
moving along a platform

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.600
at a constant speed, a nice,
inertial frame of reference.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:47.320
Einstein is standing here on the
embankment, the train platform.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:48.430
He has two friends.

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:53.260
We can call them Alice
and Bob, A and B. Einstein

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.470
has marked himself out to be in
the perfect midpoint of where

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:58.570
Alice and Bob are standing.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.560
So they mark this all
out ahead of time.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:02.590
He marks himself
perfectly in the middle.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:07.030
Alice and Bob are each equipped
with a lantern and a watch.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:09.010
And by prior
arrangement, they say

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:12.640
at 12:00 noon on the dot,
turn on your lanterns.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:15.790
So the light will
travel from both A and B

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:17.560
toward the midpoint.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.780
Point your lanterns
toward Einstein

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:23.590
at point M. Turn them
on at the same time.

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:27.100
Meanwhile on this
zooming train, there's

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.320
another friend of
Einstein's sitting

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:31.150
at the midpoint of the train.

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:33.920
At the point, this is
Marge, M prime here.

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.670
She knows that she's in the
exact midpoint of the train.

00:47:36.670 --> 00:47:38.890
She knows by prior
arrangement that Alice and Bob

00:47:38.890 --> 00:47:42.140
are standing one train
length apart from each other.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.160
And again, she's expecting that
they will turn their lanterns

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.030
on at the same time.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:49.870
So how do these different
folks describe this series

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.490
of events that follow?

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.710
Let's focus first
on what Einstein

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.630
sees when he's standing
still on the train

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:59.560
platform, the embankment,
watching the train go by.

00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.360
The observer who's
standing still

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.680
on the platform at point M
was, by prior arrangement,

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.405
at equal distance
from Alice and Bob.

00:48:08.405 --> 00:48:09.280
I guess I changed it.

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:09.940
Now it's a she.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.060
So Mileva, his wife,
is standing there.

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.320
Maybe M stands for Mileva.

00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:17.170
So she receives the light
waves from points A and B

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:18.560
at the same time.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:22.090
So she can conclude that the
light flashes were emitted

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:26.350
at the same time, that the
event of person A and person

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:29.350
B shining the lights, those
events were simultaneous.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:30.730
How do you know?

00:48:30.730 --> 00:48:34.560
Because the light had
equal distances to travel.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:37.920
And the light could only
travel at but one speed.

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.520
And they arrived
at the same time.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.760
They must have started the
journeys at the same time.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.530
The act of shining
those lanterns

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:46.480
must have been simultaneous.

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:50.080
But what about the person
who's on the moving train?

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:56.500
She sees the following as she is
zooming along at point M prime.

00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:01.120
She sees the light from point
B arrive at her location first.

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.945
Now, Mileva or
Einstein would say, oh,

00:49:02.945 --> 00:49:04.570
that's because you're
racing toward it.

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.430
She says, not so fast.

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:08.200
I'm in a perfectly
self-consistent

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:09.790
mechanical system.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:12.610
All the laws of physics work
as well for me as for you.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.140
And the light
couldn't have sped up

00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:15.940
or slowed down by
your own postulate,

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.340
she would say-- she
would be entitled to say.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.460
So if she's equal distant
between points A and B

00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:24.160
and she receives the
light from B first,

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:28.210
the only possible explanation
is that the lights were not

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.810
shown simultaneously, that A
and B did not turn the lanterns

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:33.500
on at the same time.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:36.940
So the person on the train
platform and the person

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:39.460
on the moving train
disagree about what

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.110
happens simultaneously.

00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:43.840
This becomes known as the
relativity of simultaneity.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.280
So who's correct?

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.460
I've already said, according
to Einstein, no one or both

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:51.430
of them because of postulate 1.

00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.050
They're both
entitled to work out

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:57.610
a perfectly
self-consistent set of laws

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:00.700
involving electromagnetism,
optics, and mechanics.

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.260
They agree they were
at the midpoint.

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.385
They agree that light didn't
speed up or slow down.

00:50:04.385 --> 00:50:06.430
So they are both
right, which is to say

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:08.470
there is no right answer
to the question, what

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:10.150
was really simultaneous?

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:13.600
Simultaneity becomes relative
to one's frame of reference.

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.900
That's a pretty deep change
from the Newtonian system.

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.330
And as Einstein says--
again, it's bottom of page 2,

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:20.950
very early in the paper--

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:23.830
"we see that we can
attribute no absolute meaning

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:27.100
to the concept of simultaneity,
but that two events which

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.660
examined from a
coordinate system

00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:32.140
are simultaneous"-- like
him on the embankment--

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:35.142
"can no longer be interpreted
as simultaneous events when

00:50:35.142 --> 00:50:36.850
examined from a system
which is in motion

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:38.020
relative to that system."

00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:39.520
OK, that's about kinematics.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.090
It's not about forces or
resistive medium or dynamics.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:48.620
So now he goes on-- again,
very early on in the paper--

00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:51.360
once you get to the relativity
of simultaneity-- again,

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.810
as you'll have a chance to
unpack with more patience

00:50:53.810 --> 00:50:55.820
in the coming days and weeks--

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:58.370
other strange phenomena
seem to follow from that,

00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:59.780
argues Einstein.

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:03.360
One of the first he talks
about is length contraction.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:05.480
So this had been found
and published by Lorentz.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.750
Einstein is about to give an
entirely different derivation,

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:12.147
even though quantitatively it's
the same form of the equation.

00:51:12.147 --> 00:51:14.105
For Einstein, it has
nothing to do with forces.

00:51:14.105 --> 00:51:17.150
It's all about kinematics.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.600
In general, like a
good Machian, he asks,

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.350
how do we measure the
length of an object?

00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.460
How do we make length an
object of positive experience?

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:28.322
Well, at the same time
measure the location

00:51:28.322 --> 00:51:30.530
of the front of the object
and the back of the object

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:31.890
and take the difference.

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:33.350
So if you want to measure
the length of the train,

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:34.010
that's fine.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:35.990
Just measure where the
front is and the back

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:38.390
is at the same time,
and then mark off

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:41.900
the difference between those
two locations in space.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.510
Our friends Alice and Bob
can do that with the train.

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:52.010
And they find the answer capital
L. The train is length L long.

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:54.410
Meanwhile, Alice and Bob--

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:56.870
and I should say that's
when the train is at rest.

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:59.120
When they do this
with a moving train,

00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:01.700
Alice and Bob measure the
length of a moving train,

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:03.950
they measure some
length shorter than what

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:06.470
the person on the
train was expecting.

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:10.190
The person on the train expected
the full length L. The person

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:12.920
who's moving with the object,
either at rest with it

00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.090
or moving together with it,
says the train is L units long.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:19.280
But when Alice and
Bob measure the train

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.590
by measuring the front
and back at the same time,

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:23.120
they find a shorter answer.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.430
They found it shrunk along
the direction of motion

00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:28.130
by some specific amount.

00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:29.180
Now, how could that be?

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.070
Remember, we disagree
about "at the same time."

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:33.740
So if we disagree
about simultaneity,

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:35.900
we will-- perforce,
we must start

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.250
to disagree about lengths.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:41.870
So the person on the train says,
you did your measurement wrong.

00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:44.660
You measured the front
of the train first.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.990
We know that event B
happened first, she says,

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.997
because we got the light
from event B first.

00:52:50.997 --> 00:52:52.580
So you measured the
front of the train

00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:55.880
and then waited while the train
slid and then later measured

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.620
the position of the
rear of the train.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.810
So of course you have
a shorter distance

00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:01.640
because you performed
a bad measurement,

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.140
because you didn't
measure the front

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.940
and back at the same time.

00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:06.065
We say, don't be silly.

00:53:06.065 --> 00:53:07.190
They were at the same time.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:09.440
We checked by
trading light beams.

00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:10.820
We know they were simultaneous.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:12.560
And we got the answer L prime.

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.820
Your train is short.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:14.630
Who's right?

00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:18.170
Sort of both and neither,
that because we disagree

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:21.230
on simultaneity, we
disagree on the outcomes

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:25.310
of simultaneous events like
measurements of length.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:27.950
And so he goes on with
just a few lines of algebra

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:30.170
to find the exact form
of what was already

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:32.960
known as the Lorentz
contraction, that same factor

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.800
gamma that you'll
be using all IAP,

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:40.010
that the measurement
of an object in motion

00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:42.380
shrinks along the
direction of motion.

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.330
Whereas if we were at
rest with that object,

00:53:44.330 --> 00:53:45.770
we'd find a longer length.

00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.950
And the amount it shrinks
depends on that relative speed

00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:50.045
v over c.

00:53:50.045 --> 00:53:53.270
It depends, in particular,
on this form gamma.

00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:56.180
This has nothing, for Einstein,
to do with forces or dynamics.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.390
It's a totally different
derivation than Lorentz's.

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:02.570
It's simply a consequence of
kinematics and, in particular,

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:04.830
about simultaneity.

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.210
It's a very simple exercise.

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.030
You'll probably wind
up doing it very soon

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.000
to find a similar consequence
for the rate at which clocks

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:12.720
will tick.

00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.300
This has now became
known as time dilation.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.570
Imagine a very simple kind
of clock, the simplest one--

00:54:18.570 --> 00:54:21.570
two highly polished
mirrors with a light beam

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.580
that just bounces straight
back and forth between them.

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.030
If the clock is at rest
with respect to us,

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:30.510
we hold the clock perfectly
still at a fixed height,

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.280
then the time it
takes for that light

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:35.430
to travel from the bottom
mirror to the top mirror

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:37.830
will count as one
tick of our clock.

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:39.030
[SNAPPING]

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:41.560
And we know that light can
only travel at a fixed speed.

00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:44.190
So it's a really
great, uniform clock.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.780
As long as we can hold
that height really fixed,

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:50.070
this is a great way of defining
a unit of time and therefore

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:51.870
our clock rate.

00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:54.390
What happens if our friend
has an identical clock,

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:57.150
same mirrors, held equally
rigidly at the same height

00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:01.350
apart but zooming past
us on that moving train?

00:55:01.350 --> 00:55:04.230
Then we watch the light
have to travel this longer

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:08.585
path because after the light
beam leaves the bottom mirror,

00:55:08.585 --> 00:55:09.960
in order to reach
the top mirror,

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:13.080
the whole assembly has moved
with the train to the right,

00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.860
some distance v times t
in the time during which

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.410
that light beam was in transit.

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.690
So it has to travel
the hypotenuse

00:55:21.690 --> 00:55:22.800
of this right triangle.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.780
Instead of just this
simple up and down,

00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.750
it travels perforce
a longer distance

00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:29.550
and likewise back down.

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:32.970
So our observation
of the moving clock

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:36.870
is that it takes
longer between ticks.

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:38.910
That becomes known
as time dilation.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.830
The time between
ticks has stretched,

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:46.170
which is to say the clock is
running slowly as we measure.

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:48.780
We measure the moving
clock to run slowly

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:51.270
by that same factor gamma.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.160
The time between
ticks gets stretched.

00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.010
Remember, gamma
is greater than 1.

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:58.950
So the time between
ticks gets stretched.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:02.100
And that's the same with
the clock is running slowly.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:04.558
Meanwhile, the person on the
train says, you're ridiculous.

00:56:04.558 --> 00:56:06.183
I had the clock with
me the whole time.

00:56:06.183 --> 00:56:07.110
It kept perfect time.

00:56:07.110 --> 00:56:08.790
But your clock ran slowly.

00:56:08.790 --> 00:56:10.920
I watched as I ran
by the station.

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:14.590
Perfectly symmetrical
conclusions.

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:17.610
So Einstein was working all
this out, very much inspired

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:21.810
by Ernst Mach, by this notion
of positivism, of what can we

00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:24.840
hope to measure, not
starting with forces

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.570
but with the force-free
motion of objects

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.420
through space and time, and
really trying to bring it back

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:31.740
to, what would be measurable?

00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:35.100
What would I see if I
were in this situation?

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:38.610
One of his teachers at
the ETH, a mathematician

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:42.450
named Hermann Minkowski, had
formed a deservedly low opinion

00:56:42.450 --> 00:56:43.710
of student Einstein.

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:46.060
Einstein used to cut
class, was very rude.

00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.290
But one of their mutual
friends, after Einstein's paper

00:56:49.290 --> 00:56:52.710
came out, sent the paper to
Minkowski saying, you know,

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:54.370
it's actually kind
of interesting.

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.610
Take a look, to paraphrase.

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:59.700
And Minkowski said,
well, despite the fact

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.430
that I knew Einstein was never
going to amount to anything,

00:57:02.430 --> 00:57:03.300
I read the paper.

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.310
And I was right, Minkowski says.

00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:08.110
He really made a mess
of this, as well.

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:11.010
So Minkowski's just
interested enough

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:13.380
to redo Einstein's
work in a form that

00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:15.090
made much more
sense to Minkowski,

00:57:15.090 --> 00:57:18.060
who was, after all, a
professional geometer.

00:57:18.060 --> 00:57:19.450
He wasn't just a mathematician.

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:21.660
He loved geometry most of all.

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.600
So Minkowski, not
Einstein, is the one

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:26.310
who actually brings
these pieces together

00:57:26.310 --> 00:57:28.470
a few years later
in-- it was published

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:31.410
in 1908 instead of 1905.

00:57:31.410 --> 00:57:34.080
And he says, all this
talk about moving trains

00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:37.830
and polished mirrors, all of
that's just a distraction.

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:40.860
To a properly trained
mathematician,

00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:43.350
which Einstein was
not, all we're doing

00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:46.290
is performing rotations
or projections

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:49.200
in a certain kind of
space, in this case

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.940
a spacetime in which there's,
say, one direction of space

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:56.100
running along the
horizontal axis

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:58.990
and one dimension of
time running up the page.

00:57:58.990 --> 00:58:01.140
We now call these
Minkowski diagrams

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:04.380
in his honor, or simply
spacetime diagrams.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.720
None of this appears in
Einstein's early work.

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:10.020
This was done by his
former teacher in response

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.680
to what Minkowski considered
to be Einstein's continuing

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:15.810
confusion and sloppiness.

00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:19.740
And there's a benefit from
doing that, Minkowski finds.

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:23.100
He agrees with Einstein
that we will disagree

00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:24.760
on certain kinds
of measurements,

00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:27.360
for example lengths
and durations of time,

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.730
because we disagree
on simultaneity.

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:31.800
But Minkowski finds
something that had not been

00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.640
so clear to Einstein himself.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:37.380
There are combinations of
those kinds of intervals

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:39.450
on which we will all agree.

00:58:39.450 --> 00:58:43.080
This is what we would now
call a spacetime invariant.

00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.590
Put together, a combination
of the time interval

00:58:46.590 --> 00:58:51.630
minus the space interval, a
relative minus sign and each

00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:53.880
of those quantities
squared, that combination

00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:55.650
we will all agree
on as long as we're

00:58:55.650 --> 00:58:59.790
each in states of
non-accelerating motion

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:01.500
even though we
disagree separately

00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:04.530
on the duration between two
events, delta t, or the lengths

00:59:04.530 --> 00:59:06.030
between them, delta x.

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:09.240
And that, from Minkowski, is
what any geometer should do.

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.130
Some relationships
remain invariant

00:59:11.130 --> 00:59:12.600
even under changes
of coordinates.

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.440
And for Minkowski, that was
what any undergraduate geometry

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.430
student should know to do first.

00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:21.060
So we actually have
this notion of one kind

00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:25.095
of thing called spacetime coming
from Minkowski kind of redoing

00:59:25.095 --> 00:59:26.340
Einstein's work.

00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:29.160
And as Minkowski famously
writes in his own article--

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.360
it was published posthumously;
he died quite young.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.340
And he gave a lecture.

00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:34.560
And it was published
soon after he died.

00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:37.420
And he wrote upon
introducing this new work,

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:40.500
"Henceforth space
by itself and time

00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:44.070
by itself are doomed to
fade away into mere shadows

00:59:44.070 --> 00:59:46.323
and only a kind of
union of the two

00:59:46.323 --> 00:59:47.490
will preserve independence."

00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:49.740
And by shadows, he really
meant projections, just

00:59:49.740 --> 00:59:53.280
drop perpendicular to
the appropriate axis

00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:55.380
and then think about
coordinate transformations

00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:58.883
in that spacetime of x and t.

00:59:58.883 --> 01:00:00.300
So that's, again,
something you'll

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:03.030
get much more practice with if
you haven't seen it already.

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.960
But that's a preview.

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:06.138
That comes in response
to Einstein's work.

01:00:06.138 --> 01:00:07.680
It wasn't an Einstein's
own original.

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:10.440
Although, just to jump
ahead very briefly,

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.185
Einstein first thought
that was horrible

01:00:12.185 --> 01:00:13.560
because he didn't
like Minkowski.

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.820
But then over the
next several years,

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.910
the better part of
a decade, Einstein

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:20.310
himself became more impressed
by that way of thinking

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:22.465
and really adopted it
for his own later work

01:00:22.465 --> 01:00:24.840
on what became known as the
general theory of relativity.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.010
That's for later.

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:31.998
OK, very briefly
here's the third part

01:00:31.998 --> 01:00:33.790
of the material I wanted
to share with you.

01:00:33.790 --> 01:00:36.123
And then hopefully there'll
be some time for discussion,

01:00:36.123 --> 01:00:37.190
as well.

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:39.670
So this last part
is much more brief.

01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:41.680
But it's, how do we
make sense of this?

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.500
Why was Einstein doing all
this seemingly unusual,

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.210
maybe even crazy
stuff, certainly

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.520
out of step with Lorentz,
with his own teachers

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.530
like Minkowski?

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.020
How can we account for
Einstein's quite idiosyncratic

01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:56.350
approach to what was otherwise
a common set of questions

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:58.745
about the electrodynamics
of moving bodies?

01:00:58.745 --> 01:01:01.120
Now, here's some of my favorite
work by other colleagues,

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:03.010
by other historians and
physicists who really

01:01:03.010 --> 01:01:06.170
looked at this in great detail.

01:01:06.170 --> 01:01:08.350
So for a long, long
time, I mean literally

01:01:08.350 --> 01:01:10.180
for the better
part of 100 years,

01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:13.010
since people began taking
relativity seriously,

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:17.555
which is a long time by now, it
had become very common to say,

01:01:17.555 --> 01:01:19.180
well, Einstein must
have been motivated

01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:21.370
much like Hendrik Lorentz
was, really like that

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:23.530
much of that generation was.

01:01:23.530 --> 01:01:25.690
Einstein must have
been responding

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:28.780
to the null result from
Michelson and Morley

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:31.060
and their interferometer,
that Einstein

01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:34.030
must have been trying to explain
why they couldn't measure

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:37.240
our motion through the ether
much as Lorentz, we know,

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.190
very explicitly
was trying to do.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:42.130
And there's a fascinating--
one of the first really careful

01:01:42.130 --> 01:01:45.040
examinations of that claim
was by Gerald Holton, who's

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.380
a real kind of hero of mine.

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:51.700
Holton did his first
PhD in physics,

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.460
low-temperature physics, and
then retooled many years later

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.750
in the history of science.

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:58.450
And he wrote a series of
really remarkable essays

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:02.320
about Einstein once a lot of
Einstein's papers and letters

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:04.330
and notes became available.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:06.010
Holton was among the
first to really dig

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:09.040
through these with
great care and almost

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.650
like a detective going
through the evidence.

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:13.450
And what Holton
concluded was it's

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:15.580
not clear that
Einstein even knew

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.890
about the Michelson-Morley
interferometer.

01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:20.268
Lorentz knew about it and
followed it carefully.

01:02:20.268 --> 01:02:22.810
There's very little trace that
Einstein paid it any attention

01:02:22.810 --> 01:02:23.310
at all.

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.780
If he did know about it,
it was kind of in passing.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:29.560
It was certainly not front of
mind in the months and years

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.110
leading up to the 1905 paper.

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:34.000
He might have known
about it secondhand

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.340
from reading through all
the footnotes of Lorentz.

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.800
But it's not something he
seems to have been paying

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.110
much attention to at all.

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:43.780
And so there's nice
textual evidence

01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.940
even in Einstein's
paper, that 1905 paper

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.910
that I keep showing some
brief excerpts from.

01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:51.790
Again, this is on the
first or second page.

01:02:51.790 --> 01:02:56.650
When he's trying to reason why
we should think about maybe

01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:58.990
giving up on the
ether, he mentions--

01:02:58.990 --> 01:03:00.730
without citing any
of them-- he mentions

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:03.700
several unsuccessful
attempts to discover

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:06.850
any motion of the Earth relative
to the light medium, the ether.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.693
He doesn't say
which ones he means.

01:03:08.693 --> 01:03:11.110
But he actually then goes on
to say in the same paragraph,

01:03:11.110 --> 01:03:14.875
none of these have found any
deviation to first order in v

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.030
over c.

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:18.040
And what's so striking,
as Holton reminds us,

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.950
is Michelson-Morley was
actually second order.

01:03:20.950 --> 01:03:23.650
Einstein seems to be talking
about a whole different class

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:26.133
of earlier experiments
even before Michelson

01:03:26.133 --> 01:03:26.800
got in the game.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.030
He's certainly
not obsessing over

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:32.822
the Michelson-Morley
interferometer the way

01:03:32.822 --> 01:03:34.180
other people were.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:37.060
And so some people then
read Holton's analysis

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:39.322
to say a kind of overcorrection.

01:03:39.322 --> 01:03:40.780
Does that mean
Einstein didn't care

01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:43.060
about any kinds of
experiments at all?

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:45.220
If he wasn't trying
to respond directly

01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:46.750
to the Michelson-Morley
experiment,

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:49.635
was he just off in a kind of
philosophical dream world?

01:03:49.635 --> 01:03:51.010
And that's where
I think we again

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.770
can now say quite firmly no.

01:03:53.770 --> 01:03:55.330
In fact, it makes
sense to go back

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:59.770
to Einstein's own early
years, his early fascination

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:02.490
with electrotechnical
gadgets, and remind ourselves

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:07.660
what his day job was in the
early 1900s, including 1905.

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.200
Put him back in the patent
office in Central Europe

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.610
at this very specific moment.

01:04:13.610 --> 01:04:16.870
So let's think about Einstein's
favorite technology, trains.

01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:18.820
Trains and railroads
themselves were actually

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.170
fairly new in the 19th century.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:24.640
They were introduced to
widespread commercial usage

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:28.090
for commercial
transportation really only

01:04:28.090 --> 01:04:29.950
in the 1830s and '40s.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.870
Remember, Einstein
was born in 1879.

01:04:31.870 --> 01:04:35.650
They were relatively new
even in his childhood.

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:39.770
During this whole time until
very late in the 19th century,

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.610
there were no
coordinated time zones.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:45.340
There was nothing like Eastern
Standard Time or Pacific

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.580
Time or Central European Time.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:51.160
Each town set its
own local time.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.930
And all the residents
could coordinate

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:56.200
by agreeing that we'll use
that clock tower, either

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.710
some municipal building or
often a tall church in the town

01:04:59.710 --> 01:05:02.890
square, say that's
our local time.

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.630
We'll set our local
watches to when

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:07.810
that clock chimes 12:00 noon.

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:09.730
So each town kept
its own local time.

01:05:09.730 --> 01:05:12.790
And before railway, who would
ever need anything else?

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:15.910
Because one was rarely
encountering more than one

01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:18.250
town in a given day.

01:05:18.250 --> 01:05:21.730
After the advent of railroads,
you still have this local time.

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.070
But that became more
and more of a problem.

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.020
It was true in North
America as in Europe

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:28.650
and other parts of
the world, as well.

01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:32.480
So here, closer to
Boston, passengers

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.060
riding on the train
between Boston and New York

01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:37.580
during this time would have
to change their watches

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.590
by an average of 37 minutes.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:41.360
Today we're all in
the same time zone.

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.360
But that's how different
the local variations

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:47.180
tended to be just
up and down the US

01:05:47.180 --> 01:05:49.280
portion of the
mid-Atlantic seacoast

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.290
and likewise throughout Europe.

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:53.960
That was becoming more
and more of a problem

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.480
when you have to coordinate
lots of trains traveling

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:59.330
across large distances.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.820
It wasn't only a problem
for commercial railway

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.200
or for shipping.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.350
It became a very potent,
added challenge in Germany

01:06:06.350 --> 01:06:08.330
during Einstein's youth.

01:06:08.330 --> 01:06:10.850
So again, as many
of you may know,

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:13.010
there only became
one single country

01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:17.240
of Germany, a unified
Germany, in 1871 following

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.590
yet another war with France.

01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.435
That was basically the story
of the previous 500 years,

01:06:21.435 --> 01:06:23.810
German-speaking lands fighting
with French-speaking ones.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:25.768
There was another one,
the Franco-Prussian war,

01:06:25.768 --> 01:06:27.380
throughout 1870.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.880
The German-speaking
folks prevailed.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:31.220
And it was at that moment,
in the wake of that war,

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:34.160
that there was then
a first unification

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.660
of a country of Germany, now
a much larger expanse of what

01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:42.470
had otherwise been independent
German-speaking territories.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:44.420
So now there's an
added reason to worry

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.600
about trains that have to be
coordinated across distances.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.700
There's now a new
country's worth

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:52.730
that has to defend its borders
all the way from basically

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:58.580
Poland or Russia on the
East and France on the West.

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.810
And there's a famous quotation
from a leading German general,

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:06.770
Count von Moltke,
who in the 1890s, 20

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.530
years into German unification,
is basically saying,

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:10.950
we have a problem on our hands.

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:13.760
We have to coordinate
trains for military purposes

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.710
as well as commercial, passenger
rail, and merchant shipping.

01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:21.350
We have a problem
with the fact that we

01:07:21.350 --> 01:07:23.390
don't have unified time zones.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:25.470
This is all happening
in Einstein's childhood.

01:07:25.470 --> 01:07:27.980
Remember, Einstein
was born in 1879,

01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.620
very early in this
period of unified Germany

01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:35.070
and a new focus on coordinating
clocks at a distance.

01:07:35.070 --> 01:07:37.960
So one of the main ideas that
many clever people, inventors,

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.460
came up with throughout Europe
and other parts of the world,

01:07:40.460 --> 01:07:43.460
as well, was to try
to coordinate clocks

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.160
and therefore help
coordinate train stations

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.960
in these different cities.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.850
Now, much of continental
Europe was now

01:07:49.850 --> 01:07:52.250
being connected by rail.

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.790
If the major hubs, if
the major train stations

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:58.820
could agree on the time, then
you could set your watch then.

01:07:58.820 --> 01:08:02.720
And the trains could be better
coordinated throughout even

01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:04.190
into the hinterlands.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.830
And the main idea that many
inventors and entrepreneurs

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:11.180
kind of zeroed in on was
to install these so-called

01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.970
[GERMAN] clocks, mother
clocks, central clocks

01:08:13.970 --> 01:08:16.340
that you would say
were the standard ones.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:19.729
And then connect those by
electromagnetic signal,

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:22.370
either telegraph or,
increasingly, radio waves,

01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:24.410
literally traveling
electromagnetic waves

01:08:24.410 --> 01:08:25.675
in the ether.

01:08:25.675 --> 01:08:27.800
Some of you might know that
the Eiffel Tower, which

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.870
is under construction
in just this period,

01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:32.510
was originally built to
aid radio communication.

01:08:32.510 --> 01:08:34.939
It was a radio beacon before
it was a reason for all of us

01:08:34.939 --> 01:08:35.899
to go visit Paris.

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:37.729
There were other
reasons before that.

01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:39.290
The Eiffel Tower
was built really

01:08:39.290 --> 01:08:42.950
in this period in large
part to become a radio

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:46.310
beacon to broadcast
standardized time signals.

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:48.319
And then the idea
was you would know

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.789
how far you were from Paris.

01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:52.729
You know there'd be some
delay of when you'd expect

01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:54.529
to receive the radio beacon.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:57.229
If it's 12:00 noon in Paris
when that beam was sent,

01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:00.180
you have an offset based
on how far away you are

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.580
and the speed of light that
it would take to get there.

01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.279
So then these very
clever folks who

01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:06.830
make all these gadgets
to both receive

01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:10.340
the time, either
telegraph or radio wave,

01:09:10.340 --> 01:09:13.939
and then implement the
offset and then reset

01:09:13.939 --> 01:09:16.250
the clock in your next
train station clock

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:17.340
and down the line.

01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:20.390
So imagine these coordinated
sets of coordinates

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:24.800
where you have local clocks at
every important location that

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:27.510
are sending and receiving
electromagnetic signals

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:29.729
to coordinate the local time.

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:31.725
That's exactly the
scenario that Einstein

01:09:31.725 --> 01:09:33.350
mentions in the
abstract in the opening

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:36.240
pages of his 1905 paper.

01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:39.649
He doesn't talk about
these patent applications

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:45.300
or about trains in this
more practical way.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:49.550
But it turns out, as my
friend Peter Galison shows

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:51.609
in this beautiful book
Einstein's Clocks,

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:53.569
Poincare's Maps,
this is the subject

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:56.360
of an enormous tech spree.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.210
This was the tech challenge
of the day for all these

01:09:59.210 --> 01:10:01.400
very smart, young
electrical engineers

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:04.940
to build up and patent every
bit, every switch and gear,

01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:07.550
for this way of coordinating
clocks at a distance often

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:11.740
using electromagnetic signals.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.100
Not only that, Einstein was
at the electrotechnical part

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.920
of the Bern patent office,
where a lot of these

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.940
were flowing through.

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:22.000
So he was an examiner on
many of the little widgets

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.090
and gadgets as part of this
clock-coordination sequence.

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:27.700
Even better, my favorite part
of Peter's otherwise quite

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:31.090
fascinating book, was that Peter
and his research assistants

01:10:31.090 --> 01:10:33.340
pieced together the
walk that Einstein

01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.620
used to take from his
apartment to the office--

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.750
he had a lovely
stroll through Bern

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.370
during this time of his life--

01:10:39.370 --> 01:10:42.970
and then finding out when each
of the clocks along his route

01:10:42.970 --> 01:10:46.498
were wired up to this
now coordinated system.

01:10:46.498 --> 01:10:48.040
So literally the
clocks that Einstein

01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:50.500
would walk past
between his apartment

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.830
and his office were in this
exact moment being wired up

01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:56.830
in this new, explicit,
electrotechnical clock

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:59.920
coordination system, not just
across distant train stations

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:03.220
but soon even across
the semi-urban regions

01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:04.630
where he lived.

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:07.810
It was literally his
day job and the path

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:10.030
that he walked to get to work.

01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:13.030
So this notion of using
electromagnetic signals

01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:16.840
to coordinate clocks in a
measurable, repeatable way

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.450
was of philosophical interest.

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:21.130
It was certainly
inspired in part

01:11:21.130 --> 01:11:22.810
by the writing of Ernst Mach.

01:11:22.810 --> 01:11:26.080
But Einstein was also immersed
in a different set of realities

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.330
than someone like
Hendrik Lorentz

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:30.190
or the other Maxwellians.

01:11:30.190 --> 01:11:33.640
And so when he comes to the
question of electrodynamics

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.680
of moving bodies,
Einstein's immersed

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.310
in different conversations
and day-to-day questions

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:43.780
compared to those of the
physics elite of his day.

01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:48.370
So we come back to this very
iconic but kind of unusual

01:11:48.370 --> 01:11:50.800
paper from 1905, "On
the Electrodynamics

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.510
of Moving Bodies."

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:55.720
I think we can make a bit more
sense of it, informed by work

01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:59.590
by people like Peter Galison.

01:11:59.590 --> 01:12:03.740
Einstein's paper has
almost no references.

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:06.410
Much like many
patent applications,

01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:10.640
you want to emphasize priority
and downplay precedence.

01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:13.098
Einstein focuses on the
operational details.

01:12:13.098 --> 01:12:15.140
How would you actually
perform these measurements

01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:17.540
and compare the answers
at some distance?

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:20.240
It starts to look sort of
like a patent application,

01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:24.423
not like a fancy exercise
in mathematical physics.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:26.090
So we can come back
to this question of,

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.840
why was Einstein doing
things differently?

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:28.910
And what was he up to?

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.970
And we see him really enmeshed
in just a different set

01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:35.240
of ideas, of philosophical
conversations,

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.870
of mathematical techniques,
and also of actual gadgets

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:42.430
compared to some of the
other experts of his day.

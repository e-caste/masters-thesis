00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.920
Air is normally an insulator, but under certain
conditions, it can suddenly and temporarily

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.039
change into a conductor, and we end up with
a spark. In this video, we'll use the related

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:21.380
concepts of electric fields and electric potential
to explain how insulators can suddenly, dramatically

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.570
and temporarily become conductors.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.570
This video is part of the Derivatives and
Integrals video series.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.150
Hello. My name is John McGreevy. I am a professor
in the physics department at MIT, and today

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.239
I'll be talking with you about the electric
field and electrical potential.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.620
To get the most out of this video you should
already have some exposure to the electric

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.429
field and electric potential. You should be
able to take a mathematical expression for

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:02.960
the field and obtain the potential, and vice
versa. You should also know how to draw equipotential

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.280
surfaces and electric field vectors.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.200
Throughout this video our goal is to help
you gain a clearer picture of the electric

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.490
field and the electric potential. By the end
of the video you should also be able to describe

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.229
the process of electrical breakdown by using
either the field or the potential.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.280
Let's start with a review of electric field
and electric potential. First we'll describe

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.649
them conceptually. Then we'll show the mathematical
relationship between them, and show some of

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.320
their typical visual representations.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.090
First, let's see what you remember. Take out
a piece of paper and write down everything

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.189
you remember about the electric field and
the electric potential. Try to concentrate

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:47.189
on their similarities and differences. Pause
the video to do this.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.869
Now you can compare the list you made to our
list.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.759
The electric field is generated by electric
charges, and extends an infinite distance

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:57.750
from them.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.289
If you bring a second electric charge into
a region of electric field, there will be

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:07.920
a force exerted on it. Like all forces, that
force has magnitude and direction. The stronger

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.728
the charge is, the more force will be applied
to it.

00:02:10.728 --> 00:02:16.390
The electric field is a vector quantity. It
has a vector value at every point in space,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.819
measured in Newtons per Coulomb or Volts per
Meter.

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.640
Much like the electric field, electric potentials
are created by charges and extend an infinite

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.290
distance from them.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.200
If you bring a second charge into a region
of electrical potential, that second charge

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.720
will gain or lose potential energy. The stronger
that charge, the more its potential energy

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:36.989
will change.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.680
Unlike the electric field, the electric potential
is a scalar quantity, which means that everywhere

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.680
you look you can find a number that represents
the potential, measured in Joules per Coulomb.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.540
Let's look at two ways to envision an electric
potential for a positively charged line near

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.599
the origin. We're going to look at this in
two dimensions to make things easier to see.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.750
We can also draw the level curves for the
electric potential function. These are called

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.060
"equipotential lines," because the value of
the potential is equal at every point on a

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.769
given line. For instance, we might draw lines
every ten volts.

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.450
If we plot the potential on the vertical axis,
we end up with this mountain-like shape. We

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.349
can imagine positive charges rolling down
the mountain as they are pushed away from

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:22.299
our line charge.

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:27.420
We can also sketch the electric field around
a line charge. If we pick regularly spaced

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.790
points at which to draw our electric field
vectors, we end up with a picture like this

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.250
one. Each vector shows the direction and strength
of the electric field at that point. The longer

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.610
the arrow, the stronger the field is. Here
you might imagine the arrows pushing a positive

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.840
charge away from our line

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.909
Displaying both the equipotential lines and
the field vectors at once, we get this picture.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.099
You can see that the equipotential lines are
always perpendicular to the field.

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.879
Since charges create both fields and potentials,
both will be present all the time, though

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.700
we might only draw one or the other.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:12.110
The field and the potential are related mathematically
through the gradient operator. As a vector

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.079
operator, the gradient turns the scalar potential
into a vector field. To go in the other direction,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.170
a line integral of the electric field turns
that vector field into the scalar electric

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.160
potential.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.110
The negative sign that appears in both equations
is importantâ€”the electric field points in

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.720
the opposite direction from any changes in
the potential. If the electric potential increases

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.940
in a particular direction, the electric field
points in the opposite direction.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.080
We're going to use something called "electrical
breakdown" to illustrate our concepts today.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:53.500
We'll start with an example, give a definition,
then go into an explanation of the phenomenon.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.500
Here is a clip from the Boston Museum of Science
to demonstrate

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:15.610
the phenomenon.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.050
Quite a dramatic demonstration! Let's look
at this in a little more depth.

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:42.630
Electrical breakdown is defined as the process
by which an insulating material in a strong

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.530
electric field becomes electrically conductive.
The material actually changes from being an

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.780
insulator to being a conductor. In the clip
you saw, this happened in the air near the

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.600
Van de Graaff generator, and a large electric
spark resulted.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.520
You may sometimes hear this referred to as
breakdown potential, or breakdown voltage,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.290
which is the same thing.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:10.790
The exact value of the electric field needed
depends on many factors, including distance,

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.030
humidity, temperature, and the material itself.

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:20.250
Here is a simplified explanation of how electrical
breakdown works in air. Consider this house

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.860
in a thunderstorm.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.060
If we zoom in on the air above the house,
we can see the molecules of gas in the air.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.810
Thunderstorms involve strong electric fields
and high electric potential differences. We

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:38.560
can represent those on our diagram.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.500
Imagine that one electron is pulled from its
atom by the strong electric field. Because

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.190
the electron is negatively charged, it will
accelerate against the electric field, and

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:52.800
will eventually collide with another atom.
That collision might knock another electron

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.180
loose. Now there will be two electrons accelerating.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:03.310
A single electron can thus create a chain
reaction, where many atoms lose their electrons.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:08.460
This creates a region of ionized air. Air
is normally a good insulator, but the presence

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.120
of ions allows it to conduct electricity.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.070
...resulting in a lightning bolt!

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.120
Let's use the electric field and electric
potential to investigate this situation further.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.980
Here are the Van de Graaff generators from
the video, charged up, with a metal ball as

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:25.220
a target.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.690
Let's take a simplified version of the situation
shown. Draw the equipotential surfaces around

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:35.510
these two objects, and then draw in the electric
field arrows as well. You can ignore the presence

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.610
of the support pillars.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:42.530
Here are two hints. First, the small metal
ball is grounded, or "earthed," with an electrical

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:47.690
potential of zero. Second, the electrical
charge on the generator will spread itself

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:51.740
equally over the surface of the conducting
spheres.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:58.740
Pause the video here to draw the equipotential
lines and the field vectors.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.620
Here's another picture of the generator with
the target ball nearby.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:09.120
This picture is too complex. Let's create
a simpler version of the picture. That's

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:14.380
Now we can draw in the lines. Our equipotential
lines will "hug" the surface of the conductors

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:19.930
when they are nearby. Because the charge is
spread evenly across the surface of the conductor,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:23.990
the whole surface will be at the same electric
potential. The equipotential lines will tend

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:27.530
to be smoother when farther away from the
conductors.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.620
Because the electric potential of the Van
de Graaff generator gets up to about one million

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.110
volts (or 1000 kilovolts), and we have drawn
eight lines in the picture, each line must

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:41.110
represent a difference of about 125 kilovolts.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.670
In this view we have colored in the regions
where the equipotential lines are more closely

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.640
packed, or less closely packed.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:55.090
In the blue area, with the close-packed lines,
the gradient of the potential is larger. Because

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.840
the electric field is proportional to the
gradient of the potential, the places where

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.390
our lines are more closely packed will have
a stronger electric field.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:08.260
In the red areas, where equipotential lines
are far apart, the gradient of the potential

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:12.630
is smaller. Therefore, the electric field
will be weaker.

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:15.870
We can use this as a guide when drawing our
field vectors.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.740
Let's draw in those electric field vectors
now. We have assumed here that the generator

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:23.900
becomes positively charged, but if it were
negatively charged, we could simply reverse

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.320
the direction of our arrows.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:32.050
Look carefully: our field arrows are perpendicular
to the equipotential surfaces at all points.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:35.970
Check your own diagram - is this true on yours
as well?

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.770
Our field arrows are longer where the equipotential
lines are more closely packedâ€”is this true

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:42.710
on your diagram?

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:48.140
If you need to revise your diagram or draw
a new one, do so now. If you have questions

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.680
for your teacher, here is a chance to ask
them.

00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:57.110
Pause the video here.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:01.390
Some of you may be confused by the terminology
that is used for this phenomenon. Many people

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:06.940
refer to the "breakdown potential" required
to create a spark. However, but you may have

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.220
noticed that the sparks in the video were
produced where the electric field was the

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:16.060
strongest, not where the electric potential
was the highest. Turn to a friend and discuss

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:23.060
why this is the case. Pause the video here
to discuss.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:26.750
If we return to the equations that relate
the field and the potential, we can improve

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:32.610
our understanding. You can see that we have
a gradient termâ€”a derivative with respect

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.330
to distance.

00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:39.120
If our potential changes slowly over distance,
the field is weak, and no spark is generated.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:44.880
On the other hand, if the potential changes
quickly over distance, the field is strong.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:48.370
A stronger field is more likely to remove
an electron from an atom.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.790
In fact, when numerical values are given for
the breakdown potential, they are most often

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:58.420
given in "volts per meter," which is a measurement
of the electric field. The term "breakdown

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:02.130
potential" is a little misleading, but it
is still the standard terminology.

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:08.540
To review, the gradient connects the electric
field to the electric potential. A steeper

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.940
change in the potential results in a stronger
electric field. We also saw that electrical

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.940
breakdowns happen in areas of strong electric
field, or of steep change in electrical potential.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:26.250
We hope you enjoyed this clip from the Theatre
of Electricity at the Boston Museum of Science.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:32.190
Good luck in your future studies of electricity.

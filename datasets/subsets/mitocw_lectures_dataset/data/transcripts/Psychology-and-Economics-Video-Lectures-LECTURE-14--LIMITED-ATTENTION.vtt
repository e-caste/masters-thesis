00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.280
FRANK SCHILBACH: All right,
I'm going to get started.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.100
This is lecture 14
of 14.13 The lecture

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.110
today is about attention.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.474
OK.

00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:22.185
Good.

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:23.560
So where are we
at in this class?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.960
In this class, we talked a
lot about preferences so far.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.290
Think about preference
describing in economics.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.910
What do people want?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.015
What makes them happy
in one way or the other?

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.140
We talked about time
preferences, risk preferences,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.430
and social preferences,
time preferences.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.410
How do people make
choices over time?

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.380
Risk preferences
are, how do people

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.500
deal with risky situations
when some things are uncertain

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.600
and others are more certain?

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.820
Or sometimes good things
happen, sometimes not.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.610
And there's a probability
distribution over those events.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.620
And how does that affect
how you make choices?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.120
And social
preferences is what we

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.820
talked about during the
last few weeks, which

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.420
is how does the presence of
others affect our choices?

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.370
How much do we
care about others?

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.350
And do we decide or
make choices differently

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.270
if others are involved?

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.910
So now what we've
done with preferences

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.570
is sometimes saying
we have our models

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.233
to think of ways to think
about what makes people happy.

00:01:17.233 --> 00:01:19.150
The second part when you
try to make decisions

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.220
is when you look at your
environment, what are prices

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:22.720
like?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.180
What do we know about others?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.160
What are our beliefs?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.210
And what do we attend to?

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.170
And how do we learn when
we get new information?

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.462
So what information do we have?

00:01:31.462 --> 00:01:34.180
And what information
do we attend to?

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.420
And how do we learn when we get
new information given to us?

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.440
And so we're going to
talk first about attention

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.130
in this lecture.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.170
And then the next
couple of times, we're

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.003
going to talk about
beliefs and learning.

00:01:49.003 --> 00:01:50.420
So what we're going
to do today is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.295
we're going to talk
about three broad issues.

00:01:52.295 --> 00:01:55.240
One is going to provide you
some motivating evidence

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.580
about attention.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.700
We had a little bit on
this in lectures 1 and 2.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.805
But I wanted to remind
you of that a little bit.

00:02:02.805 --> 00:02:04.930
Then we're going to talk
about two specific papers.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.510
One is a pretty famous
paper by Raj Chetty

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.900
and co-authors on
inattention to taxes.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.660
And then you're going to talk
about a second paper, which

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.687
is learning by noticing.

00:02:15.687 --> 00:02:17.770
In particular, we're going
to ask the question of,

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.430
how is it possible that people
do not attend to things that

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.950
are important in their lives?

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.590
You might say, well, if
attention is limited,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.650
that's all good.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.340
But then we should
expect that people attend

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.740
to really important stuff.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.690
So some sort of rational
inattention models

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.880
would say, well, it
might well be that people

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.620
are inattentive in some ways.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.835
But really, it can't be
possibly that the welfare

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:44.380
losses from
inattention are large

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.300
because if they were
large, if there's things

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.758
that people missed,
then they would

00:02:47.758 --> 00:02:50.530
pay attention to those things
and shift their attention

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.260
optimally.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.100
The learning by
noticing paper is

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.110
one theory, at
least potentially,

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.070
that addresses this question.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:05.800
The way these movie perception
tests work is, essentially,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.210
they look for what's
called change blindness.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.810
So the way this works
is, often, there's

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.910
one actor, which
is this guy here.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.250
I think you can see
probably right now there's

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.800
some guy who does some activity.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.600
You're supposed
to watch the guy.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.040
And then there's a second
scene in some ways where

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.740
the person does something else.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.200
In this case, the guy--

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.030
sorry, where is he?

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.800
The guy is taking a phone call.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.360
And so what happens then is--

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.260
essentially, then, this
guy that you see here

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.890
that takes a phone call is a
different person altogether.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.040
And so that's called
change blindness

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.380
where, essentially,
people then tend

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.480
to not notice at
all that there's two

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.910
different people in a scene.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.410
There's other types
of experiments

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.610
that do this, as well.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.700
One version of that would
be people who go to a bank.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.750
There's a bank teller.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.850
And this is like all
psych experiments.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.810
There's a bank teller.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.925
Here's the other guy.

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:07.800
Here's the other guy.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.800
So you see this guy.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.842
He looks actually very
different to the other guy

00:04:10.842 --> 00:04:12.068
that you had seen before.

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:13.110
So people go to the bank.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.830
There's a bank teller.

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.332
The bank teller
says, oh, yeah, I'll

00:04:15.332 --> 00:04:17.040
have to just get
something from the back.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.019
And then another
person shows up who's

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.750
a totally different person,
often looks very different,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.610
sometimes wears
different things.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.900
And people just
don't notice at all.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.480
And that's sort of
type of experiment

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.030
is called change blindness.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.670
I've already shown you
the gorilla test before.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.170
I'm going to not play it again
because I've already seen it.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.670
But essentially,
it's the same where

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.290
people are asked
to pay attention

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.640
to how many passes people
play in a basketball game.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.100
And then there's a
guy who's in a gorilla

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.010
suit who shows up and walks
through the whole screen.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.080
And many people just
miss the gorilla suit.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.830
Now, what's going on here?

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.290
There is a large number of
these types of experiments.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:08.540
They're called change blindness
or inattention experiments.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.950
And there's another
version of that,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.470
which is called the dichotic
listening experiment.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.930
This is going back
to broadband, 1958.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.020
They essentially look
something like this

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.820
where there's people who wear
headphones with messages.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.880
On the one hand, on
our left, there's

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.420
supposed to be ignored inputs.

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.020
And on the other hand, there's
supposed to be attended inputs.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.490
So the person in
the experiment is

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.130
asked, only listen to
stuff that's, I guess,

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.620
in your left ear.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.390
These are the attended inputs.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.370
I'm going to ask you some
questions about that.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.730
And then what you're
supposed to then do is--

00:05:52.447 --> 00:05:53.280
are you still stuck?

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.220
This is bad.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.220
One second.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.790
I'm going to unshare my screen.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:05.690
Exactly.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.090
Give me a second.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.870
So the way this works is you
would have headphones on.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.470
And on one hand, you
hear inputs that you're

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.740
supposed to attend to.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.350
On the other ear,
you hear inputs

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.150
that you're not
supposed to attend to.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:28.810
And usually, then, you
get explicit instructions

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.730
to attend to the
message in one ear

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.190
and then asked later about
message in the other ear.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.110
People can't remember it.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.720
And then what these
experiments often are--

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.520
when asked to keep a
number in their head,

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.660
people remember the
played message much less.

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.850
So essentially, what this
shows is that, A, I guess,

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.240
people are pretty good at
shifting attention in some way.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.640
But attention is
limited to the extent

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.190
of when you're also supposed
to attend to something

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.750
else at the same time.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.580
It's essentially
too much going on,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.380
and it's really hard for
you to remember everything.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.540
And so to some degree,
it tells us, A, I guess,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.150
attention is limited.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.240
We tend to focus--

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.680
when instructed,
at least, we tend

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.840
to focus on stuff
that's important, right?

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.465
So like in the
broadband experiment,

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:15.590
if I tell you listen to
the stuff in the right ear,

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.030
you actually focus
your attention

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:18.350
to the stuff in the right ear.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.878
You miss the stuff
on the left ear,

00:07:19.878 --> 00:07:21.920
so you can sort of direct
your attention to stuff

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:23.600
that you think is
important or you've

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.490
been instructed to focus on.

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.360
So that kind of works.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.800
But at the same time, attention
is limited in the sense of you

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.470
can actually not remember
what's in the other ear

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:34.803
because you didn't attend to it.

00:07:34.803 --> 00:07:36.845
So in some sense, it's
not like you automatically

00:07:36.845 --> 00:07:37.490
remember stuff.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.590
You have to pay
attention to things.

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:42.680
And then at the same time,
when we now exogenously reduce

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.150
people's attention
by telling people

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.570
to keep a number in their head,
distracting them in some way,

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.300
people are much more--

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.700
even playing the played
message, the message that you're

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.660
supposed to remember.

00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:59.720
I'm sure they don't remember
the other message, either.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.380
OK.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:04.155
So then in addition, which
I already alluded to,

00:08:04.155 --> 00:08:05.030
attention is limited.

00:08:07.678 --> 00:08:09.470
There might be different
factors that might

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:10.680
affect people's attention.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.790
So what factors might be
important for attention?

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.890
Could be your physical
environment in some ways.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:18.330
It could be it's really hot.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.730
It could be it's really cold.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:23.590
It could be other
threats in the room,

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:30.870
so if you're in some
place where you're

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.700
worried that there will be wild
animals coming anytime soon.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.169
Physical environment
could be really important.

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:39.400
It could be really loud.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.750
Distractions could
be social media.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.560
It could be other
stuff that you're just

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.210
trying to do at the same time.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.540
Maybe you're trying to solve
some problems right now.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.290
Maybe you're trying to prepare
for some-- for example,

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.895
I had a phone call
just before our class.

00:08:55.895 --> 00:08:58.270
And I was also trying to think
about what to do in class,

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.937
and it's just really
distracting to have

00:08:59.937 --> 00:09:02.350
other things you're thinking
about at the same time.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.260
Could be worries about your
own or others' well being.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.630
It could be sleep or what
people were saying already,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.830
people's physical environment.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.450
We're going to talk about some
of this in the poverty lecture.

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:17.170
So there in
particular, one thing

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.120
that poverty tends
to come along with

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.800
is sort of a bunch of
different ways of--

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.840
in addition to not having money
and many other deprivations,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.790
poverty tends to come along
with lots of other factors

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.190
that might reduce
people's attention.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.780
And that's to do with sleep.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.360
It's to do with
exposure to noise.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.990
It's coming with worries
about people's health

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.440
and so on and so forth.

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.350
There's some question
about practice.

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.940
Can you actually
practice attention?

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.315
And there's some
people who would

00:09:47.315 --> 00:09:49.870
argue, at least in education,
maybe at younger ages--

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.240
suppose you sit
kids down and have

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.660
them practice focusing on
tasks like multiplications

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.590
or whatever and
do math problems.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.950
Some of this, some
people would argue,

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.840
in addition to
just helping people

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.980
learn math, actually the numbers
and so on and how to multiply,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.380
you might also
actually just help

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.130
students learn how to focus and
how to pay attention carefully

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.640
to things and particularly
sustained attention

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.660
and not get distracted
by other things.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.250
Other distractions,
by the way, also,

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.730
like temptations, for example.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:29.290
So if I put a delicious
chocolate cake in front of you

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.323
and have you-- and if
you're really hungry,

00:10:31.323 --> 00:10:32.740
that might be
actually really hard

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.180
to pay attention
to whatever else

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:38.380
you're doing just because that's
really distracting to you.

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:39.080
OK.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:43.750
And so we're going to,
for now, keep thinking

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.038
about attention being fixed.

00:10:45.038 --> 00:10:47.080
We're going to get back
to the issue of attention

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.080
being malleable and
potentially being

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.250
depleted by issues such as
poverty at the end in the very

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.910
last lecture.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.500
But for now, we're
going to look at--

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.230
think about attention
as fixed but limited.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:00.730
And now we're going
to look at, what

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.670
are the consequences of that?

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:05.263
OK.

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:06.680
So then one question
you might ask

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.340
is, well, this listening
task that I just showed you

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:12.440
or when a monkey walks through
some video or the like,

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.240
it's a pretty
low-stakes situation.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.600
Who really cares?

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.630
And one Chicago
view of economics

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:21.560
would be to say, well, these
are just low-stakes situations.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.670
But once stakes are
really high, then people

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:27.298
will surely pay attention.

00:11:27.298 --> 00:11:29.090
And so there's a number
of different papers

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.500
that look at this issue.

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:39.380
But one quite nice example
here is from the stock market,

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.290
arguably an event of
high economic importance

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.230
because people make a lot of
money, potentially, from it.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.480
So there's this very nice
people by Huberman and Regev

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:51.110
from 2001 which has--

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:53.660
it's essentially an event
study and a case study

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:59.810
of stock market development
of a company called EntreMed.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:04.730
And this company in 1997
on October, November

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:08.360
has very positive early
results on a cure for cancer.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.760
Now, for any of these
types of companies,

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.550
having new cures and new
medications or vaccines

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.760
or the like are hugely valuable
because they can sell a lot

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.660
of their product in the future,
which means, essentially,

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.170
positive news about that
means you'll have lots--

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:28.790
at least with high probability
or higher probability--

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.310
large profits in the
future, to the extent

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:35.430
that the stock market is
an indication of that.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:39.020
You might expect the
stock market to go up.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.470
Now then, November 28,
the journal Nature,

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.120
which was a very highly
prominent scientific journal,

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.150
features this new
very prominently.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.560
And The New York Times,
in fact, reports on it

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:57.350
on page A28, which is very
much in the back of the paper.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:02.240
And on May 3, this is a
whole six months later.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.130
The New York Times
again features

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:09.130
essentially the same story as on
November 28 on the front page.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.250
OK.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:17.600
Now, then on November 12, 1998,
the Wall Street Journal front

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.040
page then reports about
a failed replication.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.600
It's essentially
to say, well, these

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.060
are promising new early results.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.357
These early results are
often small samples.

00:13:28.357 --> 00:13:30.440
And it's not quite clear,
does it replicate really

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.940
with larger samples and so on.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.740
Is this really a good cure?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.710
And so you kind of
won't have replications.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:40.160
And really, only if you're
able to replicate your results

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.870
is this actually
something that's useful

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:44.590
and that you can make money off.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.260
Now, what happened to the
EntreMed stock prices?

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.120
And so the first
question you might

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.310
say is, well, in a
world of full attention

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.860
with unlimited arbitrage,
as in if people

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.400
took full advantage of the
news and reacted perfectly,

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.660
what would we expect?

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.190
And second, in reality,
what did actually happen?

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.590
So let's first ask the
first question about,

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:10.013
with full attention,
what would we expect?

00:14:10.013 --> 00:14:11.680
I guess there's a bit
of a question what

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.770
happens in the first one.

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.020
There's a bit of a question,
is there insider trading?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:16.747
Or who gets the news
in the first place?

00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:19.330
So one thing you might say is,
well, maybe the first one, only

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.350
the company knows.

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.170
And maybe that's not
public knowledge.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.700
And then if there's
insider trading,

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.650
maybe the stock
market might go up.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.463
But surely, like in number
two, if Nature prominently

00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:31.630
features it, there's going
to be a bunch of traders,

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:34.242
a bunch of people who invest
in this company or not.

00:14:34.242 --> 00:14:35.950
If they pay attention,
they should really

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.260
know what's going on,
and they should really--

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.600
the stock market should go up.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.980
Conditional on that, on the
November 28 news, on May 3,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.817
there's really no
news here, right?

00:14:46.817 --> 00:14:48.400
It's kind of like
we knew this before.

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.210
If everybody was paying
attention before carefully,

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.960
the stock market should
have incorporated.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.250
The news is out.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:56.020
Traders know.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:00.280
You should buy this, or
stocks at this company

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.662
is going to be more profitable.

00:15:01.662 --> 00:15:02.620
So stocks should go up.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.250
So really, if there's
full attention,

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:10.030
you expect nothing to
happen on May 3, '98.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.340
And then if there's a
failed replication, well,

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:18.190
to the extent that this means
this cancer cure is entirely

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.520
useless, the stock market
should essentially just go down

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.530
to where it was before.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.400
Now, but what about in reality?

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.890
So let me actually
just show you.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.940
So here's the reality of this.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.170
So there's not even--

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:39.410
there's the previous
events done in here.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.300
This is essentially the
first story that comes out.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.150
You see a little bit
of an increase here.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.567
But actually, quite a bit in
relative terms with something

00:15:46.567 --> 00:15:48.050
like 5%.

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:50.210
It seems like people
just didn't really quite

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:52.370
notice what was going on.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.137
And there's also
no trend upwards.

00:15:55.137 --> 00:15:57.470
It's not like the news is
spreading across people and so

00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:58.160
on.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:01.470
And then there's like a huge
jump now in The New York Times,

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:01.970
right?

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.370
So this is essentially here,
it's in The New York Times

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:06.410
but in the back of the journal.

00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:09.080
Up here, it's essentially The
New York Times, the front page.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.930
And suddenly, lots of
people pay attention

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.760
to news that's actually not
news because that was already

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.000
in The New York Times before.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.792
To the extent that
everybody pays attention

00:16:18.792 --> 00:16:21.140
to this, unlimited attention
and unlimited arbitrage,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.420
we should essentially expect
no effects whatsoever.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.170
So we see a huge spike in
the stock market price.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.420
Maybe the stock market
overreacted a bit

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.080
and went down a little bit.

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.770
But then what we see here is
then the negative effective

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.510
of the failed replication.

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:37.910
Notice that here, the stock
market is still quite a bit

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:38.150
high.

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:40.650
The price is still up quite a
bit high, maybe twice as high,

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:44.115
about 20 compared to
10 as it was before.

00:16:44.115 --> 00:16:46.490
It's a little bit hard to
interpret that because it could

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.330
just be that maybe
there's still a chance

00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.040
that the cure might work out.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.500
Maybe there's other news about
the company in the meantime

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.130
that are positive and so on.

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:58.430
But the key part
here is the fact

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:02.000
that the stock market went
up here on May 4, 1998,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.974
really is saying it's
news for lots of people.

00:17:07.974 --> 00:17:09.349
And really, it
shouldn't be news.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:10.849
And there shouldn't
be any reaction

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.650
because, essentially,
it's old news,

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.700
as you would say, in the
sense of people in 1997

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:19.745
in November 28 already
reported all of that.

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.569
Does that make sense?

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.140
OK.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.390
And there's lots of examples
of these kinds of things.

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.020
But essentially,
some of this is--

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.288
in attention, some of
it is also confusion.

00:17:34.288 --> 00:17:35.830
I don't know if any
of you have heard

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:40.170
of what happened to the
Zoom stock market price,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:40.920
stock price.

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:46.250
I don't know if any of you
have heard of this story.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.000
So essentially,
there's a company Zoom,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.650
which is the company
that we're using

00:17:50.650 --> 00:17:53.440
right now to record this video.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:55.630
The stock market
price of Zoom has

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.820
gone up a lot during
the last three months,

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.010
rightly so because
Zoom now has--

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.190
Zoom's profits
has gone up a lot.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.345
For example, MIT now
has a corporate license

00:18:04.345 --> 00:18:07.630
of Zoom, which essentially
means thousands of people

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:10.300
now are using or can use Zoom,
and that's an expensive thing

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.460
to do.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.640
It turns out there's
another company that's

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.790
also called Zoom except for
that it's a different company

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.460
and has nothing to do with
the actual Zoom technology.

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.650
It turns out that
the Zoom stock market

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:26.650
price for this other company
went up a lot, as well.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:31.870
The ticker for that company is
actually ZOOM, so like Zoom,

00:18:31.870 --> 00:18:34.030
as opposed to the
actual Zoom company

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:35.200
that we're using right now.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.210
Their ticker is ZM.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.940
And so at some point,
actually, the trading

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.393
for that other company
was halted, presumably

00:18:42.393 --> 00:18:43.810
because people
were very confused,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.768
and they were not really
paying close attention

00:18:45.768 --> 00:18:48.512
to what is the right ticker,
what's the right company

00:18:48.512 --> 00:18:49.720
that they're actually buying.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.178
They thought they
were buying Zoom,

00:18:51.178 --> 00:18:55.090
like the actual online
video conferencing

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.695
company, while in
fact they were just

00:18:56.695 --> 00:18:58.570
buying some other company
that's actually not

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:00.610
even doing anything anymore.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:05.800
So there's lots of stories
about people being inattentive

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.530
even in situations when stakes
are really, really high.

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.350
Now, then, you might say,
well, how do we now measure?

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:16.980
So now in some sense we
have some evidence here

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.620
that people are-- in some sense
somewhat informal evidence

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.660
that people are inattentive.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:25.950
Now, how would you measure the
impact of inattention overall?

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:30.730
So if you wanted to just
measure and demonstrate

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:33.340
that people are inattentive,
in addition to what I've just

00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.690
shown you, what might you do?

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.960
How might you do that?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.100
There's some information that
you usually get in the world

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.600
and they should have.

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:45.560
One example that we can discuss
is essentially prices or taxes.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.320
And now if you want to
demonstrate that people

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.720
are actually missing those
prices or taxes, what

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.210
you can do is now you
can make it very salient.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.220
You make it really
apparent to people.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:20:00.320
And then you can look at, when
you look at changes in prices

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:03.680
or the change of making things
from non-selling to selling,

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:04.940
how do people react?

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:07.640
Or maybe you make, for
example, taxes very salient.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.240
What happens to people's
demand for certain products?

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.170
And if then making things
salient changes people's

00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:20.030
behavior, that then identifies
underlying inattention.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.860
So if you just-- people
don't have access

00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:23.480
to certain information,
in some sense, that's

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.188
less interesting
because that just means,

00:20:25.188 --> 00:20:27.440
well, I don't have
the information

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.200
that's really available to me.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.950
But in some ways, I
could make information

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.330
that's really very salient--

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:34.700
I essentially could
reduce the salience,

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.250
as you say, of certain types
of information-- again,

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.545
information that should
be available to them.

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:43.340
For example, suppose I do sales.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:46.010
And I'm trying to, as
a company, sell things.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.850
You go to a store.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.770
And usually, sales are made
very salient to people.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:51.770
Now you could essentially
just change the prices

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.930
without making these
sales very salient.

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:57.680
And then you could look at, how
attentive are people to that?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:00.470
In a way, that's, in some
ways, less natural, right,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:03.248
because when people are--

00:21:03.248 --> 00:21:04.790
in a way, what we
want to demonstrate

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.390
is that in people's
real lives, there's

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:10.730
information available to them.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.940
And they're not really paying
sufficiently much attention

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:15.000
to it.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.200
So if you can then
change that in some ways

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.670
and demonstrate that now
they're changing their behavior,

00:21:20.670 --> 00:21:22.220
that must mean that
previously, they

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.700
had been like misoptimizing.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.280
If instead you
did something like

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:34.340
if you reduce the salience of
certain types of information,

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.840
that's, in a way, somewhat less
interesting because it would

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.898
say, well, it doesn't
really mean that they

00:21:39.898 --> 00:21:41.190
were inattentive to start with.

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:42.930
It's more like you're hiding
something from people,

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.990
and now they can't find it.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:45.990
That's, in some ways,
somewhat less interesting.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.230
But I think in principle,
you'd also, exactly as you say,

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.570
identify inattention.

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:55.060
So there's a few type of
things that people have done.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.660
And to be clear, there's
often a pretty fine line

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.778
between attention and memory.

00:21:59.778 --> 00:22:02.070
So one thing we could do is--
and this is what Maya was

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.840
saying previously--

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.090
you could make certain features,
like taxes, very salient.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.010
That's what we're
going to look at next.

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.290
In addition, you could
provide some information

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.420
when the correct response
is known already.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.378
That's one we're going
to talk about afterwards

00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:19.020
is the study by Hanna et al.

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.150
So that's kind of
like when people

00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:23.310
have certain types of
information already

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.130
but then providing that
information again or giving

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.920
that information in some
sort of concise form

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.670
and potentially notifying
people of the fact

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:36.190
that this information could
be or should be important.

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:38.310
And then we now see
people react to it.

00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:41.100
That doesn't mean that that
must mean that, before, they

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.480
were inattentive.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.150
Another thing that people
have done a lot is reminders.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.972
Reminders often
are sort of like--

00:22:47.972 --> 00:22:49.930
you can think of the
pieces like memory issues,

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.630
and people just forget things.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.120
But in some sense, memory
issues and attention issues

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.505
are very closely linked.

00:22:55.505 --> 00:22:56.880
If you forget
something, then you

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.570
don't pay attention
to something.

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.450
So if I remind you of
something, now you're

00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.040
paying attention
to, for example,

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.340
your savings or your medical
adherence, like you should

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.380
take certain drugs and so on.

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:10.050
There's a number of studies that
essentially provide reminders

00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:11.370
to people.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.800
And if these reminders
have effects,

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:16.620
then that must mean that people
were not paying attention

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.470
to those kinds of
things, often presumably

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:20.760
because of memory problems.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.330
They just forget sometimes.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:25.140
OK.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:29.010
So now let me start
with a very simple model

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.030
to help us understand the
results from the Chetty et al.

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:33.690
paper.

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:37.813
It's very simple and very
sort of just sketched.

00:23:37.813 --> 00:23:39.480
But I think it's
actually helpful to see

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.900
what people are doing.

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:43.350
So consider a good
with a value of V

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:47.190
inclusive of the price, which
is the sum of two components.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:50.430
The components are
little v and o.

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:53.250
So there's visible and
salient component v,

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.040
and there's an
opaque component o.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.820
OK.

00:23:56.820 --> 00:24:00.750
And so if you're
now inattentive,

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:05.130
the consumer, inattentive
consumer perceived

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.040
value-- instead of
perceiving the true value V,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:11.010
the consumer perceives
the value of V hat,

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:13.815
which is little v, which
is a salient component.

00:24:13.815 --> 00:24:15.690
So even if you're
inattentive, the assumption

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:20.290
is the salient part of
the good you always see.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.290
For example, what color
is the good or the like?

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.466
You always see that.

00:24:24.466 --> 00:24:28.440
And in addition, the opaque
component, the stuff that's

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.050
not salient, you're only
going to pay attention

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.810
to the fraction
of 1 minus theta.

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.890
So the degree of
inattention-- so theta

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:40.340
is our inattention parameter.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:43.230
And theta measures how much
are you paying attention

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.020
to stuff that's not
particularly salient.

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.950
So for theta equals 0, you're
back to the cases before.

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.640
For theta equals 0, V hat
equals V, which is essentially

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.360
just a standard case.

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.740
If theta were 1-- so theta is
supposed to be between 0 and 1.

00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.570
If theta is 1, then
essentially you're

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:04.490
not paying attention at all
to the opaque component.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.780
And anywhere in between,
essentially, then, you're

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:10.630
paying only partial attention
to the opaque component.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:16.150
So the interpretation is each
individual essentially sees v--

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:19.770
sorry, sees o to some degree
but processes it only partially

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:22.620
to the degree of theta.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:25.740
Of course, whether you actually
see it and not process it

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:28.260
or whether you miss it
entirely is, in some sense,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.470
a philosophical question.

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.180
But think about like, everybody
has, at least in principle,

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.080
access to the component o.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.700
But they only process
and pay attention to it

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:41.610
only to some degree.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.270
OK.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.410
So Chetty et al. applies this
model essentially to taxes.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:51.150
So one very interesting
feature about some taxes

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.080
is the fact that sales taxes
are only added at the register,

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.670
right?

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:03.300
At least in most cases, you
would shop in the store.

00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:05.910
And then the sales tax, only
at the end once you actually

00:26:05.910 --> 00:26:10.620
go to the store, will be added.

00:26:10.620 --> 00:26:13.890
Now, people are not--

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:14.400
people know.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.838
When you ask people
directly, what

00:26:15.838 --> 00:26:18.255
is the sales tax in your state,
people actually on average

00:26:18.255 --> 00:26:19.588
are pretty good at knowing this.

00:26:19.588 --> 00:26:22.510
So it's not like people don't
know that there's a sales tax.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:24.900
But they might just
forget that there

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.380
are sales taxes for goods.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:32.550
So now what you can do now
is you can compare the demand

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:38.340
response to sales tax changes
versus the demand response

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.050
to other price changes, right?

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:44.640
So if you see prices
fluctuating in a store over time

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.240
or across goods,
presumably, everybody

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.280
sees those price
changes overall,

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.160
if these are price
changes that are not

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.050
related to sales
taxes, the reason

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.257
being once you're in the store,
you're going to look at prices.

00:26:58.257 --> 00:27:00.090
You're going to see is
the price high or low

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.560
even before you go
to the register.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:05.160
So presumably, you see the
price tag pretty much most

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.310
of the time.

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:09.900
In contrast, when you
look at sales tax changes,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.750
if the sales taxes
go up for some reason

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:16.290
or if there's a sales tax
for some items versus others,

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.410
you might just miss
that at the time

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.350
when you're choosing your goods
before you go to the register.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.120
And once you're then
at the register,

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:27.810
you might not even notice that
you have paid the sales tax.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:29.490
Or you might be
surprised and just don't

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:34.540
change your behavior any
more but at least notice it.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:36.010
So now what did
Chetty et al. do?

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:39.610
They have data on the demand
for items in a grocery store.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:44.830
And they have essentially
the demand, D of V hat.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:47.648
Remember, V hat is the function
of the perceived value,

00:27:47.648 --> 00:27:48.940
which I showed you here before.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:50.340
Let me go back for a second.

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.450
So you see V hat
here is v, which

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:55.750
is the salient component,
plus 1 minus theta times o

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.710
as the opaque component.

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:02.380
So the demand for goods depends
on the perceived value, V hat,

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:03.890
that people have.

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.600
And there's a visible
part as the value V, which

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.500
is inclusive of the price.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.735
So when you look at
when you're in a store,

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:12.610
you look at the good.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:13.300
You see the good.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.467
You see whether you like it.

00:28:14.467 --> 00:28:15.340
You see the brand.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.600
You see the color and
so on and so forth.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.680
You also see the
price, so the valuation

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.592
that you give or the value
V that you draw from that

00:28:23.592 --> 00:28:25.300
is essentially telling
how much they want

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:29.860
to have this thing minus
the price that you see,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.890
which goes into the visible
part of your valuation.

00:28:32.890 --> 00:28:34.670
And then there's a
less visible part,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:36.820
which is just stuff
that's essentially hidden.

00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:39.430
And there's a bunch of
different parts to that

00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:41.320
that you might not
pay attention to,

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.260
which could be
ingredients or the like,

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:46.460
or was it organic
or not and the like.

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.670
But in particular,
the sales tax, right?

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.190
So if you think
about your valuation,

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:52.810
you would have to
essentially, however

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.880
much you like the
good-- you have

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.850
to subtract the
sales tax because you

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:00.290
have to pay taxes on that good.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.990
And that's less
visible to some people.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.660
So you might not
pay attention to it.

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:10.990
So in this case, it'll be V hat
is v, the visible component,

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.320
plus 1 minus theta times o.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.280
And that's just repeating
what I showed you before.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:19.810
And that equals v minus
1 minus theta times tp,

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:21.610
which is the sales tax.

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:25.840
And now to the extent that
people pay attention to theta,

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.370
the sales tax might
matter more or less.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:32.620
There might be other
opaque components

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.082
that are unobservable
both to the experimenter

00:29:35.082 --> 00:29:36.040
but also to the person.

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.310
They can abstract from that.

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:39.727
So for now, they can essentially
say the less visible part

00:29:39.727 --> 00:29:43.090
is only the state tax.

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:45.070
OK.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.120
Any questions on this?

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:52.010
OK.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.320
So now, and this
is sort of like--

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.010
so now, essentially,
what this gives us now,

00:29:58.010 --> 00:30:01.370
we can essentially try
to see if we have this--

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:06.440
how can we identify
this parameter theta

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:08.750
by making things very salient?

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:13.510
And so the idea is now to
make the tax fully salient.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.783
Let me show you how this
looks like in practice.

00:30:15.783 --> 00:30:16.450
Here's the math.

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:18.300
But I'll go back to
this in a second.

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.130
Let me just show you what this
looks like in the experiment.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.760
So the idea in the
experiment is to say--

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.200
you see on the lower part
here, you see a normal price.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.940
You see an original
price tag here.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.120
This is what the price tag
usually would look like.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.240
So this would be an item.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.360
I guess this is brushes.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:41.357
This item would
cost $5.79 usually.

00:30:41.357 --> 00:30:43.065
And then what they
did in the experiment,

00:30:43.065 --> 00:30:45.910
they essentially added a tag
where they said, now here,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:49.240
%5.79 plus sales tax is $6.22.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.190
And now they make
it entirely salient

00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:53.510
that there's a sales
tax, and you make

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.070
the true price very salient.

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.570
OK.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:57.945
And now the question
is if you do

00:30:57.945 --> 00:31:05.350
that, if we go from theta
being, for example, say 5.5,

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:09.100
you only partially
observe the sales tax.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.970
If you go from that to making
the sales tax fully salient,

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:15.010
what happens to people's demand?

00:31:15.010 --> 00:31:19.780
And can you infer from that
theta, what theta actually

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.560
looks like?

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:22.270
So let me go back to this.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.180
So essentially, what
we're trying to look at,

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.480
we're trying to look
at a change in demand

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.460
when theta falls to 0.

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.750
Why does theta fall to 0?

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:33.280
The assumption here
is that whatever

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.770
is theta people have before,
so you might partially

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:38.740
or even not at all--

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:42.220
theta might be 0.5 or 1
or whatever for people.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:43.870
But now the
intervention that I just

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.330
showed you brings
theta down to 0, right?

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:48.520
Because now it's fully
salient to people

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.200
what the sales tax is.

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:52.420
And so the question
is now, can we

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.670
have an expression for
the change in log demand

00:31:54.670 --> 00:32:00.880
when theta falls from whatever
it is before down to 0?

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.260
So now what we have is
the change in log demand

00:32:05.260 --> 00:32:11.385
is the demand that
we had before.

00:32:11.385 --> 00:32:12.760
This is what I
showed you before.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.370
This was essentially demand
as a function of V. Remember

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:16.620
what I showed you here before.

00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:17.412
Give me one second.

00:32:17.412 --> 00:32:18.270
I'll go back.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:20.910
So what I showed you here,
demand is a function of V hat.

00:32:20.910 --> 00:32:22.350
And V hat is this animal here.

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:26.070
It's v minus 1 minus
theta times tp.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:29.190
Now, the question is, what
happens to demand when

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:30.987
or log demand here--
forget about the log.

00:32:30.987 --> 00:32:32.070
It's not that interesting.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.570
That's just for math.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.830
So here's the demand as a
function of what it was before.

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.420
And here's demand
when I now make

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.010
things very salient, right?

00:32:41.010 --> 00:32:43.490
So now here in this
case, theta equals 0.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:46.945
And here, theta is
whatever it had before.

00:32:46.945 --> 00:32:48.570
Now when you have
this expression, what

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:52.650
you can do is you can linearize
that, take the derivative

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:56.195
and say, what is
this difference?

00:32:56.195 --> 00:32:58.320
Well, this difference is--
and you can do the math.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.640
It's essentially theta times tp.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.440
And then here, this
is the derivative

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:05.790
with respect to theta.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.700
And what this gives
you essentially

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.210
is that the change in log
demand is a function of theta,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.640
a function of tau,
which is like the tax,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.060
and eta, which is
the price elasticity.

00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:22.260
So essentially, that's to say
if you have now an intervention,

00:33:22.260 --> 00:33:25.470
we can look at, how does
demand or log demand change

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.060
when we do this
intervention, assuming

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.280
that this intervention
brings theta from whatever

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.740
it was before down to 0?

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.930
We can look at now
what happens to demand.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:35.550
That's delta log demand here.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:37.123
That's just a definition.

00:33:37.123 --> 00:33:38.040
And you can have that.

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.900
That's an expression of how we
can relate that to theta to t,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:46.170
which is like the taxes--
it is at something like 7%--

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:49.570
and then eta, which is the
price elasticity of demand.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:52.170
So that is to say, if we have
this change in demand that we

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:54.630
observe from changing
theta down to 0

00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:58.740
and if we had the price
elasticity from just

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.540
other variation in prices
that we see in the world

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:04.740
and if you have t, which is
just how much the tax is,

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.130
that would allow us
to identify theta.

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.010
And that's what the
experiment is trying to do.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:13.560
So that implies essentially--
so we can just rearrange this.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.330
We can just say theta is, just
sort of rearranging things,

00:34:18.330 --> 00:34:22.860
minus the change in log demand
from this intervention divided

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:26.389
by t times the price elasticity.

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.699
OK, and that is just
to say essentially

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.090
what we're trying to see is,
intuitively, that's just to say

00:34:32.090 --> 00:34:35.690
once we make things very salient
going from things not being

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:38.449
salient to start with to
making things very salient,

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.610
how much does
demand change there?

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:48.270
And then we can
look at, well, for--

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:52.480
in this case, I guess, this is
the taxes made very salient.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.219
And then we can
look at, well, how

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:55.840
does this compare
to other changes

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.870
in prices, assuming that
essentially people are paying

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.580
attention to prices anyway?

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:05.290
So if you look at things
becoming more expensive by 1%,

00:35:05.290 --> 00:35:08.470
how much are people changing
their behavior there?

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:11.800
And now we have to take into
account that what's being

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.750
made salient here is the tax t.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.480
And from backing out the
relative changes in demand

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.810
for usual price changes
versus making things salient,

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.750
we can now try to measure
theta as how much did they

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.830
pay attention before.

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:28.870
So one way to say this is for
example, if we make things very

00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:30.930
salient and the
change in log demand

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:33.320
did not-- there's no
change in log demand,

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.050
what does that imply for theta?

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.300
What would we learn from that?

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.105
So what was the change
here in demand at 0?

00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:40.730
People did not change
the demand at all

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:42.760
when you make
things very salient

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.980
versus what it was before.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.130
Or put differently, if
theta equals 0 here,

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:52.270
then these two expressions are
the same, which essentially

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:55.180
means that this thing here
is also going to be 0.

00:35:55.180 --> 00:36:01.750
So essentially, to the extent
that our intervention induces

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:10.030
large changes in demand, that
must mean that essentially,

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.010
people were very
attentive to start with.

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.200
Essentially, if I'm making
the prices very salient

00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:20.310
and nothing happens, well,
that means people were already

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:22.590
paying attention before.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:25.710
Now, in the maximum
case, if people

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.760
were paying no attention
to prices before,

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.120
what would happen then?

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.870
Well, in that case, I
guess-- oops, sorry.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:36.660
In that case, theta would be 1.

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:38.490
So essentially, it
would just be going

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:41.730
from-- we would look at what's
the demand or change in demand

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:46.380
from going v minus tp to
v, which is essentially

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.900
just a change in tp.

00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:55.080
So that would be essentially
say if the tax was 7%, now

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:57.030
we just have to look at
what is the equivalent

00:36:57.030 --> 00:37:01.380
effect of a 7% increase
in the price, which

00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:03.672
is exactly what we have here.

00:37:03.672 --> 00:37:05.130
So essentially,
just to summarize--

00:37:05.130 --> 00:37:07.560
and I think the math is, in some
sense, not that interesting.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:09.030
But essentially,
to summarize, it's

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:12.510
like the larger our reaction
is to this intervention,

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.490
the more inattentive
most people have

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:19.410
been before because if they're
inattentive to start with,

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.040
they react more to making
things more salient.

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:26.180
So let me show you what
this looks like in practice.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.760
Again, the goal here is to
estimate a change in demand

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:30.710
from making taxes fully salient.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.380
Again, here's the
original tag, and here's

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.600
the experimental tag.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.060
It's very, very salient, very,
very clear, and very hard

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:38.930
to miss for people.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.305
And the assumption
essentially is

00:37:40.305 --> 00:37:44.120
that people pay now full
attention to this new tag.

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.920
They have a three-week
period in which--

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.657
and this is an
experiment in California.

00:37:48.657 --> 00:37:50.240
They have a three-week
period in which

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.700
they modify price
tags of certain items

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:55.700
so that they go essentially
to different stores.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.690
They pick one store.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:59.060
And then essentially,
they modify the price tag

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.090
only of the subset
of randomized goods.

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:06.950
And they make the after-tax
price salient in addition

00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:08.630
to the pre-tax price, right?

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:11.390
The pre-tax price is
already very salient here.

00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:16.073
In addition, they make the
after-tax price very salient.

00:38:16.073 --> 00:38:17.490
And now they're
going to do what's

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:21.360
called a triple-diff estimate,
which is, in some sense, a very

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:24.420
funky or fancy word just to
say what we're going to do

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:29.280
is we compare the
sales or the demand

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.080
during the treatment
periods to the following.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.360
So there's a treatment period.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.140
We compare how much of certain
goods have been treated.

00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.860
How much do the sales change
compared to the previous week

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:43.002
sales for the same items?

00:38:43.002 --> 00:38:44.460
Second, we're going
to compare them

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.940
to sales for items in which
the tax was not made salient.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.720
So there's some goods in the
store for which the tax was not

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:52.950
made salient.

00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:56.140
And then finally, there's
going to be control stores.

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:58.050
So we're going to
look at essentially,

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:00.240
in the stores that
receive the treatment

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.850
or in the store that receives
the treatment, what happens

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.160
to the goods that receive
the treatment compared

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.650
to the goods that don't
receive the treatment?

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:11.940
We compare that to demand
before the treatment was

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.235
enacted for both of
those types of goods.

00:39:15.235 --> 00:39:16.860
Essentially, what's
the relative change

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:20.940
in demand for the treated versus
the non-treated items before

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:21.555
versus after?

00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:22.930
So that's essentially
what people

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.710
would call a diff in diff,
like difference in differences.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.980
And in addition to that,
they compare that difference

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.770
in differences to the same
difference in differences

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:32.715
in the control stores.

00:39:32.715 --> 00:39:36.010
So let me show you exactly
what this looks like.

00:39:36.010 --> 00:39:37.410
So this is a bit
of a messy table

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.430
or a table with a
lot of information.

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.380
But it's in fact quite simple.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.280
So what we have here is at
the top is a treatment store.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.970
And at the bottom, there's
some control stores.

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:49.500
So in the control stores,
nothing has been changed.

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:52.050
So there's no experiment.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.960
There's no additional tax
and so on being added.

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:57.645
In the treatment stores, there's
going to be control categories

00:39:57.645 --> 00:39:59.640
and treated categories.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.890
Notice that they didn't fully
randomize all the goods.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.140
So it's not like if there's
one brush next to another,

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.420
one brush has taxes versus not.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:09.090
Presumably, because they're
trying to minimize spillovers

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:12.125
in some sense, if you only
make this tax salient for one

00:40:12.125 --> 00:40:13.500
good that's next
to another good,

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:15.917
people would get very confused
because they're like, well,

00:40:15.917 --> 00:40:18.510
why does this one have
taxes made salient and then

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.590
the other one not?

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:22.200
So now this is across
categories where people maybe

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.780
only pay attention to certain
goods in certain categories

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.630
to start with.

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:28.810
So what we're seeing
here is now here,

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.885
these are the control categories
and the treated categories.

00:40:31.885 --> 00:40:34.510
And we can look at what's called
the difference in differences.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.200
We can look at the change in
demand in the treatment stores.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.440
What we're going to
look at is essentially

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.540
the change in demand in
the control categories

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.440
and the treatment categories.

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.150
So what we see here
is we can compare

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.670
how much is sold in the
experimental period, which

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:52.270
is this row here,
compared to our baseline.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.210
What we see is essentially
demand in the control

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.850
categories was going up
a little bit by 0.84.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:40:59.590
That's just because
of seasonalities.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.840
Maybe people were just
buying more anyway

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.250
for whatever reason.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.100
And in the treated categories
over the same period,

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.260
comparing essentially
the experimental periods

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:12.920
to the baseline period,
demand went down.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.800
So now the difference
in differences estimate

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.620
is essentially the change in
demand in the treatment stores,

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.153
comparing the treated categories
compared to the control

00:41:20.153 --> 00:41:21.820
categories, which is
just the difference

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.170
between this column
and this column,

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.570
which is minus 2.14 units.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.300
OK.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:31.150
So that's essentially,
how much did the demand

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.750
change before versus after in
the treated categories compared

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:38.330
to the same change in
the control categories?

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.090
So that's essentially
a difference

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.240
in differences estimator.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:45.560
Now, they also have
the control stores.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:48.110
Why would we want the
control stores, as well?

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:50.510
Why is that helpful to have?

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:53.930
Suppose that improved sunscreen,
and now it's getting warmer.

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:57.410
It's really hot, and everybody
was out buying sunscreen.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.540
Then you see essentially
people's demand

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:00.645
in the control categories.

00:42:00.645 --> 00:42:02.270
The treatment category
goes up by a lot

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:04.070
or goes down by a lot
for whatever reason.

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.070
Suppose it's umbrellas, and
one week was really rainy,

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:08.780
and the other one was not rainy.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:12.140
And we see now essentially
seasonal or other differences

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:15.297
over time in some of the
categories that would,

00:42:15.297 --> 00:42:16.880
even if it's randomized,
it could just

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.480
happen to be the case.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:21.230
So that would not have to
do anything with a sales tax

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.890
being salient.

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:23.508
That's just by chance.

00:42:23.508 --> 00:42:25.550
So now it's very nice to
have some control stores

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.410
where we can look at like the
same difference in difference

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.060
estimates and some of the
control stores, in some sense,

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.193
like a placebo.

00:42:31.193 --> 00:42:32.360
They can do the same things.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.860
There's going to be the control
categories and the treatment

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.960
categories.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:38.150
Notice, to be very clear,
in the control stores,

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:42.190
the treated categories do not
receive any actual treatment.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:44.330
So we can do the same
difference in differences.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.900
And what we see here is now
that there's essentially

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:48.750
no difference here.

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.110
So the demand in the
control categories

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:54.403
went up a little bit for
whatever reason in the treated.

00:42:54.403 --> 00:42:56.820
And this is a little bit smaller
than in this other store.

00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.950
This difference is not
statistically significant.

00:42:58.950 --> 00:43:01.200
But anyway, the control
categories go up a little bit.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.433
The treated categories
go also up a little bit.

00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:05.600
When you do this difference
in differences estimate,

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.453
you find essentially
no difference.

00:43:07.453 --> 00:43:08.870
In the control
categories, there's

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:11.360
no change in the
treated categories

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:13.610
compared to the baseline
compared to the control

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:14.200
categories.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.820
So difference in difference
estimate in the control

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:18.722
category is essentially 0.

00:43:18.722 --> 00:43:20.930
And now what you can do is
essentially the difference

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:22.190
in differences estimate.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.940
You can compare.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:25.130
You can subtract
this number here

00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:27.170
minus this number
here, which gives you

00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:31.100
the triple-diff estimate,
which essentially

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.070
is the relative change of
treatment versus control

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:37.580
before and after and treatment
versus control stores.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:41.970
It's a little bit lots of
differences in your head.

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:45.570
But I hope this comparison
from the table makes it clear.

00:43:45.570 --> 00:43:48.728
Any questions on the
estimate or the procedure

00:43:48.728 --> 00:43:49.520
that they're doing?

00:43:58.750 --> 00:43:59.380
OK.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.200
So what we see here now
is essentially now making

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.290
these taxes salient in
the treated categories

00:44:05.290 --> 00:44:09.010
in the treatment stores
reduces demand, right?

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:10.670
Because essentially,
demand goes down.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:11.860
Why does the demand go down?

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.678
Well, the perceived price that
people face has now gone up.

00:44:16.678 --> 00:44:18.220
And now they buy
less of these goods,

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:21.280
presumably because before,
they were not paying attention.

00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:22.570
Now the price goes up.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:25.570
And now, essentially,
demand falls, as it should,

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:29.650
because now things
are more expensive.

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:32.690
And this is here the result. The
average quantity sold decreases

00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:35.600
by 2.2 units-- this is
units of the goods--

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:37.610
relative to baseline
level of 25.

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:41.240
That's an 8.8% decline.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.965
And now we can use
our own formula

00:44:42.965 --> 00:44:46.700
and compute the
degree of inattention.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:54.440
Essentially, now we can say, OK,
now we know what the tax was.

00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:57.850
The tax was 7.375%.

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:02.390
We can estimate the price
elasticity in some other ways.

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:05.380
Essentially, we can say,
what happens if prices go up

00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:07.728
by 1% for other reasons?

00:45:07.728 --> 00:45:10.270
What if the salient component
that's already salient goes up?

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:13.120
This is week-by-week
variation across stores.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.480
So if the prices go up,
what's the price elasticity?

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.370
And the estimate of
those price elasticity

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:21.100
is also given from
other variation.

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:22.660
That's 1.59.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:24.598
And now we can essentially
back out theta.

00:45:24.598 --> 00:45:26.140
Essentially, what
we're trying to ask

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:34.510
is we have a change in 2.2 units
that is making prices salient.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:36.880
Now the question is, well,
how large of a change

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:42.220
is it relative to a change in
prices of 1%, 2%, and so on?

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:47.440
We know that essentially the
price elasticity is 1.59.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:50.780
So we can essentially
just back out theta.

00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:52.360
And so what we get
from this formula

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.150
now is that theta is about 0.75,
which says that consumers react

00:45:58.150 --> 00:46:01.480
to price changes due to sales
tax changes only a quarter as

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.490
much as to other price changes.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:08.200
So essentially, consumers are
very inattentive, in fact,

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:12.080
to sales taxes, to
sales tax changes.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:13.840
In fact, they only
perceive a quarter

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:19.280
as much as any other price
changes in the world.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:21.730
And that's really saying,
look, people really

00:46:21.730 --> 00:46:23.980
seem to be missing these
things that are not salient.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:27.080
Now if you make them salient,
people change their behavior.

00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:31.000
Therefore, they must have been
inattentive to start with.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.805
In addition to that
kind of evidence,

00:46:33.805 --> 00:46:35.500
Chetty et al. also
have some evidence

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.770
on using non-experimental
variation.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:40.810
And in some sense, you
could say the evidence

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.602
that I just showed you from
the store is a little bit

00:46:43.602 --> 00:46:46.060
weird because, in some sense,
you see these different tags.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.640
And maybe the tags
raise attention

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:50.740
to the price even
regardless of the tax.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:53.150
And it's a little bit
weird in some ways.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:55.720
So it's quite nice to have
some complementary evidence

00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:03.140
of a non-experimental
panel deliberation.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:07.810
And so what they do is they
look at beer consumption.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:12.640
And it turns out beer, tobacco,
and other types of goods

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:16.600
have two types of
taxes levied on them.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.020
They have an excise tax, which
is included in the price.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.773
This is highly salient
during choice the process

00:47:23.773 --> 00:47:25.690
because essentially it's
in the price already.

00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:27.997
So if taxes go up,
essentially, the price goes up.

00:47:27.997 --> 00:47:29.830
And people will notice
if they pay attention

00:47:29.830 --> 00:47:32.170
or since they pay attention
to prices, since they

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:36.280
like the price tag already.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:37.660
And then there's a sales tax.

00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:39.970
This is the tax that we were
just talking about before.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:42.460
That's essentially very opaque
during the choice process,

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:43.810
as we just showed.

00:47:43.810 --> 00:47:46.570
And now we can look at
variation across states

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:52.300
and over time of changes in
excise taxes and sales taxes.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.280
And we can look at,
how much do people

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.700
react to excise taxes
relative to how much people

00:47:57.700 --> 00:47:59.440
react to sales taxes.

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.450
And that relative reaction
will tell us, again,

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:04.030
something about theta.

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:07.210
And what Chetty et al. finds
in here is a table for that.

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.690
Essentially, when you look
at changes in excise taxes,

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.210
this tax is very salient.

00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:18.850
The price elasticity
is above 0.8 or 0.9.

00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:22.600
So essentially, when
the price goes up by 1%,

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.680
people react by about almost 1%.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.400
In contrast, there's some
differences in estimates.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.590
But once you control
for things properly,

00:48:32.590 --> 00:48:35.560
people essentially do not
react to the sales tax at all.

00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.520
Maybe a little bit, but overall,
the number's very, very low.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:42.180
And now, essentially, the ratio
of these types of reaction

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.160
tells you how
attentive people are.

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.900
Essentially, if you
divide, say, for example--

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:53.427
if you took column number three,
if you divide 0.003 by 0.86,

00:48:53.427 --> 00:48:55.510
and you have to do a little
bit of additional math

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.550
that's uninteresting--
you essentially

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:00.430
will get a result that,
essentially, people do not

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:03.610
pay attention to sales taxes.

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.490
1 minus theta is
eventually close to 0.

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.400
Put differently, the degree
of inattention is almost 1.

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:11.170
Theta is almost 1.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.620
So essentially, people
do not pay attention

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:18.190
to these types of taxes.

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:20.740
Inattention is almost complete.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.560
So there's substantial
consumer inattention

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:26.300
to non-transparent taxes.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.760
So what I've shown you
so far is, essentially,

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.300
the existence of inattention.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:33.550
It doesn't say why
people are inattentive.

00:49:33.550 --> 00:49:37.040
It could be people just can't
do the math in their head.

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:39.040
It could be people don't
want to bother with it.

00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.457
They're sort of saying, well,
it's kind of a small change.

00:49:41.457 --> 00:49:42.520
So why do we really care?

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.607
It could be that people who
buy alcohol half of the time

00:49:45.607 --> 00:49:47.440
are drunk, and they
don't pay any attention.

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:54.020
There's no modeling in any way
of, why are people doing this?

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.580
This is just saying this shows
the existence of inattention

00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:00.070
in those kinds of
consumer choices.

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:02.020
It doesn't say why
people are inattentive.

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.120
And you might say,
well, 7% of a tax

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.770
is kind of a small distortion.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:10.460
So it might be actually
optimal to miss that,

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.712
which is a reasonable approach.

00:50:12.712 --> 00:50:14.170
It is probably
quite a bit of money

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:15.920
and quite a bit of
distortion if you think

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:17.740
about it and you actually--

00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.210
7% is not nothing.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:21.363
But if you have a
lot of money anyway,

00:50:21.363 --> 00:50:23.780
you might as well just not pay
any attention to that stuff

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.700
and if that helps you pay
attention to other things.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:30.100
Notice that even
then, that shows

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.960
the existence of inattention.

00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.460
It's just a bit of
a question, like,

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.900
how important is inattention?

00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.500
And this actually gets
me to the next point,

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.250
which is a question
of, why should we care

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:40.810
about inattention to taxes?

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:44.120
Why is that important or
interesting potentially?

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:46.205
Question exactly is,
who's paying attention?

00:50:46.205 --> 00:50:47.330
Who's not paying attention?

00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.010
And then who's
sort of distorting

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:50.280
their behavior potentially?

00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.600
There's lots of interesting
issues about heterogeneity

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.150
and who's paying attention.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:58.610
Let me talk about
this in a second.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.680
Let me ask differently.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.070
Why is it that some taxes, the
excise taxes, are very salient?

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:06.860
And why is it that other
taxes are not salient?

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.820
What do you think about that?

00:51:08.820 --> 00:51:09.680
Is that an accident?

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.140
Or why is it that the taxes
for alcohol and tobacco,

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:13.910
et cetera, are very salient?

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:16.370
And why is it that other
taxes for shampoo or

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:19.580
whatever are
actually not salient?

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:23.055
There's two simple objectives
if you took a public economics

00:51:23.055 --> 00:51:24.890
class, if you took
John Gruber's class,

00:51:24.890 --> 00:51:28.070
but also if you
took 1401 or 1403.

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:31.910
The reason why the
government levies taxes is--

00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:33.830
one big reason is to
generate revenue, right?

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:34.955
The government needs money.

00:51:34.955 --> 00:51:36.690
Somehow, we need to tax people.

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:39.770
And the issue, of course,
is that if you levy taxes

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:42.470
on some goods
versus others, that

00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:44.600
can distort consumer choices.

00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.960
And there's essentially
some theorems

00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:54.260
and some considerations about
which goods should you tax.

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.480
And ideally, you would
tax goods that people

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.490
are consuming anyway.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:00.410
Essentially, what you
want is people make--

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:02.810
so essentially, when you
have taxes on some goods

00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:05.450
but not on others, if
people have different price

00:52:05.450 --> 00:52:07.490
elasticities on some
goods versus others

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:11.840
and if you increase one good or
all goods by a certain amount,

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:14.660
if people have different
price elasticities,

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.290
then you might distort
their behavior.

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:20.440
So if you increase and you
start taxing one thing and not

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:23.600
another, people might
shift to the other good.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:26.690
And we don't want that because,
presumably, people are already

00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:29.090
optimizing to start with.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.370
Now, if people are
inelastic to certain goods,

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:33.620
if people need
certain goods anyway

00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:34.970
and they buy them anyway--

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:37.220
and the last thing, essentially,
there's public goods.

00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:41.000
Public economics would tell you
or some theories would tell you

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.030
you should tax these goods more.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:47.450
Now, distortion, when people
are-- so the distortions

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:50.810
are lower if people don't
fully react to taxes.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:54.030
That could be if, for example,
you started taxing bread,

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:57.890
for example, while everybody--
or certain goods like potatoes,

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.470
where everybody needs to
buy these goods anyway

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:02.360
because people need to eat--

00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:06.620
well, then, there
would be very low--

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:12.430
these goods would
be very inelastic.

00:53:12.430 --> 00:53:14.180
And that's because
they need those things.

00:53:14.180 --> 00:53:15.740
Not because they're
inattentive, but just

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.365
because they need
these types of goods.

00:53:17.365 --> 00:53:21.830
Now, there's obviously
issues with poverty.

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:24.320
We don't want to tax
the poor too much.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:27.630
But in general, they want to
tax things that are inelastic.

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:30.940
And so in a way, if people
are inattentive to the taxes,

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.690
in a way, that's great
because now they're

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:33.970
not distorting their behavior.

00:53:33.970 --> 00:53:36.360
And we can still
get money from them.

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.400
So in some sense, actually,
some of the inattention

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.380
for that purpose
might be actually good

00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.620
because now people are not
distorting their behavior

00:53:45.620 --> 00:53:49.310
by looking at those prices.

00:53:49.310 --> 00:53:51.620
So being inattentive
in some ways is good.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:54.720
But exactly as Maya was
saying, for some goods--

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.580
and these are often labeled
as sin goods or the like,

00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:01.500
where there's either
externalities or internalities.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.820
For example, if you think
about tobacco or alcohol,

00:54:04.820 --> 00:54:05.870
there are externalities.

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:09.590
Tobacco, for example, secondhand
smoking is bad for others.

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:11.750
For alcohol, there's
often externalities

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.390
in terms of drunk driving
or violence or the like.

00:54:15.390 --> 00:54:18.350
So the government wants to
increase the price of alcohol

00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:22.430
because when people are making
choices of how much alcohol

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:25.190
to buy, they might not take into
account the effects of alcohol

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:26.420
on others.

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:29.570
By internalities, I mean
people might not necessarily

00:54:29.570 --> 00:54:33.620
take into account the
effect of alcohol or tobacco

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:34.858
on themselves.

00:54:34.858 --> 00:54:36.400
This is what we
discussed previously.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.240
This could be because
of present bias.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:41.900
This could be because of
biased beliefs or the like.

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:44.552
Essentially, people might
hurt their future selves.

00:54:44.552 --> 00:54:46.010
And the government
might say, well,

00:54:46.010 --> 00:54:49.070
let's increase taxes
because their future sales--

00:54:49.070 --> 00:54:50.510
people might like
that there might

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.940
be a way of helping
people, for instance,

00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.080
deal with self control problems.

00:54:55.080 --> 00:54:57.980
So here, the
government explicitly

00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.370
wants consumers to
react to the taxes.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:03.188
The point is not to
make money from people.

00:55:03.188 --> 00:55:04.730
And in fact, sometimes
you're worried

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:07.200
about making too much
money from people.

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:10.040
The point here is really
to change behavior

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.790
to reduce the behaviors
that are being taxed.

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.650
So you want to make such
taxes particularly salient.

00:55:16.650 --> 00:55:17.150
Ready?

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:22.070
Now, look at the taxes on
alcohol versus the taxes on--

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.460
some of the excise taxes
versus the sales taxes.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:27.710
The excise taxes are
precisely salient because we

00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:31.828
want people to react to it
while the sales taxes are not.

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:33.620
Of course, there's
variation across places.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:36.320
But it's not an accident that
we see this in the world the way

00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:37.310
that is.

00:55:37.310 --> 00:55:39.980
Now, one thing that's
quite interesting now is--

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:43.070
and I think José or
[INAUDIBLE] was saying that.

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:45.660
It's like when consumers
are heterogeneous,

00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.850
then there's a lot of
quite interesting issues.

00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:50.850
For example, if you have
the poor paying more or less

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:53.700
attention compared to the rich
or if only a subset of people

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.970
pay attention to those
goods, then in a way,

00:55:56.970 --> 00:56:00.090
you would find that the average
elasticity is still quite low.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:02.400
But some people are actually
distorting their behavior

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.860
quite a bit, and others do not.

00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:11.010
And that gets relatively
quickly quite complicated.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.063
And you could then
get into situations

00:56:13.063 --> 00:56:15.480
where you make some people a
lot worse off and some people

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:20.150
better off when making
something salient versus not.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:21.360
Any questions on all of this?

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:29.360
OK.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.058
So then we get to
the next question.

00:56:32.058 --> 00:56:34.100
This is getting a little
bit at the question that

00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:37.340
was asked previously about,
can inattention or attention

00:56:37.340 --> 00:56:39.200
have large effects?

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:44.300
And so on the one hand,
you might say, well,

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.550
people's choices-- for
example, consumption patterns--

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:49.280
are distorted due to
limited attention.

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:53.510
But you might ask, well,
if it's really true

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:56.090
that people's consumption
patterns have really distorted

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:59.330
that much, if I'm so much worse
off by not paying attention

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:01.910
to things, well, eventually,
I'm going to notice this.

00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:03.800
Somebody is going to tell me.

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:09.320
Or in a way, I notice
myself eventually

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:11.810
that I'm doing things really
worse compared to my friends.

00:57:11.810 --> 00:57:16.460
And eventually, if things
are really distorted a lot,

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:19.290
I might pay attention to it.

00:57:19.290 --> 00:57:23.540
So the underlying idea is
that, potentially, people

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.660
are actually inattentive
in the sense of saying,

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.630
look, people's attention
is limited in some ways.

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:35.060
But it's optimal for
people to pay attention

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:36.770
to things that are
really important.

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:38.187
And there, the
underlying question

00:57:38.187 --> 00:57:39.560
is, what is salient to people?

00:57:39.560 --> 00:57:41.887
And how do people
decide what to focus on?

00:57:41.887 --> 00:57:43.970
And won't people pay
attention to important things

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:47.473
anyway if they have to?

00:57:47.473 --> 00:57:48.890
And so then the
question is, well,

00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:50.750
how is it possible
that inattention could

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.780
have large effects anyway?

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.790
And so the next paper is
a good example of that.

00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.820
And here's a very intuitive
example of why that might be.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.570
So consider the
following situation.

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:02.960
You have been getting headaches.

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.550
You go to the doctor.

00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:07.010
And the doctor asks you
whether it gets worse

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:08.900
after eating certain foods.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.860
And so what are
you going to say?

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:15.590
Well, the answer will probably
be like, I don't know.

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.060
And why is that?

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:21.481
Why might you just not even know
the answer to that question?

00:58:21.481 --> 00:58:24.310
An underlying
theory in your mind

00:58:24.310 --> 00:58:26.500
of why you might be
getting headaches.

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.350
And you might just
not have a theory

00:58:29.350 --> 00:58:31.340
that it's related to
your food consumption.

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:33.950
So while you have lots
of data in front of you--

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.160
you eat every day, you
get headaches on some days

00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.900
and not on others-- you could
surely pay attention to it

00:58:37.900 --> 00:58:38.860
if you wanted to.

00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:41.230
But it's not even a
theory in your mind,

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:44.570
so you won't even encode
the relevant information

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:47.270
if you don't expect to have
food allergies or gluten

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.940
allergy or the like
if you don't expect

00:58:48.940 --> 00:58:50.023
that to be a likely cause.

00:58:50.023 --> 00:58:52.107
Then you're never going
to actually pay attention,

00:58:52.107 --> 00:58:54.850
and you get infinite amounts of
data on every day and headaches

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:55.990
and food consumption.

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:58.390
But you're never going
to notice because you

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:02.312
don't have a theory in your mind
that that might be the case.

00:59:02.312 --> 00:59:04.770
And so there's a relationship
between attention and memory.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:07.768
You only remember or pay
attention to stuff that

00:59:07.768 --> 00:59:09.060
actually are theories of yours.

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.602
And then you'll
remember those things

00:59:10.602 --> 00:59:13.160
that you actually paid
attention to in the first place.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:15.355
And so selective
attention, then,

00:59:15.355 --> 00:59:17.230
may have persistent
effects on what we learn.

00:59:17.230 --> 00:59:19.570
Essentially, you could
have unlimited amounts

00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:21.160
of information in front of you.

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.410
And you will never
learn because you never

00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:26.170
just had it on your radar that
this information is actually

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:27.907
relevant for the issue at hand.

00:59:27.907 --> 00:59:29.740
And Josh Schwartzstein
has a very nice model

00:59:29.740 --> 00:59:31.960
that illustrates that.

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:35.980
Another example
is from medicine.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.170
Many women died
from childbed fever

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.360
at hospitals in the
mid-19th century.

00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.490
The popular theories
were bad smells

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:45.540
at the hospital, presence
of male doctors wounded

00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.020
the modesty of the mothers.

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:50.290
That's, of course, nonsense.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:51.880
The true explanation is germs.

00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.830
Doctors didn't wash their hands.

00:59:53.830 --> 00:59:56.110
And again, it's something--
that's not a tricky thing

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:58.000
to figure out if you
have the idea, if you

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.377
have the hypothesis or the idea
that this could be important.

01:00:01.377 --> 01:00:03.835
And presumably, some doctors
are washing their hands anyway

01:00:03.835 --> 01:00:06.760
and sometimes are not, and they
would have a lot fewer deaths.

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:09.040
But nobody was noticing
because, again, just nobody

01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.370
was paying attention.

01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:14.050
So once you have the
right theory in mind,

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:14.930
then you can test it.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.305
And then, of course, you can
gather the right information

01:00:17.305 --> 01:00:20.890
and pay attention to the
right information and learn.

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:25.630
Now, the basic model from
Josh Schwartzstein-- beliefs

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:28.060
today matter for what
is being attended

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:31.270
to today, which then affect
people's beliefs tomorrow.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:35.890
And now if you don't
attend to the right things,

01:00:35.890 --> 01:00:38.470
if your model of the
world is the wrong model,

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.950
you might never learn to
attend to important aspects

01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:43.070
of the world.

01:00:43.070 --> 01:00:44.980
And so then
forecasts and beliefs

01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:48.490
may be biased and persistently
biased in a systematic fashion.

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:51.430
And you might persistently
misreact and misattribute

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:55.170
causes to unimportant variables
because you have never

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:59.927
even considered the idea of
the correct model of the world.

01:00:59.927 --> 01:01:01.510
And so now the paper
I'm going to show

01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:03.500
you is an example of that.

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.750
This is seaweed
farming in Indonesia,

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.050
which is not immediately
obvious why that's related.

01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:09.500
But I'll show you in a second.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:12.496
So this is what seaweed
farming looks like.

01:01:12.496 --> 01:01:14.360
I'll give you this
relatively briefly.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.660
But essentially, it's
like, at some beaches,

01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:19.750
you can grow seaweeds
in these rows.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.830
And you see these
round things here,

01:01:21.830 --> 01:01:23.350
which are essentially pods.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.780
And so there are
many factors that are

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.820
important in seaweed farming.

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.340
Essentially, it's like these
pods, which are essentially

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.900
these round things
that you see here,

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:34.750
they're essentially
grown in different lines.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.580
And so if you're
seaweed farmers,

01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.160
what's really important
is line spacing--

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:42.520
or potentially important is line
spacing, pod spacing, and pod

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:44.560
size, how we got these pods.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:47.230
Now, how does seaweed
farming actually work?

01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:49.030
I've never done
seaweed farming myself,

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:50.930
but apparently this
is how it works.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:53.470
So farmers use what's called
the bottom method, which

01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:57.490
is they drive wooden stakes
in shallow bottom near shore,

01:01:57.490 --> 01:01:59.560
and they attach lines
to these stakes.

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.290
And they take raw seaweed
from the last harvest

01:02:02.290 --> 01:02:05.350
and cut it into pods, like
these kind of roundish things.

01:02:05.350 --> 01:02:07.480
And the pods are planted
by attaching them

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.850
at a given interval on
the line from the sea.

01:02:09.850 --> 01:02:14.650
And at low tides,
farmers tend the plots.

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:19.280
And so the seaweed is then
harvested after 30 to 40 days.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:22.150
And so now many dimensions
could matter-- the pod size,

01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:24.670
the distance between the lines,
the distance between pods,

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:25.990
timing, and so on.

01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:28.600
One nice thing about seaweed
is there's many different pods.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.610
You can actually try
and learn and estimate

01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:33.190
the importance of
these factors over time

01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:35.380
if only you paid attention.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.910
But the question is, which of
these factors are important?

01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:43.210
And are people paying
attention to those factors?

01:02:46.945 --> 01:02:48.570
And so what the
experiment now is doing

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:50.638
is there's lots of farmers
in the experiment that

01:02:50.638 --> 01:02:51.555
are quite experienced.

01:02:51.555 --> 01:02:55.320
They have been doing this for a
long time, 18 years of farming.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.930
Many of them or the vast
majority are literate.

01:02:57.930 --> 01:02:59.820
So these are people
who should really

01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:03.910
know what they're doing in their
seaweed farming experience.

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.840
And so the enumerators
went to visit these farmers

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.480
and to measure and document
their farming methods.

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.960
And when you asked them
about current pod size,

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.950
you just ask them how
big are your pods,

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:16.932
people just don't
know the answer to.

01:03:16.932 --> 01:03:18.390
They also don't
know the answer to,

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.557
what's the optimum pod size?

01:03:19.557 --> 01:03:21.765
When you just ask them how
big are your pods when you

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:23.070
plant them, they don't know.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:25.028
When you ask them what's
the best way to do it,

01:03:25.028 --> 01:03:25.890
they don't know.

01:03:25.890 --> 01:03:29.012
Importantly, they know exactly
the answer to other questions.

01:03:29.012 --> 01:03:30.720
They know the length
of the typical line.

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.428
They know the distance
between the lines.

01:03:32.428 --> 01:03:34.110
And they also have
very clear ideas

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:36.210
of what's optimal to do so.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:39.300
But they seem to essentially
neglect the pod size dimension

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.770
entirely when they're
thinking about what to do.

01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:45.940
And so in the
experimental trial now,

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:47.920
they did essentially
different treatments.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.600
And the treatments
were essentially such

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:53.350
that farmers were provided
experimental variation

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:58.030
in the different pod sizes
and essentially induced

01:03:58.030 --> 01:04:00.970
to experiment with pod sizes.

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.645
And in some cases, farmers
were just left on their own.

01:04:04.645 --> 01:04:06.520
They were just induced
to do this experiment.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.250
And the question was
like, now will farmers

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:11.540
learn from their own
in this experiment?

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:14.440
And then in addition, they also
have an information condition

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:17.620
where they then summarized
that information to the farmers

01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:18.910
in addition.

01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:23.530
So the question is
now, once farmers

01:04:23.530 --> 01:04:25.300
are induced to
experiment, you surely

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.040
would think that
farmers would learn now

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.415
that they're given all the
information that they need on,

01:04:29.415 --> 01:04:31.080
like, here's the
different pod sizes.

01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:32.622
Here's the different
profits that you

01:04:32.622 --> 01:04:36.490
get from the different
types of pods.

01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:39.140
Now they might
learn on their own.

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.770
But if you don't attend to
pod size in the first place,

01:04:41.770 --> 01:04:44.020
if you think it's
irrelevant anyway,

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:46.390
even if you are induced
to do the experiment,

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:49.430
you're not going
to learn at all.

01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:52.600
And so then they did essentially
these follow-up surveys.

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:54.190
And then we'll just skip.

01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:56.830
So now what they do is they
also go through an information

01:04:56.830 --> 01:05:01.358
provision where they essentially
tell farmers the [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:01.358 --> 01:05:02.650
they were doing with everybody.

01:05:02.650 --> 01:05:04.870
But in addition, they
also provided information

01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:07.690
and did some simple
calculations on which

01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:12.300
is the best combination
of pod size and distance.

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:13.675
Notice that farmers
are literate.

01:05:13.675 --> 01:05:15.410
They're able to do
this on their own.

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.100
But the experiment was just
providing this information

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.590
to farmers explicitly
with a recommendation

01:05:20.590 --> 01:05:24.940
about what's the pod weight and
what is the optimal distance.

01:05:24.940 --> 01:05:26.440
And so now what the
experiment finds

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:32.140
is large gains from changing
the farming methodology.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.630
And the trial
participation itself only

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.370
has an insignificant effect.

01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:38.140
That's to say, in
addition, then,

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.470
summarized data for people
has much larger effect.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:45.520
Essentially, focusing
people's attention to things

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:49.480
that they should already know
changes their farming behavior

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:50.530
a lot.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.670
And it's essentially
evidence that people were not

01:05:54.670 --> 01:05:56.570
paying attention
in the first place

01:05:56.570 --> 01:05:58.597
even if you make them
participate in a trial

01:05:58.597 --> 01:06:00.430
where they should have
really or could have,

01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:04.940
at least, learned
things on their own.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:06.820
There's large
impacts of the trial

01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.520
if the data from the trials
is presented to farmers.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.740
There's no impact of
the trial on dimensions

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:13.720
that farmers had already
noticed previously,

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:16.570
presumably because they're
already paying attention

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.642
and were optimizing.

01:06:18.642 --> 01:06:20.100
So now what did we
learn from this?

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:23.200
And let me quickly
summarize and let you go.

01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.110
So we have systematic
learning failures

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:27.480
even though all the
information was available.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.430
So farmers simply
did not pay attention

01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:31.380
because they didn't
think that pod size was

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.650
relevant in any
way in their lives.

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:36.300
And that's a
potential explanation

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.830
why people might
not pay attention

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:40.560
even to important information
because if your model

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.170
of the world is just
wrong, why would

01:06:43.170 --> 01:06:45.300
you even think that
this is important?

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.880
And the problem here is then
there's never an opportunity

01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.690
to actually learn.

01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:50.160
You never even
collect information

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:51.952
that might reject your
model because you're

01:06:51.952 --> 01:06:55.240
convinced that your model
is right in the first place.

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.290
And so then lack of attention
might generate arbitrarily

01:06:58.290 --> 01:06:59.430
large welfare losses.

01:06:59.430 --> 01:07:02.490
You can really screw up
big time for a long time

01:07:02.490 --> 01:07:06.503
and never really change your
behavior because, essentially,

01:07:06.503 --> 01:07:07.170
you never learn.

01:07:07.170 --> 01:07:09.180
You never even pay
attention to any information

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:13.400
that you might have available
that says your model is wrong.
